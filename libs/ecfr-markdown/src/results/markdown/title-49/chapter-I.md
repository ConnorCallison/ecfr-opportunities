        (c)  The inspector shall determine that each cylinder made is in conformance with the applicable specification. Inspections shall conform to CGA C-11 (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter) except as otherwise specified in the applicable specification.

        (1)  Seamless cylinders shall be inspected in accordance with Section 5 of CGA C-11. For cylinders made by the billet-piercing process, billets must be inspected and shown to be free from piping (laminations), cracks, excessive segregation and other injurious defects after parting or, when applicable, after nick and cold break.

        (2)  Welded cylinders shall be inspected in accordance with Section 6 of CGA C-11. Note: The recommended locations for test specimens are depicted in Figures 1 through 5 in appendix A to subpart C of part 178.

        (3)  Non-refillable cylinders shall be inspected in accordance with Section 7 of CGA C-11

        (4)  The inspector shall prepare a report containing, at a minimum, the applicable information listed in CGA C-11. Any additional information or markings that are required by the applicable specification must be shown on the test report. The signature of the inspector on the reports certifies that the processes of manufacture and heat treatment of cylinders were observed and found satisfactory. The inspector must furnish the completed test reports required by this subpart to the maker of the cylinder and, upon request, to the purchaser. The test report must be retained by the inspector for 15 years from the original test date of the cylinder.

        (d)  Cylinders must conform to the following:

        (1) A cylinder may not be constructed of material with seams, cracks or laminations, or other injurious defects.

        (2) Metal attachments to cylinders must have rounded or chamfered corners or must be protected in such a manner as to prevent the likelihood of causing puncture or damage to other hazardous materials packages. This requirement applies to anything temporarily or permanently attached to the cylinder, such as metal skids.

        (e)  Pressure relief devices and protection for valves, safety devices, and other connections, if applied, must be as required or authorized by the appropriate specification, and as required in § 173.301 of this subchapter.

        (f)  Markings on a DOT Specification cylinder must conform to applicable requirements.

        (1) Each cylinder must be marked with the following information:

        (i) The DOT specification marking must appear first, followed immediately by the service pressure. For example, DOT-3A1800.

        (ii) The serial number must be placed just below or immediately following the DOT specification marking.

        (iii) A symbol (letters) must be placed just below, immediately before or following the serial number. Other variations in sequence of markings are authorized only when necessitated by a lack of space. The symbol and numbers must be those of the manufacturer.

        (d)  Cylinders must be manufactured using equipment and processes adequate to ensure that each cylinder produced conforms to the requirements of this subpart. No fissure or other defect is permitted that is likely to weaken the finished cylinder appreciably. A reasonably smooth and uniform surface finish is required. If not originally free from such defects, the surface may be machined or otherwise treated to eliminate these defects. The thickness of the bottoms of cylinders welded or formed by spinning is, under no condition, to be less than two times the minimum wall thickness of the cylindrical shell; such bottom thicknesses must be measured within an area bounded by a line representing the points of contact between the cylinder and floor when the cylinder is in a vertical position.

        (e)  Welding or brazing for any purpose whatsoever is prohibited except as follows:

        (1) Welding or brazing is authorized for the attachment of neckrings and footrings which are non-pressure parts and only to the tops and bottoms of cylinders having a service pressure of 500 psig or less. Cylinders, neckrings, and footrings must be made of weldable steel, the carbon content of which may not exceed 0.25 percent except in the case of 4130X steel which may be used with proper welding procedures.

The testing equipment must be calibrated as prescribed in CGA C-1. All testing equipment and pressure indicating devices must be accurate within the parameters defined in CGA C-1.

        (2) Each cylinder must be tested to a minimum of   times service pressure.

        (3) The minimum test pressure must be maintained for at least 30 seconds and sufficiently longer to ensure complete expansion. Any internal pressure applied after heat-treatment and previous to the official test may not exceed 90 percent of the test pressure. If, due to failure of the test apparatus or operator error, the test pressure cannot be maintained, the test may be repeated in accordance with CGA C-1, section 5.7.2.

        (4) Permanent, volumetric expansion may not exceed 10 percent of the total volumetric expansion at test pressure.

        (j)  A flattening test must be performed on one cylinder taken at random out of each lot of 200 or less, by placing the cylinder between wedge shaped knife edges having a 60° included angle, rounded to  -inch radius. The longitudinal axis of the cylinder must be at a 90-degree angle to knife edges during the test. For lots of 30 or less, flattening tests are authorized to be made on a ring at least 8 inches long cut from each cylinder and subjected to same heat treatment as the finished cylinder.

        (iii) When size of cylinder does not permit securing straight specimens, the specimens may be taken in any location or direction and may be straightened or flattened cold, by pressure only, not by blows. When specimens are so taken and prepared, the inspector's report must show in connection with record of physical tests detailed information in regard to such specimens.

        (iv) Heating of a specimen for any purpose is not authorized.

        (3) The yield strength in tension must be the stress corresponding to a permanent strain of 0.2 percent of the gauge length. The following conditions apply:

        (ii) In using the “extension under load” method, the total strain (or “extension under load”) corresponding to the stress at which the 0.2-percent permanent strain occurs may be determined with sufficient accuracy by calculating the elastic extension of the gauge length under appropriate load and adding thereto 0.2 percent of the gauge length. Elastic extension calculations must be based on an elastic modulus of 30,000,000. In the event of controversy the entire stress-strain diagram must be plotted and the yield strength determined from the 0.2 percent offset.

        (iii) For the purpose of strain measurement, the initial strain must be set while the specimen is under a stress of 12,000 psig and the strain indicator reading must be set at the calculated corresponding strain.

        (1) An elongation at least 40 percent for a 2-inch gauge length or at least 20 percent in other cases and yield strength not over 73 percent of tensile strength. In this instance, the flattening test is not required.

        (2) An elongation at least 20 percent for a 2-inch gauge length or 10 percent in other cases and a yield strength not over 73 percent of tensile strength. In this instance, the flattening test is required, without cracking, to 6 times the wall thickness.

        (m)  All spun cylinders and plugged cylinders must be tested for leakage by gas or air pressure after the bottom has been cleaned and is free from all moisture subject to the following conditions and limitations:

        (1) Pressure, approximately the same as but no less than service pressure, must be applied to one side of the finished bottom over an area of at least   of the total area of the bottom but not less than   inch in diameter, including the closure, for at least 1 minute, during which time the other side of the bottom exposed to pressure must be covered with water and closely examined for indications of leakage. Except as provided in paragraph (n) of this section, a cylinder that is leaking must be rejected.

        (2) A spun cylinder is one in which an end closure in the finished cylinder has been welded by the spinning process.

        (3) A plugged cylinder is one in which a permanent closure in the bottom of a finished cylinder has been effected by a plug.

        (4) As a safety precaution, if the manufacturer elects to make this test before the hydrostatic test, the manufacturer should design the test apparatus so that the pressure is applied to the smallest area practicable, around the point of closure, and so as to use the smallest possible volume of air or gas.

        (n)  Reheat treatment is authorized for rejected cylinders. Subsequent thereto, cylinders must pass all prescribed tests to be acceptable. Repair by welding or spinning is not authorized. Spun cylinders rejected under the provisions of paragraph (m) of this section may be removed from the spun cylinder category by drilling to remove defective material, tapping and plugging.

Elastic extension calculations must be based on an elastic modulus of 30,000,000. In the event of controversy, the entire stress-strain diagram must be plotted and the yield strength determined from the 0.2 percent offset.

Elastic extension calculations must be based on an elastic modulus of 30,000,000. In the event of controversy, the entire stress-strain diagram must be plotted and the yield strength determined from the 0.2 percent offset.

        (iii) For the purpose of strain measurement, the initial strain must be set while the specimen is under a stress of 12,000 psi, the strain indicator reading being set at the calculated corresponding strain.

        (iv) Cross-head speed of the testing machine may not exceed   inch per minute during yield strength determination.

        (n)  Inspection must be performed on the inside of each container before closing and externally on each finished container after heat treatment. Evidence of discontinuities, which in the opinion of a qualified inspector may appreciably weaken or decrease the durability of the cylinder, must be cause for rejection.

        (o)  All spun cylinders and plugged cylinders must be tested for leakage by dry gas or dry air pressure after the bottom has been cleaned and is free from all moisture, subject to the following conditions and limitations:

        (1) Pressure, approximately the same as but not less than service pressure, must be applied to one side of the finished bottom over an area of at least   of the total area of the bottom but not less than   inch in diameter, including the closure, for at least one minute, during which time the other side of the bottom exposed to pressure must be covered with water and closely examined for indications of leakage. Except as provided in paragraph (q) of this section, a cylinder must be rejected if there is leakage.

        (2) A spun cylinder is one in which an end closure in the finished cylinder has been welded by the spinning process.

        (3) A plugged cylinder is one in which a permanent closure in the bottom of a finished cylinder has been effected by a plug.

        (4) As a safety precaution, if the manufacturer elects to make this test before the hydrostatic test, the manufacturer should design the test apparatus so that the pressure is applied to the smallest area practicable, around the point of closure, and so as to use the smallest possible volume of air or gas.

        (p)  Results of the flattening test, physical tests, burst test, and cycling test must conform to the following:

        (1) Flattening required without cracking to ten times the wall thickness of the cylinder.

        (2) Physical tests:

        (i) An elongation of at least 6 percent for a gauge length of 24 times the wall thickness.

        (ii) The tensile strength may not exceed 165,000 p.s.i.

        (3) The burst pressure must be at least   times the test pressure.

        (4) Cycling-at least 10,000 pressurizations.

        (q)  Reheat treatment is authorized for rejected cylinders. Subsequent thereto, cylinders must pass all prescribed tests to be acceptable. Repair by welding or spinning is not authorized. For each cylinder subjected to reheat treatment during original manufacture, sidewall measurements must be made to verify that the minimum sidewall thickness meets specification requirements after the final heat treatment.

        (r)  (1) Cylinders must be marked by low stress type steel stamping in an area and to a depth which will insure that the wall thickness measured from the root of the stamping to the interior surface is equal to or greater than the minimum prescribed wall thickness. Stamping must be permanent and legible. Stamping on side wall not authorized.

        (2) The rejection elastic expansion (REE), in cubic cm (cc), must be marked on the cylinder near the date of test. The REE for a cylinder is 1.05 times its original elastic expansion.

        (3) Name plates are authorized, provided that they can be permanently and securely attached to the cylinder. Attachment by either brazing or welding is not permitted. Attachment by soldering is permitted provided steel temperature does not exceed 500 °F.

        (s)  In addition to the requirements of § 178.35, the inspector's report must indicate the rejection elastic expansion (REE), in cubic cm (cc).

        § 178.45   Specification 3T seamless steel cylinder.

#### § § 178.45

        (a)  A DOT 3T cylinder is a seamless steel cylinder with a minimum water capacity of 1,000 pounds and a minimum service pressure of 1,800 psig. Each cylinder must have integrally formed heads concave to pressure at both ends. The inside head shape must be hemispherical, ellipsoidal in which the major axis is two times the minor axis, or a dished shape falling within these two limits. Permanent closures formed by spinning are prohibited.

        (b)  Only open hearth, basic oxygen, or electric furnace process steel of uniform quality is authorized. The steel analysis must conform to the following:

        (1) A heat of steel made under the specifications in the table in this paragraph (b), the ladle analysis of which is slightly out of the specified range, is acceptable if satisfactory in all other aspects. However, the check analysis tolerances shown in the table in this paragraph (b) may not be exceeded except as approved by the Department.

        (2) Material with seams, cracks, laminations, or other injurious defects is not permitted.

        (3) Material used must be identified by any suitable method.

        (c)  General manufacturing requirements are as follows:

        (1) Surface finish must be uniform and reasonably smooth.

        (2) Inside surfaces must be clean, dry, and free of loose particles.

        (3) No defect of any kind is permitted if it is likely to weaken a finished cylinder.

        (4) If the cylinder surface is not originally free from the defects, the surface may be machined or otherwise treated to eliminate these defects provided the minimum wall thickness is maintained.

        (5) Welding or brazing on a cylinder is not permitted.

        (d)  The minimum wall thickness must be such that the wall stress at the minimum specified test pressure does not exceed 67 percent of the minimum tensile strength of the steel as determined by the physical tests required in paragraphs (j) and (k) of this section. A wall stress of more than 90,500 p.s.i. is not permitted. The minimum wall thickness for any cylinder may not be less than 0.225 inch.

        (1) Calculation of the stress for cylinders must be made by the following formula:

        (2) Each cylinder must meet the following additional requirement which assumes a cylinder horizontally supported at its two ends and uniformly loaded over its entire length. This load consists of the weight per inch of length of the straight cylindrical portion filled with water compressed to the specified test pressure. The wall thickness must be increased when necessary to meet this additional requirement:

        (i) The sum of two times the maximum tensile stress in the bottom fibers due to bending (see paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section), plus the maximum tensile stress in the same fibers due to hydrostatic testing (see paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this section) may not exceed 80 percent of the minimum yield strength of the steel at this maximum stress.

        (ii) The following formula must be used to calculate the maximum tensile stress due to bending:

        (iii) The following formula must be used to calculate the maximum longitudinal tensile stress due to hydrostatic test pressure:

        (e)  Each completed cylinder must be uniformly and properly heat treated prior to testing, as follows:

        (1) Each cylinder must be heated and held at the proper temperature for at least one hour per inch of thickness based on the maximum thickness of the cylinder and then quenched in a suitable liquid medium having a cooling rate not in excess of 80 percent of water. The steel temperature on quenching must be that recommended for the steel analysis, but it must never exceed 1750 °F.

        (2) After quenching, each cylinder must be reheated to a temperature below the transformation range but not less than 1050 °F., and must be held at this temperature for at least one hour per inch of thickness based on the maximum thickness of the cylinder. Each cylinder must then be cooled under conditions recommended for the steel.

        (f)  Openings in cylinders must comply with the following:

        (1) Openings are permitted on heads only.

        (2) The size of any centered opening in a head may not exceed one half the outside diameter of the cylinder.

        (3) Openings in a head must have ligaments between openings of at least three times the average of their hole diameter. No off-center opening may exceed 2.625 inches in diameter.

        (4) All openings must be circular.

        (5) All openings must be threaded. Threads must be in compliance with the following:

        (i) Each thread must be clean cut, even, without any checks, and to gauge.

        (ii) Taper threads, when used, must be the American Standard Pipe thread (NPT) type and must be in compliance with the requirements of NBS Handbook H-28 (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter).

        (iii) Taper threads conforming to National Gas Taper thread (NGT) standards must be in compliance with the requirements of NBS Handbook H-28.

        (iv) Straight threads conforming with National Gas Straight thread (NGS) standards are authorized. These threads must be in compliance with the requirements of NBS Handbook H-28.

        (g)  Each cylinder must successfully withstand a pressure test as follows:

        (1) The test must be by water-jacket or direct expansion method as prescribed in CGA C-1 (IBR; see § 171.7 of this subchapter). The testing equipment must be calibrated as prescribed in CGA C-1. All testing equipment and pressure indicating devices must be accurate within the parameters defined in CGA C-1.

        (2) Each cylinder must be tested to minimum of   times service pressure.

        (3) The minimum test pressure must be maintained at least 30 seconds and sufficiently longer to ensure complete expansion. Any internal pressure applied after heat-treatment and prior to the official test may not exceed 90 percent of the test pressure. If, due to failure of the test apparatus or operator error, the test pressure cannot be maintained, the test may be repeated in accordance with CGA C-1, section 5.7.2.

        (4) Permanent volumetric expansion may not exceed 10 percent of total volumetric expansion at test pressure.

        (h)  After the hydrostatic test, the cylindrical section of each vessel must be examined in accordance with ASTM E 213 for shear wave and E 114 for straight beam (IBR, Standard  § 171.7 of this subchapter). The equipment used must be calibrated to detect a notch equal to five percent of the design minimum wall thickness. Any discontinuity indication greater than that produced by the five percent notch must be cause for rejection of the cylinder, unless the discontinuity is repaired within the requirements of this specification.

        (i)  Cylinders must be subjected to a tension and Charpy impact as follows:

        (1) When the cylinders are heat treated in a batch furnace, two tension specimens and three Charpy impact specimens must be tested from one of the cylinders or a test ring from each batch. The lot size represented by these tests may not exceed 200 cylinders.

        (2) When the cylinders are heat treated in a continuous furnace, two tension specimens and three Charpy impact specimens must be tested from one of the cylinders or a test ring from each four hours or less of production. However, in no case may a test lot based on this production period exceed 200 cylinders.

        (3) Each specimen for the tension and Charpy impact tests must be taken from the side wall of a cylinder or from a ring which has been heat treated with the finished cylinders of which the specimens must be representative. The axis of the specimens must be parallel to the axis of the cylinder. Each cylinder or ring specimen for test must be of the same diameter, thickness, and metal as the finished cylinders they represent. A test ring must be at least 24 inches long with ends covered during the heat treatment process so as to simulate the heat treatment process of the finished cylinders it represents.

        (4) A test cylinder or test ring need represent only one of the heats in a furnace batch provided the other heats in the batch have previously been tested and have passed the tests and that such tests do not represent more than 200 cylinders from any one heat.

        (5) The test results must conform to the requirements specified in paragraphs (j) and (k) of this section.

        (6) When the test results do not conform to the requirements specified, the cylinders represented by the tests may be reheat treated and the tests repeated. Paragraph (i)(5) of this section applies to any retesting.

        (j)  The following criteria must be followed to obtain acceptable physical test results:

        (1) Each tension specimen must have a gauge length of two inches with a width not exceeding one and one-half inches. Except for the grip ends, the specimen may not be flattened. The grip ends may be flattened to within one inch of each end of the reduced section.

        (2) A specimen may not be heated after heat treatment specified in paragraph (d) of this section.

        (3) The yield strength in tension must be the stress corresponding to a permanent strain of 0.2 percent of the gage length.

        (i) This yield strength must be determined by the “offset” method or the “extension under load” method described in ASTM E 8 (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter).

        (ii) For the “extension under load” method, the total strain (or extension under load) corresponding to the stress at which the 0.2 percent permanent strain occurs may be determined with sufficient accuracy by calculating the elastic extension of the gage length under appropriate load and adding thereto 0.2 percent of the gage length. Elastic extension calculations must be based on an elastic modulus of 30,000,000. However, when the degree of accuracy of this method is questionable the entire stress-strain diagram must be plotted and the yield strength determined from the 0.2 percent offset.

        (iii) For the purpose of strain measurement, the initial strain must be set with the specimen under a stress of 12,000 p.s.i. and the strain indicator reading set at the calculated corresponding strain.

        (iv) The cross-head speed of the testing machine may not exceed   inch per minute during the determination of yield strength.

        (4) Each impact specimen must be Charpy V-notch type size 10 mm × 10 mm taken in accordance with paragraph 11 of ASTM A 333 (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter). When a reduced size specimen is used, it must be the largest size obtainable.

        (k)  Results of physical tests must conform to the following:

        (1) The tensile strength may not exceed 155,000 p.s.i.

        (2) The elongation must be at least 16 percent for a two-inch gage length.

        (3) The Charpy V-notch impact properties for the three impact specimens which must be tested at 0 °F may not be less than the values shown as follows:

        (4) After the final heat treatment, each vessel must be hardness tested on the cylindrical section. The tensile strength equivalent of the hardness number obtained may not be more than 165,000 p.s.i. (Rc 36). When the result of a hardness test exceeds the maximum permitted, two or more retests may be made; however, the hardness number obtained in each retest may not exceed the maximum permitted.

        (l)  Reheat treatment is authorized for rejected cylinders. However, each reheat treated cylinder must subsequently pass all the prescribed tests. Repair by welding is not authorized.

        (m)  Marking must be done by stamping into the metal of the cylinder. All markings must be legible and located on a shoulder.

        (n)  In addition to the requirements of § 178.35, the inspector's report for the physical test report, must indicate the average value for three specimens and the minimum value for one specimen for each lot number.

        (3) The minimum test pressure must be maintained at least 30 seconds and sufficiently longer to ensure complete expansion. Any internal pressure applied after heat treatment and prior to the official test may not exceed 90 percent of the test pressure. If, due to failure of the test apparatus or operator error, the test pressure cannot be maintained, the test may be repeated in accordance with CGA C-1, section 5.7.2, however, if a second failure to maintain the test pressure occurs the cylinder being tested must be rejected.

        (4) Permanent volumetric expansion may not exceed 10 percent of total volumetric expansion at test pressure.

        (h)  One cylinder taken at random out of each lot must be subjected to a flattening test as follows:

        (1) The test must be between knife edges, wedge shaped, having a 60° included angle, and rounded in accordance with the following table. The longitudinal axis of the cylinder must be at an angle 90° to the knife edges during the test. The flattening test table is as follows:

        (2) An alternate bend test in accordance with ASTM E 290 using a mandrel diameter not more than 6 times the wall thickness is authorized to qualify lots that fail the flattening test of this section without reheat treatment. If used, this test must be performed on two samples from one cylinder taken at random out of each lot of 200 cylinders or less.

        (3) Each test cylinder must withstand flattening to nine times the wall thickness without cracking. When the alternate bend test is used, the test specimens must remain uncracked when bent inward around a mandrel in the direction of curvature of the cylinder wall until the interior edges are at a distance apart not greater than the diameter of the mandrel.

        (i)  Two test specimens cut from one cylinder representing each lot of 200 cylinders or less must be subjected to the mechanical properties test, as follows:

        (1) The results of the test must conform to at least the minimum acceptable mechanical property limits for aluminum alloys as specified in paragraph (b) of this section.

        (2) Specimens must be 4D bar or gauge length 2 inches with width not over 1  inch taken in the direction of extrusion approximately 180° from each other; provided that gauge length at least 24 times thickness with width not over 6 times thickness is authorized, when cylinder wall is not over   inch thick. The specimen, exclusive of grip ends, may not be flattened. Grip ends may be flattened to within one inch of each end of the reduced section. When the size of the cylinder does not permit securing straight specimens, the specimens may be taken in any location or direction and may be straightened or flattened cold by pressure only, not by blows. When such specimens are used, the inspector's report must show that the specimens were so taken and prepared. Heating of specimens for any purpose is forbidden.

        (3) The yield strength in tension must be the stress corresponding to a permanent strain of 0.2 percent of the gauge length.

        (i) The yield strength must be determined by either the “offset” method or the “extension under load” method as prescribed in ASTM B 557 (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter).

        (ii) In using the “extension under load” method, the total strain (or “extension under load”) corresponding to the stress at which the 0.2 percent permanent strain occurs may be determined with sufficient accuracy by calculating the elastic extension of the gauge length under appropriate load and adding thereto 0.2 percent of the gauge length. Elastic extension calculations must be based on an elastic modulus of 10,000,000 psi. In the event of controversy, the entire stress-strain diagram must be plotted and the yield strength determined from the 0.2 percent offset.

        (iii) For the purpose of strain measurement, the initial strain must be set while the specimen is under a stress of 6,000 psi, the strain indicator reading being set at the calculated corresponding strain.

        (iv) Cross-head speed of the testing machine may not exceed   inch per minute during yield strength determination.

        (j)  Reheat treatment of rejected cylinders is authorized one time. Subsequent thereto, cylinders must pass all prescribed tests to be acceptable.

        (k)  In addition to the requirements of § 178.35, the inspector shall:

        (1) Verify compliance with the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section by:

        (i) Performing or witnessing the performance of the chemical analyses on each melt or cast lot or other unit of starting material; or

        (ii) Obtaining a certified chemical analysis from the material or cylinder manufacturer for each melt, or cast of material; or

        (iii) Obtaining a certified check analysis on one cylinder out of each lot of 200 cylinders or less, if a certificate containing data to indicate compliance with the material specification is obtained.

        (2) The inspector must verify ultrasonic inspection of all material by inspection or by obtaining the material producer's certificate of ultrasonic inspection. Ultrasonic inspection must be performed or verified as having been performed in accordance with paragraph (b)(5) of this section.

        (3) The inspector must also determine that each cylinder complies with this specification by:

        (i) Selecting the samples for check analyses performed by other than the material producer;

For lots of 30 or fewer, mechanical tests are authorized to be made on a ring at least 8 inches long removed from each cylinder and subjected to the same heat treatment as the finished cylinder.

        (2) Specimens must comply with the following:

        (i) When a cylinder wall is   inch thick or less, one the following gauge lengths is authorized: A gauge length of 8 inches with a width not over 1  inches, a gauge length of 2 inches with a width not over 1  inches, or a gauge length at least twenty-four (24) times the thickness with a width not over six (6) times the thickness.

        (ii) The specimen, exclusive of grip ends, may not be flattened. Grip ends may be flattened to within one inch of each end of the reduced section.

        (iii) When the size of a cylinder does not permit securing straight specimens, the specimens may be taken in any location or direction and may be straightened or flattened cold, by pressure only, not by blows. When specimens are taken and prepared using this method, the inspector's report must show detailed information regarding such specimens in connection with the record of mechanical tests.

        (iv) Heating of a specimen for any purpose is not authorized.

        (3) The yield strength in tension must be the stress corresponding to a permanent strain of 0.2 percent of the gauge length. The following conditions apply:

        (i) The yield strength must be determined by either the “offset” method or the “extension under load” method as prescribed in ASTM E 8 (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter).

        (ii) In using the “extension under load” method, the total strain (or “extension under load”) corresponding to the stress at which the 0.2 percent permanent strain occurs may be determined with sufficient accuracy by calculating the elastic extension of the gauge length under appropriate load and adding thereto 0.2 percent of the gauge length. Elastic extension calculations must be based on an elastic modulus of 30,000,000. In the event of controversy, the entire stress-strain diagram must be plotted and the yield strength determined from the 0.2 percent offset.

        (iii) For strain measurement, the initial strain reference must be set while the specimen is under a stress of 12,000 psig, and strain indicator reading must be set at the calculated corresponding strain.

        (iv) Cross-head speed of the testing machine may not exceed   inch per minute during yield strength determination.

        (v) The yield strength must not exceed 73 percent of the tensile strength.

        (k)  Mechanical test specimens must show at least a 40 percent elongation for a 2-inch gauge length or at least 20 percent in other cases. However, elongation percentages may be reduced numerically by 2 percent for 2-inch specimens, and by 1 percent in other cases, for each 7,500 psig increase of tensile strength above 50,000 psig. The tensile strength may be incrementally increased by four increments of 7,500 psig for a maximum total of 30,000 psig.

        (l) —(1)  After pressure testing, a flattening test must be performed on one cylinder taken at random out of each lot of 200 or fewer by placing the cylinder between wedge-shaped knife edges having a 60 degree included angle, rounded to a half-inch radius. The longitudinal axis of the cylinder must be at a 90-degree angle to knife edges during the test. For lots of 30 or fewer, flattening tests are authorized to be performed on a ring of at least 8 inches long removed from each cylinder and subjected to the same heat treatment as the finished cylinder.

        (2)  When cylinders are constructed of lap welded pipe, an additional flattening test is required, without evidence of cracking, up to six (6) times the wall thickness. In such case, the rings (crop ends) removed from each end of the pipe, must be tested with the weld 45 °F or less from the point of greatest stress.

        (m)  There must be no evidence of cracking of the sample when it is flattened between flat plates to no more than six (6) times the wall thickness. If this test fails, one additional sample from the same lot may be taken. If this second sample fails, the entire lot must be rejected.

        (n)  Reheat treatment is authorized for a rejected cylinder in accordance with this paragraph (n). After reheat treatment, a cylinder must pass all prescribed tests in this section to be considered acceptable. Repair of brazed seams by brazing and welded seams by welding is authorized. For cylinders with an outside diameter of less than or equal to six (6) inches, welded seam repairs greater than one (1) inch in length shall require reheat treatment of the cylinder. For cylinders greater than an outside diameter of 6 inches, welded seam repairs greater than three (3) inches in length shall require reheat treatment.

        (o)  (1) Markings must be as required as in § 178.35 and in addition must be stamped plainly and permanently in any of the following locations on the cylinder:

        (i) On shoulders and top heads whose wall thickness is not less than 0.087-inch thick;

        (ii) On side wall adjacent to top head for side walls which are not less than 0.090 inch thick;

        (iv) On a metal plate attached to the top of the cylinder or permanent part thereof; sufficient space must be left on the plate to provide for stamping at least six retest dates; the plate must be at least  -inch thick and must be attached by welding, or by brazing. The brazing rod must melt at a temperature of 1100 °F. Welding or brazing must be along all the edges of the plate;

        (v) On the neck, neckring, valve boss, valve protection sleeve, or similar part permanently attached to the top of the cylinder; or

Determination of expansion properties is not required.

        (j)  (1) A mechanical test must be conducted to determine yield strength, tensile strength, elongation as a percentage, and reduction of area of material as a percentage, as follows:

        (i)  Testing is required on two (2) specimens removed from one cylinder or part thereof taken at random out of each lot of 200 or fewer. Samples must be removed after heat treatment as illustrated in appendix A to this subpart.

        (ii)  Testing is required on two (2) specimens removed from the sphere or flat representative sample plates of the same heat of material taken at random from the steel used to produce the spheres. Samples (including plates) must be taken from each lot of 200 or fewer. The flat steel from which two specimens are to be removed must receive the same heat treatment as the spheres themselves. Samples must be removed after heat treatment as illustrated in appendix A to this subpart.

        (2) Specimens must comply with the following:

        (i) When a cylinder wall is   inch thick or less, one the following gauge lengths is authorized: A gauge length of 8 inches with a width not over 1  inches, a gauge length of 2 inches with a width not over 1  inches, or a gauge length at least twenty-four (24) times the thickness with a width not over six (6) times the thickness.

        (ii) The specimen, exclusive of grip ends, may not be flattened. Grip ends may be flattened to within one inch of each end of the reduced section.

        (iii) When size of the cylinder does not permit securing straight specimens, the specimens may be taken in any location or direction and may be straightened or flattened cold, by pressure only, not by blows. When specimens are so taken and prepared, the inspector's report must show with the record of physical tests detailed information in regard to such specimens.

        (iv) Heating of a specimen for any purpose is not authorized.

        (3) The yield strength in tension must be the stress corresponding to a permanent strain of 0.2 percent of the gauge length. The following conditions apply:

        (i) The yield strength must be determined by either the “offset” method or the “extension under load” method as prescribed in ASTM E 8 (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter).

        (ii) In using the “extension under load” method, the total strain (or “extension under load”), corresponding to the stress at which the 0.2 percent permanent strain occurs may be determined with sufficient accuracy by calculating the elastic extension of the gauge length under appropriate load and adding thereto 0.2 percent of the gauge length. Elastic extension calculations must be based on an elastic modulus of 30,000,000. In the event of controversy, the entire stress-strain diagram must be plotted and the yield strength determined from the 0.2 percent offset.

        (iii) For strain measurement, the initial strain reference must be set while the specimen is under a stress of 12,000 psig, and the strain indicator reading must be set at the calculated corresponding strain.

        (k)  Mechanical test specimens must show at least a 40 percent elongation for a 2-inch gauge length or at least 20 percent in other cases. However, elongation percentages may be reduced numerically by 2 percent for 2-inch specimens, and by 1 percent in other cases, for each 7,500 psig increase of tensile strength above 50,000 psig. The tensile strength may be incrementally increased by four increments of 7,500 psig for a maximum total of 30,000 psig.

        (l)  Except for brazed seams, welds must be tested as follows:

        (1)  A specimen must be removed from one cylinder of each lot of 200 or fewer, or welded test plate. The welded test plate must be of one of the heats in the lot of 200 or fewer which it represents, in the same condition and approximately the same thickness as the cylinder wall except that in no case must it be of a lesser thickness than that required for a quarter size Charpy impact specimen. The weld must be made by the same procedures and subjected to the same heat treatment as the major weld on the cylinder. The specimen must be taken from across the major seam and must be prepared and tested in conformance with and must meet the requirements of CGA C-3. Should this specimen fail to meet the requirements, one additional specimen must be taken from two additional cylinders or welded test plates from the same lot and tested. If either of these latter two specimens fail to meet the requirements, the entire lot represented must be rejected.

        (2)  A root bend test specimen must be removed from the cylinder or welded test plate that was used for the tensile test specified in paragraph (l)(1) of this section. The specimen must be taken from across the circumferential seam and must be prepared and tested in conformance with and must meet the requirements of CGA C-3. Should this specimen fail to meet the requirements, one additional specimen must be taken from two additional cylinders or welded test plates from the same lot and tested. If either of these latter two specimens fail to meet the requirements, the entire lot represented must be rejected.

        (3)  This test may be used and must be as required by CGA C-3. The specimen must be bent until the elongation at the outer surface, adjacent to the root of the weld, between the lightly scribed gage lines a to b, must be at least 20 percent, except that this percentage may be reduced for steels having a tensile strength in excess of 50,000 psig, as provided in paragraph (k) of this section. Should the specimen fail to meet the requirements, one additional specimen must be taken from two additional cylinders or welded test plates from the same lot and tested. If any of these latter two specimens fail to meet the requirements, the entire lot represented must be rejected.

        (m)  Reheat treatment is authorized for a rejected cylinder in accordance with this paragraph (m). After reheat, a cylinder must pass all prescribed tests in this section to be acceptable. Repair of brazed seams by brazing and welded seams by welding is considered authorized. For cylinders with an outside diameter of less than or equal to six (6) inches, welded seam repairs greater than one (1) inch in length shall require reheat treatment of the cylinder. For cylinders greater than an outside diameter of six (6) inches, welded seam repairs greater than three (3) inches in length shall require reheat treatment.

        (n)  (1) Markings must be as required in § 178.35 and in addition must be stamped plainly and permanently in one of the following locations on the cylinder:

        (i) On shoulders and top heads whose wall thickness is not less than 0.087 inch thick;

        (ii) On side wall adjacent to top head for side walls not less than 0.090 inch thick;

        (iii) On a cylindrical portion of the shell that extends beyond the recessed bottom of the cylinder constituting an integral and non-pressure part of the cylinder;

Elastic extension calculations must be based on an elastic modulus of 30,000,000. In the event of controversy, the entire stress-strain diagram must be plotted and the yield strength determined from the 0.2 percent offset.

        (iii) For the purpose of strain measurement, the initial strain must be set while the specimen is under a stress of 12,000 psi and the strain indicator reading being set at the calculated corresponding strain.

        (iv) Cross-head speed of the testing machine may not exceed   inch per minute during yield strength determination.

        (l)  Acceptable results for the physical and flattening tests are an elongation of at least 40 percent for a 2 inch gauge length or at least 20 percent in other cases and a yield strength not over 73 percent of tensile strength. In this instance the flattening test is required, without cracking, to six times the wall thickness with a weld 90° from the direction of the applied load. Two rings cut from the ends of length of pipe used in production of a lot may be used for the flattening test provided the rings accompany the lot which they represent in all thermal processing operations. At least one of the rings must pass the flattening test.

        (m)  All spun cylinders and plugged cylinders must be tested for leakage by gas or air pressure after the bottom has been cleaned and is free from all moisture, subject to the following conditions:

        (1) Pressure, approximately the same as but no less than service pressure, must be applied to one side of the finished bottom over an area of at least   of the total area of the bottom but not less than   inch in diameter, including the closure, for at least 1 minute, during which time the other side of the bottom exposed to pressure must be covered with water and closely examined for indications of leakage. Except as provided in paragraph (n) of this section, cylinders which are leaking must be rejected.

        (2) A spun cylinder is one in which an end closure in the finished cylinder has been welded by the spinning process.

        (3) A plugged cylinder is one in which a permanent closure in the bottom of a finished cylinder has been effected by a plug.

        (4) As a safety precaution, if the manufacturer elects to make this test before the hydrostatic test, he should design his apparatus so that the pressure is applied to the smallest area practicable, around the point of closure, and so as to use the smallest possible volume of air or gas.

        (n)  Repairs of rejected cylinders is authorized. Cylinders that are leaking must be rejected, except that:

        (1) Spun cylinders rejected under the provisions of paragraph (m) of this section may be removed from the spun cylinder category by drilling to remove defective material, tapping, and plugging.

        (2) Brazed joints may be rebrazed.

        (3) Subsequent to the operations noted in paragraphs (n)(1) and (n)(2) of this section, acceptable cylinders must pass all prescribed tests.

        (o)  Markings on each cylinder must be by stamping plainly and permanently on shoulder, top head, neck or valve protection collar which is permanently attached to the cylinders and forming an integral part thereof, provided that cylinders not less than 0.090 inch thick may be stamped on the side wall adjacent to top head.

Determination of expansion properties is not required.

        (j)  A physical test must be conducted to determine yield strength, tensile strength, elongation, and reduction of area of material, as follows:

Elastic extension calculations must be based on an elastic modulus of 30,000,000. In the event of controversy, the entire stress-strain diagram must be plotted and the yield strength determined from the 0.2 percent offset.

        (iii) For the purpose of strain measurement, the initial strain reference must be set while the specimen is under a stress of 12,000 psi and the strain indicator reading being set at the calculated corresponding strain.

The welded test plate must be of one of the heats in the lot of 200 or less which it represents, in the same condition and approximately the same thickness as the cylinder wall except that it may not be of a lesser thickness than that required for a quarter size Charpy impact specimen. The weld must be made by the same procedures and subjected to the same heat treatment as the major weld on the cylinder. The specimens must be taken across the major seam and must be prepared and tested in accordance with and must meet the requirements of CGA Pamphlet C-3. Should this specimen fail to meet the requirements, specimens may be taken from two additional cylinders or welded test plates from the same lot and tested. If either of the latter specimens fail to meet the requirements, the entire lot represented must be rejected.

Specimens must be taken from across the major seam and must be prepared and tested in accordance with and must meet the requirements of CGA Pamphlet C-3.

        (3)  This test may be used and must be as required by CGA Pamphlet C-3. The specimen must be bent until the elongation at the outer surface, adjacent to the root of the weld, between the lightly scribed gage lines-a to b, is at least 20 percent, except that this percentage may be reduced for steels having a tensile strength in excess of 50,000 psi, as provided in paragraph (k) of this section.

        (m)  Reheat treatment of rejected cylinders is authorized. Subsequent thereto, cylinders must pass all prescribed tests to be acceptable. Repair of welded seams by welding is authorized.

        (ii) In using the “extension under load” method, the total strain (or “extension under load”), corresponding to the stress at which the 0.2 percent permanent strain occurs may be determined with sufficient accuracy by calculating the elastic expansion of the gauge length under appropriate load and adding thereto 0.2 percent of the gauge length. Elastic extension calculations must be based on the elastic modulus of the material used. In the event of controversy, the entire stress-strain diagram must be plotted and the yield strength determined from the 0.2 percent offset.

        (iii) For the purpose of strain measurement, the initial strain reference must be set while the specimen is under a stress of 12,000 psi and the strain indicator reading being set at the calculated corresponding strain.

        (iv) Cross-head speed of the testing machine may not exceed   inch per minute during yield strength determination.

        (k)  Physical properties must meet the limits specified in paragraph (o)(1), table 1, of this section, for the particular steel in the annealed condition. The specimens must show at least a 20 percent elongation for a 2-inch gage length. Except that the percentage may be reduced numerically by 2 for each 7,500 psi increment of tensile strength above 100,000 psi to a maximum of 5 such increments. Yield strength and tensile strength must meet the requirements of paragraph (o)(1), table 1, of this section.

        (l)  Welds must be tested as follows:

        (1)  A specimen must be cut from one cylinder of each lot of 200 or less, or welded test plate. The welded test plate must be of one of the heats in the lot of 200 or less which it represents, in the same condition and approximately the same thickness as the cylinder wall except that it may not be of a lesser thickness than that required for a quarter size Charpy impact specimen. The weld must be made by the same procedures and subjected to the same heat treatment as the major weld on the cylinder. The specimen must be taken across the major seam and must be prepared in accordance with and must meet the requirements of CGA Pamphlet C-3. Should this specimen fail to meet the requirements, specimens may be taken from two additional cylinders or welded test plates from the same lot and tested. If either of the latter specimens fails to meet the requirements, the entire lot represented must be rejected.

        (2)  A “root” bend test specimen must be cut from the cylinder or welded test plate, used for the tensile test specified in paragraph (l)(1) of this section and from any other seam or equivalent welded test plate if the seam is welded by a procedure different from that used for the major seam. Specimens must be taken across the particular seam being tested and must be prepared and tested in accordance with and must meet the requirements of CGA Pamphlet C-3.

        (3)  This test may be used and must be as specified in CGA Pamphlet C-3. The specimen must be bent until the elongation at the outer surface, adjacent to the root of the weld, between the lightly scribed gage lines a to b, is at least 20 percent, except that this percentage may be reduced for steels having a tensile strength in excess of 100,000 psig, as provided in paragraph (c) of this section.

        (4)  One set of three impact test specimens (for each test) must be prepared and tested for determining the impact properties of the deposited weld metal—

        (i) As part of the qualification of the welding procedure.

        (ii) As part of the qualification of the operators.

        (iii) For each “heat” of welding rodor wire used.

        (iv) For each 1,000 feet of weld made with the same heat of welding rod or wire.

        (v) All impact test specimens must be of the charpy type, keyhole or milled U-notch, and must conform in all respects to ASTM E 23 (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter). Each set of impact specimens must be taken across the weld and have the notch located in the weld metal. When the cylinder material thickness is 2.5 mm or thicker, impact specimens must be cut from a cylinder or welded test plate used for the tensile or bend test specimens. The dimension along the axis of the notch must be reduced to the largest possible of 10 mm, 7.5 mm, 5 mm or 2.5 mm, depending upon cylinder thickness. When the material in the cylinder or welded test plate is not of sufficient thickness to prepare 2.5 mm impact test specimens, 2.5 mm specimens must be prepared from a welded test plate made from   inch thick material meeting the requirements specified in paragraph (o)(1), table 1, of this section and having a carbon analysis of .05 minimum, but not necessarily from one of the heats used in the lot of cylinders. The test piece must be welded by the same welding procedure as used on the particular cylinder seam being qualified and must be subjected to the same heat treatment.

        (vi) Impact test specimens must be cooled to the design service temperature. The apparatus for testing the specimens must conform to requirements of ASTM Standard E 23. The test piece, as well as the handling tongs, must be cooled for a length of time sufficient to reach the service temperature. The temperature of the cooling device must be maintained within a range of plus or minus 3 °F. The specimen must be quickly transferred from the cooling device to the anvil of the testing machine and broken within a time lapse of not more than six seconds.

        (vii) The impact properties of each set of impact specimens may not be less than the values in the following table:

        (viii) When the average value of the three specimens equals or exceeds the minimum value permitted for a single specimen and the value for more than one specimen is below the required average value, or when the value for one specimen is below the minimum value permitted for a single specimen, a retest of three additional specimens must be made. The value of each of these retest specimens must equal or exceed the required average value. When an erratic result is caused by a defective specimen, or there is uncertainty in test procedure, a retest is authorized.

        (ii) Each cylinder must be tested between 500 and 600 psig and show no defect. If, due to failure of the test apparatus or operator error, the test pressure cannot be maintained, the test may be repeated in accordance with CGA C-1 section 5.7.2 or 7.1.2, as appropriate. Determination of expansion properties is not required.

        (k)  Cylinders with bottoms closed in by spinning must be leakage tested by setting the interior air or gas pressure at not less than the service pressure. Any cylinder that leaks must be rejected.

        (l)  A physical test must be conducted as follows;

        (2) Specimens must conform to a gauge length of 8 inches with a width not over 1  inches, a gauge length 2 inches with a width not over 1  inches, or a gauge length at least 24 times thickness with a width not over 6 times thickness is authorized when a cylinder wall is not over   inch thick.

        (3) The yield strength in tension must be the stress corresponding to a permanent strain of 0.2 percent of the gauge length. The following conditions apply:

        (i) The yield strength must be determined by either the “offset” method or the “extension under load” method as prescribed in ASTM E 8 (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter).

        (ii) In using the “extension under load” method, the total strain (or “extension under load”) corresponding to the stress at which the 0.2 percent permanent strain occurs may be determined with sufficient accuracy by calculating the elastic extension of the gauge length under appropriate load and adding thereto 0.2 percent of the gauge length. Elastic extension calculations must be based on an elastic modulus of 30,000,000. In the event of controversy, the entire stress-strain diagram must be plotted and the yield strength determined from the 0.2 offset.

        (iii) For the purpose of strain measurement, the initial strain must be set while the specimen is under a stress of 12,000 psi, the strain indicator reading being set at the calculated corresponding strain.

The specimen must be taken from across the major seam and must be prepared and tested in accordance with and must meet the requirements of CGA Pamphlet C-3. Should this specimen fail to meet the requirements, specimens may be taken from two additional cylinders or welded test plates from the same lot and tested. If either of the latter specimens fail to meet the requirements, the entire lot represented must be rejected.

        (2)  A root bend test specimen must be cut from the cylinder or welded test plate, used for the tensile test specified in paragraph (n)(1) of this section. Specimens must be prepared and tested in accordance with and must meet the requirements of CGA Pamphlet C-3.

        (3)  This test may be used and must be as required by CGA Pamphlet C-3. The specimen must be bent until the elongation at the outer surface, adjacent to the root of the weld, between the lightly scribed gage lines-a to b, must be at least 20 percent, except that this percentage may be reduced for steels having a tensile strength in excess of 50,000 psi, as provided in paragraph (m) of this section.

        (o)  Reheat treatment of rejected cylinders is authorized. Subsequent thereto, cylinders must pass all prescribed tests to be acceptable. Repair by welding is authorized.

        (p)  (1) Cylinders must be filled with a porous material in accordance with the following:

        (iii) Overall shrinkage of the filling material is authorized if the total clearance between the cylinder shell and filling material, after solvent has been added, does not exceed   of 1 percent of the respective diameter or length but not to exceed   inch, measured diametrically and longitudinally;

        (iv) The clearance may not impair the functions of the filling material;

        (v) The installed filling material must meet the requirements of CGA C-12 (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter); and

        (vi) Porosity of filling material may not exceed 80 percent except that filling material with a porosity of up to 92 percent may be used when tested with satisfactory results in accordance with CGA Pamphlet C-12.

        (2) When the porosity of each cylinder is not known, a cylinder taken at random from a lot of 200 or less must be tested for porosity. If the test cylinder fails, each cylinder in the lot may be tested individually and those cylinders that pass the test are acceptable.

        (3) For filling that is molded and dried before insertion in cylinders, porosity test may be made on sample block taken at random from material to be used.

        (4) The porosity of the filling material must be determined; the amount of solvent at 70 °F for a cylinder:

Exposed bottom welds on cylinders over 18 inches long must be protected by footrings. Minimum thickness of heads may not be less than 90 percent of the required thickness of the sidewall. Heads must be concave to pressure.

        (2) Circumferential seams must be by electric-arc welding. Joints must be butt with one member offset (joggle butt) or with a lap joint. Joints must have a minimum overlap of at least four (4) times nominal sheet thickness.

        (3) Longitudinal electric-arc welded seams (in shells) must be of the butt welded type. Welds must be made by a machine process including automatic feed and welding guidance mechanisms. Longitudinal seams must have complete joint penetration, and must be free from undercuts, overlaps or abrupt ridges or valleys. Misalignment of mating butt edges may not exceed   inch of nominal sheet thickness or   inch whichever is less. All joints with nominal sheet thickness up to and including   inch must be tightly butted. When nominal sheet thickness is greater than   inch, the joint must be gapped with maximum distance equal to one-half the nominal sheet thickness or   inch whichever is less. Joint design, preparation, and fit-up must be such that requirements of this paragraph (d) are satisfied.

        (4) Welding procedures and operators must be qualified in accordance with CGA C-3 (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter).

        (5)(i) Welds of the cylinders must be subjected to radioscopic or radiographic examination as follows:

        (ii) Radioscopy or radiography must be in conformance with CGA C-3 (IBR; see § 171.7 of this subchapter). Maximum joint efficiency will be 1.0 when each longitudinal seam is examined completely. Maximum joint efficiency will be 0.90 when one cylinder from each lot of 50 consecutively welded cylinders is spot examined. In addition, one out of the first five cylinders welded following a shutdown of welding operations exceeding four hours must be spot examined. Spot radiographs, when required, must be made of a finished welded cylinder and must include the circumferential weld for 2 inches in both directions from the intersection of the longitudinal and circumferential welds and include at least 6 inches of the longitudinal weld. Maximum joint efficiency of 0.75 will be permissible without radiography or radioscopy. When fluoroscopic examination is used, permanent film records need not be retained. Circumferential welds need not be examined, except as part of spot examination.

        (e)  The attachment to the tops and bottoms only of cylinders by welding of neckrings, footrings, handles, bosses, pads and valve protection rings is authorized provided that such attachments and the portion of the container to which they are attached are made of weldable steel, the carbon content of which may not exceed 0.25 percent.

        (f)  (1) For outside diameters over 6 inches the minimum wall thickness must be 0.078 inch. In any case, the minimum wall thickness must be such that the wall stress calculated by the formula listed in paragraph (f)(2) of this section may not exceed the lesser value of any of the following:

        (i) The value referenced in paragraph (b) of this section for the particular material under consideration.

        (ii) One-half of the minimum tensile strength of the material determined as required in paragraph (j) of this section.

Heat treatment must be accomplished after all forming and welding operations, except that when brazed joints are used, heat treatment must follow any forming and welding operations, but may be done before, during or after the brazing operations (see paragraph (n) of this section for weld repairs).

        (2) Heat treatment is not required after welding of weldable low-carbon parts to attachments of similar material which have been previously welded to the top or bottom of cylinders and properly heat treated, provided such subsequent welding does not produce a temperature in excess of 400 °F in any part of the top or bottom material.

        (h)  Openings in cylinders must comply with the following requirements:

        (1) All openings must be in heads or bases.

        (iv) A brass fitting may be brazed to the steel boss or flange on cylinders used as component parts of handheld fire extinguishers.

        (i)  Each cylinder must successfully withstand a pressure test as follows:

        (1)  (i) At least one (1) cylinder randomly selected out of each lot of 200 or fewer must be tested by the water-jacket or direct expansion method as prescribed in CGA C-1 (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter). The testing equipment must be calibrated as prescribed in CGA C-1. All testing equipment and pressure indicating devices must be accurate within the parameters defined in CGA C-1.

        (ii) Each selected cylinder must be tested to a minimum of two (2) times service pressure.

        (iii) The minimum test pressure must be maintained at least 30 seconds and sufficiently longer to ensure complete expansion. Any internal pressure applied after heat-treatment and prior to the official test may not exceed 90 percent of the test pressure. If, due to failure of the test apparatus or operator error, the test pressure cannot be maintained, the test may be repeated in accordance with CGA C-1, section 5.7.2.

        (iv) Permanent volumetric expansion may not exceed 10 percent of the total volumetric expansion at test pressure.

        (2)  (i) The remaining cylinders in each lot must be pressure tested by the proof pressure, water-jacket or direct expansion test method as prescribed in CGA C-1. The minimum test pressure must be maintained for the specific timeframe and the testing equipment must be calibrated as prescribed in CGA C-1. Further, all testing equipment and pressure indicating devices must be accurate within the parameters defined in CGA C-1.

        (ii) Each cylinder must be tested to a minimum of two (2) times service pressure and show no defect. If, due to failure of the test apparatus or operator error, the test pressure cannot be maintained, the test may be repeated in accordance with CGA C-1 5.7.2 or 7.1.2, as appropriate. Determination of expansion properties is not required.

        (3)  One finished cylinder selected at random out of each lot of 500 or less successively produced must be hydrostatically tested to four (4) times service pressure without bursting. All testing equipment and pressure indicating devices must be accurate within the parameters defined in CGA C-1.

        (j)  Mechanical tests must be conducted to determine yield strength, tensile strength, elongation as a percentage, and reduction of area of material as a percentage, as follows:

        (1) Specimens must be taken from one cylinder after heat treatment as illustrated in appendix A to this subpart, chosen at random from each lot of 200 or fewer, as follows:

        (i) One specimen must be taken longitudinally from the body section at least 90 degrees away from the weld.

        (ii) One specimen must be taken from either head on a cylinder when both heads are made of the same material. However, if the two heads are made of differing materials, a specimen must be taken from each head.

        (iii) If due to welded attachments on the top head there is insufficient surface from which to take a specimen, it may be taken from a representative head of the same heat treatment as the test cylinder.

        (2) Specimens must conform to the following:

        (i) When a cylinder wall is   inch thick or less, one the following gauge lengths is authorized: A gauge length of 8 inches with a width not over 1  inches, a gauge length of 2 inches with a width not over 1  inches, or a gauge length at least twenty-four (24) times the thickness with a width not over six (6) times the thickness.

        (ii) The specimen, exclusive of grip ends, may not be flattened. Grip ends may be flattened to within 1 inch of each end of the reduced section.

        (iii) When size of the cylinder does not permit securing straight specimens, the specimens may be taken in any location or direction and may be straightened or flattened cold, by pressure only, not by blows. When specimens are taken, and prepared in this manner, the inspector's report must show, in connection with the record of physical tests, detailed information in regard to such specimens.

        (iv) Heating of a specimen for any purpose is not authorized.

        (3) The yield strength in tension must be the stress corresponding to a permanent strain of 0.2 percent of the gauge length. The following conditions apply:

        (i) The yield strength must be determined by either the “off-set” method or the “extension under load” method as prescribed in ASTM E 8 (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter).

        (ii) In using the “extension under load” method, the total strain (or “extension under load”), corresponding to the stress at which the 0.2-percent permanent strain occurs may be determined with sufficient accuracy by calculating the elastic extension of the gauge length under appropriate load and adding thereto 0.2 percent of the gauge length. Elastic extension calculations must be based on an elastic modulus of 30,000,000. In the event of controversy, the entire stress-strain diagram must be plotted and the yield strength determined from the 0.2-percent offset.

        (iii) For strain measurement, the initial strain reference must be set while the specimen is under a stress of 12,000 psig, and the strain indicator reading must be set at the calculated corresponding strain.

        (iv) Cross-head speed of the testing machine may not exceed   inch per minute during yield strength determination.

        (k)  Mechanical test specimens must show at least a 40 percent elongation for a 2-inch gauge length or at least 20 percent in other cases. However, elongation percentages may be reduced numerically by 2 percent for 2-inch specimens, and by 1 percent in other cases, for each 7,500 psi increase of tensile strength above 50,000 psig. The tensile strength may be incrementally increased by four increments of 7,500 psig for a maximum total of 30,000 psig.

        (l)  Welds must be subjected to the following tests:

        (1)  A specimen must be removed from one cylinder of each lot of 200 or fewer. The specimen must be taken from across the longitudinal seam and must be prepared and tested in conformance with the requirements of CGA C-3 (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter).

        (2)  A root bend test specimen must be removed from the cylinder or welded test plate used for the tensile test specified in paragraph (m)(1) of this section. Specimens must be taken from across the longitudinal seam and must be prepared and tested in conformance with the requirements of CGA C-3. If the specimen fails to meet the requirements, one specimen each must be taken from two additional cylinders or welded test plates from the same lot as the previously tested cylinder or added test plate and tested. If either of these latter two specimens fails to meet the requirements, the entire lot represented must be rejected.

        (3)  This test may be used and must be as required by CGA C-3. The specimen must be bent until the elongation at the outer surface, adjacent to the root of the weld, between the lightly scribed gauge lines a to b, must be at least 20 percent, except that this percentage may be reduced for steels having a tensile strength in excess of 50,000 psig, as provided in paragraph (k) of this section. Should this specimen fail to meet the requirements, one additional specimen must be taken from two additional cylinders or welded test plates from the same lot and tested as the previously tested cylinder or added test plate. If either of these latter two specimens fails to meet the requirements, the entire lot represented must be rejected.

        (m)  (1) Unless otherwise stated, if a sample cylinder or specimen taken from a lot of cylinders fails the prescribed test, then two additional specimens must be selected from the same lot and subjected to the prescribed test. If either of these fails the test, then the entire lot must be rejected.

        (2)  Reheat treatment is authorized for a rejected cylinder in accordance with this paragraph (m)(2). After reheat treatment, a cylinder must pass all prescribed tests in this section to be considered acceptable. Repair of welded seams by welding is authorized. For cylinders less than or equal to an outside diameter of 6 inches, welded seam repairs greater than 1 inch in length shall require reheat treatment of the cylinder. For cylinders greater than an outside diameter of 6 inches, welded seam repairs greater than 3 inches in length shall require reheat treatment.

        (n)  (1) Markings must be as required in § 178.35 and in addition must be stamped plainly and permanently in one of the following locations on the cylinder:

        (i) On shoulders and top heads whose wall thickness is not less than 0.087 inch thick.

        (ii) On side wall adjacent to top head for side walls not less than 0.090 inch thick.

        (iii) On a cylindrical portion of the shell that extends beyond the recessed bottom of the cylinder constituting an integral and non-pressure part of the cylinder.

        (iv) On a plate attached to the top of the cylinder or permanent part thereof; sufficient space must be left on the plate to provide for stamping at least six retest dates; the plate must be at least  -inch thick and must be attached by welding at a temperature of 1,100 °F, throughout all edges of the plate.

        (v) On the neck, neckring, valve boss, valve protection sleeve, or similar part permanently attached to the top of the cylinder.

        (vi) On the footring permanently attached to the cylinder, provided the water capacity of the cylinder does not exceed 30 pounds.

        (2) Embossing the cylinder head or side wall is not permitted.

        (o)  In addition to the information required by § 178.35, the inspector's report must indicate the type and amount of radiography.

        (a)  A DOT 4E cylinder is a welded aluminum cylinder with a water capacity (nominal) of not over 1,000 pounds and a service pressure of at least 225 to not over 500 psig. The cylinder must be constructed of not more than two seamless drawn shells with no more than one circumferential weld. The circumferential weld may not be closer to the point of tangency of the cylindrical portion with the shoulder than 20 times the cylinder wall thickness. Cylinders or shells closed in by spinning process and cylinders with longitudinal seams are not authorized.

        (b)  (1) The cylinder must be constructed of aluminum of uniform quality. The following chemical analyses are authorized:

        (2) The aluminum used in the construction of the cylinder must be as specified in Table 1 to paragraph (b)(1) of this section. Analyses must regularly be made only for the elements specifically mentioned in the table. If, however, the presence of other elements is indicated in the course of routine analysis, further analysis should be made to determine conformance with the limits specified for other elements. The cylinder manufacturer must maintain a record of intentionally added alloying elements.

        (c)  Material must be identified by any suitable method that will identify the alloy and manufacturer's lot number.

        (d)  Cylinders must be manufactured using equipment and processes adequate to ensure that each cylinder produced conforms to the requirements of this subpart. No defect is permitted that is likely to weaken the finished cylinder appreciably. A reasonably smooth and uniform surface finish is required. All welding must be by the gas shielded arc process.

        (e)  The attachment to the tops and bottoms only of cylinders by welding of neckrings, flanges, footrings, handles, bosses, pads, and valve protection rings is authorized. However, such attachments and the portion of the cylinder to which it is attached must be made of weldable aluminum alloys.

        (f)  The wall thickness of the cylinder must conform to the following:

        (1) The minimum wall thickness of the cylinder must be 0.140 inch. In any case, the minimum wall thickness must be such that calculated wall stress at twice service pressure may not exceed the lesser value of either of the following:

        (2) Each opening in cylinders, except those for safety devices, must be provided with a fitting, boss, or pad, securely attached to cylinder by welding by inert gas shielded arc process or by threads. If threads are used, they must comply with the following:

        (i) Threads must be clean-cut, even, without checks and cut to gauge.

        (ii) Taper threads to be of length not less than as specified for American Standard taper pipe threads.

        (iii) Straight threads, having at least 4 engaged threads, to have tight fit and calculated shear strength at least 10 times the test pressure of the cylinder; gaskets required, adequate to prevent leakage.

        (3) Closure of a fitting, boss, or pad must be adequate to prevent leakage.

        (h)  Each cylinder must successfully withstand a pressure test as follows:

        (1)  All cylinders with a wall stress greater than 18,000 psig must be tested by water-jacket or direct expansion method as prescribed in CGA C-1 (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter). The testing equipment must be calibrated as prescribed in CGA C-1. All testing equipment and pressure indicating devices must be accurate within the parameters defined in CGA C-1.

        (i) Each cylinder must be tested to a minimum of two (2) times service pressure.

        (ii) The minimum test pressure must be maintained at least 30 seconds and sufficiently longer to ensure complete expansion. Any internal pressure applied after heat-treatment and prior to the official test may not exceed 90 percent of the test pressure. If, due to failure of the test apparatus or operator error, the test pressure cannot be maintained, the test may be repeated in accordance with CGA C-1, section 5.7.2.

        (iii) Permanent volumetric expansion may not exceed 12 percent of the total volumetric expansion at test pressure.

        (2)  (i) Cylinders with a wall stress of 18,000 psig or less may be lot tested. At least one (1) cylinder randomly selected out of each lot of 200 or less must be tested by the water-jacket or direct expansion method as prescribed in CGA C-1. The testing equipment must be calibrated as prescribed in CGA C-1. All testing equipment and pressure indicating devices must be accurate within the parameters defined in CGA C-1.

        (ii) Each selected cylinder must be tested to a minimum of two (2) times service pressure.

        (iii) The minimum test pressure must be maintained at least 30 seconds and sufficiently longer to ensure complete expansion. Any internal pressure applied after heat-treatment and prior to the official test may not exceed 90 percent of the test pressure.

        (iv) Permanent volumetric expansion may not exceed 12 percent of the total volumetric expansion at test pressure.

        (3)  (i) For cylinders with a wall stress of 18,000 psig or less, the remaining cylinders of the lot must be pressure tested by the proof pressure, water-jacket, or direct expansion test method as defined in CGA C-1. The minimum test pressure must be maintained for the specific timeframe and the testing equipment must be calibrated as prescribed in CGA C-1. Further, all testing equipment and pressure indicating devices must be accurate within the parameters defined in CGA C-1.

        (ii) Each cylinder must be tested to a minimum of two (2) times service pressure and show no defect. If, due to failure of the test apparatus or operator error, the test pressure cannot be maintained, the test may be repeated in accordance with CGA C-1 5.7.2 or 7.1.2, as appropriate. Determination of expansion properties is not required.

        (4)  One (1) finished cylinder selected at random out of each lot of 1000 or less must be hydrostatically tested to four (4) times service pressure without bursting. Inability to meet this requirement must result in rejection of the lot. All testing equipment and pressure indicating devices must be accurate within the parameters defined in CGA C-1.

        (i)  After hydrostatic testing, a flattening test is required on one section of a cylinder, taken at random out of each lot of 200 or less as follows:

        (1) If the weld is not at midlength of the cylinder, the test section must be no less in width than 30 times the cylinder wall thickness. The weld must be in the center of the section. Weld reinforcement must be removed by machining or grinding so that the weld is flush with the exterior of the parent metal. There must be no evidence of cracking in the sample when it is flattened between flat plates to no more than 6 times the wall thickness.

        (2) If the weld is at midlength of the cylinder, the test may be made as specified in paragraph (i)(1) of this section or must be made between wedge shaped knife edges (60° angle) rounded to a   inch radius. There must be no evidence of cracking in the sample when it is flattened to no more than 6 times the wall thickness.

        (j)  A mechanical test must be conducted to determine yield strength, tensile strength, elongation as a percentage, and reduction of area of material as a percentage as follows:

        (1) The test is required on two (2) specimens removed from one cylinder or part thereof as illustrated in appendix A to this subpart taken at random out of each lot of 200 or fewer.

        (2) Specimens must conform to the following:

        (i) A gauge length of 8 inches with a width not over 1  inches, a gauge length of 2 inches with a width not over 1  inches.

        (ii) The specimen, exclusive of grip ends, may not be flattened. Grip ends may be flattened to within 1 inch of each end of the reduced section.

        (iii) When size of cylinder does not permit securing straight specimens, the specimens may be taken in any location or direction and may be straightened or flattened cold, by pressure only, not by blows; when specimens are so taken and prepared, the inspector's report must show in connection with record of physical test detailed information in regard to such specimens.

        (iv) Heating of a specimen for any purpose is not authorized.

        (3) The yield strength in tension must be the stress corresponding to a permanent strain of 0.2 percent of the gauge length. The following conditions apply:

        (i) The yield strength must be determined by the “offset” method as prescribed in ASTM E 8 (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter).

        (ii) Cross-head speed of the testing machine may not exceed   inch per minute during yield strength determination.

        (k)  An acceptable result of the mechanical test requires at least 7 percent and yield strength not over 80 percent of tensile strength.

        (l)  Welds of the cylinder are required to pass the following tests successfully:

        (1)  A specimen must be removed from the cylinder used for the mechanical tests specified in paragraph (j) of this section. The specimen must be taken from across the seam; edges must be parallel for a distance of approximately 2 inches on either side of the weld. The specimen must be fractured in tension. The actual breaking stress must be a minimum of 30,000 psi. The apparent breaking stress calculated on the minimum design wall thickness must be a minimum of two (2) times the stress calculated under paragraph (f)(2) of this section. If the specimen fails to meet the requirements, the lot must be rejected except that specimens may be taken from two (2) additional cylinders from the same lot as the previously tested specimens. If either of the latter specimens fails to meet requirements, the entire lot represented must be rejected.

        (2)  A bend test specimen must be removed from the cylinder used for the mechanical test specified in paragraph (j) of this section. The specimen must be taken across the circumferential seam, must be a minimum of 1  inches wide, edges must be parallel and rounded with a file, and back-up strip, if used, must be removed by machining. The specimen must be tested as follows:

        (i)  The specimen must be bent to refusal in the guided bend test jig as illustrated in CGA C-3 (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter). The root of the weld (inside surface of the cylinder) must be located away from the ram of the jig. The specimen must not show a crack or other open defect exceeding   inch in any direction upon completion of the test. Should this specimen fail to meet the requirements, one additional specimen must be taken from two additional cylinders from the same lot and tested. If either of the latter specimens fails to meet requirements, the entire lot represented must be rejected.

        (ii)  This test may be used as an alternate to the guided bend test. The test specimen must be in conformance with The Aluminum Association's “Welding Aluminum: Theory and Practice, Fourth Edition, 2002” (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter). If the specimen fails to meet the requirements, one additional specimen must be taken from two additional cylinders or welded test plates from the same lot and tested. If any of these latter two specimens fails to meet the requirements, the entire lot must be rejected.

        (m)  Repair of welded seams is authorized. Acceptable cylinders must pass all prescribed tests.

        (n)  (1) Markings must be as required in § 178.35 and in addition must be stamped plainly and permanently in one of the following locations on the cylinder:

        (i) On the neck, neckring, valve boss, valve protection sleeve, or similar part permanently attached to the top of the cylinder.

        (ii) On the footring permanently attached to the cylinder, provided the water capacity of the cylinder does not exceed 30 pounds.

        (2) Embossing the cylinder head or side wall is not permitted.

        (o)  In addition to the information required by § 178.35, the record of chemical analyses must also include applicable information on iron, titanium, zinc, and magnesium used in the construction of the cylinder.

> [71 FR 33885, June 12, 2006]

        § 178.70   Approval of UN pressure receptacles.

#### § § 178.70

        (a)  The manufacturer of a UN pressure receptacle must obtain an initial design type approval from the Associate Administrator. The initial design type approval must be of the pressure receptacle design as it is intended to be produced. The manufacturer must arrange for an IIA, approved by the Associate Administrator in accordance with subpart I of part 107 of this chapter, to perform a pre-audit of its pressure receptacle manufacturing operation prior to having an audit conducted by the Associate Administrator or his designee.

        (b)  The manufacturer must submit an application for initial design type approval to the IIA for review. The IIA will examine the manufacturer's application for initial design type approval for completeness. An incomplete application will be returned to the manufacturer with an explanation. If an application is complete, the IIA will review all technical documentation, including drawings and calculations, to verify that the design meets all requirements of the applicable UN pressure receptacle standard and specification requirements. If the technical documentation shows that the pressure receptacle prototype design conforms to the applicable standards and requirements in § 178.70, the manufacturer will fabricate a prototype lot of pressure receptacles in conformance with the technical documentation representative of the design. The IIA will verify that the prototype lot conforms to the applicable requirements by selecting pressure receptacles and witnessing their testing. After prototype testing has been satisfactorily completed, showing the pressure receptacles fully conform to all applicable specification requirements, the certifying IIA must prepare a letter of recommendation and a design type approval certificate. The design type approval certificate must contain the name and address of the manufacturer and the IIA certifying the design type, the test results, chemical analyses, lot identification, and all other supporting data specified in the applicable ISO design, construction and testing standard. The IIA must provide the certificate and documentation to the manufacturer.

        (c)  If the pre-audit is found satisfactory by the IIA, the manufacturer will submit the letter of recommendation from the IIA and an application for design type approval to the Associate Administrator. An application for initial design type approval must be submitted for each manufacturing facility. The application must be in English and, at a minimum, contain the following information:

        (1) The name and address of the manufacturing facility. If the application is submitted by an authorized representative on behalf of the manufacturer, the application must include the representative's name and address.

        (2) The name and title of the individual responsible for the manufacturer's quality system, as required by § 178.69.

        (3) The designation of the pressure receptacle and the relevant pressure receptacle standard.

        § 171.8 of this subchapter.

        means a pressure receptacle design as specified by a particular pressure receptacle standard.

        means an overall approval of the manufacturer's quality system and design type of each pressure receptacle to be produced within the manufacturer's facility.

        § 171.8 of this subchapter.

        (c) Following the final heat treatment, all cylinders, except those selected for batch testing must be subjected to a proof pressure or a hydraulic volumetric expansion test.

        (d)  (1) Except for pressure relief devices, UN pressure receptacle equipment, including valves, piping, fittings, and other equipment subjected to pressure must be designed and constructed to withstand at least 1.5 times the test pressure of the pressure receptacle.

        (2) Service equipment must be configured, or designed, to prevent damage that could result in the release of the pressure receptacle contents during normal conditions of handling and transport. Manifold piping leading to shut-off valves must be sufficiently flexible to protect the valves and the piping from shearing or releasing the pressure receptacle contents. The filling and discharge valves and any protective caps must be secured against unintended opening. The valves must conform to ISO 10297:2014(E) and ISO 10297:2014/Amd 1:2017(E) (IBR,  § 171.7 of this subchapter), or for non-refillable pressure receptacles valves manufactured until December 31, 2020, ISO 13340:2001(E), and be protected as specified in § 173.301b(f) of this subchapter. Until December 31, 2022, the manufacture of a valve conforming to the requirements of ISO 10297:2014(E) is authorized. Until December 31, 2020, the manufacture of a valve conforming to the requirements in ISO 10297:2006(E) (IBR,  § 171.7 of this subchapter) was authorized. Until December 31, 2008, the manufacture of a valve conforming to the requirements in ISO 10297:1999(E) (IBR,  § 171.7 of this subchapter) was authorized.

For self-closing valves with inherent protection, the requirements of ISO 17879:2017(E) (IBR,  § 171.7 of this subchapter) shall be met until further notice.

        (3) UN pressure receptacles that cannot be handled manually or rolled, must be equipped with devices (e.g., skids, rings, straps) ensuring that they can be safely handled by mechanical means and so arranged as not to impair the strength of, nor cause undue stresses, in the pressure receptacle.

        (4) Pressure receptacles filled by volume must be equipped with a level indicator.

        (e)  UN pressure receptacles assembled in bundles must be structurally supported and held together as a unit and secured in a manner that prevents movement in relation to the structural assembly and movement that would result in the concentration of harmful local stresses. The frame design must ensure stability under normal operating conditions.

        (1) The frame must securely retain all the components of the bundle and must protect them from damage during conditions normally incident to transportation. The method of cylinder restraint must prevent any vertical or horizontal movement or rotation of the cylinder that could cause undue strain on the manifold. The total assembly must be able to withstand rough handling, including being dropped or overturned.

        (2) The frame must include features designed for the handling and transportation of the bundle. The lifting rings must be designed to withstand a design load of 2 times the maximum gross weight. Bundles with more than one lifting ring must be designed such that a minimum sling angle of 45 degrees to the horizontal can be achieved during lifting using the lifting rings. If four lifting rings are used, their design must be strong enough to allow the bundle to be lifted by two rings. Where two or four lifting rings are used, diametrically opposite lifting rings must be aligned with each other to allow for correct lifting using shackle pins. If the bundle is filled with forklift pockets, it must contain two forklift pockets on each side from which it is to be lifted. The forklift pockets must be positioned symmetrically consistent with the bundle center of gravity.

        (3) The frame structural members must be designed for a vertical load of 2 times the maximum gross weight of the bundle. Design stress levels may not exceed 0.9 times the yield strength of the material.

        (4) The frame must not contain any protrusions from the exterior frame structure that could cause a hazardous condition.

        (5) The frame design must prevent collection of water or other debris that would increase the tare weight of bundles filled by weight.

        (6) The floor of the bundle frame must not buckle during normal operating conditions and must allow for the drainage of water and debris from around the base of the cylinders.

        (7) If the frame design includes movable doors or covers, they must be capable of being secured with latches or other means that will not become dislodged by operational impact loads. Valves that need to be operated in normal service or in an emergency must be accessible.

        (8) For bundles of cylinders, pressure receptacle marking requirements only apply to the individual cylinders of a bundle and not to any assembly structure.

        § 178.74   Approval of MEGCs.

#### § § 178.74

        (a)  (1) Each new MEGC design type must have a design approval certificate. An owner or manufacturer must apply to an approval agency that is approved by the Associate Administrator in accordance with subpart E of part 107 of this chapter + to obtain approval of a new design. When a series of MEGCs is manufactured without change in the design, the certificate is valid for the entire series. The design approval certificate must refer to the prototype test report, the materials of construction of the manifold, the standards to which the pressure receptacles are made and an approval number. The compliance requirements or test methods applicable to MEGCs as specified in this subpart may be varied when the level of safety is determined to be equivalent to or exceed the requirements of this subchapter and is approved in writing by the Associate Administrator. A design approval may serve for the approval of smaller MEGCs made of materials of the same type and thickness, by the same fabrication techniques and with identical supports, equivalent closures and other appurtenances.

        (2) Each application for design approval must be in English and contain the following information:

        (i) Two complete copies of all engineering drawings, calculations, and test data necessary to ensure that the design meets the relevant specification.

        (ii) The manufacturer's serial number that will be assigned to each MEGC.

        (iii) A statement as to whether the design type has been examined by any approval agency previously and judged unacceptable. Affirmative statements must be documented with the name of the approval agency, reason for non-acceptance, and the nature of modifications made to the design type.

        (b)  The approval agency must review the application for design type approval, including all drawings and calculations, to ensure that the design of the MEGC meets all requirements of the relevant specification and to determine whether it is complete and conforms to the requirements of this section. An incomplete application will be returned to the applicant with the reasons why the application was returned. If the application is complete and all applicable requirements of this section are met, the approval agency must prepare a MEGC design approval certificate containing the manufacturer's name and address, results and conclusions of the examination and necessary data for identification of the design type. If the Associate Administrator approves the Design Type Approval Certificate application, the approval agency and the manufacturer must each maintain a copy of the approved drawings, calculations, and test data for at least 20 years.

        (c)  The approval agency is responsible for ensuring that the MEGC conforms to the design type approval. The approval agency must:

        (1) Witness all tests required for the approval of the MEGC specified in this section and § 178.75.

        (2) Ensure, through appropriate inspection, that each MEGC is fabricated in all respects in conformance with the approved drawings, calculations, and test data.

        (3) Determine and ensure that the MEGC is suitable for its intended use and that it conforms to the requirements of this subchapter.

        (4) Apply its name, identifying mark or identifying number, and the date the approval was issued, to the metal identification marking plate attached to the MEGC upon successful completion of all requirements of this subpart. Any approvals by the Associate Administrator authorizing design or construction alternatives (Alternate Arrangements) of the MEGC (see paragraph (a) of this section) must be indicated on the metal identification plate as specified in § 178.75(j).

        (5) Prepare an approval certificate for each MEGC or, in the case of a series of identical MEGCs manufactured to a single design type, for each series of MEGCs. The approval certificate must include all of the following information:

        (i) The information displayed on the metal identification plate required by § 178.75(j);

        (ii) The results of the applicable framework test specified in ISO 1496-3 (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter);

        (iii) The results of the initial inspection and test specified in paragraph (h) of this section;

        (iv) The results of the impact test specified in § 178.75(i)(4);

        (v) Certification documents verifying that the cylinders and tubes conform to the applicable standards; and

        (vi) A statement that the approval agency certifies the MEGC in accordance with the procedures in this section and that the MEGC is suitable for its intended purpose and meets the requirements of this subchapter. When a series of MEGCs is manufactured without change in the design type, the certificate may be valid for the entire series of MEGCs representing a single design type. The approval number must consist of the distinguishing sign or mark of the country (“USA” for the United States of America) where the approval was granted and a registration number.

        (6) Retain on file a copy of each approval certificate for at least 20 years.

        (d)  The manufacturer is responsible for compliance with the applicable specifications for the design and construction of MEGCs. The manufacturer of a MEGC must:

        (1) Comply with all the requirements of the applicable ISO standard specified in § 178.71;

        (2) Obtain and use an approval agency to review the design, construction and certification of the MEGC;

        (3) Provide a statement in the manufacturers' data report certifying that each MEGC manufactured complies with the relevant specification and all the applicable requirements of this subchapter; and

        (4) Retain records for the MEGCs for at least 20 years. When required by the specification, the manufacturer must provide copies of the records to the approval agency, the owner or lessee of the MEGC, and to a representative of DOT, upon request.

        (e)  If the Associate Administrator finds that the MEGC will not be approved for any reason, the Associate Administrator will notify the applicant in writing and provide the reason for the denial. The manufacturer may request that the Associate Administrator reconsider the decision. The application request must—

        (1) Be written in English and filed within 90 days of receipt of the decision;

        (2) State in detail any alleged errors of fact and law; and

        (3) Enclose any additional information needed to support the request to reconsider.

        (f)  (1) A manufacturer whose reconsideration request is denied may appeal to the PHMSA Administrator. The appeal must—

        (i) Be in writing and filed within 90 days of receipt of the Associate Administrator s decision on reconsideration;

        (ii) State in detail any alleged errors of fact and law;

        (iii) Enclose any additional information needed to support the appeal; and

        (iv) State in detail the modification of the final decision sought.

        (2) The Administrator will grant or deny the relief and inform the appellant in writing of the decision. The Administrator's decision is the final administrative action.

        (g)  (1) Prior to modification of any approved MEGC that may affect conformance and safe use, and that may involve a change to the design type or affect its ability to retain the hazardous material in transportation, the MEGC's owner must inform the approval agency that prepared the initial approval certificate for the MEGC or, if the initial approval agency is unavailable, another approval agency, of the nature of the modification and request certification of the modification. The owner must supply the approval agency with all revised drawings, calculations, and test data relative to the intended modification. The MEGC's owner must also provide a statement as to whether the intended modification has been examined and determined to be unacceptable by any approval agency. The written statement must include the name of the approval agency, the reason for non-acceptance, and the nature of changes made to the modification since its original rejection.

        (2) The approval agency must review the request for modification. If the approval agency determines that the proposed modification does not conform to the relevant specification, the approval agency must reject the request in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section. If the approval agency determines that the proposed modification conforms fully with the relevant specification, the request is accepted. If modification to an approved MEGC alters any information on the approval certificate, the approval agency must prepare a new approval certificate for the modified MEGC and submit the certificate to the Associate Administrator for approval. After receiving approval from the Associate Administrator, the approval agency must ensure that any necessary changes are made to the metal identification plate. A copy of each newly issued approval certificate must be retained by the approval agency and the MEGC's owner for at least 20 years. The approval agency must perform the following activities:

        (i) Retain a set of the approved revised drawings, calculations, and data as specified in § 178.69(b)(4) for at least 20 years;

        (ii) Ensure through appropriate inspection that all modifications conform to the revised drawings, calculations, and test data; and

        (iii) Determine the extent to which retesting of the modified MEGC is necessary based on the nature of the proposed modification, and ensure that all required retests are satisfactorily performed.

        (h)  (1) The Associate Administrator may terminate an approval issued under this section if he or she determines that—

        (i) Because of a change in circumstances, the approval no longer is needed or no longer would be granted if applied for;

        (ii) Information upon which the approval was based is fraudulent or substantially erroneous;

        (iii) Termination of the approval is necessary to adequately protect against risks to life and property; or

        (iv) The MEGC does not meet the specification.

        (2) Before an approval is terminated, the Associate Administrator will provide the person—

        (i) Written notice of the facts or conduct believed to warrant the termination;

        (ii) An opportunity to submit oral and written evidence; and

        (3) An opportunity to demonstrate or achieve compliance with the applicable requirements.

        (i)  If the Associate Administrator determines that a certificate of approval must be terminated to preclude a significant and imminent adverse effect on public safety, the Associate Administrator may terminate the certificate immediately. In such circumstances, the opportunities of paragraphs (h)(2) and (3) of this section need not be provided prior to termination of the approval, but must be provided as soon as practicable thereafter.

        (7) MEGCs must be designed to withstand, without loss of contents, at least the internal pressure due to the contents, and the static, dynamic and thermal loads during normal conditions of handling and transport. The design must take into account the effects of fatigue, caused by repeated application of these loads through the expected life of the MEGC.

        (8) MEGCs and their fastenings must, under the maximum permissible load, be capable of withstanding the following separately applied static forces (for calculation purposes, acceleration due to gravity (g) = 9.81 m/s ):

        (i) In the direction of travel: 2g (twice the MPGM multiplied by the acceleration due to gravity);

        (ii) Horizontally at right angles to the direction of travel: 1g (the MPGM multiplied by the acceleration due to gravity. When the direction of travel is not clearly determined, the forces must be equal to twice the MPGM);

        (10) Under each of the forces specified in paragraph (d)(8) of this section, the safety factor for the framework and fastenings must be as follows:

        (i) For steels having a clearly defined yield point, a safety factor of 1.5 in relation to the guaranteed yield strength; or

        (ii) For steels with no clearly defined yield point, a safety factor of 1.5 in relation to the guaranteed 0.2 percent proof strength and, for austenitic steels, the 1 percent proof strength.

        (11) MEGCs must be capable of being electrically grounded to prevent electrostatic discharge when intended for flammable gases.

        (12) The pressure receptacles of a MEGC must be secured in a manner to prevent movement that could result in damage to the structure and concentration of harmful localized stresses.

        (e)  (1) Service equipment must be arranged so that it is protected from mechanical damage by external forces during handling and transportation. When the connections between the frame and the pressure receptacles allow relative movement between the subassemblies, the equipment must be fastened to allow movement to prevent damage to any working part. The manifolds, discharge fittings (pipe sockets, shut-off devices), and shut-off valves must be protected from damage by external forces. Manifold piping leading to shut-off valves must be sufficiently flexible to protect the valves and the piping from shearing, or releasing the pressure receptacle contents. The filling and discharge devices, including flanges or threaded plugs, and any protective caps must be capable of being secured against unintended opening.

        (2) Each pressure receptacle intended for the transport of Division 2.3 gases must be equipped with an individual shut-off valve. The manifold for Division 2.3 liquefied gases must be designed so that each pressure receptacle can be filled separately and be kept isolated by a valve capable of being closed during transit. For Division 2.1 gases, the pressure receptacles must be isolated by an individual shut-off valve into assemblies of not more than 3,000 L.

        (3) For MEGC filling and discharge openings:

        (i) Two valves in series must be placed in an accessible position on each discharge and filling pipe. One of the valves may be a backflow prevention valve.

        (ii) The filling and discharge devices may be equipped to a manifold.

        (iii) For sections of piping which can be closed at both ends and where a liquid product can be trapped, a pressure-relief valve must be provided to prevent excessive pressure build-up.

        (iv) The main isolation valves on a MEGC must be clearly marked to indicate their directions of closure. All shutoff valves must close by a clockwise motion of the handwheel.

        (v) Each shut-off valve or other means of closure must be designed and constructed to withstand a pressure equal to or greater than 1.5 times the test pressure of the MEGC.

        (vi) All shut-off valves with screwed spindles must close by a clockwise motion of the handwheel. For other shut-off valves, the open and closed positions and the direction of closure must be clearly shown.

        (vii) All shut-off valves must be designed and positioned to prevent unintentional opening.

        (viii) Ductile metals must be used in the construction of valves or accessories.

        (4) The piping must be designed, constructed and installed to avoid damage due to expansion and contraction, mechanical shock and vibration. Joints in tubing must be brazed or have an equally strong metal union. The melting point of brazing materials must be no lower than 525 °C (977 °F). The rated pressure of the service equipment and of the manifold must be not less than two-thirds of the test pressure of the pressure receptacles.

        (f)  Each pressure receptacle must be equipped with one or more pressure relief devices as specified in § 173.301(f) of this subchapter. When pressure relief devices are installed, each pressure receptacle or group of pressure receptacles of a MEGC that can be isolated must be equipped with one or more pressure relief devices. Pressure relief devices must be of a type that will resist dynamic forces including liquid surge and must be designed to prevent the entry of foreign matter, the leakage of gas and the development of any dangerous excess pressure.

        (1) The size of the pressure relief devices: CGA S-1.1, excluding paragraph 9.1.1, (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter) must be used to determine the relief capacity of individual pressure receptacles.

        (2) Connections to pressure-relief devices: Connections to pressure relief devices must be of sufficient size to enable the required discharge to pass unrestricted to the pressure relief device. A shut-off valve installed between the pressure receptacle and the pressure relief device is prohibited, except where duplicate devices are provided for maintenance or other reasons, and the shut-off valves serving the devices actually in use are locked open, or the shut-off valves are interlocked so that at least one of the duplicate devices is always operable and capable of meeting the requirements of paragraph (f)(1) of this section. No obstruction is permitted in an opening leading to or leaving from a vent or pressure-relief device that might restrict or cut-off the flow from the pressure receptacle to that device. The opening through all piping and fittings must have at least the same flow area as the inlet of the pressure relief device to which it is connected. The nominal size of the discharge piping must be at least as large as that of the pressure relief device.

        (3) Location of pressure-relief devices: For liquefied gases, each pressure relief device must, under maximum filling conditions, be in communication with the vapor space of the pressure receptacles. The devices, when installed, must be arranged to ensure the escaping vapor is discharged upwards and unrestrictedly to prevent impingement of escaping gas or liquid upon the MEGC, its pressure receptacles or personnel. For flammable, pyrophoric and oxidizing gases, the escaping gas must be directed away from the pressure receptacle in such a manner that it cannot impinge upon the other pressure receptacles. Heat resistant protective devices that deflect the flow of gas are permissible provided the required pressure relief device capacity is not reduced. Arrangements must be made to prevent access to the pressure relief devices by unauthorized persons and to protect the devices from damage caused by rollover.

        (g)  When a MEGC is intended to be filled by mass, it must be equipped with one or more gauging devices. Glass level-gauges and gauges made of other fragile material are prohibited.

        (h)  (1) MEGCs must be designed and constructed with a support structure to provide a secure base during transport. MEGCs must be protected against damage to the pressure receptacles and service equipment resulting from lateral and longitudinal impact and overturning. The forces specified in paragraph (d)(8) of this section, and the safety factor specified in paragraph (d)(10) of this section must be considered in this aspect of the design. Skids, frameworks, cradles or other similar structures are acceptable. If the pressure receptacles and service equipment are so constructed as to withstand impact and overturning, additional protective support structure is not required (see paragraph (h)(4) of this section).

        (2) The combined stresses caused by pressure receptacle mountings (e.g. cradles, frameworks, etc.) and MEGC lifting and tie-down attachments must not cause excessive stress in any pressure receptacle. Permanent lifting and tie-down attachments must be equipped to all MEGCs. Any welding of mountings or attachments onto the pressure receptacles is prohibited.

        (3) The effects of environmental corrosion must be taken into account in the design of supports and frameworks.

        (4) When MEGCs are not protected during transport as specified in paragraph (h)(1) of this section, the pressure receptacles and service equipment must be protected against damage resulting from lateral or longitudinal impact or overturning. External fittings must be protected against release of the pressure receptacles' contents upon impact or overturning of the MEGC on its fittings. Particular attention must be paid to the protection of the manifold. Examples of protection include:

        (i) Protection against lateral impact, which may consist of longitudinal bars;

        (ii) Protection against overturning, which may consist of reinforcement rings or bars fixed across the frame;

        (iii) Protection against rear impact, which may consist of a bumper or frame;

        (iv) Protection of the pressure receptacles and service equipment against damage from impact or overturning by use of an ISO frame according to the relevant provisions of ISO 1496-3. (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter).

        (i)  The pressure receptacles and items of equipment of each MEGC must be inspected and tested before being put into service for the first time (initial inspection and test). This initial inspection and test of an MEGC must include the following:

        (1) A check of the design characteristics.

        (2) An external examination of the MEGC and its fittings, taking into account the hazardous materials to be transported.

        (3) A pressure test performed at the test pressures specified in § 173.304b(b)(1) and (2) of this subchapter. The pressure test of the manifold may be performed as a hydraulic test or by using another liquid or gas. A leakproofness test and a test of the satisfactory operation of all service equipment must also be performed before the MEGC is placed into service. When the pressure receptacles and their fittings have been pressure-tested separately, they must be subjected to a leakproof test after assembly.

        (4) An MEGC that meets the definition of “container” in the CSC (see 49 CFR 450.3(a)(2)) must be subjected to an impact test using a prototype representing each design type. The prototype MEGC must be shown to be capable of absorbing the forces resulting from an impact not less than 4 times (4 g) the MPGM of the fully loaded MEGC, at a duration typical of the mechanical shocks experienced in rail transport. A listing of acceptable methods for performing the impact test is provided in the UN Recommendations (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter).

        (j)  (1) Each MEGC must be equipped with a corrosion resistant metal plate permanently attached to the MEGC in a conspicuous place readily accessible for inspection. The pressure receptacles must be marked according to this section. Affixing the metal plate to a pressure receptacle is prohibited. At a minimum, the following information must be marked on the plate by stamping or by any other equivalent method:

        Stamp of the approval agency who performed or witnessed the most recent test

        (2) The following information must be marked on a metal plate firmly secured to the MEGC:

Requirements for approval, maintenance, inspection, testing and use are provided in § 178.273 and part 180, subpart G, of this subchapter. Any portable tank which meets the definition of a “container” within the terms of the International Convention for Safe Containers (CSC) must meet the requirements of the CSC as amended and 49 CFR parts 450 through 453 and must have a CSC safety approval plate.

        (2) In recognition of scientific and technological advances, the technical requirements applicable to UN portable tanks may be varied if approved by the Associate Administrator and the portable tank is shown to provide a level of safety equal to or exceeding the requirements of this subchapter. Portable tanks approved to alternative technical requirements must be marked “Alternative Arrangement” as specified in paragraph (i) of this section.

        (3)  The following definitions apply for the purposes of design and construction of UN portable tanks under this subpart:

        means a UN portable tank that has been approved to alternative technical requirements or testing methods other than those specified for UN portable tanks in part 178 or part 180 of this subchapter.

        means the designated approval agency authorized to approve the portable tank in accordance with the procedures in subpart E of part 107 of this subchapter.

        is defined according to the hazardous materials intended to be transported in the portable tank. See §§ 178.275, 178.276 and 178.277, as applicable.

        means a portable tank or series of portable tanks made of materials of the same material specifications and thicknesses, manufactured by a single manufacturer, using the same fabrication techniques (for example, welding procedures) and made with equivalent structural equipment, closures, and service equipment.

        means steel that has a ferritic grain size of 6 or finer when determined in accordance with ASTM E 112-96 (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter).

        means a non-reclosing pressure relief device that is thermally activated and that provides protection against excessive pressure buildup in the portable tank developed by exposure to heat, such as from a fire (see § 178.275(g)).

        means the outer insulation cover or cladding which may be part of the insulation system.

        means a test using gas to subject the shell and its service equipment to an internal pressure.

        is defined according to the hazardous materials intended to be transported in the portable tank. See §§ 178.275, 178.276 and 178.277, as applicable.

        means the sum of the tare mass of the portable tank and the heaviest hazardous material authorized for transportation.

        means a steel with a guaranteed minimum tensile strength of 360 N/mm  to 440 N/mm  and a guaranteed minimum elongation at fracture as specified in paragraph (c)(10) of this section.

        means a portable tank specially designed for repeated use in the transportation of hazardous materials to, from and between offshore facilities. An offshore portable tank is designed and constructed in accordance with the Guidelines for the Approval of Containers Handled in Open Seas specified in the IMDG Code (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter).

        means a steel with a tensile strength of 370 N/mm  and an elongation at fracture of 27%.

        means measuring instruments and filling, discharge, venting, safety, heating, cooling and insulating devices.

        means the part of the portable tank which retains the hazardous materials intended for transportation, including openings and closures, but does not include service equipment or external structural equipment.

        means the reinforcing, fastening, protective and stabilizing members external to the shell.

        means the maximum gauge pressure at the top of the shell during the hydraulic pressure test equal to not less than 1.5 times the design pressure for liquids and 1.3 for liquefied compressed gases and refrigerated liquefied gases. In some instances a pneumatic test is authorized as an alternative to the hydraulic test. The minimum test pressures for portable tanks intended for specific liquid and solid hazardous materials are specified in the applicable portable tank T codes (such as T1-T23) assigned to these hazardous materials in the § 172.101 Table of this subchapter.

        (b)  (1) The design temperature range for the shell must be −40 °C to 50 °C (−40 °F to 122 °F) for hazardous materials transported under normal conditions of transportation, except for portable tanks used for refrigerated liquefied gases where the minimum design temperature must not be higher than the lowest (coldest) temperature (for example, service temperature) of the contents during filling, discharge or transportation. For hazardous materials handled under elevated temperature conditions, the design temperature must not be less than the maximum temperature of the hazardous material during filling, discharge or transportation. More severe design temperatures must be considered for portable tanks subjected to severe climatic conditions (for example, portable tanks transported in arctic regions). Shells must be designed and constructed in accordance with the requirements in Section VIII of the ASME Code (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter), except as limited or modified in this subchapter. For portable tanks used for liquid or solid hazardous materials, a design code other than the ASME Code may be used if approved by the Associate Administrator. Portable tanks must have an ASME certification and U stamp when used for Hazard Zone A or B toxic by inhalation liquids, or when used for non-refrigerated or refrigerated liquefied compressed gases. Shells must be made of metallic materials suitable for forming. Non-metallic materials may be used for the attachments and supports between the shell and jacket, provided their material properties at the minimum and maximum design temperatures are proven to be sufficient. For welded shells, only a material whose weldability has been fully demonstrated may be used. Welds must be of high quality and conform to a level of integrity at least equivalent to the welding requirements specified in Section VIII of the ASME Code for the welding of pressure vessels. When the manufacturing process or the materials make it necessary, the shells must be suitably heat-treated to guarantee adequate toughness in the weld and in the heat-affected zones. In choosing the material, the design temperature range must be taken into account with respect to risk of brittle fracture, stress corrosion cracking, resistance to impact, and suitability for the hazardous materials intended for transportation in the portable tank. When fine grain steel is used, the guaranteed value of the yield strength must be not more than 460 N/mm  and the guaranteed value of the upper limit of the tensile strength must be not more than 725 N/mm  according to the material specification. Aluminum may not be used as a construction material for the shells of portable tanks intended for the transport of non-refrigerated liquefied gases. For portable tanks intended for the transport of liquid or solid hazardous materials, aluminum may only be used as a construction material for portable tank shells if approved by the Associate Administrator. Portable tank materials must be suitable for the external environment where they will be transported, taking into account the determined design temperature range. Portable tanks shall be designed to withstand, without loss of contents, at least the internal pressure due to the contents and the static, dynamic and thermal loads during normal conditions of handling and transportation. The design must take into account the effects of fatigue, caused by repeated application of these loads through the expected life of the portable tank.

        (2) Portable tank shells, fittings, and pipework shall be constructed from materials that are:

        (i) Compatible with the hazardous materials intended to be transported; or

        (ii) Properly passivated or neutralized by chemical reaction, if applicable; or

        (iii) For portable tanks used for liquid and solid materials, lined with corrosion-resistant material directly bonded to the shell or attached by equivalent means.

        (3) Gaskets and seals shall be made of materials that are compatible with the hazardous materials intended to be transported.

        (4) When shells are lined, the lining must be compatible with the hazardous materials intended to be transported, homogeneous, non-porous, free from perforations, sufficiently elastic and compatible with the thermal expansion characteristics of the shell. The lining of every shell, shell fittings and piping must be continuous and must extend around the face of any flange. Where external fittings are welded to the tank, the lining must be continuous through the fitting and around the face of external flanges. Joints and seams in the lining must be made by fusing the material together or by other equally effective means.

        (5) Contact between dissimilar metals which could result in damage by galvanic action must be prevented by appropriate measures.

        (6) The construction materials of the portable tank, including any devices, gaskets, linings and accessories, must not adversely affect or react with the hazardous materials intended to be transported in the portable tank.

        (7) Portable tanks must be designed and constructed with supports that provide a secure base during transportation and with suitable lifting and tie-down attachments.

        (c)  (1) Portable tanks and their fastenings must, under the maximum permissible loads and maximum permissible working pressures, be capable of absorbing the following separately applied static forces (for calculation purposes, acceleration due to gravity (g) = 9.81m/s ):

        (i) In the direction of travel: 2g (twice the MPGM multiplied by the acceleration due to gravity);

        (ii) Horizontally at right angles to the direction of travel: 1g (the MPGM multiplied by the acceleration due to gravity);

        (iii) Vertically upwards: 1g (the MPGM multiplied by the acceleration due to gravity); and

        (iv) Vertically downwards: 2g (twice the MPGM multiplied by the acceleration due to gravity).

        (2) Under each of the forces specified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the safety factor must be as follows:

        (i) For metals having a clearly defined yield point, a design margin of 1.5 in relation to the guaranteed yield strength; or

        (ii) For metals with no clearly defined yield point, a design margin of 1.5 in relation to the guaranteed 0.2% proof strength and, for austenitic steels, the 1% proof strength.

        (3) The values of yield strength or proof strength must be the values according to recognized material standards. When austenitic steels are used, the specified minimum values of yield strength or proof strength according to the material standards may be increased by up to 15% for portable tanks used for liquid and solid hazardous materials, other than toxic by inhalation liquids meeting the criteria of Hazard Zone A or Hazard Zone B (see § 173.133 of this subchapter), when these greater values are attested in the material inspection certificate.

        (4) Portable tanks must be capable of being electrically grounded to prevent dangerous electrostatic discharge when they are used for Class 2 flammable gases or Class 3 flammable liquids, including elevated temperature materials transported at or above their flash point.

        (5) For shells of portable tanks used for liquefied compressed gases, the shell must consist of a circular cross section. Shells must be of a design capable of being stress-analyzed mathematically or experimentally by resistance strain gauges as specified in UG-101 of Section VIII of the ASME Code, or other methods approved by the Associate Administrator.

        (6) Shells must be designed and constructed to withstand a hydraulic test pressure of not less than 1.5 times the design pressure for portable tanks used for liquids and 1.3 times the design pressure for portable tanks used for liquefied compressed gases. Specific requirements are provided for each hazardous material in the applicable T Code or portable tank special provision specified in the § 172.101 Table of this subchapter. The minimum shell thickness requirements must also be taken into account.

        (7) For metals exhibiting a clearly defined yield point or characterized by a guaranteed proof strength (0.2% proof strength, generally, or 1% proof strength for austenitic steels), the primary membrane stress σ (sigma) in the shell must not exceed 0.75 Re or 0.50 Rm, whichever is lower, at the test pressure, where:

        (8) The values of Re and Rm to be used must be the specified minimum values according to recognized material standards. When austenitic steels are used, the specified minimum values for Re and Rm according to the material standards may be increased by up to 15% when greater values are attested in the material inspection certificate.

        (9) Steels which have a Re/Rm ratio of more than 0.85 are not allowed for the construction of welded shells. The values of Re and Rm to be used in determining this ratio must be the values specified in the material inspection certificate.

        (10) Steels used in the construction of shells must have an elongation at fracture, in percentage, of not less than 10,000/Rm with an absolute minimum of 16% for fine grain steels and 20% for other steels.

        (11) For the purpose of determining actual values for materials for sheet metal, the axis of the tensile test specimen must be at right angles (transversely) to the direction of rolling. The permanent elongation at fracture must be measured on test specimens of rectangular cross sections in accordance with ISO 6892 (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter), using a 50 mm gauge length.

        (d)  (1) The minimum shell thickness must be the greatest thickness of the following:

        (i) the minimum thickness determined in accordance with the requirements of paragraphs (d)(2) through (d)(7) of this section;

        (ii) the minimum thickness determined in accordance with Section VIII of the ASME Code or other approved pressure vessel code; or

        (iii) the minimum thickness specified in the applicable T code or portable tank special provision indicated for each hazardous material in the § 172.101 Table of this subchapter.

        (2) Shells (cylindrical portions, heads and manhole covers) not more than 1.80 m in diameter may not be less than 5 mm thick in the reference steel or of equivalent thickness in the metal to be used. Shells more than 1.80 m in diameter may not be less than 6 mm (0.2 inches) thick in the reference steel or of equivalent thickness in the metal to be used. For portable tanks used only for the transportation of powdered or granular solid hazardous materials of Packing Group II or III, the minimum thickness requirement may be reduced to 5 mm in the reference steel or of equivalent thickness in the metal to be used regardless of the shell diameter. For vacuum-insulated tanks, the aggregate thickness of the jacket and the shell must correspond to the minimum thickness prescribed in this paragraph, with the thickness of the shell itself not less than the minimum thickness prescribed in paragraph (d)(3) of this section.

        (3) When additional protection against shell damage is provided in the case of portable tanks used for liquid and solid hazardous materials requiring test pressures less than 2.65 bar (265.0 kPa), subject to certain limitations specified in the UN Recommendations (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter), the Associate Administrator may approve a reduced minimum shell thickness.

        (4) The cylindrical portions, heads and manhole covers of all shells must not be less than 3 mm (0.1 inch) thick regardless of the material of construction, except for portable tanks used for liquefied compressed gases where the cylindrical portions, ends (heads) and manhole covers of all shells must not be less than 4 mm (0.2 inch) thick regardless of the material of construction.

        (5) When steel is used, that has characteristics other than that of reference steel, the equivalent thickness of the shell and heads must be determined according to the following formula:

        (6) The wall and all parts of the shell may not have a thickness less than that prescribed in paragraphs (d)(2), (d)(3) and (d)(4) of this section. This thickness must be exclusive of any corrosion allowance.

        (7) There must be no sudden change of plate thickness at the attachment of the heads to the cylindrical portion of the shell.

        (e)  (1) Service equipment must be arranged so that it is protected against the risk of mechanical damage by external forces during handling and transportation. When the connections between the frame and the shell allow relative movement between the sub-assemblies, the equipment must be fastened to allow such movement without risk of damage to any working part. The external discharge fittings (pipe sockets, shut-off devices) and the internal stop-valve and its seating must be protected against mechanical damage by external forces (for example, by using shear sections). Each internal self-closing stop-valve must be protected by a shear section or sacrificial device located outboard of the valve. The shear section or sacrificial device must break at no more than 70% of the load that would cause failure of the internal self-closing stop valve. The filling and discharge devices (including flanges or threaded plugs) and any protective caps must be capable of being secured against unintended opening.

        (2) Each filling or discharge opening of a portable tank must be clearly marked to indicate its function.

        (3) Each stop-valve or other means of closure must be designed and constructed to a rated pressure not less than the MAWP of the shell taking into account the temperatures expected during transport. All stop-valves with screwed spindles must close by a clockwise motion of the handwheel. For other stop-valves, the position (open and closed) and direction of closure must be clearly indicated. All stop-valves must be designed to prevent unintentional opening.

        (4) Piping must be designed, constructed and installed to avoid the risk of damage due to thermal expansion and contraction, mechanical shock and vibration. All piping must be of a suitable metallic material. Welded pipe joints must be used wherever possible.

        (5) Joints in copper tubing must be brazed or have an equally strong metal union. The melting point of brazing materials must be no lower than 525 °C (977 °F). The joints must not decrease the strength of the tubing, such as may happen when cutting threads. Brazed joints are not authorized for portable tanks intended for refrigerated liquefied gases.

        (6) The burst pressure of all piping and pipe fittings must be greater than the highest of four times the MAWP of the shell or four times the pressure to which it may be subjected in service by the action of a pump or other device (except pressure relief devices).

        (7) Ductile metals must be used in the construction of valves and accessories.

        (f) —(1)  Every pressure relief device must be clearly and permanently marked with the following:

        (i) the pressure (in bar or kPa) or temperature for fusible elements (in °C) at which it is set to discharge;

        (ii) the allowable tolerance at the discharge pressure for reclosing devices;

        (iii) the reference temperature corresponding to the rated pressure for frangible discs;

        (iv) the allowable temperature tolerance for fusible elements;

        (v) The rated flow capacity of the spring loaded pressure relief devices, frangible disc or fusible elements in standard cubic meters of air per second (m /s). For spring loaded pressure relief devices, the rated flow capacity must be determined according to ISO 4126-1 (including Technical Corrigendum 1) and ISO 4126-7 (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter); and

        (vi) The cross sectional flow areas of the spring loaded pressure relief devices, frangible discs, and fusible elements in mm ; and

        (vii) When practicable, the device must show the manufacturer's name and product number.

        (2)  Connections to pressure relief devices must be of sufficient size to enable the required discharge to pass unrestricted to the safety device. No stop-valve may be installed between the shell and the pressure relief devices except where duplicate devices are provided for maintenance or other reasons and the stop-valves serving the devices actually in use are locked open or the stop-valves are interlocked so that at least one of the devices is always in use. There must be no obstruction in an opening leading to a vent or pressure relief device which might restrict or cut-off the flow from the shell to that device. Vents or pipes from the pressure relief device outlets, when used, must deliver the relieved vapor or liquid to the atmosphere in conditions of minimum back-pressure on the relieving devices.

        (3)  (i) Each pressure relief device inlet must be situated on top of the shell in a position as near the longitudinal and transverse center of the shell as reasonably practicable. All pressure relief device inlets must, under maximum filling conditions, be situated in the vapor space of the shell and the devices must be so arranged as to ensure that any escaping vapor is not restricted in any manner. For flammable hazardous materials, the escaping vapor must be directed away from the shell in such a manner that it cannot impinge upon the shell. For refrigerated liquefied gases, the escaping vapor must be directed away from the tank and in such a manner that it cannot impinge upon the tank. Protective devices which deflect the flow of vapor are permissible provided the required relief-device capacity is not reduced.

        (ii) Provisions must be implemented to prevent unauthorized persons from access to the pressure relief devices and to protect the devices from damage caused by the portable tank overturning.

        (g)  Unless a portable tank is intended to be filled by weight, it must be equipped with one or more gauging devices. Glass level-gauges and gauges made of other fragile material, which are in direct communication with the contents of the tank are prohibited. A connection for a vacuum gauge must be provided in the jacket of a vacuum-insulated portable tank.

        (h)  (1) Portable tanks must be designed and constructed with a support structure to provide a secure base during transport. The forces and safety factors specified in paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section, respectively, must be taken into account in this aspect of the design. Skids, frameworks, cradles or other similar structures are acceptable.

        (2) The combined stresses caused by portable tank mountings (for example, cradles, framework, etc.) and portable tank lifting and tie-down attachments must not cause stress that would damage the shell in a manner that would compromise its lading retention capability. Permanent lifting and tie-down attachments must be fitted to all portable tanks. Preferably they should be fitted to the portable tank supports but may be secured to reinforcing plates located on the shell at the points of support. Each portable tank must be designed so that the center of gravity of the filled tank is approximately centered within the points of attachment for lifting devices.

        (3) In the design of supports and frameworks, the effects of environmental corrosion must be taken into account.

        (4) Forklift pockets must be capable of being closed off. The means of closing forklift pockets must be a permanent part of the framework or permanently attached to the framework. Single compartment portable tanks with a length less than 3.65 m (12 ft.) need not have forklift pockets that are capable of being closed off provided that:

        (i) The shell, including all the fittings, are well protected from being hit by the forklift blades; and

        (ii) The distance between forklift pockets (measured from the center of each pocket) is at least half of the maximum length of the portable tank.

        (5) During transport, portable tanks must be adequately protected against damage to the shell, and service equipment resulting from lateral and longitudinal impact and overturning, or the shell and service equipment must be constructed to withstand the forces resulting from impact or overturning. External fittings must be protected so as to preclude the release of the shell contents upon impact or overturning of the portable tank on its fittings. Examples of protection include:

        (i) Protection against lateral impact which may consist of longitudinal bars protecting the shell on both sides at the level of the median line;

        (ii) Protection of the portable tank against overturning which may consist of reinforcement rings or bars fixed across the frame;

        (iii) Protection against rear impact which may consist of a bumper or frame;

        (iv) Protection of the shell against damage from impact or overturning by use of an ISO frame in accordance with ISO 1496-3 (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter); and

        (v) Protection of the portable tank from impact or damage that may result from overturning by an insulation jacket.

        (i)  (1) Every portable tank must be fitted with a corrosion resistant metal plate permanently attached to the portable tank in a conspicuous place and readily accessible for inspection. When the plate cannot be permanently attached to the shell, the shell must be marked with at least the information required by Section VIII of the ASME Code. At a minimum, the following information must be marked on the plate by stamping or by any other equivalent method:

        (2) The following information must be marked either on the portable tank itself or on a metal plate firmly secured to the portable tank:

        (3) If a portable tank is designed and approved for open seas operations, such as offshore oil exploration, in accordance with the IMDG Code, the words “OFFSHORE PORTABLE TANK” must be marked on the identification plate.

        (j)  The initial inspection and test of a portable tank must include the following:

        (1) A check of the design characteristics.

        (2) An internal and external examination of the portable tank and its fittings, taking into account the hazardous materials to be transported. For UN portable tanks used for refrigerated liquefied gases, a pressure test using an inert gas may be conducted instead of a hydrostatic test. An internal inspection is not required for a portable tank used for the dedicated transportation of refrigerated liquefied gases that are not filled with an inspection opening.

        (3) A pressure test as specified in paragraph (i) of this section.

        (4) A leakage test.

        (5) A test of the satisfactory operation of all service equipment including pressure relief devices must also be performed. When the shell and its fittings have been pressure-tested separately, they must be subjected to a leakage test after reassembly. All welds, subject to full stress level in the shell, must be inspected during the initial test by radiographic, ultrasonic, or another suitable non-destructive test method. This does not apply to the jacket.

        (6) Effective January 1, 2008, each new UN portable tank design type meeting the definition of “container” in the Convention for Safe Containers (CSC) (see 49 CFR 450.3(a)(2)) must be subjected to the dynamic longitudinal impact test prescribed in Part IV, Section 40 of the UN Manual of Tests and Criteria (see IBR, § 171.7 of this subchapter). A UN portable tank design type impact-tested prior to January 1, 2008, in accordance with the requirements of this section in effect on October 1, 2005, need not be retested. UN portable tanks used for the dedicated transportation of “Helium, refrigerated liquid,” UN1963, and “Hydrogen, refrigerated liquid,” UN1966, that are marked “NOT FOR RAIL TRANSPORT” in letters of a minimum height of 10 cm (4 inches) on at least two sides of the portable tank are excepted from the dynamic longitudinal impact test.

        (7) The following tests must be completed on a portable tank or a series of portable tanks designed and constructed to a single design type that is also a CSC container without leakage or deformation that would render the portable tank unsafe for transportation and use:

        (i)  The portable tank loaded to its maximum gross weight must be positioned with its longitudinal axis vertical. It shall be held in this position for five minutes by support at the lower end of the base structure providing vertical and lateral restraint and by support at the upper end of the base structure providing lateral restraint only.

        (ii)  The portable tank loaded to its maximum gross weight must be positioned for five minutes with its transverse axis vertical. It shall be held in this position for five minutes by support at the lower side of the base structure providing vertical and lateral restraint and by support at the upper side of the base structure providing lateral restraint only.

        § 178.275   Specification for UN Portable Tanks intended for the transportation of liquid and solid hazardous materials.

#### § § 178.275

        (a) In addition to the requirements of § 178.274, this section sets forth definitions and requirements that apply to UN portable tanks intended for the transportation of liquid and solid hazardous materials.

        (b) —(1)  means the pressure to be used in calculations required by the recognized pressure vessel code. The design pressure must not be less than the highest of the following pressures:

        (i) The maximum effective gauge pressure allowed in the shell during filling or discharge; or

        (ii) The sum of—

        (A) The absolute vapor pressure (in bar) of the hazardous material at 65 °C, minus 1 bar (149 °F, minus 100 kPa);

        (B) The partial pressure (in bar) of air or other gases in the ullage space, resulting from their compression during filling without pressure relief by a maximum ullage temperature of 65 °C (149 °F) and a liquid expansion due to an increase in mean bulk temperature of 35 °C (95 °F); and

        (C) A head pressure determined on the basis of the forces specified in § 178.274(c) of this subchapter, but not less than 0.35 bar (35 kPa).

        (2)  means a pressure that must not be less than the highest of the following pressures measured at the top of the shell while in operating position:

        (i) The maximum effective gauge pressure allowed in the shell during filling or discharge; or

        (ii) The maximum effective gauge pressure to which the shell is designed which must be not less than the design pressure.

        (c)  (1) In addition to the requirements specified in § 178.274, for service equipment, all openings in the shell, intended for filling or discharging the portable tank must be fitted with a manually operated stop-valve located as close to the shell as reasonably practicable. Other openings, except for openings leading to venting or pressure relief devices, must be equipped with either a stop-valve or another suitable means of closure located as close to the shell as reasonably practicable.

        (2) All portable tanks must be fitted with a manhole or other inspection openings of a suitable size to allow for internal inspection and adequate access for maintenance and repair of the interior. Compartmented portable tanks must have a manhole or other inspection openings for each compartment.

        (3) For insulated portable tanks, top fittings must be surrounded by a spill collection reservoir with suitable drains.

        (4) Piping must be designed, constructed and installed to avoid the risk of damage due to thermal expansion and contraction, mechanical shock and vibration. All piping must be of a suitable metallic material. Welded pipe joints must be used wherever possible.

        (d)  (1) Certain hazardous materials may not be transported in portable tanks with bottom openings. When the applicable T code or portable tank special provision, as referenced for materials in the § 172.101 Table of this subchapter, specifies that bottom openings are prohibited, there must be no openings below the liquid level of the shell when it is filled to its maximum permissible filling limit. When an existing opening is closed, it must be accomplished by internally and externally welding one plate to the shell.

        (2) Bottom discharge outlets for portable tanks carrying certain solid, crystallizable or highly viscous hazardous materials must be equipped with at least two serially fitted and mutually independent shut-off devices. Use of only two shut-off devices is only authorized when this paragraph is referenced in the applicable T Code indicated for each hazardous material in the § 172.101 Table of this subchapter. The design of the equipment must be to the satisfaction of the approval agency and must include:

        (i) An external stop-valve fitted as close to the shell as reasonably practicable; and

        (ii) A liquid tight closure at the end of the discharge pipe, which may be a bolted blank flange or a screw cap.

        (3) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, every bottom discharge outlet must be equipped with three serially fitted and mutually independent shut-off devices. The design of the equipment must include:

        (i) A self-closing internal stop-valve, which is a stop-valve within the shell or within a welded flange or its companion flange, such that:

        (A) The control devices for the operation of the valve are designed to prevent any unintended opening through impact or other inadvertent act;

        (B) The valve is operable from above or below;

        (C) If possible, the setting of the valve (open or closed) must be capable of being verified from the ground;

        (D) Except for portable tanks having a capacity less than 1,000 liters (264.2 gallons), it must be possible to close the valve from an accessible position on the portable tank that is remote from the valve itself within 30 seconds of actuation; and

        (E) The valve must continue to be effective in the event of damage to the external device for controlling the operation of the valve;

        (ii) An external stop-valve fitted as close to the shell as reasonably practicable;

        (iii) A liquid tight closure at the end of the discharge pipe, which may be a bolted blank flange or a screw cap; and

        (iv) For UN portable tanks, with bottom outlets, used for the transportation of liquid hazardous materials that are Class 3, PG I or II, or PG III with a flash point of less than 100 °F (38 °C); Division 5.1, PG I or II; or Division 6.1, PG I or II, the remote means of closure must be capable of thermal activation. The thermal means of activation must activate at a temperature of not more than 250 °F (121 °C).

        (e)  All portable tanks must be fitted with at least one pressure relief device. All relief devices must be designed, constructed and marked in accordance with the requirements of this subchapter.

        (f)  (1) A shell which is to be equipped with a vacuum-relief device must be designed to withstand, without permanent deformation, an external pressure of not less than 0.21 bar (21.0 kPa). The vacuum-relief device must be set to relieve at a vacuum setting not greater than −0.21 bar (−21.0 kPa) unless the shell is designed for a higher external over pressure, in which case the vacuum-relief pressure of the device to be fitted must not be greater than the tank design vacuum pressure. A shell that is not fitted with a vacuum-relief device must be designed to withstand, without permanent deformation, an external pressure of not less than 0.4 bar (40.0 kPa).

        (2) Vacuum-relief devices used on portable tanks intended for the transportation of hazardous materials meeting the criteria of Class 3, including elevated temperature hazardous materials transported at or above their flash point, must prevent the immediate passage of flame into the shell or the portable tank must have a shell capable of withstanding, without leakage, an internal explosion resulting from the passage of flame into the shell.

        (g)  (1) Each portable tank with a capacity not less than 1,900 liters (501.9 gallons) and every independent compartment of a portable tank with a similar capacity, must be provided with one or more pressure relief devices of the reclosing type. Such portable tanks may, in addition, have a frangible disc or fusible element in parallel with the reclosing devices, except when the applicable T code assigned to a hazardous material requires that the frangible disc precede the pressure relief device, according to paragraph (g)(3) of this section, or when no bottom openings are allowed. The pressure relief devices must have sufficient capacity to prevent rupture of the shell due to over pressurization or vacuum resulting from filling, discharging, heating of the contents or fire.

        (2) Pressure relief devices must be designed to prevent the entry of foreign matter, the leakage of liquid and the development of any dangerous excess pressure.

        (3) When required for certain hazardous materials by the applicable T code or portable tank special provision specified for a hazardous material in the § 172.101 Table of this subchapter, portable tanks must have a pressure relief device consistent with the requirements of this subchapter. Except for a portable tank in dedicated service that is fitted with an approved relief device constructed of materials compatible with the hazardous material, the relief device system must include a frangible disc preceding (such as, between the lading and the reclosing pressure relief device) a reclosing pressure relief device. A pressure gauge or suitable tell-tale indicator for the detection of disc rupture, pin-holing or leakage must be provided in the space between the frangible disc and the pressure relief device to allow the portable tank operator to check to determine if the disc is leak free. The frangible disc must rupture at a nominal pressure 10% above the start-to-discharge pressure of the reclosable pressure relief device.

        (4) Every portable tank with a capacity less than 1,900 liters (501.9 gallons) must be fitted with a pressure relief device which, except as provided in paragraph (g)(3) of this section, may be a frangible disc when this disc is set to rupture at a nominal pressure equal to the test pressure at any temperature within the design temperature range.

        (5) When the shell is fitted for pressure discharge, a suitable pressure relief device must provide the inlet line to the portable tank and set to operate at a pressure not higher than the MAWP of the shell, and a stop-valve must be fitted as close to the shell as practicable to minimize the potential for damage.

        (6)  (i) Pressure relief devices must operate only in conditions of excessive rise in temperature. The shell must not be subject to undue fluctuations of pressure during normal conditions of transportation.

        (ii) The required pressure relief device must be set to start to discharge at a nominal pressure of five-sixths of the test pressure for shells having a test pressure of not more than 4.5 bar (450 kPa) and 110% of two-thirds of the test pressure for shells having a test pressure of more than 4.5 bar (450 kPa). A self-closing relief device must close at a pressure not more than 10% below the pressure at which the discharge starts. The device must remain closed at all lower pressures. This requirement does not prevent the use of vacuum-relief or combination pressure relief and vacuum-relief devices.

        (h)  Fusible elements must operate at a temperature between 110 °C (230 °F) and 149 °C (300.2 °F), provided that the pressure in the shell at the fusing temperature will not exceed the test pressure. They must be placed at the top of the shell with their inlets in the vapor space and in no case may they be shielded from external heat. Fusible elements must not be utilized on portable tanks with a test pressure which exceeds 2.65 bar (265.0 kPa); however, fusible elements are authorized on portable tanks for the transportation of certain organometallic materials in accordance with § 172.102, special provision TP36 of this subchapter. Fusible elements used on portable tanks intended for the transport of elevated temperature hazardous materials must be designed to operate at a temperature higher than the maximum temperature that will be experienced during transport and must be designed to the satisfaction of the approval agency.

        (i)  (1) The reclosing pressure relief device required by paragraph (g)(1) of this section must have a minimum cross sectional flow area equivalent to an orifice of 31.75 mm (1.3 inches) diameter. Vacuum-relief devices, when used, must have a cross sectional flow area not less than 284 mm   (11.2 inches  ).

        (2) The combined delivery capacity of the pressure relief system (taking into account the reduction of the flow when the portable tank is fitted with frangible-discs preceding spring-loaded pressure-relief devices or when the spring-loaded pressure-relief devices are provided with a device to prevent the passage of the flame), in condition of complete fire engulfment of the portable tank must be sufficient to limit the pressure in the shell to 20% above the start to discharge pressure limiting device (pressure relief device). The total required capacity of the relief devices may be determined using the formula in paragraph (i)(2)(i)(A) of this section or the table in paragraph (i)(2)(iii) of this section.

        (i)(A) To determine the total required capacity of the relief devices, which must be regarded as being the sum of the individual capacities of all the contributing devices, the following formula must be used:

        (B) The constant C, as shown in the formula in paragraph (i)(2)(i)(A) of this section, is derived from one of the following formulas as a function of the ratio k of specific heats:

        (C) When k >1:

        (D) When k = 1 or k is unknown, a value of 0.607 may be used for the constant C. C may also be taken from the following table:

        (ii) As an alternative to the formula in paragraph (i)(2)(i)(A) of this section, relief devices for shells used for transporting liquids may be sized in accordance with the table in paragraph (i)(2)(iii) of this section. The table in paragraph (i)(2)(iii) of this section assumes an insulation value of F = 1 and must be adjusted accordingly when the shell is insulated. Other values used in determining the table in paragraph (i)(2)(iii) of this section are: L = 334.94 kJ/kg; M = 86.7; T = 394 °K; Z = 1; and C = 0.607.

        (iii) Minimum emergency vent capacity, Q, in cubic meters of air per second at 1 bar and 0 °C (273 °K) shown in the following table:

        (iv) Insulation systems, used for the purpose of reducing venting capacity, must be specifically approved by the approval agency. In all cases, insulation systems approved for this purpose must—

        (A) Remain effective at all temperatures up to 649 °C (1200 °F); and

        (B) Be jacketed with a material having a melting point of 700 °C (1292 °F) or greater.

        (b)  (1) Shells must be of seamless or welded steel construction, or combination of both, and have a water capacity greater than 450 liters (118.9 gallons). Shells must be designed, constructed, certified and stamped in accordance with the ASME Code, Section VIII.

        (2) Portable tanks must be postweld heat-treated and radiographed as prescribed in Section VIII of the ASME Code, except that each portable tank constructed in accordance with part UHT of the ASME Code must be postweld heat-treated. Where postweld heat treatment is required, the portable tank must be treated as a unit after completion of all the welds in and/or to the shell and heads. The method must be as prescribed in the ASME Code. Welded attachments to pads may be made after postweld heat treatment is made. A portable tank used for anhydrous ammonia must be postweld heat-treated. The postweld heat treatment must be as prescribed in the ASME Code, but in no event at less than 1050 °F tank metal temperature. Additionally, portable tanks constructed in accordance with part UHT of the ASME Code must conform to the following requirements:

The minimum impact required for full-sized specimens shall be 20 foot-pounds (or 10 foot-pounds for half-sized specimens) at 0 °F (−17.8 °F) Charpy V-Notch in both the longitudinal and transverse direction. If the lot test does not pass this requirement, individual plates may be accepted if they individually meet this impact requirement.

        (3) When the shells intended for the transportation of non-refrigerated liquefied compressed gases are equipped with thermal insulation, a device must be provided to prevent any dangerous pressure from developing in the insulating layer in the event of a leak, when the protective covering is closed it must be gas tight. The thermal insulation must not inhibit access to the fittings and discharge devices. In addition, the thermal insulation systems must satisfy the following requirements:

        (2) When a portable tank is fitted with an excess flow valve, the excess flow valve must be so fitted that its seating is inside the shell or inside a welded flange or, when fitted externally, its mountings must be designed so that in the event of impact it maintains its effectiveness. The excess flow valves must be selected and fitted so as to close automatically when the rated flow, specified by the manufacturer, is reached. Connections and accessories leading to or from such a valve must have a capacity for a flow more than the excess flow valve's rated flow.

        (3) For filling and discharge openings that are located below the liquid level, the first shut-off device must be an internal stop-valve and the second must be a stop-valve placed in an accessible position on each discharge and filling pipe.

        (4) For filling and discharge openings located below the liquid level of portable tanks intended for the transportation of flammable and/or toxic liquefied compressed gases, the internal stop-valve must be a self-closing safety device that fully closes automatically during filling or discharge in the event of fire engulfment. The device shall fully close within 30 seconds of actuation and the thermal means of closure must actuate at a temperature of not more than 121 °C (250 °F). Except for portable tanks having a capacity less than 1,000 liters (264.2 gallons), this device must be operable by remote control.

        (5) In addition to filling, discharge and gas pressure equalizing orifices, shells may have openings in which gauges, thermometers and manometers can be fitted. Connections for such instruments must be made by suitable welded nozzles or pockets and may not be connected by screwed connections through the shell.

        (6) All portable tanks must be fitted with manholes or other inspection openings of suitable size to allow for internal inspection and adequate access for maintenance and repair of the interior.

        (7)  The inlet and discharge outlets on portable tanks used to transport chlorine must meet the requirements of § 178.337-1(c)(2) and must be fitted with an internal excess flow valve. In addition to the internal excess flow valve, the inlet and discharge outlets must be equipped with an external stop valve (angle valve). Excess flow valves must conform to the standards of The Chlorine Institute, Inc. (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter) as follows:

        (i) A valve conforming to Drawing 101-7, dated July 1993, must be installed under each liquid angle valve.

        (ii) A valve conforming to Drawing 106-6, dated July 1993, must be installed under each gas angle valve. For portable tanks used to transport non-refrigerated liquefied gases.

        (8) External fittings must be grouped together as close as reasonably practicable. The following openings may be installed at locations other than on the top or end of the tank:

        (i) The openings for liquid level gauging devices, pressure gauges, or for safety devices, may be installed separately at the other location or in the side of the shell;

        (ii) One plugged opening of 2-inch National Pipe Thread or less provided for maintenance purposes may be located elsewhere;

        (iii) An opening of 3-inch National Pipe Size or less may be provided at another location, when necessary, to facilitate installation of condensing coils.

        (9) Filling and discharge connections are not required to be grouped and may be installed below the normal liquid level of the tank if:

        (i) The portable tank is permanently mounted in a full framework for containerized transport;

        (ii) For each portable tank design, a prototype portable tank, meets the requirements of parts 450 through 453 of this title for compliance with the requirements of Annex II of the International Convention for Safe Containers; and

        (iii) Each filling and discharge outlet meets the requirements of paragraph (c)(4) of this section.

        (d)  Bottom openings are prohibited on portable tanks when the UN Portable Tank Table for Liquefied Compressed Gases in § 173.313 of this subchapter indicates that bottom openings are not allowed. In this case, there may be no openings located below the liquid level of the shell when it is filled to its maximum permissible filling limit.

        (e)  (1) Portable tanks must be provided with one or more reclosing pressure relief devices. The pressure relief devices must open automatically at a pressure not less than the MAWP and be fully open at a pressure equal to 110% of the MAWP. These devices must, after discharge, close at a pressure not less than 10% below the pressure at which discharge starts and must remain closed at all lower pressures. The pressure relief devices must be of a type that will resist dynamic forces including liquid surge. A frangible disc may only be used in series with a reclosing pressure relief device.

        (2) Pressure relief devices must be designed to prevent the entry of foreign matter, the leakage of gas and the development of any dangerous excess pressure.

        (3) A portable tank intended for the transportation of certain liquefied compressed gases identified in the UN Portable Tank Table for Liquefied Compressed Gases in § 173.313 of this subchapter must have a pressure relief device which conforms to the requirements of this subchapter. Unless a portable tank, in dedicated service, is fitted with a relief device constructed of materials compatible with the hazardous material, the relief device must be comprised of a frangible disc preceded by a reclosing device. The space between the frangible disc and the device must be provided with a pressure gauge or a suitable tell-tale indicator. This arrangement must facilitate the detection of disc rupture, pinholing or leakage which could cause a malfunction of the pressure relief device. The frangible disc must rupture at a nominal pressure 10% above the start-to-discharge pressure of the relief device.

        (4) In the case of portable tanks used for more than one gas, the pressure relief devices must open at a pressure indicated in paragraph (e)(1) of this section for the gas having the highest maximum allowable pressure of the gases allowed to be transported in the portable tank.

        (f)  The combined delivery capacity of the relief devices must be sufficient so that, in the event of total fire engulfment, the pressure inside the shell cannot exceed 120% of the MAWP. Reclosing relief devices must be used to achieve the full relief capacity prescribed. In the case of portable tanks used for more than gas, the combined delivery capacity of the pressure relief devices must be taken for the liquefied compressed gas which requires the highest delivery capacity of the liquefied compressed gases allowed to be transported in the portable tank. The total required capacity of the relief devices must be determined according to the requirements in § 178.275(i). These requirements apply only to liquefied compressed gases which have critical temperatures well above the temperature at the accumulating condition. For gases that have critical temperatures near or below the temperature at the accumulating condition, the calculation of the pressure relief device delivery capacity must consider the additional thermodynamic properties of the gas, for example see CGA S-1.2 (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter).

        § 178.277   Requirements for the design, construction, inspection and testing of portable tanks intended for the transportation of refrigerated liquefied gases.

#### § § 178.277

        (a) In addition to the requirements of § 178.274 applicable to UN portable tanks, the following requirements and definitions apply to UN portable tanks used for refrigerated liquefied gases:

        For the purpose of this section the term “design pressure” is consistent with the definition for design pressure in the ASME Code, Section VIII (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter).

        is the time, as determined by testing, that will elapse from loading until the pressure of the contents, under equilibrium conditions, reaches the lowest set pressure of the pressure limiting device(s) (for example, pressure control valve or pressure relief device). _Holding time_ must be determined as specified in § 178.338-9.

        means the maximum effective gauge pressure permissible at the top of the shell of a loaded portable tank in its operating position including the highest effective pressure during filling and discharge;

        means the temperature which is used for the design and construction of the shell not higher than the lowest (coldest) service temperature of the contents during normal conditions of filling, discharge and transportation.

        means the part of the portable tank which retains the refrigerated liquefied gas intended for transport, including openings and their closures, but does not include service equipment or external structural equipment.

        means a construction which normally consists of either:

        (1) A jacket and one or more inner shells where the space between the shell(s) and the jacket is exhausted of air (vacuum insulation) and may incorporate a thermal insulation system; or

        (2) A jacket and an inner shell with an intermediate layer of solid thermally insulating material (for example, solid foam).

        (b)  (1) Portable tanks must be of seamless or welded steel construction and have a water capacity of more than 450 liters (118.9 gallons). Portable tanks must be designed, constructed, certified and stamped in accordance with Section VIII of the ASME Code.

        (2) Portable tanks must be postweld heat treated and radiographed as prescribed in Sections V and VIII of the ASME Code except that each tank constructed in accordance with part UHT in Section VIII of the ASME Code must be postweld heat treated. Where postweld heat treatment is required, the tank must be treated as a unit after completion of all the welds to the shell and heads. The method must be as prescribed in the ASME Code. Welded attachments to pads may be made after postweld heat treatment is made. The postweld heat treatment must be as prescribed in Section VIII of the ASME Code, but in no event at less than 1,050 °F tank metal temperature.

        (3) Welding procedure and welder performance tests must be made annually in accordance with Section IX of the ASME Code (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter). In addition to the essential variables named in the ASME Code, the following must be considered as essential variables: number of passes, thickness of plate, heat input per pass, and the specified rod and flux. The number of passes, thickness of plate and heat input per pass may not vary more than 25% from the procedure qualification. Records of the qualification must be retained for at least 5 years by the portable tank manufacturer and made available to the approval agency and the owner of the portable tank as specified in § 178.273.

        (4) Shells and jackets must be made of metallic materials suitable for forming. Jackets must be made of steel. Non-metallic materials may be used for the attachments and supports between the shell and jacket, provided their material properties at the minimum design temperature are proven to be sufficient. In choosing the material, the minimum design temperature must be taken into account with respect to risk of brittle fracture, to hydrogen embrittlement, to stress corrosion cracking and to resistance to impact.

        (5) Any part of a portable tank, including fittings, gaskets and pipe-work, which can be expected normally to come into contact with the refrigerated liquefied gas transported must be compatible with that refrigerated liquefied gas.

        (6) The thermal insulation system must include a complete covering of the shell with effective insulating materials. External insulation must be protected by a jacket so as to prevent the ingress of moisture and other damage under normal transport conditions.

        (7) When a jacket is so closed as to be gas-tight, a device must be provided to prevent any dangerous pressure from developing in the insulation space.

        (8) Materials which may react with oxygen or oxygen enriched atmospheres in a dangerous manner may not be used in portable tanks intended for the transport of refrigerated liquefied gases having a boiling point below minus 182 °C at atmospheric pressure in locations with the thermal insulation where there is a risk of contact with oxygen or with oxygen enriched fluid.

        (9) Insulating materials must not deteriorate to an extent that the effectiveness of the insulation system, as determined in accordance with paragraph (b)(11) of this section, would be reduced in service.

        (10) A reference holding time must be determined for each refrigerated liquefied gas intended for transport in a portable tank. The reference holding time must be determined by testing in accordance with the requirements of § 178.338-9, considering the following factors:

        (i) The effectiveness of the insulation system, determined in accordance with paragraph (b)(11) of this section;

        (ii) The lowest set pressure of the pressure limiting device;

        (iii) The initial filling conditions;

        (iv) An assumed ambient temperature of 30 °C (86 °F);

        (v) The physical properties of the individual refrigerated liquefied gas intended to be transported.

        (11) The effectiveness of the insulation system (heat influx in watts) may be determined by type testing the portable tank in accordance with a procedure specified in § 178.338-9(c) or by using the holding time test in § 178.338-9(b). This test must consist of either:

        (i) A constant pressure test (for example, at atmospheric pressure) when the loss of refrigerated liquefied gas is measured over a period of time; or

        (ii) A closed system test when the rise in pressure in the shell is measured over a period of time.

        (12) When performing the constant pressure test, variations in atmospheric pressure must be taken into account. When performing either test, corrections must be made for any variation of the ambient temperature from the assumed ambient temperature reference value of 30 °C (86 °F).

        (13) The jacket of a vacuum-insulated double-wall tank must have either an external design pressure not less than 100 kPa (1 bar) gauge pressure calculated in accordance with Section VIII of the ASME Code or a calculated critical collapsing pressure of not less than 200 kPa (2 bar) gauge pressure. Internal and external reinforcements may be included in calculating the ability of the jacket to resist the external pressure.

        (c)  For shells with vacuum insulation, the test pressure must not be less than 1.3 times the sum of the MAWP and 100 kPa (1 bar). In no case may the test pressure be less than 300 kPa (3 bar) gauge pressure.

        (d)  (1) Each filling and discharge opening in portable tanks used for the transport of flammable refrigerated liquefied gases must be fitted with at least three mutually independent shut-off devices in series: the first being a stop-valve situated as close as reasonably practicable to the jacket, the second being a stop-valve and the third being a blank flange or equivalent device. The shut-off device closest to the jacket must be a self-closing device, which is capable of being closed from an accessible position on the portable tank that is remote from the valve within 30 seconds of actuation. This device must actuate at a temperature of not more than 121 °C (250 °F).

        (2) Each filling and discharge opening in portable tanks used for the transport of non-flammable refrigerated liquefied gases must be fitted with at least two mutually independent shut-off devices in series: the first being a stop-valve situated as close as reasonably practicable to the jacket and the second a blank flange or equivalent device.

        (3) For sections of piping which can be closed at both ends and where liquid product can be trapped, a method of automatic pressure relief must be provided to prevent excess pressure build-up within the piping.

        (4) Each filling and discharge opening on a portable tank must be clearly marked to indicate its function.

        (5) When pressure-building units are used, the liquid and vapor connections to that unit must be provided with a valve as close to the jacket as reasonably practicable to prevent the loss of contents in case of damage to the pressure-building unit. A check valve may be used for this purpose if it is located on the vapor side of the pressure build-up coil.

        (6) The materials of construction of valves and accessories must have satisfactory properties at the lowest operating temperature of the portable tank.

        (7) Vacuum insulated portable tanks are not required to have an inspection opening.

        (e)  (1) Every shell must be provided with not less than two independent reclosing pressure relief devices. The pressure relief devices must open automatically at a pressure not less than the MAWP and be fully open at a pressure equal to 110% of the MAWP. These devices must, after discharge, close at a pressure not lower than 10% below the pressure at which discharge starts and must remain closed at all lower pressures. The pressure relief devices must be of the type that will resist dynamic forces including surge.

        (2) Except for portable tanks used for oxygen, portable tanks for non-flammable refrigerated liquefied gases (except oxygen) and hydrogen may in addition have frangible discs in parallel with the reclosing devices as specified in paragraphs (e)(4)(ii) and (e)(4)(iii) of this section.

        (3) Pressure relief devices must be designed to prevent the entry of foreign matter, the leakage of gas and the development of any dangerous excess pressure.

        (4)  (i) In the case of the loss of vacuum in a vacuum-insulated tank or of loss of 20% of the insulation of a portable tank insulated with solid materials, the combined capacity of all pressure relief devices installed must be sufficient so that the pressure (including accumulation) inside the shell does not exceed 120% of the MAWP.

        (ii) For non-flammable refrigerated liquefied gases (except oxygen) and hydrogen, this capacity may be achieved by the use of frangible discs in parallel with the required safety-relief devices. Frangible discs must rupture at nominal pressure equal to the test pressure of the shell.

        (iii) Under the circumstances described in paragraphs (e)(4)(i) and (e)(4)(ii) of this section, together with complete fire engulfment, the combined capacity of all pressure relief devices installed must be sufficient to limit the pressure in the shell to the test pressure.

        (iv) The required capacity of the relief devices must be calculated in accordance with CGA Pamphlet S-1.2 (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter).

        (B) The vertical shear stress generated by an extreme vertical accelerative force equal to 0.7 times the vertical reaction at the suspension assembly of a trailer, and the horizontal pivot of the upper coupler (fifth wheel) or turntable; or anchoring and support members of a truck, as applicable. The vertical reaction must be calculated based on the static weight of the fully loaded cargo tank motor vehicle, all structural elements, equipment and appurtenances supported by the cargo tank wall;

        (C) The lateral shear stress generated by an extreme lateral accelerative force equal to 0.4 times the vertical reaction at the suspension assembly of a trailer, applied at the road surface, and as transmitted to the cargo tank wall through the suspension assembly of a trailer, and the horizontal pivot of the upper coupler (fifth wheel) or turntable; or anchoring and support members of a truck, as applicable. The vertical reaction must be calculated based on the static weight of the fully loaded cargo tank motor vehicle, all structural elements, equipment and appurtenances supported by the cargo tank wall; and

        (D) The torsional shear stress generated by the same lateral forces as described in paragraph (c)(2)(iv)(C) of this section.

        (d) In order to account for stresses due to impact in an accident, the design calculations for the cargo tank shell and heads must include the load resulting from the design pressure in combination with the dynamic pressure resulting from a longitudinal deceleration of “2g”. For this loading condition the stress value used may not exceed the lesser of the yield strength or 75 percent of the ultimate tensile strength of the material of construction. For cargo tanks constructed of stainless steel the maximum design stress may not exceed 75 percent of the ultimate tensile strength of the type steel used.

        (e) The minimum metal thickness for the shell and heads on tanks with a design pressure of 100 psig or more must be 4.75 mm (0.187 inch) for steel and 6.86 mm (0.270 inch) for aluminum, except for chlorine and sulfur dioxide tanks. In all cases, the minimum thickness of the tank shell and head shall be determined using structural design requirements in Section VIII of the ASME Code or 25% of the tensile strength of the material used. For a cargo tank used in chlorine or sulfur dioxide service, the cargo tank must be made of steel. A corrosion allowance of 20 percent or 2.54 mm (0.10 inch), whichever is less, must be added to the thickness otherwise required for sulfur dioxide and chlorine tank material. In chlorine cargo tanks, the wall thickness must be at least 1.59 cm (0.625 inch), including corrosion allowance.

        (f) Where a cargo tank support is attached to any part of the cargo tank wall, the stresses imposed on the cargo tank wall must meet the requirements in paragraph (a) of this section.

        (g) The design, construction, and installation of an attachment, appurtenance to the cargo tank, structural support member between the cargo tank and the vehicle or suspension component, or accident protection device must conform to the following requirements:

        (1) Structural members, the suspension sub-frame, accident protection structures, and external circumferential reinforcement devices must be used as sites for attachment of appurtenances and other accessories to the cargo tank, when practicable.

        (2) A lightweight attachment to the cargo tank wall such as a conduit clip, brake line clip, skirting structure, lamp mounting bracket, or placard holder must be of a construction having lesser strength than the cargo tank wall materials and may not be more than 72 percent of the thickness of the material to which it is attached. The lightweight attachment may be secured directly to the cargo tank wall if the device is designed and installed in such a manner that, if damaged, it will not affect the lading retention integrity of the tank. A lightweight attachment must be secured to the cargo tank shell or head by a continuous weld or in such a manner as to preclude formation of pockets which may become sites for corrosion. Attachments meeting the requirements of this paragraph are not authorized for cargo tanks constructed under part UHT in Section VIII of the ASME Code.

        (3) Except as prescribed in paragraphs (g)(1) and (g)(2) of this section, the welding of any appurtenance to the cargo tank wall must be made by attachment of a mounting pad so that there will be no adverse effect upon the lading retention integrity of the cargo tank if any force less than that prescribed in paragraph (b)(1) of this section is applied from any direction. The thickness of the mounting pad may not be less than that of the shell wall or head wall to which it is attached, and not more than 1.5 times the shell or head thickness. However, a pad with a minimum thickness of 0.25 inch may be used when the shell or head thickness is over 0.25 inch. If weep holes or tell-tale holes are used, the pad must be drilled or punched at the lowest point before it is welded to the tank. Each pad must—

        (i) Be fabricated from material determined to be suitable for welding to both the cargo tank material and the material of the appurtenance or structural support member; a Design Certifying Engineer must make this determination considering chemical and physical properties of the materials and must specify filler material conforming to the requirements in Section VIII of the ASME Code (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter).

        (ii) Be preformed to an inside radius no greater than the outside radius of the cargo tank at the attachment location.

        (iii) Extend at least 2 inches in each direction from any point of attachment of an appurtenance or structural support member. This dimension may be measured from the center of the attached structural member.

        (iv) Have rounded corners, or otherwise be shaped in a manner to minimize stress concentrations on the shell or head.

        (v) Be attached by continuous fillet welding. Any fillet weld discontinuity may only be for the purpose of preventing an intersection between the fillet weld and a tank or jacket seam weld.

        (a)  The requirements in this paragraph (a) apply to MC 331 cargo tanks except for those used to transport chlorine. The requirements for inlets and outlets on chlorine cargo tanks are in paragraph (b) of this section.

        (1) An opening must be provided on each cargo tank used for the transportation of liquefied materials to permit complete drainage.

        (2) Except for gauging devices, thermometer wells, pressure relief valves, manhole openings, product inlet openings, and product discharge openings, each opening in a cargo tank must be closed with a plug, cap, or bolted flange.

        (3) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, each product inlet opening, including vapor return lines, must be fitted with a back flow check valve or an internal self-closing stop valve located inside the cargo tank or inside a welded nozzle that is an integral part of the cargo tank. The valve seat must be located inside the cargo tank or within 2.54 cm (one inch) of the external face of the welded flange. Damage to parts exterior to the cargo tank or mating flange must not prevent effective seating of the valve. All parts of a valve inside a cargo tank or welded flange must be made of material that will not corrode or deteriorate in the presence of the lading.

        (4) Except as provided in paragraphs (a)(5), (b), and (c) of this section, each liquid or vapor discharge outlet must be fitted with a primary discharge control system as defined in § 178.337-1(g). Thermal remote operators must activate at a temperature of 121.11 °C (250 °F) or less. Linkages between closures and remote operators must be corrosion resistant and effective in all types of environmental conditions incident to discharging of product.

        (i) On a cargo tank over 13,247.5 L (3,500 gallons) water capacity, thermal and mechanical means of remote closure must be installed at the ends of the cargo tank in at least two diagonally opposite locations. If the loading/unloading connection at the cargo tank is not in the general vicinity of one of the two locations specified in the first sentence of this paragraph (a)(4)(i), additional means of thermal remote closure must be installed so that heat from a fire in the loading/unloading connection area or the discharge pump will activate the primary discharge control system. The loading/unloading connection area is where hoses or hose reels are connected to the permanent metal piping.

        (ii) On a cargo tank of 13,247.5 L (3,500 gallons) water capacity or less, a thermal means of remote closure must be installed at or near the internal self-closing stop valve. A mechanical means of remote closure must be installed on the end of the cargo tank furthest away from the loading/unloading connection area.

Damage to parts exterior to the cargo tank or mating flange must not prevent effective seating of the valve.

        (5) A primary discharge control system is not required on the following:

        (i) A vapor or liquid discharge opening of less than 1  NPT equipped with an excess flow valve together with a manually operated external stop valve in place of an internal self-closing stop valve.

        (ii) An engine fuel line on a truck-mounted cargo tank of not more than   NPT equipped with a valve having an integral excess flow valve or excess flow feature.

        (iii) A cargo tank motor vehicle used to transport refrigerated liquids such as argon, carbon dioxide, helium, krypton, neon, nitrogen, and xenon, or mixtures thereof.

        (6) In addition to the internal self-closing stop valve, each filling and discharge line must be fitted with a stop valve located in the line between the internal self-closing stop valve and the hose connection. A back flow check valve or excess flow valve may not be used to satisfy this requirement.

        (7) An excess flow valve may be designed with a bypass, not to exceed a 0.1016 centimeter (0.040 inch) diameter opening, to allow equalization of pressure.

        (b)  The inlet and discharge outlets on a cargo tank used to transport chlorine must meet the requirements of § 178.337-1(c)(2) and must be fitted with an internal excess flow valve. In addition to the internal excess flow valve, the inlet and discharge outlets must be equipped with an external stop valve (angle valve). Excess flow valves must conform to the standards of The Chlorine Institute, Inc., as follows:

        (1) A valve conforming to The Chlorine Institute, Inc., Dwg. 101-7 (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter), must be installed under each liquid angle valve.

        (2) A valve conforming to The Chlorine Institute, Inc., Dwg. 106-6 (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter), must be installed under each gas angle valve.

        § 178.338-3   Structural integrity.

#### § § 178.338-3

        (a)  (1) Except as permitted in paragraph (d) of this section, the maximum calculated design stress at any point in the tank may not exceed the lesser of the maximum allowable stress value prescribed in Section VIII of the ASME Code (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter), or 25 percent of the tensile strength of the material used.

        (2) The relevant physical properties of the materials used in each tank may be established either by a certified test report from the material manufacturer or by testing in conformance with a recognized national standard. In either case, the ultimate tensile strength of the material used in the design may not exceed 120 percent of the minimum ultimate tensile strength specified in either the ASME Code or the ASTM standard to which the material is manufactured.

        (3) The maximum design stress at any point in the tank must be calculated separately for the loading conditions described in paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section. Alternate test or analytical methods, or a combination thereof, may be used in lieu of the procedures described in paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section, if the methods are accurate and verifiable.

        (4) Corrosion allowance material may not be included to satisfy any of the design calculation requirements of this section.

        (b)  (1) The static design and construction of each tank must be in accordance with appendix G in Section VIII of the ASME Code (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter). The tank design must include calculation of stress due to the design pressure, the weight of lading, the weight of structures supported by the tank wall, and the effect of temperature gradients resulting from lading and ambient temperature extremes. When dissimilar materials are used, their thermal coefficients must be used in calculation of the thermal stresses.

        (2) Stress concentrations in tension, bending, and torsion which occur at pads, cradles, or other supports must be considered in accordance with appendix G in Section VIII of the ASME Code.

        (c) Stresses resulting from static and dynamic loadings, or a combination thereof, are not uniform throughout the cargo tank motor vehicle. The following is a simplified procedure for calculating the effective stress in the tank resulting from static and dynamic loadings. The effective stress (the maximum principal stress at any point) must be determined by the following formula:

        (1) S = effective stress at any given point under the most severe combination of static and dynamic loadings that can occur at the same time, in psi.

        (2) S = circumferential stress generated b*y* internal and external pressure when applicable, in psi.

        (3) S = the net longitudinal stress, in psi, generated by the following loading conditions:

        (i) The longitudinal tensile stress generated by internal pressure;

        (ii) The tensile or compressive stress generated by the axial load resulting from a decelerative force applied independently to each suspension assembly at the road surface using applicable static loadings specified in § 178.338-13 (b);

        (iii) The tensile or compressive stress generated by the bending moment resulting from a decelerative force applied independently to each suspension assembly at the road surface using applicable static loadings specified in § 178.338-13 (b);

        (iv) The tensile or compressive stress generated by the axial load resulting from an accelerative force applied to the horizontal pivot of the fifth wheel supporting the vehicle using applicable static loadings specified in § 178.338-13 (b);

        (v) The tensile or compressive stress generated by the bending moment resulting from an accelerative force applied to the horizontal pivot of the fifth wheel supporting the vehicle using applicable static loadings specified in § 178.338-13 (b); and

        (vi) The tensile or compressive stress generated by a bending moment produced by a vertical force using applicable static loadings specified in § 178.338-13 (b).

        (4) S = The following *s*hear stresses that apply, in psi,: The vectorial sum of the applicable shear stresses in the plane under consideration, including direct shear generated by the static vertical loading; direct lateral and torsional shear generated by a lateral accelerative force applied at the road surface, using applicable static loads specified in § 178.338-13 (b)

        (d) In order to account for stresses due to impact in an accident, the design calculations for the tank shell and heads must include the load resulting from the design pressure in combination with the dynamic pressure resulting from a longitudinal deceleration of “2g”. For this loading condition the stress value used may not exceed the lesser of the yield strength or 75 percent of the ultimate tensile strength of the material of construction. For a cargo tank constructed of stainless steel, the maximum design stress may not exceed 75 percent of the ultimate tensile strength of the type steel used.

        (e) The minimum thickness of the shell or heads of the tank must be 0.187 inch for steel and 0.270 inch for aluminum. However, the minimum thickness for steel may be 0.110 inches provided the cargo tank is:

        (1) Vacuum insulated, or

        (2) Double walled with a load bearing jacket designed to carry a proportionate amount of structural loads prescribed in this section.

        (f) Where a tank support is attached to any part of the tank wall, the stresses imposed on the tank wall must meet the requirements in paragraph (a) of this section.

        (g) The design, construction and installation of an attachment, appurtenance to the cargo tank or structural support member between the cargo tank and the vehicle or suspension component or accident protection device must conform to the following requirements:

        (1) Structural members, the suspension subframe, accident protection structures and external circumferential reinforcement devices must be used as sites for attachment of appurtenances and other accessories to the cargo tank, when practicable.

        (2) A lightweight attachment to the cargo tank wall such as a conduit clip, brakeline clip, skirting structure, lamp mounting bracket, or placard holder must be of a construction having lesser strength than the cargo tank wall materials and may not be more than 72 percent of the thickness of the material to which it is attached. The lightweight attachment may be secured directly to the cargo tank wall if the device is designed and installed in such a manner that, if damaged, it will not affect the lading retention integrity of the tank. A lightweight attachment must be secured to the cargo tank shell or head by a continuous weld or in such a manner as to preclude formation of pockets that may become sites for corrosion. Attachments meeting the requirements of this paragraph are not authorized for cargo tanks constructed under part UHT in Section VIII of the ASME Code.

        (3) Except as prescribed in paragraphs (g)(1) and (g)(2) of this section, the welding of any appurtenance the cargo tank wall must be made by attachment of a mounting pad so that there will be no adverse effect upon the lading retention integrity of the cargo tank if any force less than that prescribed in paragraph (b)(1) of this section is applied from any direction. The thickness of the mounting pad may not be less than that of the shell or head to which it is attached, and not more than 1.5 times the shell or head thickness. However, a pad with a minimum thickness of 0.187 inch may be used when the shell or head thickness is over 0.187 inch. If weep holes or tell-tale holes are used, the pad must be drilled or punched at the lowest point before it is welded to the tank. Each pad must:

        (i) Be fabricated from material determined to be suitable for welding to both the cargo tank material and the material of the appurtenance or structural support member; a Design Certifying Engineer must make this determination considering chemical and physical properties of the materials and must specify filler material conforming to the requirements in Section IX of the ASME Code (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter).

        (ii) Be preformed to an inside radius no greater than the outside radius of the cargo tank at the attachment location.

        (iii) Extend at least 2 inches in each direction from any point of attachment of an appurtenance or structural support member. This dimension may be measured from the center of the attached structural member.

        (iv) Have rounded corners, or otherwise be shaped in a manner to minimize stress concentrations on the shell or head.

        (v) Be attached by continuous fillet welding. Any fillet weld discontinuity may only be for the purpose of preventing an intersection between the fillet weld and a tank or jacket seam weld.

This requirement is met when such piping, valves, and fittings have been tested after installation with gas or air and proved leak tight at not less than the design pressure marked on the cargo tank. This requirement is applicable to all hoses used in a cargo tank, except that hose may be tested before or after installation on the tank.

        (6) Each valve must be suitable for the tank design pressure at the tank design service temperature.

        (7) All fittings must be rated for the maximum tank pressure and suitable for the coldest temperature to which they will be subjected in actual service.

        (8) All piping, valves, and fittings must be grouped in the smallest practicable space and protected from damage as required by § 178.338-10.

        (9) When a pressure-building coil is used on a tank designed to handle oxygen or flammable ladings, the vapor connection to that coil must be provided with a valve or check valve as close to the tank shell as practicable to prevent the loss of vapor from the tank in case of damage to the coil. The liquid connection to that coil must also be provided with a valve.

        § 178.338-9   Holding time.

#### § § 178.338-9

        (a) “Holding time” is the time, as determined by testing, that will elapse from loading until the pressure of the contents, under equilibrium conditions, reaches the level of the lowest pressure control valve or pressure relief valve setting.

        (b)  (1) The test to determine holding time must be performed by charging the tank with a cryogenic liquid having a boiling point, at a pressure of one atmosphere, absolute, no lower than the design service temperature of the tank. The tank must be charged to its maximum permitted filling density with that liquid and stabilized to the lowest practical pressure, which must be equal to or less than the pressure to be used for loading. The cargo tank together with its contents must then be exposed to ambient temperature.

        (2) The tank pressure and ambient temperature must be recorded at 3-hour intervals until the pressure level of the contents reaches the set-to-discharge pressure of the pressure control valve or pressure relief valve with the lowest setting. This total time lapse in hours represents the measured holding time at the actual average ambient temperature. This measured holding time for the test cryogenic liquid must be adjusted to an equivalent holding time for each cryogenic liquid that is to be identified on or adjacent to the specification plate, at an average ambient temperature of 85 °F. This is the rated holding time (RHT). The marked rated holding time (MRHT) displayed on or adjacent to the specification plate (see § 178.338-18(c)(10)) may not exceed this RHT.

        (c)  (1) If more than one cargo tank is made to the same design, only one cargo tank must be subjected to the full holding time test at the time of manufacture. However, each subsequent cargo tank made to the same design must be performance tested during its first trip. The holding time determined in this test may not be less than 90 percent of the marked rated holding time. This test must be performed in accordance with §§ 173.318(g)(3) and 177.840(h) of this subchapter, regardless of the classification of the cryogenic liquid.

        (2)  The term “same design” as used in this section means cargo tanks made to the same design type. See § 178.320(a) for definition of “design type”.

        (3) For a cargo tank used in nonflammable cryogenic liquid service, in place of the holding time tests prescribed in paragraph (b) of this section, the marked rated holding time (MRHT) may be determined as follows:

        (i) While the cargo tank is stationary, the heat transfer rate must be determined by measuring the normal evaporation rate (NER) of the test cryogenic liquid (preferably the lading, where feasible) maintained at approximately one atmosphere. The calculated heat transfer rate must be determined from:

        (ii) The rated holding time (RHT) must be calculated as follows:

        (iii) The MRHT (see § 178.338-18(b)(9) of this subchapter) may not exceed the RHT.

        § 178.338-10   Accident damage protection.

#### § § 178.338-10

        (a) All valves, fittings, pressure relief devices and other accessories to the tank proper, which are not isolated from the tank by closed intervening shut-off valves or check valves, must be installed within the motor vehicle framework or within a suitable collision resistant guard or housing, and appropriate ventilation must be provided. Each pressure relief device must be protected so that in the event of the upset of the vehicle onto a hard surface, the device's opening will not be prevented and its discharge will not be restricted.

        (b) Each protective device or housing, and its attachment to the vehicle structure, must be designed to withstand static loading in any direction that it may be loaded as a result of front, rear, side, or sideswipe collision, or the overturn of the vehicle. The static loading shall equal twice the loaded weight of the tank and attachments. A safety factor of four, based on the tensile strength of the material, shall be used. The protective device or the housing must be made of steel at least  -inch thick, or other material of equivalent strength.

        (c)  Rear-end tank protections devices must:

        (1) Consist of at least one rear bumper designed to protect the cargo tank and piping in the event of a rear-end collision. The rear-end tank protection device design must transmit the force of the collision directly to the chassis of the vehicle. The rear-end tank protection device and its attachments to the chassis must be designed to withstand a load equal to twice the weight of the loaded cargo tank and attachments, using a safety factor of four based on the tensile strength of the materials used, with such load being applied horizontally and parallel to the major axis of the cargo tank. The rear-end tank protection device dimensions must meet the requirements of § 393.86 of this title and extend vertically to a height adequate to protect all valves and fittings located at the rear of the cargo tank from damage that could result in loss of lading; or

        (2) Conform to the requirements of § 178.345-8(d).

        (d) Every part of the loaded cargo tank, and any associated valve, pipe, enclosure, or protective device or structure (exclusive of wheel assemblies), must be at least 14 inches above level ground.

        § 178.338-11   Discharge control devices.

#### § § 178.338-11

        (a) Excess-flow valves are not required.

        (b) Each liquid filling and liquid discharge line must be provided with a shut-off valve located as close to the tank as practicable. Unless this valve is manually operable at the valve, the line must also have a manual shut-off valve.

        (c) Except for a cargo tank that is used to transport argon, carbon dioxide, helium, krypton, neon, nitrogen, xenon, or mixtures thereof, each liquid filling and liquid discharge line must be provided with an on-vehicle remotely controlled self-closing shutoff valve.

        (1) If pressure from a reservoir or from an engine-driven pump or compressor is used to open this valve, the control must be of fail-safe design and spring-biased to stop the admission of such pressure into the cargo tank. If the jacket is not evacuated, the seat of the valve must be inside the tank, in the opening nozzle or flange, or in a companion flange bolted to the nozzle. If the jacket is evacuated, the remotely controlled valve must be located as close to the tank as practicable.

        (2) Each remotely controlled shut off valve must be provided with on-vehicle remote means of automatic closure, both mechanical and thermal. One means may be used to close more than one remotely controlled valve. Cable linkage between closures and remote operators must be corrosion resistant and effective in all types of environment and weather. The thermal means must consist of fusible elements actuated at a temperature not exceeding 121 °C (250 °F), or equivalent devices. The loading/unloading connection area is where hoses are connected to the permanent metal piping. The number and location of remote operators and thermal devices shall be as follows:

        (i) On a cargo tank motor vehicle over 3,500 gallons water capacity, remote means of automatic closure must be installed at the ends of the cargo tank in at least two diagonally opposite locations. If the loading/unloading connection at the cargo tank is not in the general vicinity of one of these locations, at least one additional thermal device must be installed so that heat from a fire in the loading/unloading connection area will activate the emergency control system.

        (ii) On a cargo tank motor vehicle of 3,500 gallons water capacity or less, at least one remote means of automatic closure must be installed on the end of the cargo tank farthest away from the loading/unloading connection area. At least one thermal device must be installed so that heat from a fire in the loading/unloading connection area will activate the emergency control system.

#### § § 178.338-12

        Unless the valve is located in a rear cabinet forward of and protected by the bumper (see § 178.338-10(c)), the design and installation of each valve, damage to which could result in loss of liquid or vapor, must incorporate a shear section or breakage groove adjacent to, and outboard of, the valve. The shear section or breakage groove must yield or break under strain without damage to the valve that would allow the loss of liquid or vapor. The protection specified in § 178.338-10 is not a substitute for a shear section or breakage groove.

        § 178.338-13   Supporting and anchoring.

#### § § 178.338-13

        (a) On a cargo tank motor vehicle designed and constructed so that the cargo tank constitutes in whole or in part the structural member used in place of a motor vehicle frame, the cargo tank or the jacket must be supported by external cradles or by load rings. For a cargo tank mounted on a motor vehicle frame, the tank or jacket must be supported by external cradles, load rings, or longitudinal members. If cradles are used, they must subtend at least 120 degrees of the cargo tank circumference. The design calculations for the supports and load-bearing tank or jacket, and the support attachments must include beam stress, shear stress, torsion stress, bending moment, and acceleration stress for the loaded vehicle as a unit, using a safety factor of four, based on the tensile strength of the material, and static loading that uses the weight of the cargo tank and its attachments when filled to the design weight of the lading (see appendix G in Section VIII of the ASME Code) (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter), multiplied by the following factors. The effects of fatigue must also be considered in the calculations. Minimum static loadings must be as follows:

        (1) For a vacuum-insulated cargo tank—

        (i) Vertically downward of 2;

        (ii) Vertically upward of 2;

        (iii) Longitudinally of 2; and

        (iv) Laterally of 2.

        (2) For any other insulated cargo tank—

        (i) Vertically downward of 3;

        (ii) Vertically upward of 2;

        (iii) Longitudinally of 2; and

        (iv) Laterally of 2.

        (b) When a loaded tank is supported within the vacuum jacket by structural members, the design calculations for the tank and its structural members must be based on a safety factor of four and the tensile strength of the material at ambient temperature. The enhanced tensile strength of the material at actual operating temperature may be substituted for the tensile strength at ambient temperature to the extent recognized in the ASME Code for static loadings. Static loadings must take into consideration the weight of the tank and the structural members when the tank is filled to the design weight of lading (see Appendix G of Section VIII, Division 1 of the ASME Code), multiplied by the following factors. Static loadings must take into consideration the weight of the tank and the structural members when the tank is filled to the design weight of lading (see appendix G in Section VIII of the ASME Code), multiplied by the following factors. When load rings in the jacket are used for supporting the tank, they must be designed to carry the fully loaded tank at the specified static loadings, plus external pressure. Minimum static loadings must be as follows:

        (1) Vertically downward of 2;

        (2) Vertically upward of 1 ;

        (3) Longitudinally of 1 ; and, (4) Laterally of 1 .

        § 178.338-14   Gauging devices.

#### § § 178.338-14

        (a)  (1) Unless a cargo tank is intended to be filled by weight, it must be equipped with one or more gauging devices, which accurately indicate the maximum permitted liquid level at the loading pressure, in order to provide a minimum of two percent outage below the inlet of the pressure control valve or pressure relief valve at the condition of incipient opening of that valve. A fixed-length dip tube, a fixed trycock line, or a differential pressure liquid level gauge must be used as the primary control for filling. Other gauging devices, except gauge glasses, may be used, but not as the primary control for filling.

        (2) The design pressure of each liquid level gauging device must be at least that of the tank.

        (3) If a fixed length dip tube or trycock line gauging device is used, it must consist of a pipe or tube of small diameter equipped with a valve at or near the jacket and extending into the cargo tank to a specified filling height. The fixed height at which the tube ends in the cargo tank must be such that the device will function when the liquid reaches the maximum level permitted in loading.

        (4) The liquid level gauging device used as a primary control for filling must be designed and installed to accurately indicate the maximum filling level at the point midway of the tank both longitudinally and laterally.

        (b)  Each cargo tank must be provided with a suitable pressure gauge indicating the lading pressure and located on the front of the jacket so it can be read by the driver in the rear view mirror. Each gauge must have a reference mark at the cargo tank design pressure or the set pressure of the pressure relief valve or pressure control valve, whichever is lowest.

        (c)  All openings for dip tube gauging devices and pressure gauges in flammable cryogenic liquid service must be restricted at or inside the jacket by orifices no larger than 0.060-inch diameter. Trycock lines, if provided, may not be greater than  -inch nominal pipe size.

        § 178.338-16   Inspection and testing.

#### § § 178.338-16

        (a)  The material of construction of a tank and its appurtenances must be inspected for conformance to Section VIII of the ASME Code (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter). The tank must be subjected to either a hydrostatic or pneumatic test. The test pressure must be one and one-half times the sum of the design pressure, plus static head of lading, plus 101.3 kPa (14.7 psi) if subjected to external vacuum, except that for tanks constructed in accordance with Part UHT in Section VIII of the ASME Code the test pressure must be twice the design pressure.

        (b)  A pneumatic test may be used in place of the hydrostatic test. Due regard for protection of all personnel should be taken because of the potential hazard involved in a pneumatic test. The pneumatic test pressure in the tank must be reached by gradually increasing the pressure to one-half of the test pressure. Thereafter, the test pressure must be increased in steps of approximately one-tenth of the test pressure until the required test pressure has been reached. Then the pressure must be reduced to a value equal to four-fifths of the test pressure and held for a sufficient time to permit inspection of the cargo tank for leaks.

        (c)  All tank shell or head welds subject to pressure shall be radiographed in accordance with Section VIII of the ASME Code. A tank which has been subjected to inspection by the magnetic particle method, the liquid penetrant method, or any method involving a material deposit on the interior tank surface, must be cleaned to remove any such residue by scrubbing or equally effective means, and all such residue and cleaning solution must be removed from the tank prior to final closure of the tank.

        (d)  All cracks and other defects must be repaired as prescribed in Section VIII of the ASME Code. The welder and the welding procedure must be qualified in accordance with Section IX of the ASME Code (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter). After repair, the tank must again be postweld heat-treated, if such heat treatment was previously performed, and the repaired areas must be retested.

        (e) Verification must be made of the interior cleanliness of a tank constructed for oxygen service by means that assure that all contaminants that are likely to react with the lading have been removed as required by § 178.338-15.

#### § § 178.345-3

        (a)  (1) The maximum calculated design stress at any point in the cargo tank wall may not exceed the maximum allowable stress value prescribed in Section VIII of the ASME Code (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter), or 25 percent of the tensile strength of the material used at design conditions.

        (2) The relevant physical properties of the materials used in each cargo tank may be established either by a certified test report from the material manufacturer or by testing in conformance with a recognized national standard. In either case, the ultimate tensile strength of the material used in the design may not exceed 120 percent of the minimum ultimate tensile strength specified in either the ASME Code or the ASTM standard to which the material is manufactured.

        (3) The maximum design stress at any point in the cargo tank must be calculated separately for the loading conditions described in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section. Alternate test or analytical methods, or a combination thereof, may be used in place of the procedures described in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, if the methods are accurate and verifiable. TTMA RP 96-01, Structural Integrity of DOT 406, DOT 407, and DOT 412 Cylindrical Cargo Tanks, may be used as guidance in performing the calculations.

        (4) Corrosion allowance material may not be included to satisfy any of the design calculation requirements of this section.

        (b)  The static design and construction of each cargo tank must be in accordance with Section VIII of the ASME Code. The cargo tank design must include calculation of stresses generated by the MAWP, the weight of the lading, the weight of structures supported by the cargo tank wall and the effect of temperature gradients resulting from lading and ambient temperature extremes.

        § 178.345-6   Supports and anchoring.

#### § § 178.345-6

        (a) A cargo tank with a frame not integral to the cargo tank must have the tank secured by restraining devices to eliminate any motion between the tank and frame that may abrade the tank shell due to the stopping, starting, or turning of the cargo tank motor vehicle. The design calculations of the support elements must include the stresses indicated in § 178.345-3(b) and as generated by the loads described in § 178.345-3(c). Such restraining devices must be readily accessible for inspection and maintenance, except that insulation and jacketing are permitted to cover the restraining devices.

        (b) A cargo tank designed and constructed so that it constitutes, in whole or in part, the structural member used in lieu of a frame must be supported in such a manner that the resulting stress levels in the cargo tank do not exceed those specified in § 178.345-3(a). The design calculations of the support elements must include the stresses indicated in § 178.345-3(b) and as generated by the loads described in § 178.345-3(c).

        § 178.345-7   Circumferential reinforcements.

#### § § 178.345-7

        (a) A cargo tank with a shell thickness of less than   inch must be circumferentially reinforced with bulkheads, baffles, ring stiffeners, or any combination thereof, in addition to the cargo tank heads.

        (1) Circumferential reinforcement must be located so that the thickness and tensile strength of the shell material in combination with the frame and reinforcement produces structural integrity at least equal to that prescribed in § 178.345-3 and in such a manner that the maximum unreinforced portion of the shell does not exceed 60 inches. For cargo tanks designed to be loaded by vacuum, spacing of circumferential reinforcement may exceed 60 inches provided the maximum unreinforced portion of the shell conforms with the requirements in Section VIII of the ASME Code (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter).

        (2) Where circumferential joints are made between conical shell sections, or between conical and cylindrical shell sections, and the angle between adjacent sections is less than 160 degrees, circumferential reinforcement must be located within one inch of the shell joint, unless otherwise reinforced with structural members capable of maintaining shell stress levels authorized in § 178.345-3. When the joint is formed by the large ends of adjacent conical shell sections, or by the large end of a conical shell and a cylindrical shell section, this angle is measured inside the shell; when the joint is formed by the small end of a conical shell section and a cylindrical shell section, it is measured outside the shell.

        (b) Except for doubler plates and knuckle pads, no reinforcement may cover any circumferential joint.

        (c) When a baffle or baffle attachment ring is used as a circumferential reinforcement member, it must produce structural integrity at least equal to that prescribed in § 178.345-3 and must be circumferentially welded to the cargo tank shell. The welded portion may not be less than 50 percent of the total circumference of the cargo tank and the length of any unwelded space on the joint may not exceed 40 times the shell thickness unless reinforced external to the cargo tank.

        (d) When a ring stiffener is used as a circumferential reinforcement member, whether internal or external, reinforcement must be continuous around the circumference of the cargo tank shell and must be in accordance with the following:

        (1) The section modulus about the neutral axis of the ring section parallel to the shell must be at least equal to that derived from the applicable formula:

        (2) If a ring stiffener is welded to the cargo tank shell, a portion of the shell may be considered as part of the ring section for purposes of computing the ring section modulus. This portion of the shell may be used provided at least 50 percent of the total circumference of the cargo tank is welded and the length of any unwelded space on the joint does not exceed 40 times the shell thickness. The maximum portion of the shell to be used in these calculations is as follows:

        (3) When used to meet the vacuum requirements of this section, ring stiffeners must be as prescribed in Section VIII of the ASME Code.

        (4) If configuration of internal or external ring stiffener encloses an air space, this air space must be arranged for venting and be equipped with drainage facilities which must be kept operative at all times.

        (5) Hat shaped or open channel ring stiffeners which prevent visual inspection of the cargo tank shell are prohibited on cargo tank motor vehicles constructed of carbon steel.

        § 178.345-8   Accident damage protection.

#### § § 178.345-8

        (a)  Each cargo tank motor vehicle must be designed and constructed in accordance with the requirements of this section and the applicable individual specification to minimize the potential for the loss of lading due to an accident.

        (1) Any dome, sump, or washout cover plate projecting from the cargo tank wall that retains lading in any tank orientation, must be as strong and tough as the cargo tank wall and have a thickness at least equal to that specified by the appropriate cargo tank specification. Any such projection located in the lower   of the tank circumference (or cross section perimeter for non-circular cargo tanks) that extends more than half its diameter at the point of attachment to the tank or more than 4 inches from the cargo tank wall, or located in the upper   of the tank circumference (or cross section perimeter for non-circular cargo tanks) that extends more than   its diameter or more than 2 inches from the point of attachment to the tank must have accident damage protection devices that are:

        (i) As specified in this section;

        (ii) 125 percent as strong as the otherwise required accident damage protection device; or

        (iii) Attached to the cargo tank in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (a)(3) of this section.

        (2) Outlets, valves, closures, piping, or any devices that if damaged in an accident could result in a loss of lading from the cargo tank must be protected by accident damage protection devices as specified in this section.

        (3) Accident damage protection devices attached to the wall of a cargo tank must be able to withstand or deflect away from the cargo tank the loads specified in this section. They must be designed, constructed and installed so as to maximize the distribution of loads to the cargo tank wall and to minimize the possibility of adversely affecting the lading retention integrity of the cargo tank. Accident induced stresses resulting from the appropriate accident damage protection device requirements in combination with the stresses from the cargo tank operating at the MAWP may not result in a cargo tank wall stress greater than the ultimate strength of the material of construction using a safety factor of 1.3. Deformation of the protection device is acceptable provided the devices being protected are not damaged when loads specified in this section are applied.

        (4) Any piping that extends beyond an accident damage protection device must be equipped with a stop-valve and a sacrificial device such as a shear section. The sacrificial device must be located in the piping system outboard of the stop-valve and within the accident damage protection device to prevent any accidental loss of lading. The device must break at no more than 70 percent of the load that would be required to cause the failure of the protected lading retention device, part or cargo tank wall. The failure of the sacrificial device must leave the protected lading retention device and its attachment to the cargo tank wall intact and capable of retaining product.

        (5)  The minimum road clearance of any cargo tank motor vehicle component or protection device located between any two adjacent axles on a vehicle or vehicle combination must be at least one-half inch for each foot separating the component or device from the nearest axle of the adjacent pair, but in no case less than twelve (12) inches, except that the minimum road clearance for landing gear or other attachments within ten (10) feet of an axle must be no less than ten (10) inches. These measurements must be calculated at the gross vehicle weight rating of the cargo tank motor vehicle.

        (b) Each outlet, projection or piping located in the lower   of the cargo tank circumference (or cross section perimeter for non-circular cargo tanks) that could be damaged in an accident that may result in the loss of lading must be protected by a bottom damage protection device, except as provided by paragraph (a)(1) of this section and § 173.33(e) of this subchapter. Outlets, projections and piping may be grouped or clustered together and protected by a single protection device.

        (1) Any bottom damage protection device must be able to withstand a force of 155,000 pounds (based on the ultimate strength of the material), from the front, side, and rear uniformly distributed, applied in each direction of the device, over an area not to exceed 6 square feet, and a width not to exceed 6 feet. Suspension components and structural mounting members may be used to provide all, or part, of this protection. The device must extend no less than 6 inches beyond any component that may contain lading in transit.

        (2) A lading discharge opening equipped with an internal self-closing stop-valve need not conform to paragraph (b)(1) of this section provided it is protected so as to reasonably assure against the accidental loss of lading. This protection must be provided by a sacrificial device located outboard of each internal self-closing stop-valve and within 4 inches of the major radius of the cargo tank shell or within 4 inches of a sump, but in no case more than 8 inches from the major radius of the tank shell. The device must break at no more than 70 percent of the load that would be required to cause the failure of the protected lading retention device, part or cargo tank wall. The failure of the sacrificial device must leave the protected lading retention device or part and its attachment to the cargo tank wall intact and capable of retaining product.

        (c) Each closure for openings, including but not limited to the manhole, filling or inspection openings, and each valve, fitting, pressure relief device, vapor recovery stop valve or lading retaining fitting located in the upper   of a cargo tank circumference (or cross section perimeter for non-circular tanks) must be protected by being located within or between adjacent rollover damage protection devices, or by being 125 percent of the strength that would be provided by the otherwise required damage protection device.

        (1) A rollover damage protection device on a cargo tank motor vehicle must be designed and installed to withstand loads equal to twice the weight of the loaded cargo tank motor vehicle applied as follows: normal to the cargo tank shell (perpendicular to the cargo tank surface); and tangential (perpendicular to the normal load) from any direction. The stresses shall not exceed the ultimate strength of the material of construction. These design loads may be considered to be uniformly distributed and independently applied. If more than one rollover protection device is used, each device must be capable of carrying its proportionate share of the required loads and in each case at least one-fourth the total tangential load. The design must be proven capable of carrying the required loads by calculations, tests or a combination of tests and calculations.

        (2) A rollover damage protection device that would otherwise allow the accumulation of liquid on the top of the cargo tank, must be provided with a drain that directs the liquid to a safe point of discharge away from any structural component of the cargo tank motor vehicle.

        (d)  Each cargo tank motor vehicle must be provided with a rear-end tank protection device to protect the cargo tank and piping in the event of a rear-end collision and reduce the likelihood of damage that could result in the loss of lading. Nothing in this paragraph relieves the manufacturer of responsibility for complying with the requirements of § 393.86 of this title and, if applicable, paragraph (b) of this section. The rear-end tank protection device must conform to the following requirements:

        (1) The rear-end cargo tank protection device must be designed so that it can deflect at least 6 inches horizontally forward with no contact between any part of the cargo tank motor vehicle which contains lading during transit and with any part of the rear-end protection device, or with a vertical plane passing through the outboard surface of the protection device.

        (2) The dimensions of the rear-end cargo tank protection device shall conform to the following:

        (i) The bottom surface of the rear-end protection device must be at least 4 inches below the lower surface of any part at the rear of the cargo tank motor vehicle which contains lading during transit and not more than 60 inches from the ground when the vehicle is empty.

        (ii) The maximum width of a notch, indentation, or separation between sections of a rear-end cargo tank protection device may not exceed 24 inches. A notched, indented, or separated rear-end protection device may be used only when the piping at the rear of the cargo tank is equipped with a sacrificial device outboard of a shut-off valve.

        (iii) The widest part of the motor vehicle at the rear may not extend more than 18 inches beyond the outermost ends of the device or (if separated) devices on either side of the vehicle.

        (3) The structure of the rear-end protection device and its attachment to the vehicle must be designed to satisfy the conditions specified in paragraph (d)(1) of this section when subjected to an impact of the cargo tank motor vehicle at rated payload, at a deceleration of 2 “g”. Such impact must be considered as being uniformly applied in the horizontal plane at an angle of 10 degrees or less to the longitudinal axis of the vehicle.

        (e)  In order to account for stresses due to longitudinal impact in an accident, the cargo tank shell and heads must be able to withstand the load resulting from the design pressure in combination with the dynamic pressure resulting from a longitudinal deceleration of 2 “g”. For this loading condition, the allowable stress value used may not exceed the ultimate strength of the material of construction using a safety factor of 1.3. Performance testing, analytical methods, or a combination thereof, may be used to prove this capability provided the methods are accurate and verifiable. For cargo tanks with internal baffles, the decelerative force may be reduced by 0.25 “g” for each baffle assembly, but in no case may the total reduction in decelerative force exceed 1.0 “g”.

        § 178.345-9   Pumps, piping, hoses and connections.

#### § § 178.345-9

        (a) Suitable means must be provided during loading or unloading operations to ensure that pressure within a cargo tank does not exceed test pressure.

        (b) Each hose, piping, stop-valve, lading retention fitting and closure must be designed for a bursting pressure of the greater of 100 psig or four times the MAWP.

        (c) Each hose coupling must be designed for a bursting pressure of the greater of 120 psig or 4.8 times the MAWP of the cargo tank, and must be designed so that there will be no leakage when connected.

        (d) Suitable provision must be made to allow for and prevent damage due to expansion, contraction, jarring, and vibration. Slip joints may not be used for this purpose in the lading retention system.

        (e) Any heating device, when installed, must be so constructed that the breaking of its external connections will not cause leakage of the cargo tank lading.

        (f) Any gauging, loading or charging device, including associated valves, must be provided with an adequate means of secure closure to prevent leakage.

        (g) The attachment and construction of each loading/unloading or charging line must be of sufficient strength, or be protected by a sacrificial device, such that any load applied by loading/unloading or charging lines connected to the cargo tank cannot cause damage resulting in loss of lading from the cargo tank.

        (h) Use of a nonmetallic pipe, valve or connection that is not as strong and heat resistant as the cargo tank material is authorized only if such attachment is located outboard of the lading retention system.

        § 178.345-10   Pressure relief.

#### § § 178.345-10

        (a) Each cargo tank must be equipped to relieve pressure and vacuum conditions in conformance with this section and the applicable individual specification. The pressure and vacuum relief system must be designed to operate and have sufficient capacity to prevent cargo tank rupture or collapse due to over-pressurization or vacuum resulting from loading, unloading, or from heating and cooling of lading. Pressure relief systems are not required to conform to the ASME Code.

        (b)  (1) Each cargo tank must be provided with a primary pressure relief system consisting of one or more reclosing pressure relief valves. A secondary pressure relief system consisting of another pressure relief valve in parallel with the primary pressure relief system may be used to augment the total venting capacity of the cargo tank. Non-reclosing pressure relief devices are not authorized in any cargo tank except when in series with a reclosing pressure relief device. Gravity actuated reclosing valves are not authorized on any cargo tank.

        (2) When provided by § 173.33(c)(1)(iii) of this subchapter, cargo tanks may be equipped with a normal vent. Such vents must be set to open at not less than 1 psig and must be designed to prevent loss of lading through the device in case of vehicle overturn.

        (3) Each pressure relief system must be designed to withstand dynamic pressure surges in excess of the design set pressure as specified in paragraphs (b)(3) (i) and (ii) of this section. Set pressure is a function of MAWP as set forth in paragraph (d) of this section.

        (i) Each pressure relief device must be able to withstand dynamic pressure surge reaching 30 psig above the design set pressure and sustained above the set pressure for at least 60 milliseconds with a total volume of liquid released not exceeding one gallon before the relief device recloses to a leak-tight condition. This requirement must be met regardless of vehicle orientation. This capability must be demonstrated by testing. An acceptable method is outlined in TTMA RP No. 81-97 “Performance of Spring Loaded Pressure Relief Valves on MC 306, MC 307, MC 312, DOT 406, DOT 407, and DOT 412 Tanks” (incorporated by reference; see § 171.7 of this subchapter).

        (ii) After August 31, 1995, each pressure relief device must be able to withstand a dynamic pressure surge reaching 30 psig above the design set pressure and sustained above the design set pressure for at least 60 milliseconds with a total volume of liquid released not exceeding 1 L before the relief valve recloses to a leak-tight condition. This requirement must be met regardless of vehicle orientation. This capability must be demonstrated by testing. TTMA RP No. 81, cited in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, is an acceptable test procedure.

        (4) Each reclosing pressure relief valve must be constructed and installed in such a manner as to prevent unauthorized adjustment of the relief valve setting.

        (5) No shut-off valve or other device that could prevent venting through the pressure relief system may be installed in a pressure relief system.

        (6) The pressure relief system must be mounted, shielded and drainable so as to minimize the accumulation of material that could impair the operation or discharge capability of the system by freezing, corrosion or blockage.

        (c)  Each pressure relief device must communicate with the vapor space above the lading as near as practicable to the center of the vapor space. For example, on a cargo tank designed to operate in a level attitude, the device should be positioned at the horizontal and transverse center of the cargo tank; on cargo tanks sloped to the rear, the device should be located in the forward half of the cargo tank. The discharge from any device must be unrestricted. Protective devices which deflect the flow of vapor are permissible provided the required vent capacity is maintained.

        (d)  The set pressure of the pressure relief system is the pressure at which it starts to open, allowing discharge.

        (1)  The set pressure of each primary relief valve must be no less than 120 percent of the MAWP, and no more than 132 percent of the MAWP. The valve must reclose at not less than 108 percent of the MAWP and remain closed at lower pressures.

        (2)  The set pressure of each pressure relief valve used as a secondary relief device must be not less than 120 percent of the MAWP.

        (e)  The pressure relief system (primary and secondary, including piping) must have sufficient venting capacity to limit the cargo tank internal pressure to not more than the cargo tank test pressure. The total venting capacity, rated at not more than the cargo tank test pressure, must be at least that specified in table I, except as provided in § 178.348-4.

        (1)  Unless otherwise specified in the applicable individual specification, the primary relief system must have a minimum venting capacity of 12,000 SCFH per 350 square feet of exposed cargo tank area, but in any case at least one fourth the required total venting capacity for the cargo tank.

        (2)  If the primary pressure relief system does not provide the required total venting capacity, additional capacity must be provided by a secondary pressure relief system.

        (f)  The manufacturer of any pressure relief device, including valves, frangible (rupture) disks, vacuum vents and combination devices must certify that the device model was designed and tested in accordance with this section and the appropriate cargo tank specification. The certificate must contain sufficient information to describe the device and its performance. The certificate must be signed by a responsible official of the manufacturer who approved the flow capacity certification.

        (g)  Each pressure relief device model must be successfully flow capacity certification tested prior to first use. Devices having one design, size and set pressure are considered to be one model. The testing requirements are as follows:

        (1) At least 3 devices of each specific model must be tested for flow capacity at a pressure not greater than the test pressure of the cargo tank. For a device model to be certified, the capacities of the devices tested must fall within a range of plus or minus 5 percent of the average for the devices tested.

        (2) The rated flow capacity of a device model may not be greater than 90 percent of the average value for the devices tested.

        (3) The rated flow capacity derived for each device model must be certified by a responsible official of the device manufacturer.

        (h)  Each pressure relief device must be permanently marked with the following:

        (1) Manufacturer's name;

        (2) Model number;

        (3) Set pressure, in psig; and

        (4) Rated flow capacity, in SCFH at the rating pressure, in psig.

        § 178.345-11   Tank outlets.

#### § § 178.345-11

        (a)  As used in this section, “loading/unloading outlet” means any opening in the cargo tank wall used for loading or unloading of lading, as distinguished from outlets such as manhole covers, vents, vapor recovery devices, and similar closures. Cargo tank outlets, closures and associated piping must be protected in accordance with § 178.345-8.

        (b) Each cargo tank loading/unloading outlet must be equipped with an internal self-closing stop-valve, or alternatively, with an external stop-valve located as close as practicable to the cargo tank wall. Each cargo tank loading/unloading outlet must be in accordance with the following provisions:

        (1) Each loading/unloading outlet must be fitted with a self-closing system capable of closing all such outlets in an emergency within 30 seconds of actuation. During normal operations the outlets may be closed manually. The self-closing system must be designed according to the following:

        (i) Each self-closing system must include a remotely actuated means of closure located more than 10 feet from the loading/unloading outlet where vehicle length allows, or on the end of the cargo tank farthest away from the loading/unloading outlet. The actuating mechanism must be corrosion-resistant and effective in all types of environment and weather.

        (ii) If the actuating system is accidentally damaged or sheared off during transportation, each loading/unloading outlet must remain securely closed and capable of retaining lading.

        (iii) When required by part 173 of this subchapter for materials which are flammable, pyrophoric, oxidizing, or Division 6.1 (poisonous liquid) materials, the remote means of closure must be capable of thermal activation. The means by which the self-closing system is thermally activated must be located as close as practicable to the primary loading/unloading connection and must actuate the system at a temperature not over 250 °F. In addition, outlets on these cargo tanks must be capable of being remotely closed manually or mechanically.

        (2) Bottom loading outlets which discharge lading into the cargo tank through fixed internal piping above the maximum liquid level of the cargo tank need not be equipped with a self-closing system.

        (c) Any loading/unloading outlet extending beyond an internal self-closing stop-valve, or beyond the innermost external stop-valve which is part of a self-closing system, must be fitted with another stop-valve or other leak-tight closure at the end of such connection.

        (d) Each cargo tank outlet that is not a loading/unloading outlet must be equipped with a stop-valve or other leak-tight closure located as close as practicable to the cargo tank outlet. Any connection extending beyond this closure must be fitted with another stop-valve or other leak-tight closure at the end of such connection.

        § 178.345-12   Gauging devices.

#### § § 178.345-12

        Each cargo tank, except a cargo tank intended to be filled by weight, must be equipped with a gauging device that indicates the maximum permitted liquid level to within 0.5 percent of the nominal capacity as measured by volume or liquid level. Gauge glasses are not permitted.

        § 178.345-13   Pressure and leakage tests.

#### § § 178.345-13

        (a) Each cargo tank must be pressure and leakage tested in accordance with this section and §§ 178.346-5, 178.347-5, or 178.348-5.

        (b)  Each cargo tank or cargo tank compartment must be tested hydrostatically or pneumatically. Each cargo tank of a multi-cargo tank motor vehicle must be tested with the adjacent cargo tanks empty and at atmospheric pressure. Each closure, except pressure relief devices and loading/unloading venting devices rated at less than the prescribed test pressure, must be in place during the test. If the venting device is not removed during the test, such device must be rendered inoperative by a clamp, plug or other equally effective restraining device, which may not prevent the detection of leaks, or damage the device. Restraining devices must be removed immediately after the test is completed.

        (1)  Each cargo tank, including its domes, must be filled with water or other liquid having similar viscosity, the temperature of which may not exceed 100 °F. The cargo tank must then be pressurized as prescribed in the applicable specification. The pressure must be gauged at the top of the cargo tank. The prescribed test pressure must be maintained for at least 10 minutes during which time the cargo tank must be inspected for leakage, bulging, or other defect.

        (2)  A pneumatic test may be used in place of the hydrostatic test. However, pneumatic pressure testing may involve higher risk than hydrostatic testing. Therefore, suitable safeguards must be provided to protect personnel and facilities should failure occur during the test. The cargo tank must be pressurized with air or an inert gas. Test pressure must be reached gradually by increasing the pressure to one half of test pressure. Thereafter, the pressure must be increased in steps of approximately one tenth of the test pressure until test pressure is reached. Test pressure must be held for at least 5 minutes. The pressure must then be reduced to the inspection pressure which must be maintained while the entire cargo tank surface is inspected for leakage and other sign of defects. The inspection method must consist of coating all joints and fittings with a solution of soap and water or other equally sensitive method.

        (c)  The cargo tank with all its accessories in place and operable must be leak tested at not less than 80 percent of tank's MAWP with the pressure maintained for at least 5 minutes.

        (d) Any cargo tank that leaks, bulges or shows any other sign of defect must be rejected. Rejected cargo tanks must be suitably repaired and retested successfully prior to being returned to service. The retest after any repair must use the same method of test under which the cargo tank was originally rejected.

#### § § 178.503

        (a) A manufacturer must mark every packaging that is represented as manufactured to meet a UN standard with the marks specified in this section. The markings must be durable, legible and placed in a location and of such a size relative to the packaging as to be readily visible, as specified in § 178.3(a). Except as otherwise provided in this section, every reusable packaging liable to undergo a reconditioning process which might obliterate the packaging marks must bear the marks specified in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(6) and (a)(9) of this section in a permanent form (e.g. embossed) able to withstand the reconditioning process. A marking may be applied in a single line or in multiple lines provided the correct sequence is used. As illustrated by the examples in paragraph (e) of this section, the following information must be presented in the correct sequence. Slash marks should be used to separate this information. A packaging conforming to a UN standard must be marked as follows:

        (1) Except as provided in paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section, the United Nations symbol as illustrated in paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section (for embossed metal receptacles, the letters “UN” may be applied in place of the symbol);

        (2) A packaging identification code designating the type of packaging, the material of construction and, when appropriate, the category of packaging under §§ 178.504 through 178.523 of this subpart within the type to which the packaging belongs. The letter “V” must follow the packaging identification code on packagings tested in accordance with § 178.601(g)(2); for example, “4GV”. The letter “W” must follow the packaging identification code on packagings when required by an approval under the provisions of § 178.601(h) of this part;

        (3) A letter identifying the performance standard under which the packaging design type has been successfully tested, as follows:

        (i) X—for packagings meeting Packing Group I, II and III tests;

        (ii) Y—for packagings meeting Packing Group II and III tests; or

        (iii) Z—for packagings only meeting Packing Group III tests;

        (4) A designation of the specific gravity or mass for which the packaging design type has been tested, as follows:

        (i) For packagings without inner packagings intended to contain liquids, the designation shall be the specific gravity rounded down to the first decimal but may be omitted when the specific gravity does not exceed 1.2; and

        (ii) For packagings intended to contain solids or inner packagings, the designation shall be the maximum gross mass in kilograms;

        (5)(i) For single and composite packagings intended to contain liquids, the test pressure in kilopascals rounded down to the nearest 10 kPa of the hydrostatic pressure test that the packaging design type has successfully passed;

        (ii) For packagings intended to contain solids or inner packagings, the letter “S”;

        (6) The last two digits of the year of manufacture. Packagings of types 1H and 3H shall also be marked with the month of manufacture in any appropriate manner; this may be marked on the packaging in a different place from the remainder of the markings;

        (7) The state authorizing allocation of the mark. The letters ‘USA’ indicate that the packaging is manufactured and marked in the United States in compliance with the provisions of this subchapter;

        (8) The name and address or symbol of the manufacturer or the approval agency certifying compliance with subpart L and subpart M of this part. Symbols, if used, must be registered with the Associate Administrator;

        (9) For metal or plastic drums or jerricans intended for reuse or reconditioning as single packagings or the outer packagings of a composite packaging, the thickness of the packaging material, expressed in mm (rounded to the nearest 0.1 mm), as follows:

        (i) Metal drums or jerricans must be marked with the nominal thickness of the metal used in the body. The marked nominal thickness must not exceed the minimum thickness of the steel used by more than the thickness tolerance stated in ISO 3574 (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter). (See appendix C of this part.) The unit of measure is not required to be marked. When the nominal thickness of either head of a metal drum is thinner than that of the body, the nominal thickness of the top head, body, and bottom head must be marked (e.g., “1.0-1.2-1.0” or “0.9-1.0-1.0”).

        (ii) Plastic drums or jerricans must be marked with the minimum thickness of the packaging material. Minimum thicknesses of plastic must be as determined in accordance with § 173.28(b)(4). The unit of measure is not required to be marked;

        (10) In addition to the markings prescribed in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(9) of this section, every new metal drum having a capacity greater than 100 L must bear the marks described in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(6), and (a)(9)(i) of this section, in a permanent form, on the bottom. The markings on the top head or side of these packagings need not be permanent, and need not include the thickness mark described in paragraph (a)(9) of this section. This marking indicates a drum's characteristics at the time it was manufactured, and the information in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(6) of this section that is marked on the top head or side must be the same as the information in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(6) of this section permanently marked by the original manufacturer on the bottom of the drum; and

        (11) Rated capacity of the packaging expressed in liters may be marked.

        (b) For a packaging with a removable head, the markings may not be applied only to the removable head.

        (c)  (1) If a packaging is reconditioned, it shall be marked by the reconditioner near the marks required in paragraphs (a)(1) through (6) of this section with the following additional information:

        (i) The name of the country in which the reconditioning was performed (in the United States, use the letters “USA”);

        (ii) The name and address or symbol of the reconditioner. Symbols, if used, must be registered with the Associate Administrator;

        (iii) The last two digits of the year of reconditioning;

        (iv) The letter “R”; and

        (v) For every packaging successfully passing a leakproofness test, the additional letter “L”.

        (2) When, after reconditioning, the markings required by paragraph (a)(1) through (a)(5) of this section no longer appear on the top head or the side of the metal drum, the reconditioner must apply them in a durable form followed by the markings in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. These markings may identify a different performance capability than that for which the original design type had been tested and marked, but may not identify a greater performance capability. The markings applied in accordance with this paragraph may be different from those which are permanently marked on the bottom of a drum in accordance with paragraph (a)(10) of this section.

        (d)  For remanufactured metal drums, if there is no change to the packaging type and no replacement or removal of integral structural components, the required markings need not be permanent (e.g., embossed). Every other remanufactured drum must bear the marks required in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(6) of this section in a permanent form (e.g., embossed) on the top head or side. If the metal thickness marking required in paragraph (a)(9)(i) of this section does not appear on the bottom of the drum, or if it is no longer valid, the remanufacturer also must mark this information in permanent form.

        (e)  markings.

        (1)(i) The United Nations symbol is:

        (ii) The circle that surrounds the letters “u” and “n” may have small breaks provided the following provisions are met:

        (A) The total gap space does not exceed 15 percent of the circumference of the circle;

        (B) There are no more than four gaps in the circle;

        C) The spacing between gaps is separated by no less than 20 percent of the circumference of the circle (72 degrees); and

        D) The letters “u” and “n” appear exactly as depicted in § 178.503(e)(1)(i) with no gaps.

        (2) Examples of markings for a new packaging are as follows:

        (i) For a fiberboard box designed to contain an inner packaging:

        (ii) For a steel drum designed to contain liquids:

        (iii) For a steel drum to transport solids or inner packagings:

        (3) Examples of markings for reconditioned packagings are as follows:

        (f) A manufacturer must mark every UN specification package represented as manufactured to meet the requirements of § 178.609 for packaging of infectious substances with the marks specified in this section. The markings must be durable, legible, and must be readily visible, as specified in § 178.3(a). An infectious substance packaging that successfully passes the tests conforming to the UN standard must be marked as follows:

        (1) The United Nations symbol as illustrated in paragraph (e) of this section.

        (2) The code designating the type of packaging and material of construction according to the identification codes for packagings specified in § 178.502.

        (3) The text “CLASS 6.2”.

**Source:** Source: Amdt. 178-97, 55 FR 52723, Dec. 21, 1990, unless otherwise noted.

        § 178.600   Purpose and scope.

#### § § 178.600

        This subpart prescribes certain testing requirements for performance-oriented packagings identified in subpart L of this part.

> [Amdt. 178-97, 55 FR 52717, Dec. 21, 1990, as amended by Amdt. 178-99, 58 FR 51534, Oct. 1, 1993]

        § 178.601   General requirements.

#### § § 178.601

        (a)  The test procedures prescribed in this subpart are intended to ensure that packages containing hazardous materials can withstand normal conditions of transportation and are considered minimum requirements. Each packaging must be manufactured and assembled so as to be capable of successfully passing the prescribed tests and of conforming to the requirements of § 173.24 of this subchapter at all times while in transportation.

        (b)  It is the responsibility of the packaging manufacturer to assure that each package is capable of passing the prescribed tests. To the extent that a package assembly function, including final closure, is performed by the person who offers a hazardous material for transportation, that person is responsible for performing the function in accordance with §§ 173.22 and 178.2 of this subchapter.

        (c)  For the purpose of this subpart:

        (1)  is the performance of the tests prescribed in § 178.603, § 178.604, § 178.605, § 178.606, § 178.607, § 178.608, or § 178.609, as applicable, for each new or different packaging, at the start of production of that packaging.

        (2)  is the performance of the drop, leakproofness, hydrostatic pressure, and stacking tests, as applicable, as prescribed in § 178.603, § 178.604, § 178.605, or § 178.606, respectively, at the frequency specified in paragraph (e) of this section. For infectious substances packagings required to meet the requirements of § 178.609, periodic retesting is the performance of the tests specified in § 178.609 at the frequency specified in paragraph (e) of this section.

        (3)  is the performance of the leakproofness test prescribed in § 178.604 of this subpart on each single or composite packaging intended to contain a liquid.

        (4)  is one that differs (, is not identical) from a previously produced packaging in structural design, size, material of construction, wall thickness or manner of construction but does not include:

        (i) A packaging which differs only in surface treatment;

        (ii) A combination packaging which differs only in that the outer packaging has been successfully tested with different inner packagings. A variety of such inner packagings may be assembled in this outer packaging without further testing;

        (iii) A plastic packaging which differs only with regard to additives which conform to § 178.509(b)(3) or § 178.517(b) (4) or (5) of this part;

        (iv) A combination packaging with inner packagings conforming to the provisions of paragraph (g) of this section;

        (v) Packagings which differ from the design type only in their lesser design height; or

        (vi) For a steel drum, variations in design elements which do not constitute a different design type under the provisions of paragraph (g)(8) of this section.

        (d)  The packaging manufacturer shall achieve successful test results for the design qualification testing at the start of production of each new or different packaging.

        (e)  The packaging manufacturer must achieve successful test results for the periodic retesting at intervals established by the manufacturer of sufficient frequency to ensure that each packaging produced by the manufacturer is capable of passing the design qualification tests. Changes in retest frequency are subject to the approval of the Associate Administrator for Hazardous Materials Safety. For single or composite packagings, the periodic retests must be conducted at least once every 12 months. For combination packagings, the periodic retests must be conducted at least once every 24 months. For infectious substances packagings, the periodic retests must be conducted at least once every 24 months.

        (f)  The manufacturer shall conduct the design qualification and periodic tests prescribed in this subpart using random samples of packagings, in the numbers specified in the appropriate test section. In addition, the leakproofness test, when required, shall be performed on each packaging produced by the manufacturer, and each packaging prior to reuse under § 173.28 of this subchapter, by the reconditioner.

        (g)  The selective testing of packagings that differ only in minor respects from a tested type is permitted as described in this section. For air transport, packagings must comply with § 173.27(c)(1) and (c)(2) of this subchapter.

        (1)  Variations are permitted in inner packagings of a tested combination package, without further testing of the package, provided an equivalent level of performance is maintained and, when a package is altered under Variation 1 after October 1, 2010, the methodology used to determine that the inner packaging, including closure, maintains an equivalent level of performance is documented in writing by the person certifying compliance with this paragraph and retained in accordance with paragraph (l) of this section. Permitted variations are as follows:

        (i) Inner packagings of equivalent or smaller size may be used provided—

        (A) The inner packagings are of similar design to the tested inner packagings (, shape—round, rectangular, etc.);

        (B) The material of construction of the inner packagings (glass, plastic, metal, etc.) offers resistance to impact and stacking forces equal to or greater than that of the originally tested inner packaging;

        (C) The inner packagings have the same or smaller openings and the closure is of similar design (e.g., screw cap, friction lid, etc.);

        (D) Sufficient additional cushioning material is used to take up void spaces and to prevent significant moving of the inner packagings;

        (E) Inner packagings are oriented within the outer packaging in the same manner as in the tested package; and,

        (F) The gross mass of the package does not exceed that originally tested.

        (ii) A lesser number of the tested inner packagings, or of the alternative types of inner packagings identified in paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this section, may be used provided sufficient cushioning is added to fill void space(s) and to prevent significant moving of the inner packagings.

        (2)  Articles or inner packagings of any type, for solids or liquids, may be assembled and transported without testing in an outer packaging under the following conditions:

        (i) The outer packaging must have been successfully tested in accordance with § 178.603 with fragile (e.g. glass) inner packagings containing liquids at the Packing Group I drop height;

        (ii) The total combined gross mass of inner packagings may not exceed one-half the gross mass of inner packagings used for the drop test;

        (iii) The thickness of cushioning material between inner packagings and between inner packagings and the outside of the packaging may not be reduced below the corresponding thickness in the originally tested packaging; and when a single inner packaging was used in the original test, the thickness of cushioning between inner packagings may not be less than the thickness of cushioning between the outside of the packaging and the inner packaging in the original test. When either fewer or smaller inner packagings are used (as compared to the inner packagings used in the drop test), sufficient additional cushioning material must be used to take up void spaces.

        (iv) The outer packaging must have successfully passed the stacking test set forth in § 178.606 of this subpart when empty, i.e., without either inner packagings or cushioning materials. The total mass of identical packages must be based on the combined mass of inner packagings used for the drop test;

        (v) Inner packagings containing liquids must be completely surrounded with a sufficient quantity of absorbent material to absorb the entire liquid contents of the inner packagings;

        (vi) When the outer packaging is intended to contain inner packagings for liquids and is not leakproof or is intended to contain inner packagings for solids and is not siftproof, a means of containing any liquid or solid contents in the event of leakage must be provided in the form of a leakproof liner, plastic bag, or other equally efficient means of containment. For packagings containing liquids, the absorbent material required in paragraph (g)(2)(v) of this section must be placed inside as the means of containing liquid contents; and

        (vii) Packagings must be marked in accordance with § 178.503 of this part as having been tested to Packing Group I performance for combination packagings. The marked maximum gross mass may not exceed the sum of the mass of the outer packaging plus one half the mass of the filled inner packagings of the tested combination packaging. In addition, the marking required by § 178.503(a)(2) of this part must include the letter “V”.

        (3)  Packagings other than combination packagings which are produced with reductions in external dimensions (, length, width or diameter) of up to 25 percent of the dimensions of a tested packaging may be used without further testing provided an equivalent level of performance is maintained. The packagings must, in all other respects (including wall thicknesses), be identical to the tested design-type. The marked gross mass (when required) must be reduced in proportion to the reduction in volume.

        (4)  Variations are permitted in outer packagings of a tested design-type combination packaging, without further testing, provided an equivalent level of performance is maintained, as follows:

        (i) Each external dimension (length, width and height) is less than or equal to the corresponding dimension of the tested design-type;

        (ii) The structural design of the tested outer packaging (, methods of construction, materials of construction, strength characteristics of materials of construction, method of closure and material thicknesses) is maintained;

        (iii) The inner packagings are identical to the inner packagings used in the tested design type except that their size and mass may be less; and they are oriented within the outer packaging in the same manner as in the tested packaging;

        (iv) The same type or design of absorbent materials, cushioning materials and any other components necessary to contain and protect inner packagings, as used in the tested design type, are maintained. The thickness of cushioning material between inner packagings and between inner packagings and the outside of the packaging may not be less than the thicknesses in the tested design type packaging; and

        (v) Sufficient additional cushioning material is used to take up void spaces and to prevent significant moving of the inner packagings.

        (5)  Single packagings (, non-bulk packagings other than combination packagings), that differ from a tested design type only to the extent that the closure device or gasketing differs from that used in the originally tested design type, may be used without further testing, provided an equivalent level of performance is maintained, subject to the following conditions (the qualifying tests):

        (i) A packaging with the replacement closure devices or gasketing must successfully pass the drop test specified in § 178.603 in the orientation which most severely tests the integrity of the closure or gasket;

        (ii) When intended to contain liquids, a packaging with the replacement closure devices or gasketing must successfully pass the leakproofness test specified in § 178.604, the hydrostatic pressure test specified in § 178.605, and the stacking test specified in § 178.606.

        (6)  Variations in inner and intermediate packagings are permitted in packages for articles containing Cartridges, small arms (UN0012); Cartridges for tools, blank (UN0014); Primers, cap type (UN0044); and Cases, cartridge empty with primer (UN0055) packed in inner packages without further testing of the package under the following conditions:

        (i) The package has been tested containing only the articles to be transported without intermediate containment;

        (ii) The outer packaging must have passed the stacking test set forth in § 178.606 when empty,  without cushioning or inner or intermediate packagings, with the test mass of identical packages being the mass of the package filled with the articles;

        (iii) Only articles tested without intermediate containment may be transported; however, a variety of articles tested in this fashion may be assembled in a package with intermediate containment;

        (iv) No articles demonstrate a loss of material in testing; and

        (v) The completed package does not exceed the marked maximum gross mass of the package.

        (7) The provisions in Variations 1, 2, and 4 in paragraphs (g)(1), (2) and (4) of this section for combination packagings may be applied to packagings containing articles, where the provisions for inner packagings are applied analogously to the articles. In this case, inner packagings need not comply with § 173.27(c)(1) and (c)(2) of this subchapter.

        (8)  In addition to the provisions of paragraphs (g)(1) through (7) of this section, the Associate Administrator may approve the selective testing of packagings that differ only in minor respects from a tested type.

        (9) For a steel drum with a capacity greater than 12 L (3 gallons) manufactured from low carbon, cold-rolled sheet steel meeting ASTM designations A 366/A 366M or A 568/A 568M, variations in elements other than the following design elements are considered minor and do not constitute a different drum design type, or “different packaging” as defined in paragraph (c) of this section for which design qualification testing and periodic retesting are required. Minor variations authorized without further testing include changes in the identity of the supplier of component material made to the same specifications, or the original manufacturer of a DOT specification or UN standard drum to be remanufactured.

        § 178.602   Preparation of packagings and packages for testing.

#### § § 178.602

        (a) Except as otherwise provided in this subchapter, each packaging and package must be closed in preparation for testing and tests must be carried out in the same manner as if prepared for transportation, including inner packagings in the case of combination packagings.

        (b) For the drop and stacking test, inner and single-unit receptacles other than bags must be filled to not less than 95% of maximum capacity (see § 171.8 of this subchapter) in the case of solids and not less than 98% of maximum in the case of liquids. Bags containing solids shall be filled to the maximum mass at which they may be used. The material to be transported in the packagings may be replaced by a non-hazardous material, except for chemical compatibility testing or where this would invalidate the results of the tests.

        (c) If the material to be transported is replaced for test purposes by a non-hazardous material, the material used must be of the same or higher specific gravity as the material to be carried, and its other physical properties (grain, size, viscosity) which might influence the results of the required tests must correspond as closely as possible to those of the hazardous material to be transported. Water may also be used for the liquid drop test under the conditions specified in § 178.603(e) of this subpart. It is permissible to use additives, such as bags of lead shot, to achieve the requisite total package mass, so long as they are placed so that the test results are not affected.

        (d) Paper or fiberboard packagings must be conditioned for at least 24 hours immediately prior to testing in an atmosphere maintained—

        (1) At 50 percent ±2 percent relative humidity, and at a temperature of 23 °C±2 °C (73 °F±4 °F). Average values should fall within these limits. Short-term fluctuations and measurement limitations may cause individual measurements to vary by up to ±5 percent relative humidity without significant impairment of test reproducibility;

        (2) At 65 percent ±2 percent relative humidity, and at a temperature of 20 °C±2 °C (68 °F±4 °F), or 27 °C±2 °C (81 °F±4 °F). Average values should fall within these limits. Short-term fluctuations and measurement limitations may cause individual measurements to vary by up to ±5 percent relative humidity without significant impairment of test reproducibility; or

        (3) For testing at periodic intervals only (, other than initial design qualification testing), at ambient conditions.

        (e) Except as otherwise provided, each packaging must be closed in preparation for testing in the same manner as if prepared for actual shipment. All closures must be installed using proper techniques and torques.

        (f) Bung-type barrels made of natural wood must be left filled with water for at least 24 hours before the tests.

> [Amdt. 178-97, 55 FR 52723, Dec. 21, 1990, as amended at 56 FR 66286, Dec. 20, 1991; Amdt. 178-106, 59 FR 67522, Dec. 29, 1994; 69 FR 76186, Dec. 20, 2004; 71 FR 78635, Dec. 29, 2006]

        § 178.603   Drop test.

#### § § 178.603

        (a)  The drop test must be conducted for the qualification of all packaging design types and performed periodically as specified in § 178.601(e). For other than flat drops, the center of gravity of the test packaging must be vertically over the point of impact. Where more than one orientation is possible for a given drop test, the orientation most likely to result in failure of the packaging must be used. The number of drops required and the packages' orientations are as follows:

        (b)  For testing of single or composite packagings constructed of stainless steel, nickel, or monel at periodic intervals only (, other than design qualification testing), the drop test may be conducted with two samples, one sample each for the two drop orientations. These samples may have been previously used for the hydrostatic pressure or stacking test. Exceptions for the number of steel, aluminum and other metal packaging samples used for conducting the drop test are subject to the approval of the Associate Administrator.

        (c)  (1) Testing of plastic drums, plastic jerricans, plastic boxes other than expanded polystyrene boxes, composite packagings (plastic material), and combination packagings with plastic inner packagings other than plastic bags intended to contain solids or articles must be carried out when the temperature of the test sample and its contents has been reduced to −18 °C (0 °F) or lower. Test liquids must be kept in the liquid state, if necessary, by the addition of anti-freeze. Water/anti-freeze solutions with a minimum specific gravity of 0.95 for testing at −18 °C (0 °F) or lower are considered acceptable test liquids. Test samples prepared in this way are not required to be conditioned in accordance with § 178.602(d).

        (d)  The target must be a rigid, non-resilient, flat and horizontal surface.

        (e)  Drop heights, measured as the vertical distance from the target to the lowest point on the package, must be equal to or greater than the drop height determined as follows:

        (1) For solids and liquids, if the test is performed with the solid or liquid to be transported or with a non-hazardous material having essentially the same physical characteristic, the drop height must be determined according to packing group, as follows:

        (i) Packing Group I: 1.8 m (5.9 feet).

        (ii) Packing Group II: 1.2 m (3.9 feet).

        (iii) Packing Group III: 0.8 m (2.6 feet).

        (2) For liquids in single packagings and for inner packagings of combination packagings, if the test is performed with water:

        (i) Where the materials to be carried have a specific gravity not exceeding 1.2, drop height must be determined according to packing group, as follows:

        (A) Packing Group I: 1.8 m (5.9 feet).

        (B) Packing Group II: 1.2 m (3.9 feet).

        (C) Packing Group III: 0.8 m (2.6 feet).

        (ii) Where the materials to be transported have a specific gravity exceeding 1.2, the drop height must be calculated on the basis of the specific gravity (SG) of the material to be carried, rounded up to the first decimal, as follows:

        (A) Packing Group I: SG × 1.5 m (4.9 feet).

        (B) Packing Group II: SG × 1.0 m (3.3 feet).

        (C) Packing Group III: SG × 0.67 m (2.2 feet).

        (f)  A package is considered to successfully pass the drop tests if for each sample tested—

        (1) For packagings containing liquid, each packaging does not leak when equilibrium has been reached between the internal and external pressures, except for inner packagings of combination packagings when it is not necessary that the pressures be equalized;

        (2) For removable head drums for solids, the entire contents are retained by an inner packaging (e.g., a plastic bag) even if the closure on the top head of the drum is no longer sift-proof;

        (3) For a bag, neither the outermost ply nor an outer packaging exhibits any damage likely to adversely affect safety during transport;

        (4) The packaging or outer packaging of a composite or combination packaging must not exhibit any damage likely to affect safety during transport. Inner receptacles, inner packagings, or articles must remain completely within the outer packaging and there must be no leakage of the filling substance from the inner receptacles or inner packagings;

        (5) Any discharge from a closure is slight and ceases immediately after impact with no further leakage; and

        (6) No rupture is permitted in packagings for materials in Class 1 which would permit spillage of loose explosive substances or articles from the outer packaging.

        § 178.604   Leakproofness test.

#### § § 178.604

        (a)  The leakproofness test must be performed with compressed air or other suitable gases on all packagings intended to contain liquids, except that:

        (1) The inner receptacle of a composite packaging may be tested without the outer packaging provided the test results are not affected; and

        (2) This test is not required for inner packagings of combination packagings.

        (b) —(1)  All packagings subject to the provisions of this section must be tested and must pass the leakproofness test:

        (i) Before they are first used in transportation; and

        (ii) Prior to reuse, when authorized for reuse by § 173.28 of this subchapter.

        (2)  Three samples of each different packaging must be tested and must pass the leakproofness test. Exceptions for the number of samples used in conducting the leakproofness test are subject to the approval of the Associate Administrator.

        (c) —(1) For design qualification and periodic testing, packagings must be tested with closures in place. For production testing, packagings need not have their closures in place. Removable heads need not be installed during production testing.

        (2) For testing with closures in place, vented closures must either be replaced by similar non-vented closures or the vent must be sealed.

        (d)  The packaging must be restrained under water while an internal air pressure is applied; the method of restraint must not affect the results of the test. The test must be conducted, for other than production testing, for a minimum time of five minutes. Other methods, at least equally effective, may be used in accordance with appendix B of this part.

        (e)  An internal air pressure (gauge) must be applied to the packaging as indicated for the following packing groups:

        (1) Packing Group I: Not less than 30 kPa (4 psi).

        (2) Packing Group II: Not less than 20 kPa (3 psi).

        (3) Packing Group III: Not less than 20 kPa (3 psi).

        (f)  A packaging passes the test if there is no leakage of air from the packaging.

        § 178.605   Hydrostatic pressure test.

#### § § 178.605

        (a)  The hydrostatic pressure test must be conducted for the qualification of all metal, plastic, and composite packaging design types intended to contain liquids and be performed periodically as specified in § 178.601(e). This test is not required for inner packagings of combination packagings. For internal pressure requirements for inner packagings of combination packagings intended for transportation by aircraft, see § 173.27(c) of this subchapter.

        (b)  Three test samples are required for each different packaging. For packagings constructed of stainless steel, monel, or nickel, only one sample is required for periodic retesting of packagings. Exceptions for the number of aluminum and steel sample packagings used in conducting the hydrostatic pressure test are subject to the approval of the Associate Administrator.

        (c)  Vented closures must either be replaced by similar non-vented closures or the vent must be sealed.

        (d)  Metal packagings and composite packagings other than plastic (e.g., glass, porcelain or stoneware), including their closures, must be subjected to the test pressure for 5 minutes. Plastic packagings and composite packagings (plastic material), including their closures, must be subjected to the test pressure for 30 minutes. This pressure is the one to be marked as required in § 178.503(a)(5). The receptacles must be supported in a manner that does not invalidate the test. The test pressure must be applied continuously and evenly, and it must be kept constant throughout the test period. In addition, packagings intended to contain hazardous materials of Packing Group I must be tested to a minimum test pressure of 250 kPa (36 psig). The hydraulic pressure (gauge) applied, taken at the top of the receptacle, and determined by any one of the following methods must be:

        (1) Not less than the total gauge pressure measured in the packaging (, the vapor pressure of the filling material and the partial pressure of the air or other inert gas minus 100 kPa (15 psi)) at 55 °C (131 °F), multiplied by a safety factor of 1.5. This total gauge pressure must be determined on the basis of a maximum degree of filling in accordance with § 173.24a(d) of this subchapter and a filling temperature of 15 °C (59 °F);

        (2) Not less than 1.75 times the vapor pressure at 50 °C (122 °F) of the material to be transported minus 100 kPa (15 psi), but with a minimum test pressure of 100 kPa (15 psig); or

        (3) Not less than 1.5 times the vapor pressure at 55 °C (131 °F) of the material to be transported minus 100 kPa (15 psi), but with a minimum test pressure of 100 kPa (15 psig).

        (e)  A package passes the hydrostatic test if, for each test sample, there is no leakage of liquid from the package.

        § 178.606   Stacking test.

#### § § 178.606

        (a)  All packaging design types other than bags must be subjected to a stacking test.

        (b)  Three test samples are required for each different packaging. For periodic retesting of packagings constructed of stainless steel, monel, or nickel, only one test sample is required. Exceptions for the number of aluminum and steel sample packagings used in conducting the stacking test are subject to the approval of the Associate Administrator. Notwithstanding the provisions of § 178.602(a) of this subpart, combination packagings may be subjected to the stacking test without their inner packagings, except where this would invalidate the results of the test.

        (c) —(1)  The test sample must be subjected to a force applied to the top surface of the test sample equivalent to the total weight of identical packages which might be stacked on it during transport; where the contents of the test sample are non-hazardous liquids with specific gravities different from that of the liquid to be transported, the force must be calculated based on the specific gravity that will be marked on the packaging. The minimum height of the stack, including the test sample, must be 3.0 m (10 feet). The duration of the test must be 24 hours, except that plastic drums, jerricans, and composite packagings 6HH intended for liquids shall be subjected to the stacking test for a period of 28 days at a temperature of not less than 40 °C (104 °F). Alternative test methods which yield equivalent results may be used if approved by the Associate Administrator. In guided load tests, stacking stability must be assessed after completion of the test by placing two filled packagings of the same type on the test sample. The stacked packages must maintain their position for one hour. Plastic packagings must be cooled to ambient temperature before this stacking stability assessment.

        (2)  The test sample must be tested in accordance with:

        (i) Section 178.606(c)(1) of this subpart; or

        (ii) The packaging may be tested using a dynamic compression testing machine. The test must be conducted at room temperature on an empty, unsealed packaging. The test sample must be centered on the bottom platen of the testing machine. The top platen must be lowered until it comes in contact with the test sample. Compression must be applied end to end. The speed of the compression tester must be one-half inch plus or minus one-fourth inch per minute. An initial preload of 50 pounds must be applied to ensure a definite contact between the test sample and the platens. The distance between the platens at this time must be recorded as zero deformation. The force A to then be applied must be calculated using the formula:

        (d)  No test sample may leak. In composite packagings or combination packagings, there must be no leakage of the filling substance from the inner receptacle, or inner packaging. No test sample may show any deterioration which could adversely affect transportation safety or any distortion likely to reduce its strength, cause instability in stacks of packages, or cause damage to inner packagings likely to reduce safety in transportation. For the dynamic compression test, a container passes the test if, after application of the required load, there is no buckling of the sidewalls sufficient to cause damage to its expected contents; in no case may the maximum deflection exceed one inch.

        § 178.607   Cooperage test for bung-type wooden barrels.

#### § § 178.607

        (a)  One barrel is required for each different packaging.

        (b)  Remove all hoops above the bilge of an empty barrel at least two days old.

        (c)  A packaging passes the cooperage test only if the diameter of the cross-section of the upper part of the barrel does not increase by more than 10 percent.

        § 178.608   Vibration standard.

#### § § 178.608

        (a) Each packaging must be capable of withstanding, without rupture or leakage, the vibration test procedure outlined in this section.

        (b) Test method. (1) Three sample packagings, selected at random, must be filled and closed as for shipment.

        (2) The three samples must be placed on a vibrating platform that has a vertical or rotary double-amplitude (peak-to-peak displacement) of one inch. The packages should be constrained horizontally to prevent them from falling off the platform, but must be left free to move vertically, bounce and rotate.

        (3) The test must be performed for one hour at a frequency that causes the package to be raised from the vibrating platform to such a degree that a piece of material of approximately 1.6 mm (0.063 inch) thickness (such as steel strapping or paperboard) can be passed between the bottom of any package and the platform.

        (4) Immediately following the period of vibration, each package must be removed from the platform, turned on its side and observed for any evidence of leakage.

        (5) Other methods, at least equally effective, may be used, if approved by the Associate Administrator.

        (c)  A packaging passes the vibration test if there is no rupture or leakage from any of the packages. No test sample should show any deterioration which could adversely affect transportation safety or any distortion liable to reduce packaging strength.

        § 178.609   Test requirements for packagings for infectious substances.

#### § § 178.609

        (a) Samples of each packaging must be prepared for testing as described in paragraph (b) of this section and then subjected to the tests in paragraphs (d) through (i) of this section.

        (b) Samples of each packaging must be prepared as for transport except that a liquid or solid infectious substance should be replaced by water or, where conditioning at −18 °C (0 °F) is specified, by water/antifreeze. Each primary receptacle must be filled to 98 percent capacity. Packagings for live animals should be tested with the live animal being replaced by an appropriate dummy of similar mass.

        (c) Packagings prepared as for transport must be subjected to the tests in Table I of this paragraph (c), which, for test purposes, categorizes packagings according to their material characteristics. For outer packagings, the headings in Table I relate to fiberboard or similar materials whose performance may be rapidly affected by moisture; plastics that may embrittle at low temperature; and other materials, such as metal, for which performance is not significantly affected by moisture or temperature. Where a primary receptacle and a secondary packaging of an inner packaging are made of different materials, the material of the primary receptacle determines the appropriate test. In instances where a primary receptacle is made of more than one material, the material most likely to be damaged determines the appropriate test.

        (d) Samples must be subjected to free-fall drops onto a rigid, nonresilient, flat, horizontal surface from a height of 9 m (30 feet).

        The drops must be performed as follows:

        (1) Where the samples are in the shape of a box, five samples must be dropped, one in each of the following orientation:

        (i) Flat on the base;

        (ii) Flat on the top;

        (iii) Flat on the longest side;

        (iv) Flat on the shortest side; and

        (v) On a corner.

        (2) Where the samples are in the shape of a drum or jerrican, three samples must be dropped, one in each of the following orientations:

        (i) Diagonally on the top edge, with the center of gravity directly above the point of impact;

        (ii) Diagonally on the base edge; and

        (iii) Flat on the body or side.

        (3) While the sample should be released in the required orientation, it is accepted that for aerodynamic reasons the impact may not take place in that orientation.

        (4) Following the appropriate drop sequence, there must be no leakage from the primary receptacle(s) which should remain protected by absorbent material in the secondary packaging.

        (e) The samples must be subjected to a water spray to simulate exposure to rainfall of approximately 50 mm (2 inches) per hour for at least one hour. They must then be subjected to the test described in paragraph (d) of this section.

        (f) The sample must be conditioned in an atmosphere of −18 °C (0 °F) or less for a period of at least 24 hours and within 15 minutes of removal from that atmosphere be subjected to the test described in paragraph (d) of this section. Where the sample contains dry ice, the conditioning period may be reduced to 4 hours.

        (g) Where packaging is intended to contain dry ice, an additional drop test to that specified in paragraph (d), and when appropriate, paragraph (e) or (f) of this section must be performed on one sample in one of the orientations described in paragraph (d)(1) or (2) of this section, as appropriate, which is most likely to result in failure of the packaging. The sample must be stored so that all the dry ice dissipates prior to being subjected to the drop test.

        (h) Packagings with a gross mass of 7 kg (15 pounds) or less should be subjected to the tests described in paragraph (h)(1) of this section and packagings with a gross mass exceeding 7 kg (15 pounds) to the tests in paragraph (h)(2) of this section.

        (1) Samples must be placed on a level, hard surface. A cylindrical steel rod with a mass of at least 7 kg (15 pounds), a diameter not exceeding 38 mm (1.5 inches), and, at the impact end edges, a radius not exceeding 6 mm (0.2 inches), must be dropped in a vertical free fall from a height of 1 m (3 feet), measured from the impact end of the sample's impact surface. One sample must be placed on its base. A second sample must be placed in an orientation perpendicular to that used for the first. In each instance, the steel rod must be aimed to impact the primary receptacle(s). For a successful test, there must be no leakage from the primary receptacle(s) following each impact.

        (2) Samples must be dropped onto the end of a cylindrical steel rod. The rod must be set vertically in a level, hard surface. It must have a diameter of 38 mm (1.5 inches) and a radius not exceeding 6 mm (0.2 inches) at the edges of the upper end. The rod must protrude from the surface a distance at least equal to that between the primary receptacle(s) and the outer surface of the outer packaging with a minimum of 200 mm (7.9 inches). One sample must be dropped in a vertical free fall from a height of 1 m (3 feet), measured from the top of the steel rod. A second sample must be dropped from the same height in an orientation perpendicular to that used for the first. In each instance, the packaging must be oriented so the steel rod will impact the primary receptacle(s). For a successful test, there must be no leakage from the primary receptacle(s) following each impact.

        (i)  The following variations in the primary receptacles placed within the secondary packaging are allowed without additional testing of the completed package. An equivalent level of performance must be maintained.

        (1)  Primary receptacles of equivalent or smaller size as compared to the tested primary receptacles may be used provided they meet all of the following conditions:

        (i) The primary receptacles are of similar design to the tested primary receptacle (e.g., shape: round, rectangular, etc.).

        (ii) The material of construction of the primary receptacle (glass, plastics, metal, etc.) offers resistance to impact and a stacking force equal to or greater than that of the originally tested primary receptacle.

        (iii) The primary receptacles have the same or smaller openings and the closure is of similar design (e.g., screw cap, friction lid, etc.).

        (iv) Sufficient additional cushioning material is used to fill void spaces and to prevent significant movement of the primary receptacles.

        (v) Primary receptacles are oriented within the intermediate packaging in the same manner as in the tested package.

        (2)  A lesser number of the tested primary receptacles, or of the alternative types of primary receptacles identified in paragraph (i)(1) of this section, may be used provided sufficient cushioning is added to fill the void space(s) and to prevent significant movement of the primary receptacles.

        (3)  Primary receptacles of any type may be placed within a secondary packaging and shipped without testing in the outer packaging provided all of the following conditions are met:

        (i) The secondary and outer packaging combination must be successfully tested in accordance with paragraphs (a) through (h) of this section with fragile (e.g., glass) inner receptacles.

        (ii) The total combined gross weight of inner receptacles may not exceed one-half the gross weight of inner receptacles used for the drop test in paragraph (d) of this section.

        (iii) The thickness of cushioning material between inner receptacles and between inner receptacles and the outside of the secondary packaging may not be reduced below the corresponding thicknesses in the originally tested packaging. If a single inner receptacle was used in the original test, the thickness of cushioning between the inner receptacles must be no less than the thickness of cushioning between the outside of the secondary packaging and the inner receptacle in the original test. When either fewer or smaller inner receptacles are used (as compared to the inner receptacles used in the drop test), sufficient additional cushioning material must be used to fill the void.

        (iv) The outer packaging must pass the stacking test in § 178.606 while empty. The total weight of identical packages must be based on the combined mass of inner receptacles used in the drop test in paragraph (d) of this section.

        (v) For inner receptacles containing liquids, an adequate quantity of absorbent material must be present to absorb the entire liquid contents of the inner receptacles.

        (vi) If the outer packaging is intended to contain inner receptacles for liquids and is not leakproof, or is intended to contain inner receptacles for solids and is not sift proof, a means of containing any liquid or solid contents in the event of leakage must be provided. This can be a leakproof liner, plastic bag, or other equally effective means of containment.

        (vii) In addition, the marking required in § 178.503(f) of this subchapter must be followed by the letter “U”.

        § 178.704   General IBC standards.

#### § § 178.704

        (a) Each IBC must be resistant to, or protected from, deterioration due to exposure to the external environment. IBCs intended for solid hazardous materials must be sift-proof and water-resistant.

        (b) All service equipment must be so positioned or protected as to minimize potential loss of contents resulting from damage during IBC handling and transportation.

        (c) Each IBC, including attachments, and service and structural equipment, must be designed to withstand, without loss of hazardous materials, the internal pressure of the contents and the stresses of normal handling and transport. An IBC intended for stacking must be designed for stacking. Any lifting or securing features of an IBC must be of sufficient strength to withstand the normal conditions of handling and transportation without gross distortion or failure and must be positioned so as to cause no undue stress in any part of the IBC.

        (d) An IBC consisting of a packaging within a framework must be so constructed that:

        (1) The body is not damaged by the framework;

        (2) The body is retained within the framework at all times; and

        (3) The service and structural equipment are fixed in such a way that they cannot be damaged if the connections between body and frame allow relative expansion or motion.

        (e) Bottom discharge valves must be secured in the closed position and the discharge system suitably protected from damage. Valves having lever closures must be secured against accidental opening. The open or closed position of each valve must be readily apparent. For each IBC containing a liquid, a secondary means of sealing the discharge aperture must also be provided, e.g., by a blank flange or equivalent device.

        (f) IBC design types must be constructed in such a way as to be bottom-lifted or top-lifted as specified in §§ 178.811 and 178.812.

        § 178.705   Standards for metal IBCs.

#### § § 178.705

        (a) The provisions in this section apply to metal IBCs intended to contain liquids and solids. Metal IBC types are designated:

        (1) 11A, 11B, 11N for solids that are loaded or discharged by gravity.

        (2) 21A, 21B, 21N for solids that are loaded or discharged at a gauge pressure greater than 10 kPa (1.45 psig).

        (3) 31A, 31B, 31N for liquids.

        (b) Definitions for metal IBCs:

        (1)  means an IBC with a metal body, together with appropriate service and structural equipment.

        (2)  means providing the IBC body with additional external protection against impact and abrasion. For example, a multi-layer (sandwich) or double wall construction or a frame with a metal lattice-work casing.

        (c) Construction requirements for metal IBCs are as follows:

        (1)  The body must be made of ductile metal materials. Welds must be made so as to maintain design type integrity of the receptacle under conditions normally incident to transportation.

        (i) The use of dissimilar metals must not result in deterioration that could affect the integrity of the body.

        (ii) Aluminum IBCs intended to contain flammable liquids must have no movable parts, such as covers and closures, made of unprotected steel liable to rust, which might cause a dangerous reaction from friction or percussive contact with the aluminum.

        (iii) Metals used in fabricating the body of a metal IBC must meet the following requirements:

        (A) For steel, the percentage elongation at fracture must not be less than 10,000/Rm with a minimum of 20 percent; where Rm = minimum tensile strength of the steel to be used, in N/mm ; if U.S. Standard units of psi are used for tensile strength then the ratio becomes 10,000 × (145/Rm).

        (B) For aluminum, the percentage elongation at fracture must not be less than 10,000/(6Rm) with an absolute minimum of eight percent; if U.S. Standard units of psi are used for tensile strength then the ratio becomes 10,000 × 145 / (6Rm).

        (C) Specimens used to determine the elongation at fracture must be taken transversely to the direction of rolling and be so secured that:

        (iv)  For metal IBCs with a capacity of more than 1500 liters, the minimum wall thickness must be determined as follows:

        (A) For a reference steel having a product of Rm × Ao = 10,000, where Ao is the minimum elongation (as a percentage) of the reference steel to be used on fracture under tensile stress (Rm × Ao = 10,000 × 145; if tensile strength is in U.S. Standard units of pounds per square inch), the wall thickness must not be less than:

        (B) For metals other than the reference steel described in paragraph (c)(1)(iii)(A) of this section, the minimum wall thickness is the greater of 1.5 mm (0.059 inches) or as determined by use of the following equivalence formula:

        (C) For purposes of the calculation described in paragraph (c)(*1*)(iv)(B) of this section, the guaranteed minimum tensile strength of the metal to be used (Rm) must be the minimum value according to material standards. However, for austenitic (stainless) steels, the specified minimum value for Rm, according to the material standards, may be increased by up to 15% when a greater value is provided in the material inspection certificate. When no material standard exists for the material in question, the value of Rm must be the minimum value indicated in the material inspection certificate.

        (2)  The following pressure relief requirements apply to IBCs intended for liquids:

        (i) IBCs must be capable of releasing a sufficient amount of vapor in the event of fire engulfment to ensure that no rupture of the body will occur due to pressure build-up. This can be achieved by spring-loaded or non-reclosing pressure relief devices or by other means of construction.

        (ii) The start-to-discharge pressure may not be higher than 65 kPa (9 psig) and no lower than the vapor pressure of the hazardous material plus the partial pressure of the air or other inert gases, measured in the IBC at 55 °C (131 °F), determined on the basis of a maximum degree of filling as specified in § 173.35(d) of this subchapter. This does not apply to fusible devices unless such devices are the only source of pressure relief for the IBC. Pressure relief devices must be fitted in the vapor space.

        (d) Metal IBCs may not have a volumetric capacity greater than 3,000 L (793 gallons) or less than 450 L (119 gallons).

        § 178.706   Standards for rigid plastic IBCs.

#### § § 178.706

        (a) The provisions in this section apply to rigid plastic IBCs intended to contain solids or liquids. Rigid plastic IBC types are designated:

        (1) 11H1 fitted with structural equipment designed to withstand the whole load when IBCs are stacked, for solids which are loaded or discharged by gravity.

        (2) 11H2 freestanding, for solids which are loaded or discharged by gravity.

        (3) 21H1 fitted with structural equipment designed to withstand the whole load when IBCs are stacked, for solids which are loaded or discharged under pressure.

        (4) 21H2 freestanding, for solids which are loaded or discharged under pressure.

        (5) 31H1 fitted with structural equipment designed to withstand the whole load when IBCs are stacked, for liquids.

        (6) 31H2 freestanding, for liquids.

        (b) Rigid plastic IBCs consist of a rigid plastic body, which may have structural equipment, together with appropriate service equipment.

        (c) Rigid plastic IBCs must be manufactured from plastic material of known specifications and be of a strength relative to its capacity and to the service it is required to perform. In addition to conformance to § 173.24 of this subchapter, plastic materials must be resistant to aging and to degradation caused by ultraviolet radiation.

        (1) If protection against ultraviolet radiation is necessary, it must be provided by the addition of a pigment or inhibiter such as carbon black. These additives must be compatible with the contents and remain effective throughout the life of the IBC body. Where use is made of carbon black, pigments or inhibitors, other than those used in the manufacture of the tested design type, retesting may be omitted if changes in the carbon black content, the pigment content or the inhibitor content do not adversely affect the physical properties of the material of construction.

        § 178.707   Standards for composite IBCs.

#### § § 178.707

        (a) The provisions in this section apply to composite IBCs intended to contain solids and liquids. To complete the marking codes listed below, the letter “Z” must be replaced by a capital letter in accordance with § 178.702(a)(2) to indicate the material used for the outer packaging. Composite IBC types are designated:

        (1) 11HZ1 Composite IBCs with a rigid plastic inner receptacle for solids loaded or discharged by gravity.

        (2) 11HZ2 Composite IBCs with a flexible plastic inner receptacle for solids loaded or discharged by gravity.

        (3) 21HZ1 Composite IBCs with a rigid plastic inner receptacle for solids loaded or discharged under pressure.

        (4) 21HZ2 Composite IBCs with a flexible plastic inner receptacle for solids loaded or discharged under pressure.

        (5) 31HZ1 Composite IBCs with a rigid plastic inner receptacle for liquids.

        (6) 31HZ2 Composite IBCs with a flexible plastic inner receptacle for liquids.

        (b) Definitions for composite IBC types:

        (1) A  is an IBC which consists of a rigid outer packaging enclosing a plastic inner receptacle together with any service or other structural equipment. The outer packaging of a _composite IBC_ is designed to bear the entire stacking load. The inner receptacle and outer packaging form an integral packaging and are filled, stored, transported, and emptied as a unit.

        (2) The term plastic means polymeric materials (, plastic or rubber).

        (3) A “rigid” inner receptacle is an inner receptacle which retains its general shape when empty without closures in place and without benefit of the outer casing. Any inner receptacle that is not “rigid” is considered to be “flexible.”

        (c) Construction requirements for composite IBCs with plastic inner receptacles are as follows:

        (1) The outer packaging must consist of rigid material formed so as to protect the inner receptacle from physical damage during handling and transportation, but is not required to perform the secondary containment function. It includes the base pallet where appropriate. The inner receptacle is not intended to perform a containment function without the outer packaging.

        (2) A composite IBC with a fully enclosing outer packaging must be designed to permit assessment of the integrity of the inner container following the leakproofness and hydraulic tests. The outer packaging of 31HZ2 composite IBCs must enclose the inner receptacles on all sides.

        (3) The inner receptacle must be manufactured from plastic material of known specifications and be of a strength relative to its capacity and to the service it is required to perform. In addition to conformance with the requirements of § 173.24 of this subchapter, the material must be resistant to aging and to degradation caused by ultraviolet radiation. The inner receptacle of 31HZ2 composite IBCs must consist of at least three plies of film.

        (i) If necessary, protection against ultraviolet radiation must be provided by the addition of pigments or inhibitors such as carbon black. These additives must be compatible with the contents and remain effective throughout the life of the inner receptacle. Where use is made of carbon black, pigments, or inhibitors, other than those used in the manufacture of the tested design type, retesting may be omitted if the carbon black content, the pigment content, or the inhibitor content do not adversely affect the physical properties of the material of construction.

        (ii) Additives may be included in the composition of the plastic material of the inner receptacle to improve resistance to aging, provided they do not adversely affect the physical or chemical properties of the material.

        (iii) No used material, other than production residues or regrind from the same manufacturing process, may be used in the manufacture of inner receptacles unless approved by the Associate Administrator.

        (iv) Composite IBCs intended for the transportation of liquids must be capable of releasing a sufficient amount of vapor to prevent the body of the IBC from rupturing if it is subjected to an internal pressure in excess of that for which it was hydraulically tested. This may be achieved by spring-loaded or non-reclosing pressure relief devices or by other means of construction.

        (4) The strength of the construction material comprising the outer packaging and the manner of construction must be appropriate to the capacity of the composite IBC and its intended use. The outer packaging must be free of any projection that might damage the inner receptacle.

        (i) Outer packagings of natural wood must be constructed of well seasoned wood that is commercially dry and free from defects that would materially lessen the strength of any part of the outer packaging. The tops and bottoms may be made of water-resistant reconstituted wood such as hardboard or particle board. Materials other than natural wood may be used for construction of structural equipment of the outer packaging.

        (ii) Outer packagings of plywood must be made of well-seasoned, rotary cut, sliced, or sawn veneer, commercially dry and free from defects that would materially lessen the strength of the casing. All adjacent plies must be glued with water-resistant adhesive. Materials other than plywood may be used for construction of structural equipment of the outer packaging. Outer packagings must be firmly nailed or secured to corner posts or ends or be assembled by equally suitable devices.

        (iii) Outer packagings of reconstituted wood must be constructed of water-resistant reconstituted wood such as hardboard or particle board. Materials other than reconstituted wood may be used for the construction of structural equipment of reconstituted wood outer packaging.

        (iv) Fiberboard outer packagings must be constructed of strong, solid, or double-faced corrugated fiberboard (single or multiwall).

        (A) Water resistance of the outer surface must be such that the increase in mass, as determined in a test carried out over a period of 30 minutes by the Cobb method of determining water absorption, is not greater than 155 grams per square meter (0.0316 pounds per square foot)—see ISO 535 (E) (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter). Fiberboard must have proper bending qualities. Fiberboard must be cut, creased without cutting through any thickness of fiberboard, and slotted so as to permit assembly without cracking, surface breaks, or undue bending. The fluting of corrugated fiberboard must be firmly glued to the facings.

        (B) The ends of fiberboard outer packagings may have a wooden frame or be constructed entirely of wood. Wooden battens may be used for reinforcements.

        (C) Manufacturers' joints in the bodies of outer packagings must be taped, lapped and glued, or lapped and stitched with metal staples.

        (D) Lapped joints must have an appropriate overlap.

        (E) Where closing is effected by gluing or taping, a water-resistant adhesive must be used.

        (F) All closures must be sift-proof.

        (v) Outer packagings of plastic materials must be constructed in accordance with the relevant provisions of paragraph (c)(3) of this section.

        (5) Any integral pallet base forming part of an IBC, or any detachable pallet, must be suitable for the mechanical handling of an IBC filled to its maximum permissible gross mass.

        (i) The pallet or integral base must be designed to avoid protrusions that may cause damage to the IBC in handling.

        (ii) The outer packaging must be secured to any detachable pallet to ensure stability in handling and transportation. Where a detachable pallet is used, its top surface must be free from sharp protrusions that might damage the IBC.

        (iii) Strengthening devices, such as timber supports to increase stacking performance, may be used but must be external to the inner receptacle.

        (iv) The load-bearing surfaces of IBCs intended for stacking must be designed to distribute loads in a stable manner. An IBC intended for stacking must be designed so that loads are not supported by the inner receptacle.

        (6) Intermediate IBCs of type 31HZ2 must be limited to a capacity of not more than 1,250 L.

        (d) Composite IBCs may not have a volumetric capacity greater than 3,000 L (793 gallons) or less than 450 L (119 gallons).

      Subpart O—Testing of IBCs

        § 178.800   Purpose and scope.

#### § § 178.800

        This subpart prescribes certain testing requirements for IBCs identified in subpart N of this part.

> [Amdt. 178-103, 59 FR 38074, July 26, 1994, as amended by 66 FR 45386, Aug. 28, 2001]

        § 178.801   General requirements.

#### § § 178.801

        (a)  The test procedures prescribed in this subpart are intended to ensure that IBCs containing hazardous materials can withstand normal conditions of transportation and are considered minimum requirements. Each packaging must be manufactured and assembled so as to be capable of successfully passing the prescribed tests and of conforming to the requirements of § 173.24 of this subchapter at all times while in transportation.

        (b)  It is the responsibility of the IBC manufacturer to assure that each IBC is capable of passing the prescribed tests. To the extent that an IBC assembly function, including final closure, is performed by the person who offers a hazardous material for transportation, that person is responsible for performing the function in accordance with §§ 173.22 and 178.2 of this subchapter.

        (c)  For the purpose of this subpart:

        (1)  refers to an IBC that does not differ in structural design, size, material of construction, wall thickness, manner of construction and representative service equipment.

        (2)  is the performance of the drop, leakproofness, hydrostatic pressure, stacking, bottom-lift or top-lift, tear, topple, righting and vibration tests, as applicable, prescribed in this subpart, for each different IBC design type, at the start of production of that packaging.

        (3)  is the performance of the applicable tests specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this section on an IBC design type, in order to requalify the design for continued production at the frequency specified in paragraph (e) of this section.

        (4)  is the inspection that must initially be conducted on each newly manufactured IBC.

        (5)  is the performance of the leakproofness test in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section on each IBC intended to contain solids discharged by pressure or intended to contain liquids.

        (6)  is performance of the applicable test and inspections on each IBC at the frequency specified in § 180.352 of this subchapter.

        (7)  is one that differs from a previously qualified IBC design type in structural design, size, material of construction, wall thickness, or manner of construction, but does not include:

        (i) A packaging which differs in surface treatment;

        (ii) A rigid plastic IBC or composite IBC which differs with regard to additives used to comply with §§ 178.706(c), 178.707(c) or 178.710(c);

        (iii) A packaging which differs only in its lesser external dimensions (, height, width, length) provided materials of construction and material thicknesses or fabric weight remain the same;

        (iv) A packaging which differs in service equipment.

        (d)  The packaging manufacturer shall achieve successful test results for the design qualification testing at the start of production of each new or different IBC design type. The service equipment selected for this design qualification testing shall be representative of the type of service equipment that will be fitted to any finished IBC body under the design. Application of the certification mark by the manufacturer shall constitute certification that the IBC design type passed the prescribed tests in this subpart.

        (e)  (1) Periodic design requalification must be conducted on each qualified IBC design type if the manufacturer is to maintain authorization for continued production. The IBC manufacturer shall achieve successful test results for the periodic design requalification at sufficient frequency to ensure each packaging produced by the manufacturer is capable of passing the design qualification tests. Design requalification tests must be conducted at least once every 12 months.

        (2) Changes in the frequency of design requalification testing specified in paragraph (e)(1) of this section are authorized if approved by the Associate Administrator. These requests must be based on:

        (i) Detailed quality assurance programs that assure that proposed decreases in test frequency maintain the integrity of originally tested IBC design types; and

        (ii) Demonstrations that each IBC produced is capable of withstanding higher standards (e.g., increased drop height, hydrostatic pressure, wall thickness, fabric weight).

        (f)  (1) Production testing consists of the leakproofness test prescribed in § 178.813 of this subpart and must be performed on each IBC intended to contain solids discharged by pressure or intended to contain liquids. For this test:

        (i) The IBC need not have its closures fitted, except that the IBC must be fitted with its primary bottom closure.

        (ii) The inner receptacle of a composite IBC may be tested without the outer IBC body, provided the test results are not affected.

        (2) Applicable inspection requirements in § 180.352 of this subchapter must be performed on each IBC initially after production.

        (g)  The IBC manufacturer shall conduct the design qualification and periodic design requalification tests prescribed in this subpart using random samples of IBCs, according to the appropriate test section.

        (h)  Variation of a tested IBC design type is permitted without further testing, provided selective testing demonstrates an equivalent or greater level of safety than the design type tested and which has been approved by the Associate Administrator.

        (i)  An IBC differing from the standards in subpart N of this part, or tested using methods other than those specified in this subpart, may be used if approved by the Associate Administrator. Such IBCs must be shown to be equally effective, and testing methods used must be equivalent.

        (j)  Notwithstanding the periodic design requalification testing intervals specified in paragraph (e) of this section, the Associate Administrator, or a designated representative, may at any time require demonstration of compliance by a manufacturer, through testing in accordance with this subpart, that packagings meet the requirements of this subpart. As required by the Associate Administrator, or a designated representative, the manufacturer shall either:

        (1) Conduct performance tests or have tests conducted by an independent testing facility, in accordance with this subpart; or

        (2) Make a sample IBC available to the Associate Administrator, or a designated representative, for testing in accordance with this subpart.

        (k)  If an inner treatment or coating of an IBC is required for safety reasons, the manufacturer shall design the IBC so that the treatment or coating retains its protective properties even after withstanding the tests prescribed by this subpart.

        (l)  Following each design qualification test and each periodic retest on an IBC, a test report must be prepared.

        (1) The test report must be maintained at each location where the packaging is manufactured, certified, and a design qualification test or periodic retest is conducted as follows:

        (2) The test report must be made available to a user of a packaging or a representative of the Department upon request. The test report, at a minimum, must contain the following information:

        (i) Name and address of test facility;

        (ii) Name and address of the person certifying the IBC;

        (iii) A unique test report identification;

        (iv) Date of test report;

        (v) Manufacturer of the IBC;

        (3) Flexible IBCs must be filled to the maximum permissible gross mass; the contents must be evenly distributed.

        (4) Rigid plastic IBCs and composite IBCs with plastic inner receptacles must be conditioned for testing by reducing the temperature of the packaging and its contents to −18 °C (0 °F) or lower. Test liquids must be kept in the liquid state, if necessary, by the addition of anti-freeze. Water/anti-freeze solutions with a minimum specific gravity of 0.95 for testing at −18 °C (0 °F) or lower are considered acceptable test liquids, and may be considered equivalent to water for test purposes. IBCs conditioned in this way are not required to be conditioned in accordance with § 178.802.

        (c)  (1) Samples of all IBC design types must be dropped onto a rigid, non-resilient, smooth, flat and horizontal surface. The point of impact must be the most vulnerable part of the base of the IBC being tested. Following the drop, the IBC must be restored to the upright position for observation.

        (2) IBC design types with a capacity of 0.45 cubic meters (15.9 cubic feet) or less must be subject to an additional drop test. The same IBC or a different IBC of the same design may be used for each drop.

        (d)  (1) For all IBCs, drop heights are specified as follows:

        (i) Packing Group I: 1.8 m (5.9 feet).

        (ii) Packing Group II: 1.2 m (3.9 feet).

        (2) Drop tests are to be performed with the solid or liquid to be transported or with a non-hazardous material having essentially the same physical characteristics.

        (3) The specific gravity and viscosity of a substituted non-hazardous material used in the drop test for liquids must be similar to the hazardous material intended for transportation. Water also may be used for the liquid drop test under the following conditions:

        (i) Where the substances to be carried have a specific gravity not exceeding 1.2, the drop heights must be those specified in paragraph (d)(1) of this section for each IBC design type; and

        (ii) Where the substances to be carried have a specific gravity exceeding 1.2, the drop heights must be as follows:

        (A) Packing Group I: SG × 1.5 m (4.9 feet).

        (B) Packing Group II: SG × 1.0 m (3.3 feet).

        (C) Packing Group III: SG × 0.67 m (2.2 feet).

        (e)  For all IBC design types, there may be no damage which renders the IBC unsafe to be transported for salvage or for disposable, and no loss of contents. The IBC shall be capable of being lifted by an appropriate means until clear of the floor for five minutes. A slight discharge from a closure upon impact is not considered to be a failure of the IBC provided that no further leakage occurs. A slight discharge (e.g., from closures or stitch holes) upon impact is not considered a failure of the flexible IBC provided that no further leakage occurs after the IBC has been raised clear of the ground.

#### § § 178.813

        (a)  The leakproofness test must be conducted for the qualification of all IBC design types and on all production units intended to contain solids that are loaded or discharged under pressure or intended to contain liquids.

        (b)  Vented closures must either be replaced by similar non-vented closures or the vent must be sealed. For metal IBC design types, the initial test must be carried out before the fitting of any thermal insulation equipment. The inner receptacle of a composite IBC may be tested without the outer packaging provided the test results are not affected.

        (c)  The leakproofness test must be carried out for a suitable length of time using air at a gauge pressure of not less than 20 kPa (2.9 psig). Leakproofness of IBC design types must be determined by coating the seams and joints with a heavy oil, a soap solution and water, or other methods suitable for the purpose of detecting leaks. Other methods, if at least equally effective, may be used in accordance with appendix B of this part, or if approved by the Associate Administrator, as provided in § 178.801(i)).

        (d)  For all IBC design types intended to contain solids that are loaded or discharged under pressure or intended to contain liquids, there may be no leakage of air from the IBC.

        (ii) The calculated superimposed test load weight loaded on either a flat plate or a reproduction of the base of the IBC, which is stacked on the test IBC.

        (5)  For all IBCs, the load to be placed on the IBC must be 1.8 times the combined maximum permissible gross mass of the number of similar IBCs that may be stacked on top of the IBC during transportation.

        (d)  (1) The package must be tested in acc_or_dance with paragraph (c) of this section;

        (2) The packaging may be tested using a dynamic compression testing machine. The test must be conducted at room temperature on an empty, unsealed packaging.

An initial preload of 50 pounds must be applied to ensure a definite contact between the test sample and the platens. The distance between the platens at this time must be recorded as zero deformation. The force “A” then to be applied must be calculated using the applicable formula:

        (e)  (1) For metal, rigid plastic, and composite IBCs, there may be no permanent deformation, which renders the IBC unsafe for transportation, and no loss of contents.

        (2) For fiberboard and wooden IBCs, there may be no loss of contents and no permanent deformation, which renders the whole IBC, including the base pallet, unsafe for transportation.

        (3) For flexible IBCs, there may be no deterioration, which renders the IBC unsafe for transportation, and no loss of contents.

        (4) For the dynamic compression test, a container passes the test if, after application of the required load, there is no permanent deformation to the IBC, which renders the whole IBC, including the base pallet, unsafe for transportation; in no case may the maximum deflection exceed one inch.

      Subpart Q—Testing of Large Packagings

**Source:** Source: 75 FR 5400, Feb. 2, 2010, unless otherwise noted.

        § 178.950   Purpose and scope.

#### § § 178.950

        This subpart prescribes certain testing requirements for Large Packagings identified in subpart P of this part.

        § 178.955   General requirements.

#### § § 178.955

        (a)  The test procedures prescribed in this subpart are intended to ensure that Large Packagings containing hazardous materials can withstand normal conditions of transportation. These test procedures are considered minimum requirements. Each packaging must be manufactured and assembled so as to be capable of successfully passing the prescribed tests and to conform to the requirements of § 173.24 of this subchapter while in transportation.

        (b)  The Large Packaging manufacturer is responsible for ensuring each Large Packaging is capable of passing the prescribed tests. To the extent a Large Packaging's assembly function, including final closure, is performed by the person who offers a hazardous material for transportation, that person is responsible for performing the function in accordance with §§ 173.22 and 178.2 of this subchapter.

        (c)  For the purpose of this subpart:

        (1)  refers to a Large Packaging which does not differ in structural design, size, material of construction and packing.

        (2)  is the performance of the drop, stacking, and bottom-lift or top-lift tests, as applicable, prescribed in this subpart, for each different Large Packaging design type, at the start of production of that packaging.

        (3)  is the performance of the applicable tests specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this section on a Large Packaging design type, to requalify the design for continued production at the frequency specified in paragraph (e) of this section.

        (4)  is the inspection, which must initially be conducted on each newly manufactured Large Packaging.

        (5)  is one which differs from a previously qualified Large Packaging design type in structural design, size, material of construction, wall thickness, or manner of construction, but does not include:

        (i) A packaging which differs in surface treatment;

        (ii) A rigid plastic Large Packaging, which differs with regard to additives used to comply with § 178.925(b) or § 178.940(b);

        (iii) A packaging which differs only in its lesser external dimensions ( height, width, length) provided materials of construction and material thickness or fabric weight remain the same;

        (6)  is a metal or rigid Large Packaging that is produced as a UN type from a non-UN type or is converted from one UN design type to another UN design type. _Remanufactured Large Packaging_s are subject to the same requirements of this subchapter that apply to new Large Packagings of the same type.

        (7)  is a Large Packaging intended to be refilled and has been examined and found free of defects affecting its ability to withstand the performance tests.  also § 173.36(c) of this subchapter.

        (d)  The packaging manufacturer must achieve successful test results for the design qualification testing at the start of production of each new or different Large Packaging design type. Application of the certification mark by the manufacturer constitutes certification that the Large Packaging design type passed the prescribed tests in this subpart.

        (e)  (1) Periodic design requalification must be conducted on each qualified Large Packaging design type if the manufacturer is to maintain authorization for continued production. The Large Packaging manufacturer must achieve successful test results for the periodic design requalification at sufficient frequency to ensure each packaging produced by the manufacturer is capable of passing the design qualification tests. Design requalification tests must be conducted at least once every 24 months.

        (2) Changes in the frequency of design requalification testing specified in paragraph (e)(1) of this section are authorized if approved by the Associate Administrator.

        (f)  The manufacturer must conduct the design qualification and periodic tests prescribed in this subpart using random samples of packagings, in the numbers specified in the appropriate test section.

        (g)  The selective testing of Large Packagings, which differ only in minor respects from a tested type is permitted as described in this section. For air transport, Large Packagings must comply with § 173.27(c)(1) and (c)(2) of this subchapter. Variations are permitted in inner packagings of a tested Large Packaging, without further testing of the package, provided an equivalent level of performance is maintained and the methodology used to determine that the inner packaging, including closure, maintains an equivalent level of performance is documented in writing by the person certifying compliance with this paragraph and retained in accordance with paragraph (l) of this section. Permitted variations are as follows:

        (1) Inner packagings of equivalent or smaller size may be used provided—

        (i) The inner packagings are of similar design to the tested inner packagings ( shape—round, rectangular, etc.);

        (ii) The material of construction of the inner packagings (glass, plastic, metal, etc.) offers resistance to impact and stacking forces equal to or greater than that of the originally tested inner packaging;

        (iii) The inner packagings have the same or smaller openings and the closure is of similar design (e.g., screw cap, friction lid, etc.);

        (iv) Sufficient additional cushioning material is used to take up void spaces and to prevent significant movement of the inner packagings;

        (v) Inner packagings are oriented within the outer packaging in the same manner as in the tested package; and

        (vi) The gross mass of the package does not exceed that originally tested.

        (2) A lesser number of the tested inner packagings, or of the alternative types of inner packagings identified in paragraph (g)(1) of this section, may be used provided sufficient cushioning is added to fill void space(s) and to prevent significant movement of the inner packagings.

        (h)  A Large Packaging differing from standards in subpart P of this part, or tested using methods other than those specified in this subpart, may be used if approved by the Associate Administrator. The Large Packagings and testing methods must be shown to have an equivalent level of safety.

        (i)  In addition to the periodic design requalification testing intervals specified in paragraph (e) of this section, the Associate Administrator, or a designated representative, may at any time require demonstration of compliance by a manufacturer, through testing in accordance with this subpart, to ensure packagings meet the requirements of this subpart. As required by the Associate Administrator, or a designated representative, the manufacturer must either:

        (1) Conduct performance tests or have tests conducted by an independent testing facility, in accordance with this subpart; or

        (2) Make a sample Large Packaging available to the Associate Administrator, or a designated representative, for testing in accordance with this subpart.

        (j)  Following each design qualification test and each periodic retest on a Large Packaging, a test report must be prepared.

        (1) The test report must be maintained at each location where the packaging is manufactured, certified, and a design qualification test or periodic retest is conducted as follows:

        (2) The test report must be made available to a user of a Large Packaging or a representative of the Department of Transportation upon request. The test report, at a minimum, must contain the following information:

        § 178.960   Preparation of Large Packagings for testing.

#### § § 178.960

        (a) Except as otherwise provided in this subchapter, each Large Packaging and package must be closed in preparation for testing and tests must be carried out in the same manner as if prepared for transportation, including inner packagings. All closures must be installed using proper techniques and torques.

        (b) For the drop and stacking test, inner receptacles must be filled to not less than 95 percent of maximum capacity ( § 171.8 of this subchapter) in the case of solids and not less than 98 percent of maximum in the case of liquids. Bags must be filled to the maximum mass at which they may be used. For Large Packagings where the inner packagings are designed to carry liquids and solids, separate testing is required for both liquid and solid contents. The material to be transported in the packagings may be replaced by a non-hazardous material, except for chemical compatibility testing or where this would invalidate the results of the tests.

        (c) If the material to be transported is replaced for test purposes by a non-hazardous material, the material used must be of the same or higher specific gravity as the material to be carried, and its other physical properties (grain, size, viscosity) which might influence the results of the required tests must correspond as closely as possible to those of the hazardous material to be transported. It is permissible to use additives, such as bags of lead shot, to achieve the requisite total package mass, so long as they do not affect the test results.

        (d) Paper or fiberboard Large Packagings must be conditioned for at least 24 hours immediately prior to testing in an atmosphere maintained—

        (1) At 50 percent ±2 percent relative humidity, and at a temperature of 23 °C ±2 °C (73 °F ±4 °F). Average values should fall within these limits. Short-term fluctuations and measurement limitations may cause individual measurements to vary by up to ±5 percent relative humidity without significant impairment of test reproducibility;

        (2) At 65 percent ±2 percent relative humidity, and at a temperature of 20 °C ±2 °C (68 °F ±4 °F), or 27 °C ±2 °C (81 °F ±4 °F). Average values should fall within these limits. Short-term fluctuations and measurement limitations may cause individual measurements to vary by up to ±5 percent relative humidity without significant impairment of test reproducibility; or

        (3) For testing at periodic intervals only ( other than initial design qualification testing), at ambient conditions.

        § 178.965   Drop test.

#### § § 178.965

        (a)  The drop test must be conducted for the qualification of all Large Packaging design types and performed periodically as specified in § 178.955(e) of this subpart.

        (b)  Large Packagings must be filled in accordance with § 178.960.

        (c)  Rigid plastic Large Packagings and Large Packagings with plastic inner receptacles must be conditioned for testing by reducing the temperature of the packaging and its contents to −18 °C (0 °F) or lower. Test liquids must be kept in the liquid state, if necessary, by the addition of anti-freeze. Water/anti-freeze solutions with a minimum specific gravity of 0.95 for testing at −18 °C (0 °F) or lower are considered acceptable test liquids, and may be considered equivalent to water for test purposes. Large Packagings conditioned in this way are not required to be conditioned in accordance with § 178.960(d).

        (d)  (1) Samples of all Large Packaging design types must be dropped onto a rigid, non-resilient, smooth, flat and horizontal surface. The point of impact must be the most vulnerable part of the base of the Large Packaging being tested. Following the drop, the Large Packaging must be restored to the upright position for observation.

        (2) Large Packaging design types with a capacity of 0.45 cubic meters (15.9 cubic feet) or less must be subject to an additional drop test.

        (e)  (1) For all Large Packagings, drop heights are specified as follows:

        (i) Packing group I: 1.8 m (5.9 feet)

        (ii) Packing group II: 1.2 m (3.9 feet)

        (iii) Packing group III: 0.8 m (2.6 feet)

        (2) Drop tests are to be performed with the solid or liquid to be transported or with a non-hazardous material having essentially the same physical characteristics.

        (3) The specific gravity and viscosity of a substituted non-hazardous material used in the drop test for liquids must be similar to the hazardous material intended for transportation. Water also may be used for the liquid drop test under the following conditions:

        (i) Where the substances to be carried have a specific gravity not exceeding 1.2, the drop heights must be those specified in paragraph (e)(1) of this section for each Large Packaging design type; and

        (ii) Where the substances to be carried have a specific gravity exceeding 1.2, the drop heights must be as follows:

        (A) Packing Group I: SG × 1.5 m (4.9 feet).

        (B) Packing Group II: SG × 1.0 m (3.3 feet).

        (1) On cars with center sills, a ball valve may be welded to the outside bottom of the tank or mounted on a pad or nozzle with a tongue and groove or male and female flange attachment, but in no case shall the breakage groove or equivalent extend below the bottom flange of the center sill. On cars without continuous center sills, a ball valve may be welded to the outside bottom of the tank or mounted with a tongue and groove or male and female flange attachment on a pad attached to the outside bottom of the tank. The mounting pad must have a maximum thickness of 2  inches measured on the longitudinal centerline of the tank. The valve operating mechanism must be provided with a suitable locking arrangement to insure positive closure during transit.

        (2) When internal bottom outlet valve is used in liquefied flammable gas service, the outlet of the valve must be equipped with an excess flow valve of approved design, except when a quick-closing internal valve of approved design is used. Protective housing is not required.

        (3) Bottom outlet must be equipped with a liquid tight closure at its lower end.

        (b) Bottom outlet equipment must be of approved design and must meet the following requirements:

        (1) The extreme projection of the bottom outlet equipment may not be more than allowed by appendix E of the AAR Specifications for Tank Cars (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter). All bottom outlet reducers and closures and their attachments shall be secured to the car by at least   inch chain, or its equivalent, except that bottom outlet closure plugs may be attached by   inch chain. When the bottom outlet closure is of the combination cap and valve type, the pipe connection to the valve shall be closed by a plug, cap, or approved quick coupling device. The bottom outlet equipment should include only the valve, reducers and closures that are necessary for the attachment of unloading fixtures. The permanent attachment of supplementary exterior fittings must be approved by the AAR Committee on Tank Cars.

        (2) To provide for the attachment of unloading connections, the discharge end of the bottom outlet nozzle or reducer, the valve body of the exterior valve, or some fixed attachment thereto, shall be provided with one of the following arrangements or an approved modification thereof. (See appendix E. Fig. E17 of the AAR Specifications for Tank Cars for illustrations of some of the possible arrangements.)

        (i) A bolted flange closure arrangement including a minimum 1-inch NPT pipe plug (see Fig. E17.1) or including an auxiliary valve with a threaded closure.

        (ii) A threaded cap closure arrangement including a minimum 1-inch NPT pipe plug (see Fig. E17.2) or including an auxiliary valve with a threaded closure.

        (iii) A quick-coupling device using a threaded plug closure of at least 1-inch NPT or having a threaded cap closure with a minimum 1-inch NPT pipe plug (see Fig. E17.3 through E17.5). A minimum 1-inch auxiliary test valve with a threaded closure may be substituted for the 1-inch pipe plug (see Fig E17.6). If the threaded cap closure does not have a pipe plug or integral auxiliary test valve, a minimum 1-inch NPT pipe plug shall be installed in the outlet nozzle above the closure (see Fig. E17.7).

        (iv) A two-piece quick-coupling device using a clamped dust cap must include an in-line auxiliary valve, either integral with the quick-coupling device or located between the primary bottom outlet valve and the quick-coupling device. The quick-coupling device closure dust cap or outlet nozzle shall be fitted with a minimum 1-inch NPT closure (see Fig. E17.8 and E17.9).

        (3) The valve operating mechanism must be provided with a suitable locking arrangement to insure positive closure during transit.

        (4) If the outlet nozzle extends 6 inches or more from shell of tank, a V-shaped breakage groove shall be cut (not cast) in the upper part to the outlet nozzle at a point immediately below the lowest part of value closest to the tank. In no case may the nozzle wall thickness at the roof of the “V” be more than  -inch. On cars without continuous center sills, the breakage groove or its equivalent may not be more than 15 inches below the tank shell. On cars with continuous center sills, the breakage groove or its equivalent must be above the bottom of the center sill construction.

        (5) The valve body must be of a thickness which will insure that accidental breakage of the outlet nozzle will occur at or below the “V” groove, or its equivalent, and will not cause distortion of the valve seat or valve.

        (b)  No person may represent that a repair or requalification of a cylinder has been performed in accordance with the requirements in this subchapter unless that person holds a current approval issued under the procedural requirements prescribed in subpart I of part 107 of this chapter. No person may mark a cylinder with a RIN and a requalification date or otherwise represent that a DOT specification or special permit cylinder has been requalified unless all applicable requirements of this subpart have been met. A person who requalifies cylinders must maintain the records prescribed in § 180.215 at each location at which it inspects, tests, or marks cylinders.

        (c)  Each cylinder bearing a DOT, CRC, BTC, or CTC specification marking must be requalified and marked as specified in the requalification table in § 180.209(a) or requalified and marked by a facility registered by Transport Canada in accordance with the Transport Canada TDG Regulations (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter). Each cylinder bearing both a TC specification marking and also marked with a corresponding DOT specification marking must be requalified and marked as specified in the requalification table in § 180.209(a) or requalified and marked by a facility registered by Transport Canada in accordance with the Transport Canada TDG Regulations. Each cylinder bearing a DOT special permit (or exemption) number must be requalified and marked in conformance with this section and the terms of the applicable special permit (or exemption). Each cylinder bearing only a TC mark must be requalified and marked as specified in the Transport Canada TDG Regulations, except that registration with Transport Canada is not required and cylinders must be marked with the requalifier's DOT issued requalifier identification number. No cylinder may be filled with a hazardous material and offered for transportation in commerce unless that cylinder has been successfully requalified and marked in accordance with this subpart. A cylinder may be requalified at any time during or before the month and year that the requalification is due. However, a cylinder filled before the requalification becomes due may remain in service until it is emptied. A cylinder with a specified service life may not be refilled and offered for transportation after its authorized service life has expired.

        (1) Each cylinder that is requalified in accordance with the requirements specified in this section must be marked in accordance with § 180.213 or the requirements of the Transport Canada TDG Regulations, or in the case of a TC cylinder requalified in the United States by a DOT RIN holder, in accordance with the requirements of the Transport Canada TDG Regulations except that registration with Transport Canada is not required and cylinders must be marked with the requalifiers DOT issued requalifier identification number.

        (2) Each cylinder that fails requalification must be:

        (i) Rejected and may be repaired or rebuilt in accordance with § 180.211 or § 180.212, as appropriate; or

        (ii) Condemned in accordance with paragraph (i) of this section.

        § 180.209   Requirements for requalification of specification cylinders.

#### § § 180.209

        (a)  Each specification cylinder that becomes due for periodic requalification, as specified in the following table, must be requalified and marked in conformance with the requirements of this subpart. Requalification records must be maintained in accordance with § 180.215. Table 1 follows:

        (b)  (1) A cylinder conforming to specification DOT 3A or 3AA with a water capacity of 56.7 kg (125 lb) or less that is removed from any cluster, bank, group, rack, or vehicle each time it is filled, may be requalified every ten years instead of every five years, provided the cylinder conforms to all of the following conditions:

        (i) The cylinder was manufactured after December 31, 1945.

        (ii) The cylinder is used exclusively for air; argon; cyclopropane; ethylene; helium; hydrogen; krypton; neon; nitrogen; nitrous oxide; oxygen; sulfur hexafluoride; xenon; chlorinated hydrocarbons, fluorinated hydrocarbons, liquefied hydrocarbons, and mixtures thereof that are commercially free from corroding components; permitted mixtures of these gases ( § 173.301(d) of this subchapter); and permitted mixtures of these gases with up to 30 percent by volume of carbon dioxide, provided the gas has a dew point at or below minus (52 °F) at 1 atmosphere.

        (iii) [Reserved]

        (iv) The cylinder is dried immediately after hydrostatic testing to remove all traces of water.

        (v) The cylinder is not used for underwater breathing.

        (vi) Each cylinder is stamped with a five-pointed star at least one-fourth of an inch high immediately following the test date.

        (2) If, since the last required requalification, a cylinder has not been used exclusively for the gases specifically identified in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, but currently conforms with all other provisions of paragraph (b)(1) of this section, it may be requalified every 10 years instead of every five years, provided it is first requalified and examined as prescribed by § 173.302a(b) (2), (3) and (4) of this subchapter.

        (3) Except as specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, if a cylinder, marked with a star, is filled with a compressed gas other than as specified in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, the star following the most recent test date must be obliterated. The cylinder must be requalified five years from the marked test date, or prior to the first filling with a compressed gas, if the required five-year requalification period has passed.

        (c)  A DOT 4-series cylinder, except a 4L cylinder, that at any time shows evidence of a leak, internal or external corrosion, denting, bulging or rough usage to the extent that it is likely to be weakened appreciably, or that has lost 5 percent or more of its official tare weight must be requalified before being refilled and offered for transportation. (Refer to CGA C-6 or C-6.3 (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter), as applicable, regarding cylinder weakening.) After testing, the actual tare weight must be recorded as the new tare weight on the test report and marked on the cylinder. The previous tare weight must be strike-lined through, but not obliterated.

        (d)  A cylinder of 5.44 kg (12 lb) or less water capacity authorized for service pressure of 300 psig or less must be given a complete external visual inspection at the time periodic requalification becomes due. External visual inspection must be in accordance with CGA C-6 or CGA C-6.1 (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter). The cylinder may be proof pressure tested. The test is successful if the cylinder, when examined under test pressure, does not display a defect described in § 180.205(j)(1)(ii) or (iii). Upon successful completion of the test and inspection, the cylinder must be marked in accordance with § 180.213.

        (e)  A cylinder made in conformance with DOT Specifications 4B, 4BA, 4BW, or 4E protected externally by a suitable corrosion-resistant coating and used exclusively for non-corrosive gas that is commercially free from corroding components may be requalified by volumetric expansion testing every 12 years instead of every 5 years. As an alternative, the cylinder may be subjected to a proof pressure test at least two times the marked service pressure, but this latter type of test must be repeated every 10 years after expiration of the initial 12-year period. When subjected to a proof pressure test, as prescribed in CGA C-1 (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter), the cylinder must be carefully examined under test pressure and removed from service if a leak or defect is found.

        (f)  A cylinder conforming to specification DOT 3A, 3AA, 3B, 4BA, or 4BW having a service pressure of 300 psig or less and used exclusively for methyl bromide, liquid; mixtures of methyl bromide and ethylene dibromide, liquid; mixtures of methyl bromide and chlorpicrin, liquid; mixtures of methyl bromide and petroleum solvents, liquid; or methyl bromide and nonflammable, nonliquefied compressed gas mixtures, liquid; commercially free of corroding components, and protected externally by a suitable corrosion resistant coating (such as galvanizing or painting) and internally by a suitable corrosion resistant lining (such as galvanizing) may be tested every 10 years instead of every five years, provided a visual internal and external examination of the cylinder is conducted every five years in accordance with CGA Pamphlet C-6. The cylinder must be examined at each filling, and rejected if a dent, corroded area, leak or other condition indicates possible weakness.

        (g)  A cylinder conforming to a specification listed in the table in this paragraph (g) and used exclusively in the service indicated may, instead of a periodic hydrostatic test, be given a complete external visual inspection at the time periodic requalification becomes due. External visual inspection must be in conformance with CGA C-6 or C-6.3, as applicable. When this inspection is used instead of hydrostatic testing, subsequent inspections are required at five-year intervals after the first inspection. Inspections must be made only by persons holding a current RIN and the results recorded and maintained in conformance with § 180.215. Records must include: Date of inspection (month and year); DOT-specification number; cylinder identification (registered symbol and serial number, date of manufacture, and owner); type of cylinder protective coating (including statement as to need of refinishing or recoating); conditions checked ( leakage, corrosion, gouges, dents or digs in shell or heads, broken or damaged footring or protective ring or fire damage); and disposition of cylinder (returned to service, returned to cylinder manufacturer for repairs or condemned). A cylinder passing requalification by the external visual inspection must be marked in conformance with § 180.213. Specification cylinders must be in exclusive service as shown in table 2 to this paragraph (g):

        (h)  A cylinder conforming to specification DOT 3A, 3A480X, or 4AA480 used exclusively for anhydrous ammonia, commercially free from corroding components, and protected externally by a suitable corrosion-resistant coating (such as paint) may be requalified every 10 years instead of every five years.

        (i)  (1) Each owner of a DOT-8 series cylinder used to transport acetylene must have the cylinder shell and the porous filler requalified in accordance with CGA Pamphlet C-13 (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter). Requalification must be performed in accordance with the following schedule:

        (2) Unless requalified and marked in accordance with CGA Pamphlet C-13 before October 1, 1994, an acetylene cylinder must be requalified by a person who holds a current RIN.

        (3) If a cylinder valve is replaced, a cylinder valve of the same weight must be used or the tare weight of the cylinder must be adjusted to compensate for valve weight differential.

        (4) The person performing a visual inspection or requalification must record the results as specified in § 180.215.

        (5) The person performing a visual inspection or requalification must mark the cylinder as specified in § 180.213.

        (j)  Only a DOT-specification cylinder used as a fire extinguisher in conformance with § 173.309(a) of this subchapter may be requalified in conformance with this paragraph (j).

        § 180.213   Requalification markings.

#### § § 180.213

        (a)  Each cylinder or UN pressure receptacle requalified in accordance with this subpart with acceptable results must be marked as specified in this section. Required specification markings may not be altered or removed.

        (b)  Each cylinder must be plainly and permanently marked on the metal of the cylinder as permitted by the applicable specification. Unless authorized by the cylinder specification, marking on the cylinder sidewall is prohibited.

        (1) Requalification and required specification markings must be legible so as to be readily visible at all times. Illegible specification markings may be remarked on the cylinder as provided by the original specification. Requalification markings may be placed on any portion of the upper end of the cylinder excluding the sidewall, as provided in this section. Requalification and required specification markings that are illegible may be reproduced on a metal plate and attached as provided by the original specification.

        (2) Previous requalification markings may not be obliterated, except that, when the space originally provided for requalification dates becomes filled, additional dates may be added as follows:

        (i) All preceding requalification dates may be removed by peening provided that—

        (A) Permission is obtained from the cylinder owner;

        (B) The minimum wall thickness is maintained in accordance with manufacturing specifications for the cylinder; and

        (C) The original manufacturing test date is not removed.

        (ii) When the cylinder is fitted with a footring, additional dates may be marked on the external surface of the footring.

        (c)  The depth of requalification markings may not be greater than specified in the applicable specification. The markings must be made by stamping, engraving, scribing or applying a label embedded in epoxy that will remain legible and durable throughout the life of the cylinder, or by other methods that produce a legible, durable mark.

        (1) A cylinder used as a fire extinguisher (see § 180.209(j)) may be marked by using a pressure sensitive label.

        (2) For a DOT 3HT cylinder, when stamped, the test date and RIN must be applied by low-stress steel stamps to a depth no greater than that prescribed at the time of manufacture. Stamping on the sidewall is not authorized.

        (3) For a composite cylinder, the requalification markings must be applied on a pressure sensitive label, securely affixed and overcoated with epoxy in a manner prescribed by the cylinder manufacturer, near the original manufacturer's label. Stamping of the composite surface is not authorized.

        (d)  Each cylinder successfully passing requalification must be marked with the RIN set in a square pattern, between the month and year of the requalification date. The first character of the RIN must appear in the upper left corner of the square pattern; the second in the upper right; the third in the lower right; and the fourth in the lower left. Example: A cylinder requalified in September 2006, and approved by a person who has been issued RIN “A123”, would be marked plainly and permanently into the metal of the cylinder in accordance with location requirements of the cylinder specification or on a metal plate permanently secured to the cylinder in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section. An example of the markings prescribed in this paragraph (d) is as follows:

        (1) Upon written request, variation from the marking requirement may be approved by the Associate Administrator.

        (2) A cylinder subject to the requirements of § 171.23(a)(5) of this subchapter must be marked with the date and RIN in accordance with this paragraph (d) and paragraph (f)(11) of this section, or marked in accordance with the requalification authorized by the Associate Administrator in accordance with § 171.23(a)(5)(i) of this subchapter.

        (e)  The size of the markings must be at least 6.35 mm (  in.) high, except RIN characters must be at least 3.18 mm (  in.) high.

        (f)  Examples of required requalification markings for DOT specification and special permit cylinders are illustrated as follows:

        (1) For designation of the 5-year volumetric expansion test, 10-year volumetric expansion test for UN cylinders and cylinders conforming to § 180.209(f) and (h), or 12-year volumetric expansion test for fire extinguishers conforming to § 173.309(a) of this subchapter and cylinders conforming to § 180.209(e) and (g), the marking is as illustrated in paragraph (d) of this section.

#### § § 180.407

        (a)  (1) A cargo tank constructed in accordance with a DOT specification for which a test or inspection specified in this section has become due, may not be filled and offered for transportation or transported until the test or inspection has been successfully completed. This paragraph does not apply to any cargo tank filled prior to the test or inspection due date.

        (2) Except during a pressure test, a cargo tank may not be subjected to a pressure greater than its design pressure or MAWP.

        (3) A person witnessing or performing a test or inspection specified in this section must meet the minimum qualifications prescribed in § 180.409.

        (4) Each cargo tank must be evaluated in accordance with the acceptable results of tests and inspections prescribed in § 180.411.

        (5) Each cargo tank which has successfully passed a test or inspection specified in this section must be marked in accordance with § 180.415.

        (6) A cargo tank which fails a prescribed test or inspection must:

        (i) Be repaired and retested in accordance with § 180.413; or

        (ii) Be removed from hazardous materials service and the specification plate removed, obliterated or covered in a secure manner.

        (b)  Without regard to any other test or inspection requirements, a specification cargo tank must be tested and inspected in accordance with this section prior to further use if:

        (1) The cargo tank shows evidence of dents, cuts, gouges, corroded or abraded areas, leakage, or any other condition that might render it unsafe for hazardous materials service. At a minimum, any area of a cargo tank showing evidence of dents, cuts, digs, gouges, or corroded or abraded areas must be thickness tested in accordance with the procedures set forth in paragraphs (i)(2), (i)(3), (i)(5), (i)(6), (i)(9), and (i)(10) of this section and evaluated in accordance with the criteria prescribed in § 180.411. Any signs of leakage must be repaired in accordance with § 180.413. The suitability of any repair affecting the structural integrity of the cargo tank must be determined either by the testing required in the applicable manufacturing specification or in paragraph (g)(1)(iv) of this section.

        (2) The cargo tank has sustained damage to an extent that may adversely affect its lading retention capability. A damaged cargo tank must be pressure tested in accordance with the procedures set forth in paragraph (g) of this section.

        (3) The cargo tank has been out of hazardous materials transportation service for a period of one year or more. Each cargo tank that has been out of hazardous materials transportation service for a period of one year or more must be pressure tested in accordance with § 180.407(g) prior to further use.

        (4) [Reserved]

        (5) The Department so requires based on the existence of probable cause that the cargo tank is in an unsafe operating condition.

        (c)  Each specification cargo tank must be tested and inspected as specified in the following table by an inspector meeting the qualifications in § 180.409. The retest date shall be determined from the specified interval identified in the following table from the most recent inspection or the CTMV certification date.

        (d)  The following applies to the external visual inspection and testing of cargo tanks:

        (1) Where insulation precludes a complete external visual inspection as required by paragraphs (d)(2) through (d)(6) of this section, the cargo tank also must be given an internal visual inspection in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section. If external visual inspection is precluded because any part of the cargo tank wall is externally lined, coated, or designed to prevent an external visual inspection, those areas of the cargo tank must be internally inspected. If internal visual inspection is precluded because the cargo tank is lined, coated, or designed so as to prevent access for internal inspection, the tank must be hydrostatically or pneumatically tested in accordance with paragraph (g)(1)(iv) of this section. Those items able to be externally inspected must be externally inspected and noted in the inspection report.

        (2) The external visual inspection and testing must include as a minimum the following:

        (i) The tank shell and heads must be inspected for corroded or abraded areas, dents, distortions, defects in welds and any other conditions, including leakage, that might render the tank unsafe for transportation service;

        (ii) The piping, valves, and gaskets must be carefully inspected for corroded areas, defects in welds, and other conditions, including leakage, that might render the tank unsafe for transportation service;

        (iii) All devices for tightening manhole covers must be operative and there must be no evidence of leakage at manhole covers or gaskets;

        (iv) All emergency devices and valves including self-closing stop valves, excess flow valves and remote closure devices must be free from corrosion, distortion, erosion and any external damage that will prevent safe operation. Remote closure devices and self-closing stop valves must be functioned to demonstrate proper operation;

        (v) Missing bolts, nuts and fusible links or elements must be replaced, and loose bolts and nuts must be tightened;

        (vi) All markings on the cargo tank required by parts 172, 178 and 180 of this subchapter must be legible;

        (vii) [Reserved]

        (viii) All major appurtenances and structural attachments on the cargo tank including, but not limited to, suspension system attachments, connecting structures, and those elements of the upper coupler (fifth wheel) assembly that can be inspected without dismantling the upper coupler (fifth wheel) assembly must be inspected for any corrosion or damage which might prevent safe operation;

        (ix) For cargo tanks transporting lading corrosive to the tank, areas covered by the upper coupler (fifth wheel) assembly must be inspected at least once in each two year period for corroded and abraded areas, dents, distortions, defects in welds, and any other condition that might render the tank unsafe for transportation service. The upper coupler (fifth wheel) assembly must be removed from the cargo tank for this inspection.

        (3) All reclosing pressure relief valves must be externally inspected for any corrosion or damage which might prevent safe operation. All reclosing pressure relief valves on cargo tanks carrying lading corrosive to the valve must be removed from the cargo tank for inspection and testing. Each reclosing pressure relief valve required to be removed and tested must be tested according to the requirements set forth in paragraph (j) of this section.

        (4) Ring stiffeners or other appurtenances, installed on cargo tanks constructed of mild steel or high-strength, low-alloy steel, that create air cavities adjacent to the tank shell that do not allow for external visual inspection must be thickness tested in accordance with paragraphs (i)(2) and (i)(3) of this section, at least once every 2 years. At least four symmetrically distributed readings must be taken to establish an average thickness for the ring stiffener or appurtenance. If any thickness reading is less than the average thickness by more than 10%, thickness testing in accordance with paragraphs (i)(2) and (i)(3) of this section must be conducted from the inside of the cargo tank on the area of the tank wall covered by the appurtenance or ring stiffener.

        (5) Corroded or abraded areas of the cargo tank wall must be thickness tested in accordance with the procedures set forth in paragraphs (i)(2), (i)(3), (i)(5), (i)(6), (i)(9), and (i)(10) of this section.

        (6) The gaskets on any full opening rear head must be:

        (i) Visually inspected for cracks or splits caused by weather or wear; and

        (ii) Replaced if cuts or cracks which are likely to cause leakage, or are of a depth one-half inch or more, are found.

        (7) The inspector must record the results of the external visual examination as specified in § 180.417(b).

        (e)  (1) When the cargo tank is not equipped with a manhole or inspection opening, or the cargo tank design precludes an internal inspection, the tank shall be hydrostatically or pneumatically tested in accordance with 180.407(c) and (g).

        (2) The internal visual inspection must include as a minimum the following:

        (i) The tank shell and heads must be inspected for corroded and abraded areas, dents, distortions, defects in welds, and any other condition that might render the tank unsafe for transportation service.

        (ii) Tank liners must be inspected as specified in § 180.407(f).

        (3) Corroded or abraded areas of the cargo tank wall must be thickness tested in accordance with paragraphs (i)(2), (i)(3), (i)(5), (i)(6), (i)(9), and (i)(10) of this section.

        (4) The inspector must record the results of the internal visual inspection as specified in § 180.417(b).

        (f)  The integrity of the lining on all lined cargo tanks, when lining is required by this subchapter, must be verified at least once each year as follows:

        (1) Rubber (elastomeric) lining must be tested for holes as follows:

        (i) Equipment must consist of:

        (A) A high frequency spark tester capable of producing sufficient voltage to ensure proper calibration;

        (B) A probe with an “L” shaped 2.4 mm (0.09 inch) diameter wire with up to a 30.5 cm (12-inch) bottom leg (end bent to a 12.7 mm (0.5 inch) radius), or equally sensitive probe; and

        (C) A steel calibration coupon 30.5 cm × 30.5 cm (12 inches × 12 inches) covered with the same material and thickness as that to be tested. The material on the coupon shall have a test hole to the metal substrate made by puncturing the material with a 22 gauge hypodermic needle or comparable piercing tool.

        (ii) The probe must be passed over the surface of the calibration coupon in a constant uninterrupted manner until the hole is found. The hole is detected by the white or light blue spark formed. (A sound lining causes a dark blue or purple spark.) The voltage must be adjusted to the lowest setting that will produce a minimum 12.7 mm (0.5 inch) spark measured from the top of the lining to the probe. To assure that the setting on the probe has not changed, the spark tester must be calibrated periodically using the test calibration coupon, and the same power source, probe, and cable length.

        (iii) After calibration, the probe must be passed over the lining in an uninterrupted stroke.

        (iv) Holes that are found must be repaired using equipment and procedures prescribed by the lining manufacturer or lining installer.

        (2) Linings made of other than rubber (elastomeric material) must be tested using equipment and procedures prescribed by the lining manufacturer or lining installer.

        (3) Degraded or defective areas of the cargo tank liner must be removed and the cargo tank wall below the defect must be inspected. Corroded areas of the tank wall must be thickness tested in accordance with paragraphs (i)(2), (i)(3), (i)(5) and (i)(6) of this section.

        (4) The inspector must record the results of the lining inspection as specified in § 180.417(b).

        (g)  All components of the cargo tank wall, as defined in § 178.320(a) of this subchapter, must be pressure tested as prescribed by this paragraph.

        (1) —(i) As part of the pressure test, the inspector must perform an external and internal visual inspection, except that on an MC 338 cargo tank, or a cargo tank not equipped with a manhole or inspection opening, an internal inspection is not required.

        (ii) All self-closing pressure relief valves, including emergency relief vents and normal vents, must be removed from the cargo tank for inspection and testing according to the requirements in paragraph (j) of this section.

        (iii) Except for cargo tanks carrying lading corrosive to the tank, areas covered by the upper coupler (fifth wheel) assembly must be inspected for corroded and abraded areas, dents, distortions, defects in welds, and any other condition that might render the tank unsafe for transportation service. The upper coupler (fifth wheel) assembly must be removed from the cargo tank for this inspection.

        (iv) Each cargo tank must be tested hydrostatically or pneumatically to the internal pressure specified in the following table. At no time during the pressure test may a cargo tank be subject to pressures that exceed those identified in the following table:

        (v) [Reserved]

        (vi) Each cargo tank of a multi-tank cargo tank motor vehicle must be tested with the adjacent cargo tanks empty and at atmospheric pressure.

        (vii) All closures except pressure relief devices must be in place during the test. All prescribed loading and unloading venting devices rated at less than test pressure may be removed during the test. If retained, the devices must be rendered inoperative by clamps, plugs, or other equally effective restraining devices. Restraining devices may not prevent detection of leaks or damage the venting devices and must be removed immediately after the test is completed.

        (viii)  Each cargo tank, including its domes, must be filled with water or other liquid having similar viscosity, at a temperature not exceeding 100 °F. The cargo tank must then be pressurized to not less than the pressure specified in paragraph (g)(1)(iv) of this section. The cargo tank, including its closures, must hold the prescribed test pressure for at least 10 minutes during which time it shall be inspected for leakage, bulging or any other defect.

        (ix)  Pneumatic testing may involve higher risk than hydrostatic testing. Therefore, suitable safeguards must be provided to protect personnel and facilities should failure occur during the test. The cargo tank must be pressurized with air or an inert gas. The pneumatic test pressure in the cargo tank must be reached by gradually increasing the pressure to one-half of the test pressure. Thereafter, the pressure must be increased in steps of approximately one-tenth of the test pressure until the required test pressure has been reached. The test pressure must be held for at least 5 minutes. The pressure must then be reduced to the MAWP, which must be maintained during the time the entire cargo tank surface is inspected. During the inspection, a suitable method must be used for detecting the existence of leaks. This method must consist either of coating the entire surface of all joints under pressure with a solution of soap and water, or using other equally sensitive methods.

        (2) When testing an insulated cargo tank, the insulation and jacketing need not be removed unless it is otherwise impossible to reach test pressure and maintain a condition of pressure equilibrium after test pressure is reached, or the vacuum integrity cannot be maintained in the insulation space. If an MC 338 cargo tank used for the transportation of a flammable gas or oxygen, refrigerated liquid is opened for any reason, the cleanliness must be verified prior to closure using the procedures contained in § 178.338-15 of this subchapter.

        (3) Each MC 330 and MC 331 cargo tank constructed of quenched and tempered steel in accordance with Part UHT in Section VIII of the ASME Code (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter), or constructed of other than quenched and tempered steel but without postweld heat treatment, used for the transportation of anhydrous ammonia or any other hazardous materials that may cause corrosion stress cracking, must be internally inspected by the wet fluorescent magnetic particle method immediately prior to and in conjunction with the performance of the pressure test prescribed in this section. Each MC 330 and MC 331 cargo tank constructed of quenched and tempered steel in accordance with Part UHT in Section VIII of the ASME Code and used for the transportation of liquefied petroleum gas must be internally inspected by the wet fluorescent magnetic particle method immediately prior to and in conjunction with the performance of the pressure test prescribed in this section. The wet fluorescent magnetic particle inspection must be in accordance with Section V of the ASME Code and CGA Technical Bulletin TB-2 (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter). This paragraph does not apply to cargo tanks that do not have manholes. (See § 180.417(c) for reporting requirements.)

        (4) All pressure bearing portions of a cargo tank heating system employing a medium such as, but not limited to, steam or hot water for heating the lading must be hydrostatically pressure tested at least once every 5 years. The test pressure must be at least the maximum system design operating pressure and must be maintained for five minutes. A heating system employing flues for heating the lading must be tested to ensure against lading leakage into the flues or into the atmosphere.

        (5)  (i) Pressure testing is not required for MC 330 and MC 331 cargo tanks in dedicated sodium metal service.

        (ii) Pressure testing is not required for uninsulated lined cargo tanks, with a design pressure or MAWP of 15 psig or less, which receive an external visual inspection and a lining inspection at least once each year.

        (6)  A cargo tank that leaks, fails to retain test pressure or pneumatic inspection pressure, shows distortion, excessive permanent expansion, or other evidence of weakness that might render the cargo tank unsafe for transportation service, may not be returned to service, except as follows: A cargo tank with a heating system which does not hold pressure may remain in service as an unheated cargo tank if:

        (i) The heating system remains in place and is structurally sound and no lading may leak into the heating system, and

        (ii) The specification plate heating system information is changed to indicate that the cargo tank has no working heating system.

        (7) The inspector must record the results of the pressure test as specified in § 180.417(b).

        (h)  The following requirements apply to cargo tanks requiring a leakage test:

        (1) Each cargo tank must be tested for leaks in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section. The leakage test must include testing product piping with all valves and accessories in place and operative, except that any venting devices set to discharge at less than the leakage test pressure must be removed or rendered inoperative during the test. All internal or external self-closing stop valves must be tested for leak tightness. Each cargo tank of a multi-cargo tank motor vehicle must be tested with adjacent cargo tanks empty and at atmospheric pressure. Test pressure must be maintained for at least 5 minutes. Cargo tanks in liquefied compressed gas service must be externally inspected for leaks during the leakage test. Suitable safeguards must be provided to protect personnel should a failure occur. Cargo tanks may be leakage tested with hazardous materials contained in the cargo tank during the test. Leakage test pressure must be no less than 80% of MAWP marked on the specification plate except as follows:

        (i) A cargo tank with an MAWP of 690 kPa (100 psig) or more may be leakage tested at its maximum normal operating pressure provided it is in dedicated service or services; or

        (ii) An MC 330 or MC 331 cargo tank in dedicated liquified petroleum gas service may be leakage tested at not less than 414 kPa (60 psig).

        (iii) An operator of a specification MC 330 or MC 331 cargo tank, and a nonspecification cargo tank authorized under § 173.315(k) of this subchapter, equipped with a meter may check leak tightness of the internal self-closing stop valve by conducting a meter creep test. (See appendix B to this part.)

        (iv) An MC 330 or MC 331 cargo tank in dedicated service for anhydrous ammonia may be leakage tested at not less than 414 kPa (60 psig).

        (v) A non-specification cargo tank required by § 173.8(d) of this subchapter to be leakage tested, must be leakage tested at not less than 16.6 kPa (2.4 psig), or as specified in paragraph (h)(2) of this section.

        (2) Cargo tanks used to transport petroleum distillate fuels that are equipped with vapor collection equipment may be leak tested in accordance with the Environmental Protection Agency's “Method 27—Determination of Vapor Tightness of Gasoline Delivery Tank Using Pressure-Vacuum Test,” as set forth in Appendix A to 40 CFR part 60. Test methods and procedures and maximum allowable pressure and vacuum changes are in 40 CFR 63.425(e). The hydrostatic test alternative, using liquid in Environmental Protection Agency's “Method 27—Determination of Vapor Tightness of Gasoline Delivery Tank Using Pressure-Vacuum Test,” may not be used to satisfy the leak testing requirements of this paragraph. The test must be conducted using air.

        (3) A cargo tank that fails to retain leakage test pressure may not be returned to service as a specification cargo tank, except under conditions specified in § 180.411(d).

        (4) After July 1, 2000, Registered Inspectors of specification MC 330 and MC 331 cargo tanks, and nonspecification cargo tanks authorized under § 173.315(k) of this subchapter must visually inspect the delivery hose assembly and piping system while the assembly is under leakage test pressure utilizing the rejection criteria listed in § 180.416(g). Delivery hose assemblies not permanently attached to the cargo tank motor vehicle may be inspected separately from the cargo tank motor vehicle. In addition to a written record of the inspection prepared in accordance with § 180.417(b), the Registered Inspector conducting the test must note the hose identification number, the date of the test, and the condition of the hose assembly and piping system tested.

        (5) The inspector must record the results of the leakage test as specified in § 180.417(b).

        (i)  (1) The shell and head thickness of all unlined cargo tanks used for the transportation of materials corrosive to the tank must be measured at least once every 2 years, except that cargo tanks measuring less than the sum of the minimum prescribed thickness, plus one-fifth of the original corrosion allowance, must be tested annually.

        (2) Measurements must be made using a device capable of accurately measuring thickness to within ±0.002 of an inch.

        (3) Any person performing thickness testing must be trained in the proper use of the thickness testing device used in accordance with the manufacturer's instruction.

        (4) Thickness testing must be performed in the following areas of the cargo tank wall, as a minimum:

        (i) Areas of the tank shell and heads and shell and head area around any piping that retains lading;

        (ii) Areas of high shell stress such as the bottom center of the tank;

        (iii) Areas near openings;

        (iv) Areas around weld joints;

        (v) Areas around shell reinforcements;

        (vi) Areas around appurtenance attachments;

        (vii) Areas near upper coupler (fifth wheel) assembly attachments;

        (viii) Areas near suspension system attachments and connecting structures;

        (ix) Known thin areas in the tank shell and nominal liquid level lines; and

        (x) Connecting structures joining multiple cargo tanks of carbon steel in a self-supporting cargo tank motor vehicle.

        (5) Minimum thicknesses for MC 300, MC 301, MC 302, MC 303, MC 304, MC 305, MC 306, MC 307, MC 310, MC 311, and MC 312 cargo tanks are determined based on the definition of minimum thickness found in § 178.320(a) of this subchapter. The following Tables I and II identify the “In-Service Minimum Thickness” values to be used to determine the minimum thickness for the referenced cargo tanks. The column headed “Minimum Manufactured Thickness” indicates the minimum values required for new construction of DOT 400 series cargo tanks, found in Tables I and II of §§ 178.346-2, 178.347-2, and 178.348-2 of this subchapter. In-Service Minimum Thicknesses for MC 300, MC 301, MC 302, MC 303, MC 304, MC 305, MC 306, MC 307, MC 310, MC 311, and MC 312 cargo tanks are based on 90 percent of the manufactured thickness specified in the DOT specification, rounded to three places.

        (6) An owner of a cargo tank that no longer conforms to the minimum thickness prescribed for the design as manufactured may use the cargo tank to transport authorized materials at reduced maximum weight of lading or reduced maximum working pressure, or combinations thereof, provided the following conditions are met:

        (i) A Design Certifying Engineer must certify that the cargo tank design and thickness are appropriate for the reduced loading conditions by issuance of a revised manufacturer's certificate, and

        (ii) The cargo tank motor vehicle's nameplate must reflect the revised service limits.

        (7) An owner of a cargo tank that no longer conforms with the minimum thickness prescribed for the specification may not return the cargo tank to hazardous materials service. The tank's specification plate must be removed, obliterated or covered in a secure manner.

        (8) The inspector must record the results of the thickness test as specified in § 180.417(b).

        (9) For MC 331 cargo tanks constructed before October 1, 2003, minimum thickness shall be determined by the thickness indicated on the U1A form minus any corrosion allowance. For MC 331 cargo tanks constructed after October 1, 2003, the minimum thickness will be the value indicated on the specification plate. If no corrosion allowance is indicated on the U1A form then the thickness of the tank shall be the thickness of the material of construction indicated on the UIA form with no corrosion allowance.

        (7) An inspection of the required markings on the tank car for legibility.

        (e)  (1) Each tank car owner must ensure the structural elements on the tank car qualify with the applicable requirements of this subchapter. At a minimum, the structural integrity inspection and test must include:

        (i) All transverse fillet welds greater than 0.64 cm (0.25 inch) within 121.92 cm (4 feet) of the bottom longitudinal centerline except body bolster pad attachment welds;

        (ii) The termination of longitudinal fillet welds greater than 0.64 cm (0.25 inch) within 121.92 cm (4 feet) of the bottom longitudinal centerline; and

        (iii) The tank shell butt welds within 60.96 cm (2 feet) of the bottom longitudinal centerline, unless the tank car owner can determine by analysis (e.g., finite element analysis, damage-tolerance analysis, or service reliability assessment) that the structure will not develop defects that reduce the design level of safety and reliability or fail within its operational life or prior to the next required inspection. The owner must maintain all documentation used to make such determination at its principal place of business and make the data available to FRA or an authorized representative of the Department upon request.

        (2) For DOT 115 class tanks, paragraphs (e)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section apply only to the outer shell fillet welds and to the non-reinforced exposed outer shell butt welds.

        (3) The inspection requirements of paragraph (e)(1)(iii) of this section do not apply to reinforced tank shell butt welds until the time of lining removal or application for tank cars with an internal lead, glass, or rubber lining.

        (4) Each tank car facility must inspect and test the elements identified in paragraph (e)(1) of this section by one or more of the following methods:

        (i) Dye penetrant testing (PT);

        (ii) Radiographic examination (RT);

        (iii) Magnetic particle testing (MT);

        (iv) Ultrasonic testing (UT); and

        (v) Direct, remote, or enhanced visual inspection, using, for example, magnifiers, fiberscopes, borescopes, and/or machine vision technology (VT).

        (f)  (1) The tank car owner must ensure that each tank car facility measures the thickness of the tank car shell, heads, sumps, protective housing (, domes), and nozzles on each tank car by using a device capable of accurately measuring the thickness to within ±0.05 mm (±0.002 inch).

        (2) The tank car owner must ensure that each tank car has a thickness test measurement:

        (i) At the time of an internal coating or lining application or replacement, or

        (ii) At least once every ten (10) years for a tank that does not have an internal coating or lining, or

        (iii) At least once every five (5) years for a tank that does not have an internal coating or lining when:

        (A) The tank is used to transport a material that is corrosive or reactive to the tank (see Appendix D of this part) or service equipment as defined § 180.503, and

        (B) The remaining shell and head thickness is tested and determined to be at or below line C in Figure A of this paragraph.

        (3) For a localized repair of an internal coating or lining where a material corrosive to the tank or service equipment as defined § 180.503 has contacted the tank, a qualified individual must verify the coating or lining's conformance with paragraph (g) of this section by measuring the shell or head in the area of the repair. The thickness test applies only to the non-lined or coated repaired area, and is not a qualification event. Modification of the tank stencil is not required.

        (4) Operation of a tank car below the condemning limit for general corrosion or the condemning limit for localized corrosion (as shown in Figure A of this section) is prohibited.

        (5) For sumps, protective housing (, domes), nozzles, and nozzle reinforcing pads, the tank car owner must determine if any reduction in wall thickness affects the design levels of reliability and safety built into sump, protective housing, nozzle, or nozzle reinforcement. Each tank car owner must maintain at its principal place of business documentation describing the allowable thickness reductions for sumps, protective housings, and nozzles, and nozzle reinforcements. This documentation must be made available to FRA or an authorized representative of the Department upon request.

        (6) After repairs, alterations, conversions, modifications, or blasting of tank car that results in a reduction of the tank's thickness, and anytime a tank car coating or lining is removed, a qualified individual must measure the thickness of the tank in the area of reduced thickness to ensure that the thickness of the tank conforms to paragraph (g) of this section.

        (g)  (1) A tank car found with a thickness below the required minimum thickness after forming for its specification, as stated in part 179 of this subchapter, may continue in service if any reduction in the required minimum thickness is not more than that provided in the following table:

        (2) [Reserved]

        (h)  Each tank car owner must ensure qualification of the tank car safety systems. However, inspections of foam or cork insulation systems are not required.

        (i)  (1) At a minimum, the owner of an internal coating or lining applied to protect a tank used to transport a material that is corrosive or reactive to the tank must ensure an inspection adequate enough to detect defects or other conditions that could reduce the design level of reliability and safety of the tank is performed. In addition, the owner of a coating or lining of tank cars used to transport hazardous materials must ensure the lining complies with § 173.24(b)(2) and (b)(3) of this subchapter.

        (2) The owner of the internal coating or lining must establish and maintain a record of the service life of the coating or lining and commodity combination, that is, the specific hazardous materials that were loaded into a tank and the coating or lining in place at the time of loading. The owner of the internal coating or lining must use its knowledge of the service life of each coating or lining and commodity combination to establish an appropriate inspection interval for that coating or lining and commodity combination. This interval must not exceed eight (8) years, unless the coating or lining owner can establish, document, and show that the service history or scientific analysis of the coating or lining and commodity pairing supports a longer inspection interval. The owner must maintain at its principal place of business a written procedure for collecting and documenting the performance of the coating or lining applied within the tank car for its service life. The internal coating or lining owner must provide this documentation, including inspection and test, repair, removal, and application procedures, to the FRA or car owner upon request. Further, the offeror must provide commodity information to the car owner and the owner of the internal coating or lining upon request.

        (3) The owner of the internal coating or lining must provide the test method and acceptance criteria to the tank car owner and to the person responsible for qualifying the coating or lining. The tank car facility inspecting and testing the internal coating or lining must follow the inspection and test procedure, including the acceptance requirements, established by the internal coating or lining owner.

        (j)  Unless the design of the service equipment arrangement precludes it (e.g., there is no fitting to pressurize the tank), each owner of a tank car must ensure that the tank, service equipment, and closures installed, replaced, or reinstalled on the tank car are leak tested. The test may be conducted with the lading in the tank. When the test pressure exceeds the start-to-discharge or burst pressure of a pressure relief device, the device must be rendered inoperative. The written procedures and test method for leak testing must ensure the sensitivity and reliability of the test method to prevent premature failure. This section does not apply to facilities that remove closures for the sole purpose of loading or unloading the lading (e.g., blind flanges, pipe plugs, etc.).

        (k)  (1) Each tank car owner must ensure the qualification of tank car service equipment at least once every ten (10) years. The tank car owner must analyze the service equipment inspection and test results for any given lading and, based on the analysis, adjust the inspection and test frequency to ensure that the design level of reliability and safety of the equipment is met. The owner must maintain at its principal place of business all supporting documentation used to make such analyses and inspection and test frequency adjustments. The supporting documentation must be made available to FRA or an authorized representative of the Department upon request.

        (2) Each tank car facility must qualify service equipment, including reclosing pressure relief devices and interior heater systems in accordance with the applicable provisions of Appendix D of the AAR Specifications for Tank Cars (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter).

        (l)  When approved by the Associate Administrator for Railroad Safety, FRA, a tank car owner, or a coating or lining owner may use an alternative inspection and test procedure or interval based on a damage-tolerance analysis (that must include a determination of the probable locations and modes of damage due to fatigue, corrosion, and accidental damage), or based on a service reliability assessment (that must be supported by analysis of systematically collected data) in lieu of the other requirements of this section.

        (m)  (1) After July 1, 2000, each tank car with a metal jacket or with a thermal protection system shall have an inspection and test conforming to this section no later than the date the tank car requires a periodic hydrostatic pressure test (, the marked due date on the tank car for the hydrostatic test).

        (2) After July 1, 1998, each tank car without a metal jacket shall have an inspection and test conforming to this section no later than the date the tank car requires a periodic hydrostatic pressure test (, the marked due date on the tank car for the hydrostatic test).

        (3) For tank cars on a 20-year periodic hydrostatic pressure test interval (, Class DOT 103W, 104W, 111A60W1, 111A100W1, and 111A100W3 tank cars), the next inspection and test date is the midpoint between the compliance date in paragraph (l)(1) or (2) of this section and the remaining years until the tank would have had a hydrostatic pressure test.

        § 180.517   Reporting and record retention requirements.

#### § § 180.517

        (a)  Each owner of a specification tank car must retain the certificate of construction (AAR Form 4-2) and related papers certifying that the manufacture of the specification tank car identified in the documents is in accordance with the applicable specification. The builder's signature on the certificate of construction and the marking of the tank car with the tank specification is the representation that all of the appropriate inspections and tests were successfully performed to qualify the tank for use. The owner must retain the documents throughout the period of ownership of the specification tank car and for one year thereafter. Upon a change of ownership, the applicable provisions prescribed in Section 1.3.15 of the AAR Specifications for Tank Cars (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter) apply. The builder of the car or a facility performing work on the car may retain copies of relevant records.

        (b)  Each tank car that is inspected and tested as specified in § 180.509 must have a written report, in English, prepared according to this paragraph. Marking the tank car with the specification (or retaining the specification marking on the tank) is the representation that all of the appropriate inspections and tests were performed and the results meet the tank car owner's acceptance criteria to qualify the car for continued use. The report may be created and retained electronically, but, upon request by FRA for a copy of the report, it must be made available in common readable form. The owner must retain a copy of the inspection and test reports until successfully completing the next inspection and test of the same type. The inspection and test report must include the following:

        (1) Type of inspection and test performed (a checklist is acceptable);

        (2) The results of each inspection and test performed;

        (3) Tank car reporting mark and number;

        (4) Tank car specification;

        (5) Inspection and test date (month and year);

        (6) Location and description of defects found and method used to repair each defect;

        (7) The name and address of the tank car facility and the name and signature of inspector; and

        (8) The unique code (station stencil) identifying the facility.

        § 180.519   Periodic retest and inspection of tank cars other than single-unit tank car tanks.

#### § § 180.519

        (a)  Unless otherwise provided in this subpart, tanks designed to be removed from cars for filling and emptying and tanks built to a Class DOT 107A specification and their safety relief devices must be retested periodically as specified in Retest Table 1 of paragraph (b)(5) of this section. Retests may be made at any time during the calendar year the retest falls due.

        (b)  (1) Each tank must be subjected to the specified hydrostatic pressure and its permanent expansion determined. Pressure must be maintained for 30 seconds and for as long as necessary to secure complete expansion of the tank. Before testing, the pressure gauge must be shown to be accurate within 1 percent at test measure. The expansion gauge must be shown to be accurate, at test pressure, to within 1 percent. Expansion must be recorded in cubic cm. Permanent volumetric expansion may not exceed 10 percent of total volumetric expansion at test pressure and the tank must not leak or show evidence of distress.

        (2) Each tank, except tanks built to specification DOT 107A, must also be subjected to interior air pressure test of at least 100 psig under conditions favorable to detection of any leakage. No leaks may appear.

        (3) Safety relief valves must be retested by air or gas, must start-to-discharge at or below the prescribed pressure and must be vapor tight at or above the prescribed pressure.

        (4) Rupture discs and fusible plugs must be removed from the tank and visually inspected.

        (5) Tanks must be retested as specified in Retest Table 1 of this paragraph (b)(5), and before returning to service after repairs involving welding or heat treatment:

        (6) The month and year of test, followed by a “V” if visually inspected as described in paragraph (c) of this section, must be plainly and permanently stamped into the metal of one head or chime of each tank with successful test results; for example, 01-90 for January 1990. On DOT 107A**** tanks, the date must be stamped into the metal of the marked end, except that if all tanks mounted on a car have been tested, the date may be stamped into the metal of a plate permanently applied to the bulkhead on the “A” end of the car. Dates of previous tests and all prescribed markings must be kept legible.

        (c)  Tanks of Class DOT 106A and DOT 110A-W specifications (§§ 179.300 and 179.301 of this subchapter) used exclusively for transporting fluorinated hydrocarbons and mixtures thereof, and that are free from corroding components, may be given a periodic complete internal and external visual inspection in place of the periodic hydrostatic retest. Visual inspections shall be made only by competent persons. The tank must be accepted or rejected in accordance with the criteria in CGA C-6 (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter).

        (d)  The results of the pressure test and visual inspection must be recorded on a suitable data sheet. Completed copies of these reports must be retained by the owner and by the person performing the pressure test and visual inspection as long as the tank is in service. The information to be recorded and checked on these data sheets are: Date of test and inspection; DOT specification number; tank identification (registered symbol and serial number, date of manufacture and ownership symbol); type of protective coating (painted, etc., and statement as to need for refinishing or recoating); conditions checked (leakage, corrosion, gouges, dents or digs, broken or damaged chime or protective ring, fire, fire damage, internal condition); test pressure; results of tests; and disposition of tank (returned to service, returned to manufacturer for repair, or scrapped); and identification of the person conducting the retest or inspection.

      Subpart G—Qualification and Maintenance of Portable Tanks

**Source:** Source: 66 FR 33453, June 21, 2001, unless otherwise noted.

        § 180.601   Applicability.

#### § § 180.601

        This subpart prescribes requirements, in addition to those contained in parts 107, 171, 172, 173, and 178 of this subchapter, applicable to any person responsible for the continuing qualification, maintenance or periodic retesting of a portable tank.

        § 180.603   Qualification of portable tanks.

#### § § 180.603

        (a) Each portable tank used for the transportation of hazardous materials must be an authorized packaging.

        (b) To qualify as an authorized packaging, each portable tank must conform to the requirements of this subchapter and the applicable design specification to which the portable tank was constructed.

        (c) The following portable tanks are authorized for use provided they conform to all applicable safety requirements of this subchapter: 51, 56, 57, 60, IM 101, IM 102 and UN portable tanks.

        (d) A portable tank that also meets the definition of “container” in 49 CFR 450.3(a)(3) must conform to the requirements in parts 450 through 453 of this title for compliance with Annex II of the Convention for Safe Containers (CSC).

        (e)  The owner of a portable tank constructed in accordance with and used under an exemption issued prior to August 31, 1996, which was in conformance with the requirements for Specification DOT 51 portable tanks with the exception of the location of fill and discharge outlets, shall examine the portable tank and its design to determine if it meets the outlet requirements in effect on October 1, 1996. If the owner determines that the portable tank is in compliance with all requirements of the DOT 51 specification, the exemption number stenciled on the portable tank shall be removed and the specification plate (or a plate placed adjacent to the specification plate) shall be durably marked “DOT 51-E*****” (where ***** is to be replaced by the exemption number). During the period the portable tank is in service, and for one year thereafter, the owner of the portable tank must retain on file, at its principal place of business, a copy of the last exemption in effect.

        § 180.605   Requirements for periodic testing, inspection, and repair of portable tanks.

#### § § 180.605

        (a) A portable tank constructed in accordance with a DOT specification for which a test or inspection specified in this subpart has become due, must be tested or inspected prior to being returned for transportation.

        (b)  Without regard to any other test or inspection requirements, a Specification or UN portable tank must be tested and inspected in accordance with this section prior to further use if any of the following conditions exist:

        (1) The portable tank shows evidence of dents, corroded or abraded areas, leakage, or any other condition that might render it unsafe for transportation service.

        (2) The portable tank has been in an accident and has been damaged to an extent that may adversely affect its ability to retain the hazardous material.

        (3) The portable tank has been out of hazardous materials transportation service for a period of one year or more.

        (4) The portable tank has been modified from its original design specification.

        (5) The portable tank is in an unsafe operating condition.

        (c)  Each Specification portable tank must be tested and inspected in accordance with the following schedule:

        (1) Each IM or UN portable tank must be given an initial inspection and test before being placed into service, a periodic inspection and test at least once every 5 years, and an intermediate periodic inspection and test at least every 2.5 years following the initial inspection and the last 5 year periodic inspection and test.

        (2) Each Specification 51 portable tank must be given a periodic inspection and test at least once every five years.

        (3) Each Specification 56 or 57 portable tank must be given a periodic inspection and test at least once every 2.5 years.

        (4) Each Specification 60 portable tank must be given a periodic inspection and test at the end of the first 4-year period after the original test; at least once every 2 years thereafter up to a total of 12 years of service; and at least once annually thereafter. Retesting is not required on a rubber-lined tank except before each relining.

        (d)  For IM and UN portable tanks the intermediate 2.5 year periodic inspection and test must include at least an internal and external examination of the portable tank and its fittings taking into account the hazardous materials intended to be transported; a leakage test; and a test of the satisfactory operation of all service equipment. Sheathing, thermal insulation, etc. need only be removed to the extent required for reliable appraisal of the condition of the portable tank. For portable tanks intended for the transportation of a single hazardous material, the internal examination may be waived if it is leakage tested in accordance with the procedures in paragraph (h) of this section prior to each filling, or if approved by the Associate Administrator. Portable tanks used for dedicated transportation of refrigerated liquefied gases that are not fitted with inspection openings are excepted from the internal inspection requirement.

        (e)  The 5 year periodic inspection and test must include an internal and external examination and, unless excepted, a pressure test as specified in this section. Sheathing, thermal insulation, etc. need only to be removed to the extent required for reliable appraisal of the condition of the portable tank. Except for DOT Specification 56 and 57 portable tanks, reclosing pressure relief devices must be removed from the tank and tested separately unless they can be tested while installed on the portable tank. For portable tanks where the shell and equipment have been pressure-tested separately, after assembly they must be subjected together to a leakage test and effectively tested and inspected for corrosion. Portable tanks used for the transportation of refrigerated, liquefied gases are excepted from the requirement for internal inspection and the hydraulic pressure test during the 5-year periodic inspection and test, if the portable tanks were pressure tested to a minimum test pressure of 1.3 times the design pressure using an inert gas as prescribed in § 178.338-16(a) and (b) of this subchapter before putting the portable tank into service initially and after any exceptional inspections and tests specified in paragraph (f) of this section.

        (f)  The exceptional inspection and test is necessary when a portable tank shows evidence of damaged or corroded areas, or leakage, or other conditions that indicate a deficiency that could affect the integrity of the portable tank. The extent of the exceptional inspection and test must depend on the amount of damage or deterioration of the portable tank. It must include at least the inspection and a pressure test according to paragraph (e) of this section. Pressure relief devices need not be tested or replaced unless there is reason to believe the relief devices have been affected by the damage or deterioration.

        (g)  The internal and external examinations must ensure that:

        (1) The shell is inspected for pitting, corrosion, or abrasions, dents, distortions, defects in welds or any other conditions, including leakage, that might render the portable tank unsafe for transportation. The wall thickness must be verified by appropriate measurement if this inspection indicates a reduction of wall thickness;

        (2) The piping, valves, and gaskets are inspected for corroded areas, defects, and other conditions, including leakage, that might render the portable tank unsafe for filling, discharge or transportation;

        (3) Devices for tightening manhole covers are operative and there is no leakage at manhole covers or gaskets;

        (4) Missing or loose bolts or nuts on any flanged connection or blank flange are replaced or tightened;

        (5) All emergency devices and valves are free from corrosion, distortion and any damage or defect that could prevent their normal operation. Remote closure devices and self-closing stop-valves must be operated to demonstrate proper operation;

        (6) Required markings on the portable tank are legible and in accordance with the applicable requirements; and

        (7) The framework, the supports and the arrangements for lifting the portable tank are in satisfactory condition.

        (h)  (1) Each Specification 57 portable tank must be leak tested by a minimum sustained air pressure of at least 3 psig applied to the entire tank. Each Specification 51 or 56 portable tank must be tested by a minimum pressure (air or hydrostatic) of at least 2 psig or at least one and one-half times the design pressure (maximum allowable working pressure, or re-rated pressure) of the tank, whichever is greater. The leakage test for portable tanks used for refrigerated liquefied gas must be performed at 90% of MAWP. Leakage tests for all other portable tanks must be at a pressure of at least 25% of MAWP. During each air pressure test, the entire surface of all joints under pressure must be coated with or immersed in a solution of soap and water, heavy oil, or other material suitable for the purpose of detecting leaks. The pressure must be held for a period of time sufficiently long to assure detection of leaks, but in no case less than five minutes. During the air or hydrostatic test, relief devices may be removed, but all the closure fittings must be in place and the relief device openings plugged. Lagging need not be removed from a lagged tank if it is possible to maintain the required test pressure at constant temperature with the tank disconnected from the source of pressure.

        (2) Each Specification 60 portable tank must be retested by completely filling the tank with water or other liquid having a similar viscosity, the temperature of the liquid must not exceed 37.7 °C (100 °F) during the test, and applying a pressure of 60 psig. The portable tank must be capable of holding the prescribed pressure for at least 10 minutes without leakage, evidence of impending failure, or failure. All closures shall be in place while the test is made and the pressure shall be gauged at the top of the tank. Safety devices and/or vents shall be plugged during this test.

        (3) Each Specification IM or UN portable tank, except for UN portable tanks used for non-refrigerated and refrigerated liquefied gases, and all piping, valves and accessories, except pressure relief devices, must be hydrostatically tested with water, or other liquid of similar density and viscosity, to a pressure not less than 150% of its maximum allowable working pressure. UN portable tanks used for the transportation of non-refrigerated liquefied gases must be hydrostatically tested with water, or other liquid of similar density and viscosity, to a pressure not less than 130% of its maximum allowable working pressure. UN portable tanks used for the transportation of refrigerated liquefied gases may be tested hydrostatically or pneumatically using an inert gas to a pressure not less than 1.3 times the design pressure. For pneumatic testing, due regard for protection of all personnel must be taken because of the potential hazard involved in such a test. The pneumatic test pressure in the portable tank must be reached by gradually increasing the pressure to one-half of the test pressure. Thereafter, the test pressure must be increased in steps of approximately one-tenth of the test pressure until the required test pressure has been reached. The pressure must then be reduced to a value equal to four-fifths of the test pressure and held for a sufficient time to permit inspection of the portable tank for leaks. The minimum test pressure for a portable tank is determined on the basis of the hazardous materials that are intended to be transported in the portable tanks. For liquid, solid and non-refrigerated liquefied gases, the minimum test pressure for specific hazardous materials are specified in the applicable T Codes assigned to a particular hazardous material in the § 172.101 Table of this subchapter. While under pressure the tank shall be inspected for leakage, distortion, or any other condition which might render the tank unsafe for service. A portable tank fails to meet the requirements of the pressure test if, during the test, there is permanent distortion of the tank exceeding that permitted by the applicable specification; if there is any leakage; or if there are any deficiencies that would render the portable tank unsafe for transportation. Any portable tank that fails must be rejected and may not be used again for the transportation of a hazardous material unless the tank is adequately repaired, and, thereafter, a successful test is conducted in accordance with the requirements of this paragraph. An approval agency shall witness the hydrostatic or pneumatic test. Any damage or deficiency that might render the portable tank unsafe for service shall be repaired to the satisfaction of the witnessing approval agency. The repaired tank must be retested to the original pressure test requirements. Upon successful completion of the hydrostatic or pneumatic test, as applicable, the witnessing approval agency shall apply its name, identifying mark or identifying number in accordance with paragraph (k) of this section.

        (i)  When evidence of any unsafe condition is discovered, the portable tank may not be returned to service until it has been repaired and the pressure test is repeated and passed.

        (j)  The repair of a portable tank is authorized, provided such repairs are made in accordance with the requirements prescribed in the specification for the tank's original design and construction. In addition to any other provisions of the specification, no portable tank may be repaired so as to cause leakage or cracks or so as to increase the likelihood of leakage or cracks near areas of stress concentration due to cooling metal shrinkage in welding operations, sharp fillets, reversal of stresses, or otherwise. No field welding may be done except to non-pressure parts. Any cutting, burning or welding operations on the shell of an IM or UN portable tank must be done with the approval of the approval agency and be done in accordance with the requirements of this subchapter, taking into account the pressure vessel code used for the construction of the shell. A pressure test to the original test pressure must be performed after the work is completed.

        (k)  (1) Each IM or UN portable tank must be durably and legibly marked, in English, with the date (month and year) of the last pressure test, the identification markings of the approval agency witnessing the test, when required, and the date of the last visual inspection. The marking must be placed on or near the metal identification plate, in letters and numerals of not less than 3 mm (0.118 inches) high when on the metal identification plate, and 12 mm (0.47 inches) high when on the portable tank.

        (2) Each Specification DOT 51, 56, 57 or 60 portable tank must be durably and legibly marked, in English, with the date (month and year) of the most recent periodic retest. The marking must be placed on or near the metal certification plate and must be in accordance with § 178.3 of this subchapter. The letters and numerals must not be less than 3 mm (0.118 inches) high when on the metal certification plate, and 12 mm (0.47 inches) high when on the portable tank, except that a portable tank manufactured under a previously authorized specification may continue to be marked with smaller markings if originally authorized under that specification (for example, DOT Specification 57 portable tanks).

        (l)  (1) The owner of each portable tank or his authorized agent shall retain a written record of the date and results of all required inspections and tests, including an ASME manufacturer's date report, if applicable, and the name and address of the person performing the inspection or test, in accordance with the applicable specification. The manufacturer's data report, including a certificate(s) signed by the manufacturer, and the authorized design approval agency, as applicable, indicating compliance with the applicable specification of the portable tank, and related papers certifying that the portable tank was manufactured and tested in accordance with the applicable specification must be retained in the files of the owner, or his authorized agent, during the time that such portable tank is used for such service, except for Specifications 56 and 57 portable tanks.

        (2) If the owner does not have the manufacturer's certificate required by the specification and the manufacturer's data report required by the ASME, the owner may contact the National Board for a copy of the manufacturer's data report, if the portable tank was registered with the National Board, or copy the information contained on the portable tanks specification plate and ASME Code data plates.

        § 190.7   Subpoenas; witness fees.

#### § § 190.7

        (a) The Administrator, Chief Counsel, or the official designated by the Administrator to preside over a hearing convened in accordance with this part, may sign and issue subpoenas individually on his or her own initiative at any time, including pursuant to an inspection or investigation, or upon request and adequate showing by a participant to an enforcement proceeding that the information sought will materially advance the proceeding.

        (b) A subpoena may require the attendance of a witness, or the production of documentary or other tangible evidence in the possession or under the control of person served, or both.

        (c) A subpoena may be served personally by any person who is not an interested person and is not less than 18 years of age, or by certified mail.

        (d) Service of a subpoena upon the person named in the subpoena is achieved by delivering a copy of the subpoena to the person and by paying the fees for one day's attendance and mileage, as specified by paragraph (g) of this section. When a subpoena is issued at the instance of any officer or agency of the United States, fees and mileage need not be tendered at the time of service. Delivery of a copy of a subpoena and tender of the fees to a natural person may be made by handing them to the person, leaving them at the person's office with a person in charge, leaving them at the person's residence with a person of suitable age and discretion residing there, by mailing them by certified mail to the person at the last known address, or by any method whereby actual notice is given to the person and the fees are made available prior to the return date.

        (e) When the person to be served is not a natural person, delivery of a copy of the subpoena and tender of the fees may be achieved by handing them to a designated agent or representative for service, or to any officer, director, or agent in charge of any office of the person, or by mailing them by certified mail to that agent or representative and the fees are made available prior to the return date.

        (f) The original subpoena bearing a certificate of service shall be filed with the official having responsibility for the proceeding in connection with which the subpoena was issued.

        (g) A subpoenaed witness shall be paid the same fees and mileage as would be paid to a witness in a proceeding in the district courts of the United States. The witness fees and mileage shall be paid by the person at whose instance the subpoena was issued.

        (h) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (g) of this section, and upon request, the witness fees and mileage may be paid by the PHMSA if the official who issued the subpoena determines on the basis of good cause shown, that:

        (1) The presence of the subpoenaed witness will materially advance the proceeding; and

        (2) The person at whose instance the subpoena was issued would suffer a serious hardship if required to pay the witness fees and mileage.

        (i) Any person to whom a subpoena is directed may, prior to the time specified therein for compliance, but in no event more than 10 days after the date of service of such subpoena, apply to the official who issued the subpoena, or if the person is unavailable, to the Administrator to quash or modify the subpoena. The application shall contain a brief statement of the reasons relied upon in support of the action sought therein. The Administrator, or this issuing official, as the case may be, may:

        (1) Deny the application;

        (2) Quash or modify the subpoena; or

        (3) Condition a grant or denial of the application to quash or modify the subpoena upon the satisfaction of certain just and reasonable requirements. The denial may be summary.

        (j) Upon refusal to obey a subpoena served upon any person under the provisions of this section, the PHMSA may request the Attorney General to seek the aid of the U. S. District Court for any District in which the person is found to compel that person, after notice, to appear and give testimony, or to appear and produce the subpoenaed documents before the PHMSA, or both.

        § 190.9   Petitions for finding or approval.

#### § § 190.9

        (a) In circumstances where a rule contained in parts 192, 193 and 195 of this chapter authorizes the Administrator to make a finding or approval, an operator may petition the Administrator for such a finding or approval.

        (b) Each petition must refer to the rule authorizing the action sought and contain information or arguments that justify the action. Unless otherwise specified, no public proceeding is held on a petition before it is granted or denied. After a petition is received, the Administrator or participating state agency notifies the petitioner of the disposition of the petition or, if the request requires more extensive consideration or additional information or comments are requested and delay is expected, of the date by which action will be taken.

        (1) For operators seeking a finding or approval involving intrastate pipeline transportation, petitions must be sent to:

        Specific Relief

          § 190.233   Corrective action orders.

#### § § 190.233

          (a)  Except as provided by paragraph (b) of this section, if the Associate Administrator finds, after reasonable notice and opportunity for hearing in accord with paragraph (c) of this section, a particular pipeline facility is or would be hazardous to life, property, or the environment, the Associate Administrator may issue an order pursuant to this section requiring the operator of the facility to take corrective action. Corrective action may include suspended or restricted use of the facility, physical inspection, testing, repair, replacement, or other appropriate action.

          (b)  The Associate Administrator may waive the requirement for notice and opportunity for hearing under paragraph (a) of this section before issuing an order whenever the Associate Administrator determines that the failure to do so would result in the likelihood of serious harm to life, property, or the environment. When an order is issued under this paragraph, a respondent that contests the order may obtain expedited review of the order either by answering in writing to the order within 10 days of receipt or requesting a hearing under § 190.211 to be held as soon as practicable in accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of this section. For purposes of this section, the term “expedited review” is defined as the process for making a prompt determination of whether the order should remain in effect or be amended or terminated. The expedited review of an order issued under this paragraph will be complete upon issuance of such determination.

          (c)

          (1) Written notice that OPS intends to issue an order under this section will be served upon the owner or operator of an alleged hazardous facility in accordance with § 190.5. The notice must allege the existence of a hazardous facility and state the facts and circumstances supporting the issuance of a corrective action order. The notice must provide the owner or operator with an opportunity to respond within 10 days of receipt.

          (2) An owner or operator that elects to exercise its opportunity for a hearing under this section must notify the Associate Administrator of that election in writing within 10 days of receipt of the notice provided under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, or the order under paragraph (b) of this section when applicable. The absence of such written notification waives an owner or operator's opportunity for a hearing.

          (3) At any time after issuance of a notice or order under this section, the respondent may request a copy of the case file as set forth in § 190.209.

          (4) A hearing under this section is conducted pursuant to § 190.211. The hearing should be held within 15 days of receipt of the respondent's request for a hearing.

          (5) After conclusion of a hearing under this section, the Presiding Official submits a recommended decision to the Associate Administrator as to whether or not the facility is or would be hazardous to life, property, or the environment, and if necessary, requiring expeditious corrective action. If a notice or order is contested in writing without a hearing, an attorney from the Office of Chief Counsel prepares the recommended decision. The recommended decision should be submitted to the Associate Administrator within five business days after conclusion of the hearing or after receipt of the respondent's written objection if no hearing is held. Upon receipt of the recommendation, the Associate Administrator will proceed in accordance with paragraphs (d) through (h) of this section. If the Associate Administrator finds the facility is or would be hazardous to life, property, or the environment, the Associate Administrator issues a corrective action order in accordance with this section, or confirms (or amends) the corrective action order issued under paragraph (b) of this section. If the Associate Administrator does not find the facility is or would be hazardous to life, property, or the environment, the Associate Administrator withdraws the notice or terminates the order issued under paragraph (b) of this section, and promptly notifies the operator in writing by service as prescribed in § 190.5.

          (d) The Associate Administrator may find a pipeline facility to be hazardous under paragraph (a) of this section:

          (1) If under the facts and circumstances the Associate Administrator determines the particular facility is hazardous to life, property, or the environment; or

          (2) If the pipeline facility or a component thereof has been constructed or operated with any equipment, material, or technique which the Associate Administrator determines is hazardous to life, property, or the environment, unless the operator involved demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Associate Administrator that, under the particular facts and circumstances involved, such equipment, material, or technique is not hazardous.

          (e) In making a determination under paragraph (d) of this section, the Associate Administrator shall consider, if relevant:

          (1) The characteristics of the pipe and other equipment used in the pipeline facility involved, including its age, manufacturer, physical properties (including its resistance to corrosion and deterioration), and the method of its manufacture, construction or assembly;

          (2) The nature of the materials transported by such facility (including their corrosive and deteriorative qualities), the sequence in which such materials are transported, and the pressure required for such transportation;

          (3) The characteristics of the geographical areas in which the pipeline facility is located, in particular the climatic and geologic conditions (including soil characteristics) associated with such areas, and the population density and population and growth patterns of such areas;

          (4) Any recommendation of the National Transportation Safety Board issued in connection with any investigation conducted by the Board; and

          (5) Such other factors as the Associate Administrator may consider appropriate.

          (f) A corrective action order shall contain the following information:

          (1) A finding that the pipeline facility is or would be hazardous to life, property, or the environment.

          (2) The relevant facts which form the basis of that finding.

          (3) The legal basis for the order.

          (4) The nature and description of any particular corrective action required of the respondent.

          (5) The date by which the required corrective action must be taken or completed and, where appropriate, the duration of the order.

          (6) If the opportunity for a hearing was waived pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, a statement that an opportunity for a hearing will be available at a particular time and location after issuance of the order.

          (g) The Associate Administrator will terminate a corrective action order whenever the Associate Administrator determines that the facility is no longer hazardous to life, property, or the environment. If appropriate, however, a notice of probable violation may be issued under § 190.207.

          (h) At any time after a corrective action order issued under this section has become effective, the Associate Administrator may request the Attorney General to bring an action for appropriate relief in accordance with § 190.235.

          (i) Upon petition by the Attorney General, the District Courts of the United States shall have jurisdiction to enforce orders issued under this section by appropriate means.

#### § § 190.236

          (a)  When the Administrator determines that an unsafe condition or practice, or a combination of unsafe conditions and practices, constitutes or is causing an imminent hazard, as defined in § 190.3, the Administrator may issue or impose an emergency order, without advance notice or an opportunity for a hearing, but only to the extent necessary to abate the imminent hazard. The order will contain a written description of:

          (1) The violation, condition, or practice that constitutes or is causing the imminent hazard;

          (2) Those entities subject to the order;

          (3) The restrictions, prohibitions, or safety measures imposed;

          (4) The standards and procedures for obtaining relief from the order;

          (5) How the order is tailored to abate the imminent hazard and the reasons the authorities under 49 U.S.C. 60112 and 60117(l) are insufficient to do so; and

          (6) How the considerations listed in paragraph (c) of this section were taken into

          account.

          (b)  In considering the factors under paragraph (c) of this section, the Administrator shall consult, as the Administrator determines appropriate, with appropriate Federal agencies, State agencies, and other entities knowledgeable in pipeline safety or operations.

          (c)  Prior to issuing an emergency order, the Administrator shall consider the following, as appropriate:

          (1) The impact of the emergency order on public health and safety;

          (2) The impact, if any, of the emergency order on the national or regional economy or national security;

          (3) The impact of the emergency order on the ability of owners and operators of pipeline facilities to maintain reliability and continuity of service to customers; and

          (4) The results of any consultations with appropriate Federal agencies, State agencies, and other entities knowledgeable in pipeline safety or operations.

          (d)  The Administrator will provide service of emergency orders in accordance with § 190.5 to all operators of gas and hazardous liquid pipeline facilities that the Administrator reasonably expects to be affected by the emergency order. In addition, the Administrator will publish emergency orders in the  and post them on the PHMSA website as soon as practicable upon issuance. Publication in the  will serve as general notice of an emergency order. Each emergency order must contain information specifying how pipeline operators and owners may respond to the emergency order, filing procedures, and service requirements, including the address of DOT Docket Operations and the names and addresses of all persons to be served if a petition for review is filed.

          (e)  If an emergency order has been in effect for more than 365 days, the Administrator will make an assessment regarding whether the unsafe condition or practice, or combination of unsafe conditions and practices, constituting or causing an imminent hazard, as defined in § 190.3, continues to exist. If the imminent hazard does not continue to exist, the Administrator will rescind the emergency order and follow the service procedures set forth in § 190.236(d). If the imminent hazard underlying the emergency order continues to exist, PHMSA will initiate a rulemaking action as soon as practicable.

          § 190.239   Safety orders.

#### § § 190.239

          (a)  If the Associate Administrator finds, after notice and an opportunity for hearing under paragraph (b) of this section, that a particular pipeline facility has a condition or conditions that pose a pipeline integrity risk to public safety, property, or the environment, the Associate Administrator may issue an order requiring the operator of the facility to take necessary corrective action. Such action may include physical inspection, testing, repair or other appropriate action to remedy the identified risk condition.

          (b)  (1)  PHMSA will serve written notice of a proposed safety order under § 190.5 to an operator of the pipeline facility. The notice will allege the existence of a condition that poses a pipeline integrity risk to public safety, property, or the environment, and state the facts and circumstances that support issuing a safety order for the specified pipeline or portion thereof. The notice will also specify proposed testing, evaluations, integrity assessment, or other actions to be taken by the operator and may propose that the operator submit a work plan and schedule to address the conditions identified in the notice. The notice will also provide the operator with its response options, including procedures for requesting informal consultation and a hearing. An operator receiving a notice will have 30 days to respond to the PHMSA official who issued the notice.

          (2)  Upon timely request by the operator, PHMSA will provide an opportunity for informal consultation concerning the proposed safety order. Such informal consultation shall commence within 30 days, provided that PHMSA may extend this time by request or otherwise for good cause. Informal consultation provides an opportunity for the respondent to explain the circumstances associated with the risk condition(s) identified in the notice and, where appropriate, to present a proposal for corrective action, without prejudice to the operator's position in any subsequent hearing. If the respondent and Regional Director agree within 30 days of the informal consultation on a plan for the operator to address each risk condition, they may enter into a written consent agreement and the Associate Administrator may issue a consent order incorporating the terms of the agreement. If a consent agreement is reached, no further hearing will be provided in the matter and any pending hearing request will be considered withdrawn. If a consent agreement is not reached within 30 days of the informal consultation (or if informal consultation is not requested), the Associate Administrator may proceed under paragraphs (b)(3) through (5) of this section. If PHMSA subsequently determines that an operator has failed to comply with the terms of a consent order, PHMSA may obtain any administrative or judicial remedies available under 49 U.S.C. 60101  and this part. If a consent agreement is not reached, any admissions made by the operator during the informal consultation shall be excluded from the record in any subsequent hearing. Nothing in this paragraph (b) precludes PHMSA from terminating the informal consultation process if it has reason to believe that the operator is not engaging in good faith discussions or otherwise concludes that further consultation would not be productive or in the public interest.

          (3)  An operator receiving a notice of proposed safety order may contest the notice, or any portion thereof, by filing a written request for a hearing within 30 days following receipt of the notice or within 10 days following the conclusion of informal consultation that did not result in a consent agreement, as applicable. In the absence of a timely request for a hearing, the Associate Administrator may issue a safety order in the form of the proposed order in accordance with paragraphs (c) through (g) of this section.

          (4)  An attorney from the Office of Chief Counsel, will serve as the Presiding Official in a hearing under this section. The hearing will be conducted informally, without strict adherence to formal rules of evidence in accordance with § 190.211. The respondent may submit any relevant information or materials, call witnesses, and present arguments on the issue of whether a safety order should be issued to address the alleged presence of a condition that poses a pipeline integrity risk to public safety, property, or the environment.

          (5)  Following a hearing under this section, the Presiding Official will submit a recommendation to the Associate Administrator concerning issuance of a final safety order. Upon receipt of the recommendation, the Associate Administrator may proceed under paragraphs (c) through (g) of this section. If the Associate Administrator finds the facility to have a condition that poses a pipeline integrity risk to public safety, property, or the environment, the Associate Administrator will issue a safety order under this section. If the Associate Administrator does not find that the facility has such a condition, or concludes that a safety order is otherwise not warranted, the Associate Administrator will withdraw the notice and promptly notify the operator in writing by service as prescribed in § 190.5. Nothing in this subsection precludes PHMSA and the operator from entering into a consent agreement at any time before a safety order is issued.

          (6)  Once all remedial actions set forth in the safety order and associated work plans are completed, as determined by PHMSA, the Associate Administrator will notify the operator that the safety order has been lifted. The Associate Administrator shall suspend or terminate a safety order whenever the Associate Administrator determines that the pipeline facility no longer has a condition or conditions that pose a pipeline integrity risk to public safety, property, or the environment.

          (c)  The Associate Administrator may find a pipeline facility to have a condition that poses a pipeline integrity risk to public safety, property, or the environment under paragraph (a) of this section:

          (1) If under the facts and circumstances the Associate Administrator determines the particular facility has such a condition; or

          (2) If the pipeline facility or a component thereof has been constructed or operated with any equipment, material, or technique with a history of being susceptible to failure when used in pipeline service, unless the operator involved demonstrates that such equipment, material, or technique is not susceptible to failure given the manner it is being used for a particular facility.

          (d)  In making a determination under paragraph (c) of this section, the Associate Administrator shall consider, if relevant:

          (1) The characteristics of the pipe and other equipment used in the pipeline facility involved, including its age, manufacturer, physical properties (including its resistance to corrosion and deterioration), and the method of its manufacture, construction or assembly;

          (2) The nature of the materials transported by such facility (including their corrosive and deteriorative qualities), the sequence in which such materials are transported, and the pressure required for such transportation;

          (3) The characteristics of the geographical areas where the pipeline facility is located, in particular the climatic and geologic conditions (including soil characteristics) associated with such areas;

          (4) For hazardous liquid pipelines, the proximity of the pipeline to an unusually sensitive area;

          (5) The population density and growth patterns of the area in which the pipeline facility is located;

          (6) Any relevant recommendation of the National Transportation Safety Board issued in connection with any investigation conducted by the Board;

          (7) The likelihood that the condition will impair the serviceability of the pipeline;

          (8) The likelihood that the condition will worsen over time; and

          (9) The likelihood that the condition is present or could develop on other areas of the pipeline.

          (e)  A safety order shall contain the following:

          (1) A finding that the pipeline facility has a condition that poses a pipeline integrity risk to public safety, property, or the environment;

          (2) The relevant facts which form the basis of that finding;

          (3) The legal basis for the order;

          (4) The nature and description of any particular corrective actions to be required of the operator; and

          (5) The date(s) by which the required corrective actions must be taken or completed and, where appropriate, the duration of the order.

          (f)  Nothing in this section precludes PHMSA from issuing a Notice of Probable Violation under § 190.207 or taking other enforcement action if noncompliance is identified at the facilities that are the subject of a safety order proceeding.

          (g)  Yes, a petition for reconsideration may be submitted in accordance with § 190.243.

          (b) If the respondent requests the consideration of additional facts or arguments, the respondent must submit the reasons why they were not presented prior to issuance of the final order.

          (c) The filing of a petition under this section stays the payment of any civil penalty assessed. However, unless the Associate Administrator otherwise provides, the order, including any required corrective action, is not stayed.

          (d) The Associate Administrator may grant or deny, in whole or in part, any petition for reconsideration without further proceedings. If the Associate Administrator reconsiders an order under this section, a final decision on reconsideration may be issued without further proceedings, or, in the alternative, additional information, data, and comment may be requested by the Associate Administrator, as deemed appropriate.

          (e) It is the policy of the Associate Administrator to expeditiously issue notice of the action taken on a petition for reconsideration.

        § 190.203   Inspections and investigations.

#### § § 190.203

        (a) Officers, employees, or agents authorized by the Associate Administrator for Pipeline Safety, PHMSA, upon presenting appropriate credentials, are authorized to enter upon, inspect, and examine, at reasonable times and in a reasonable manner, the records and properties of persons to the extent such records and properties are relevant to determining the compliance of such persons with the requirements of 49 U.S.C. 60101  or regulations or orders issued thereunder.

        (b) Inspections are ordinarily conducted pursuant to one of the following:

        (1) Routine scheduling by the Regional Director of the Region in which the facility is located;

        (2) A complaint received from a member of the public;

        (3) Information obtained from a previous inspection;

        (4) Report from a State Agency participating in the Federal Program under 49 U.S.C. 60105;

        (5) Pipeline accident or incident; or

        (6) Whenever deemed appropriate by the Associate Administrator.

        (c) If the Associate Administrator or Regional Director believes that further information is needed to determine appropriate action, the Associate Administrator or Regional Director may notify the pipeline operator in writing that the operator is required to provide specific information within 30 days from the time the notification is received by the operator, unless otherwise specified in the notification. The notification must provide a reasonable description of the specific information required. An operator may request an extension of time to respond by providing a written justification as to why such an extension is necessary and proposing an alternative submission date. A request for an extension may ask for the deadline to be stayed while the extension is considered. General statements of hardship are not acceptable bases for requesting an extension.

        (d) To the extent necessary to carry out the responsibilities under 49 U.S.C. 60101  the Administrator, or the Associate Administrator, may require testing of portions of pipeline facilities that have been involved in, or affected by, an accident. However, before exercising this authority, the Administrator, or the Associate Administrator, shall make every effort to negotiate a mutually acceptable plan with the owner of those facilities and, where appropriate, the National Transportation Safety Board for performing the testing.

        (e) If a representative of the U.S. Department of Transportation inspects or investigates an accident or incident involving a pipeline facility, the operator must make available to the representative all records and information that pertain to the event in any way, including integrity management plans and test results. The operator must provide all reasonable assistance in the investigation.

#### § § 190.207

        (a) Except as otherwise provided by this subpart, a Regional Director begins an enforcement proceeding by serving a notice of probable violation on a person charging that person with a probable violation of 49 U.S.C. 60101  33 U.S.C. 1321(j), or any regulation or order issued thereunder.

        (b) A notice of probable violation issued under this section shall include:

        § 190.208   Response options.

#### § § 190.208

        Within 30 days of receipt of a notice of probable violation, the respondent must answer the Regional Director who issued the notice in the following manner:

        (a) When the notice contains a proposed civil penalty—

        (1) If the respondent is not contesting an allegation of probable violation, pay the proposed civil penalty as provided in § 190.227 and advise the Regional Director of the payment. The payment authorizes the Associate Administrator to make a finding of violation and to issue a final order under § 190.213;

        (2) If the respondent is not contesting an allegation of probable violation but wishes to submit a written explanation, information, or other materials the respondent believes may warrant mitigation or elimination of the proposed civil penalty, the respondent may submit such materials. This authorizes the Associate Administrator to make a finding of violation and to issue a final order under § 190.213;

        (3) If the respondent is contesting one or more allegations of probable violation but is not requesting a hearing under § 190.211, the respondent may submit a written response in answer to the allegations; or

        (4) The respondent may request a hearing under § 190.211.

        (b) When the notice contains a proposed compliance order—

        (1) If the respondent is not contesting an allegation of probable violation, agree to the proposed compliance order. This authorizes the Associate Administrator to make a finding of violation and to issue a final order under § 190.213;

        (2) Request the execution of a consent order under § 190.219;

        (3) If the respondent is contesting one or more of the allegations of probable violation or compliance terms, but is not requesting a hearing under § 190.211, the respondent may object to the proposed compliance order and submit written explanations, information, or other materials in answer to the allegations in the notice of probable violation; or

        (4) The respondent may request a hearing under § 190.211.

        (c) Before or after responding in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section or, when applicable paragraph (b) of this section, the respondent may request a copy of the violation report from the Regional Director as set forth in § 190.209. The Regional Director will provide the violation report to the respondent within five business days of receiving a request.

        (d) Failure to respond in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section or, when applicable paragraph (b) of this section, constitutes a waiver of the right to contest the allegations in the notice of probable violation and authorizes the Associate Administrator, without further notice to the respondent, to find the facts as alleged in the notice of probable violation and to issue a final order under § 190.213.

        (e) All materials submitted by operators in response to enforcement actions may be placed on publicly accessible Web sites. A respondent seeking confidential treatment under 5 U.S.C. 552(b) for any portion of its responsive materials must provide a second copy of such materials along with the complete original document. A respondent may redact the portions it believes qualify for confidential treatment in the second copy but must provide a written explanation for each redaction.

The respondent's request must also indicate whether or not the respondent will be represented by counsel at the hearing. The respondent may withdraw a request for a hearing in writing and provide a written response.

        (c)  A telephone hearing will be held if the amount of the proposed civil penalty or the cost of the proposed corrective action is less than $25,000, unless the respondent or OPS submits a written request for an in-person hearing.

The Presiding Official regulates the course of the hearing and gives each party an opportunity to offer facts, statements, explanations, documents, testimony or other evidence that is relevant and material to the issues under consideration. The parties may call witnesses on their own behalf and examine the evidence and witnesses presented by the other party. After the evidence in the case has been presented, the Presiding Official will permit reasonable discussion of the issues under consideration.

        (f)  If a respondent elects to transcribe a hearing, the respondent must make arrangements with a court reporter at cost to the respondent and submit a complete copy of the transcript for the case file. The respondent must notify the Presiding Official in advance if it intends to transcribe a hearing.

        (g)  The respondent and OPS may request an opportunity to submit further written material after the hearing for inclusion in the record.

If the material is not submitted within the time prescribed, the case will proceed to final action without the material.

        (h)  After consideration of the case file, the Presiding Official prepares a recommended decision in the case, which is then forwarded to the Associate Administrator for issuance of a final order.

        § 190.339   Direct final rulemaking.

#### § § 190.339

        (a) Where practicable, the Administrator will use direct final rulemaking to issue the following types of rules:

        (1) Minor, substantive changes to regulations;

        (2) Incorporation by reference of the latest edition of technical or industry standards;

        (3) Extensions of compliance dates; and

        (4) Other noncontroversial rules where the Administrator determines that use of direct final rulemaking is in the public interest, and that a regulation is unlikely to result in adverse comment.

        (b) The direct final rule will state an effective date. The direct final rule will also state that unless an adverse comment or notice of intent to file an adverse comment is received within the specified comment period, generally 60 days after publication of the direct final rule in the  the Administrator will issue a confirmation document, generally within 15 days after the close of the comment period, advising the public that the direct final rule will either become effective on the date stated in the direct final rule or at least 30 days after the publication date of the confirmation document, whichever is later.

        (c) For purposes of this section, an adverse comment is one which explains why the rule would be inappropriate, including a challenge to the rule's underlying premise or approach, or would be ineffective or unacceptable without a change. Comments that are frivolous or insubstantial will not be considered adverse under this procedure. A comment recommending a rule change in addition to the rule will not be considered an adverse comment, unless the commenter states why the rule would be ineffective without the additional change.

        (d) Only parties who filed comments to a direct final rule issued under this section may petition under § 190.335 for reconsideration of that direct final rule.

        (e) If an adverse comment or notice of intent to file an adverse comment is received, a timely document will be published in the  advising the public and withdrawing the direct final rule in whole or in part. The Administrator may then incorporate the adverse comment into a subsequent direct final rule or may publish a notice of proposed rulemaking. A notice of proposed rulemaking will provide an opportunity for public comment, generally a minimum of 60 days, and will be processed in accordance with §§ 190.311-190.329.

        § 190.341   Special permits.

        (5) A description of any measures to be taken after the emergency situation or permit expires—whichever comes first—to confirm long-term operational reliability of the pipeline facility.

        (j)  (1) PHMSA may revoke, suspend, or modify a special permit on a finding that:

        (i) Intervening changes in Federal law mandate revocation, suspension, or modification of the special permit;

        (ii) Based on a material change in conditions or circumstances, continued adherence to the terms of the special permit would be inconsistent with safety;

        (iii) The application contained inaccurate or incomplete information, and the special permit would not have been granted had the application been accurate and complete;

        (iv) The application contained deliberately inaccurate or incomplete information; or

        (v) The holder has failed to comply with any material term or condition of the special permit.

        (2) Except as provided in paragraph (h)(3) of this section, before a special permit is modified, suspended or revoked, PHMSA will notify the holder in writing of the proposed action and the reasons for it, and provide an opportunity to show cause why the proposed action should not be taken.

        (i) The holder may file a written response that shows cause why the proposed action should not be taken within 30 days of receipt of notice of the proposed action.

        (3) If necessary to avoid a risk of significant harm to persons, property, or the environment, PHMSA may in the notification declare the proposed action immediately effective.

        (4) Unless otherwise specified, the terms and conditions of a corrective action order, compliance order, or other order applicable to a pipeline facility covered by a special permit will take precedence over the terms of the special permit.

        (5) A special permit holder may seek reconsideration of a decision under paragraph (h) of this section as provided in paragraph (i) of this section.

        (k)  Reconsideration of the denial of an application for a special permit or a revocation of an existing special permit may be sought by petition to the Associate Administrator. Petitions for reconsideration must be received by PHMSA within 20 calendar days of the notice of the grant or denial and must contain a brief statement of the issue and an explanation of why the petitioner believes that the decision being appealed is not in the public interest. The Associate Administrator may grant or deny, in whole or in part, any petition for reconsideration without further proceedings. The Associate Administrator's decision is the final administrative action.

        (l)  Documents related to an application, including the application itself, are available for public inspection on regulations.gov or the Docket Operations Facility to the extent such documents do not include information exempt from public disclosure under 5 U.S.C. 552(b).

        § 192.8   How are onshore gathering pipelines and regulated onshore gathering pipelines determined?

#### § § 192.8

        (a) An operator must use API RP 80 (incorporated by reference, see § 192.7), to determine if an onshore pipeline (or part of a connected series of pipelines) is an onshore gathering line. The determination is subject to the limitations listed below. After making this determination, an operator must determine if the onshore gathering line is a regulated onshore gathering line under paragraph (b) of this section.

        (1) The beginning of gathering, under section 2.2(a)(1) of API RP 80, may not extend beyond the furthermost downstream point in a production operation as defined in section 2.3 of API RP 80. This furthermost downstream point does not include equipment that can be used in either production or transportation, such as separators or dehydrators, unless that equipment is involved in the processes of “production and preparation for transportation or delivery of hydrocarbon gas” within the meaning of “production operation.”

        (2) The endpoint of gathering, under section 2.2(a)(1)(A) of API RP 80, may not extend beyond the first downstream natural gas processing plant, unless the operator can demonstrate, using sound engineering principles, that gathering extends to a further downstream plant.

        (3) If the endpoint of gathering, under section 2.2(a)(1)(C) of API RP 80, is determined by the commingling of gas from separate production fields, the fields may not be more than 50 miles from each other, unless the Administrator finds a longer separation distance is justified in a particular case (see 49 CFR § 190.9).

        (4) The endpoint of gathering, under section 2.2(a)(1)(D) of API RP 80, may not extend beyond the furthermost downstream compressor used to increase gathering line pressure for delivery to another pipeline.

        (5) For new, replaced, relocated, or otherwise changed gas gathering pipelines installed after May 16, 2022, the endpoint of gathering under sections 2.2(a)(1)(E) and 2.2.1.2.6 of API RP 80 (incorporated by reference,  § 192.7)—also known as “incidental gathering”—may not be used if the pipeline terminates 10 or more miles downstream from the furthermost downstream endpoint as defined in paragraphs 2.2(a)(1)(A) through (a)(1)(D) of API RP 80 (incorporated by reference,  § 192.7) and this section. If an “incidental gathering” pipeline is 10 miles or more in length, the entire portion of the pipeline that is designated as an incidental gathering line under 2.2(a)(1)(E) and 2.2.1.2.6 of API RP 80 shall be classified as a transmission pipeline subject to all applicable regulations in this chapter for transmission pipelines.

        (b) Each operator must determine and maintain for the life of the pipeline records documenting the methodology by which it calculated the beginning and end points of each onshore gathering pipeline it operates, as described in the second column of table 1 to paragraph (c)(2) of this section, by:

        (1) November 16, 2022, or before the pipeline is placed into operation, whichever is later; or

        (2) An alternative deadline approved by the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA). The operator must notify PHMSA and State or local pipeline safety authorities, as applicable, no later than 90 days in advance of the deadline in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. The notification must be made in accordance with § 192.18 and must include the following information:

        (i) Description of the affected facilities and operating environment;

        (ii) Justification for an alternative compliance deadline; and

        (iii) Proposed alternative deadline.

        (c) For purposes of part 191 of this chapter and § 192.9, the term “regulated onshore gathering pipeline” means:

        (1) Each Type A, Type B, or Type C onshore gathering pipeline (or segment of onshore gathering pipeline) with a feature described in the second column of table 1 to paragraph (c)(2) of this section that lies in an area described in the third column; and

        (2) As applicable, additional lengths of pipeline described in the fourth column to provide a safety buffer:

        (3) A Type R gathering line is subject to reporting requirements under part 191 of this chapter but is not a regulated onshore gathering line under this part.

        (4) For the purpose of identifying Type C lines in table 1 to paragraph (c)(2) of this section, if an operator has not calculated MAOP consistent with the methods at § 192.619(a) or (c)(1), the operator must either:

        (i) Calculate MAOP consistent with the methods at § 192.619(a) or (c)(1); or

        (ii) Use as a substitute for MAOP the highest operating pressure to which the segment was subjected during the preceding 5 operating years.

        (1) The valve and the operating device to open or close the valve must be readily accessible and protected from tampering and damage.

        (2) The valve must be supported to prevent settling of the valve or movement of the pipe to which it is attached.

        (c) Each section of a transmission line, other than offshore segments, between main line valves must have a blowdown valve with enough capacity to allow the transmission line to be blown down as rapidly as practicable. Each blowdown discharge must be located so the gas can be blown to the atmosphere without hazard and, if the transmission line is adjacent to an overhead electric line, so that the gas is directed away from the electrical conductors.

        (d) Offshore segments of transmission lines must be equipped with valves or other components to shut off the flow of gas to an offshore platform in an emergency.

        (e) For onshore transmission pipeline segments with diameters greater than or equal to 6 inches that are constructed after April 10, 2023, the operator must install rupture-mitigation valves (RMV) or an alternative equivalent technology whenever a valve must be installed to meet the appropriate valve spacing requirements of this section. An operator seeking to use alternative equivalent technology must notify PHMSA in accordance with the procedures set forth in paragraph (g) of this section. All RMVs and alternative equivalent technologies installed pursuant to this paragraph (e) must meet the requirements of § 192.636. The installation requirements in this paragraph (e) do not apply to pipe segments with a potential impact radius (PIR), as defined in § 192.903, that is less than or equal to 150 feet in either Class 1 or Class 2 locations. An operator may request an extension of the installation compliance deadline requirements of this paragraph (e) if it can demonstrate to PHMSA, in accordance with the notification procedures in § 192.18, that those installation compliance deadlines would be economically, technically, or operationally infeasible for a particular new pipeline.

        (f) For entirely replaced onshore transmission pipeline segments, as defined in § 192.3, with diameters greater than or equal to 6 inches and that are installed after April 10, 2023, the operator must install RMVs or an alternative equivalent technology whenever a valve must be installed to meet the appropriate valve spacing requirements of this section. An operator seeking to use alternative equivalent technology must notify PHMSA in accordance with the procedures set forth in paragraph (g) of this section. All RMVs and alternative equivalent technologies installed pursuant to this paragraph (f) must meet the requirements of § 192.636. The requirements of this paragraph (f) apply when the applicable pipeline replacement project involves a valve, either through addition, replacement, or removal. The installation requirements in this paragraph (f) do not apply to pipe segments with a PIR, as defined in § 192.903, that is less than or equal to 150 feet in either Class 1 or Class 2 locations. An operator may request an extension of the installation compliance deadline requirements of this paragraph (f) if it can demonstrate to PHMSA, in accordance with the notification procedures in § 192.18, that those installation compliance deadlines would be economically, technically, or operationally infeasible for a particular pipeline replacement project.

        (g) If an operator elects to use alternative equivalent technology in accordance with paragraph (e) or (f) of this section, the operator must notify PHMSA in accordance with the procedures in § 192.18. The operator must include a technical and safety evaluation in its notice to PHMSA. Valves that are installed as alternative equivalent technology must comply with §§ 192.634 and 192.636. An operator requesting use of manual valves as an alternative equivalent technology must also include within the notification submitted to PHMSA a demonstration that installation of an RMV as otherwise required would be economically, technically, or operationally infeasible. An operator may use a manual compressor station valve at a continuously manned station as an alternative equivalent technology, and use of such valve would not require a notification to PHMSA in accordance with § 192.18, but it must comply with § 192.636.

        (h) The valve spacing requirements of paragraph (a) of this section do not apply to pipe replacements on a pipeline if the distance between each point on the pipeline and the nearest valve does not exceed:

        (1) Four (4) miles in Class 4 locations, with a total spacing between valves no greater than 8 miles;

        (2) Seven-and-a-half (7 ) miles in Class 3 locations, with a total spacing between valves no greater than 15 miles; or

        (3) Ten (10) miles in Class 1 or 2 locations, with a total spacing between valves no greater than 20 miles.

#### § § 192.197

        (a) If the maximum actual operating pressure of the distribution system is 60 p.s.i. (414 kPa) gage, or less and a service regulator having the following characteristics is used, no other pressure limiting device is required:

        (1) A regulator capable of reducing distribution line pressure to pressures recommended for household appliances.

        (2) A single port valve with proper orifice for the maximum gas pressure at the regulator inlet.

        (3) A valve seat made of resilient material designed to withstand abrasion of the gas, impurities in gas, cutting by the valve, and to resist permanent deformation when it is pressed against the valve port.

        (4) Pipe connections to the regulator not exceeding 2 inches (51 millimeters) in diameter.

        (5) A regulator that, under normal operating conditions, is able to regulate the downstream pressure within the necessary limits of accuracy and to limit the build-up of pressure under no-flow conditions to prevent a pressure that would cause the unsafe operation of any connected and properly adjusted gas utilization equipment.

        (6) A self-contained service regulator with no external static or control lines.

        (b) If the maximum actual operating pressure of the distribution system is 60 p.s.i.

        (c) If the maximum actual operating pressure of the distribution system exceeds 60 p.s.i. (414 kPa) gage, one of the following methods must be used to regulate and limit, to the maximum safe value, the pressure of gas delivered to the customer:

        (1) A service regulator having the characteristics listed in paragraph (a) of this section, and another regulator located upstream from the service regulator. The upstream regulator may not be set to maintain a pressure higher than 60 p.s.i. (414 kPa) gage. A device must be installed between the upstream regulator and the service regulator to limit the pressure on the inlet of the service regulator to 60 p.s.i. (414 kPa) gage or less in case the upstream regulator fails to function properly. This device may be either a relief valve or an automatic shutoff that shuts, if the pressure on the inlet of the service regulator exceeds the set pressure (60 p.s.i. (414 kPa) gage or less), and remains closed until manually reset.

        (2) A service regulator and a monitoring regulator set to limit, to a maximum safe value, the pressure of the gas delivered to the customer.

        (3) A service regulator with a relief valve vented to the outside atmosphere, with the relief valve set to open so that the pressure of gas going to the customer does not exceed a maximum safe value. The relief valve may either be built into the service regulator or it may be a separate unit installed downstream from the service regulator. This combination may be used alone only in those cases where the inlet pressure on the service regulator does not exceed the manufacturer's safe working pressure rating of the service regulator, and may not be used where the inlet pressure on the service regulator exceeds 125 p.s.i. (862 kPa) gage. For higher inlet pressures, the methods in paragraph (c) (1) or (2) of this section must be used.

        (4) A service regulator and an automatic shutoff device that closes upon a rise in pressure downstream from the regulator and remains closed until manually reset.

However, if tests at those intervals are impractical for separately protected short sections of mains or transmission lines, not in excess of 100 feet (30 meters), or separately protected service lines, these pipelines may be surveyed on a sampling basis. At least 10 percent of these protected structures, distributed over the entire system must be surveyed each calendar year, with a different 10 percent checked each subsequent year, so that the entire system is tested in each 10-year period.

        (b) Cathodic protection rectifiers and impressed current power sources must be periodically inspected as follows:

        (1) Each cathodic protection rectifier or impressed current power source must be inspected six times each calendar year, but with intervals not exceeding 2  months between inspections, to ensure adequate amperage and voltage levels needed to provide cathodic protection are maintained. This may be done either through remote measurement or through an onsite inspection of the rectifier.

        (2) After January 1, 2022, each remotely inspected rectifier must be physically inspected for continued safe and reliable operation at least once each calendar year, but with intervals not exceeding 15 months.

        (c) Each reverse current switch, each diode, and each interference bond whose failure would jeopardize structure protection must be electrically checked for proper performance six times each calendar year, but with intervals not exceeding 2  months. Each other interference bond must be checked at least once each calendar year, but with intervals not exceeding 15 months.

        (d) Each operator must promptly correct any deficiencies indicated by the inspection and testing required by paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section. For onshore gas transmission pipelines, each operator must develop a remedial action plan and apply for any necessary permits within 6 months of completing the inspection or testing that identified the deficiency. Remedial action must be completed promptly, but no later than the earliest of the following: prior to the next inspection or test interval required by this section; within 1 year, not to exceed 15 months, of the inspection or test that identified the deficiency; or as soon as practicable, not to exceed 6 months, after obtaining any necessary permits.

        (e) After the initial evaluation required by §§ 192.455(b) and (c) and 192.457(b), each operator must, not less than every 3 years at intervals not exceeding 39 months, reevaluate its unprotected pipelines and cathodically protect them in accordance with this subpart in areas in which active corrosion is found. The operator must determine the areas of active corrosion by electrical survey. However, on distribution lines and where an electrical survey is impractical on transmission lines, areas of active corrosion may be determined by other means that include review and analysis of leak repair and inspection records, corrosion monitoring records, exposed pipe inspection records, and the pipeline environment.

        (f) An operator must determine the extent of the area with inadequate cathodic protection for onshore gas transmission pipelines where any annual test station reading (pipe-to-soil potential measurement) indicates cathodic protection levels below the required levels in appendix D to this part.

        (1) Gas transmission pipeline operators must investigate and mitigate any non-systemic or location-specific causes.

        (2) To address systemic causes, an operator must conduct close interval surveys in both directions from the test station with a low cathodic protection reading at a maximum interval of approximately 5 feet or less. An operator must conduct close interval surveys unless it is impractical based upon geographical, technical, or safety reasons. An operator must complete close interval surveys required by this section with the protective current interrupted unless it is impractical to do so for technical or safety reasons. An operator must remediate areas with insufficient cathodic protection levels, or areas where protective current is found to be leaving the pipeline, in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section. An operator must confirm the restoration of adequate cathodic protection following the implementation of remedial actions undertaken to mitigate systemic causes of external corrosion.

        (1) Interference surveys for a pipeline system to detect the presence and level of any electrical stray current. Interference surveys must be conducted when potential monitoring indicates a significant increase in stray current, or when new potential stray current sources are introduced, such as through co-located pipelines, structures, or high voltage alternating current (HVAC) power lines, including from additional generation, a voltage up-rating, additional lines, new or enlarged power substations, or new pipelines or other structures;

        (2) Analysis of the results of the survey to determine the cause of the interference and whether the level could cause significant corrosion, impede safe operation, or adversely affect the environment or public;

        (3) Development of a remedial action plan to correct any instances where interference current is greater than or equal to 100 amps per meter squared alternating current (AC), or if it impedes the safe operation of a pipeline, or if it may cause a condition that would adversely impact the environment or the public; and

        (4) Application for any necessary permits within 6 months of completing the interference survey that identified the deficiency. An operator must complete remedial actions promptly, but no later than the earliest of the following: within 15 months after completing the interference survey that identified the deficiency; or as soon as practicable, but not to exceed 6 months, after obtaining any necessary permits.

      Subpart K—Uprating

        § 192.551   Scope.

#### § § 192.551

        This subpart prescribes minimum requirements for increasing maximum allowable operating pressures (uprating) for pipelines.

        § 192.553   General requirements.

#### § § 192.553

        (a)  Whenever the requirements of this subpart require that an increase in operating pressure be made in increments, the pressure must be increased gradually, at a rate that can be controlled, and in accordance with the following:

        (1) At the end of each incremental increase, the pressure must be held constant while the entire segment of pipeline that is affected is checked for leaks.

        (2) Each leak detected must be repaired before a further pressure increase is made, except that a leak determined not to be potentially hazardous need not be repaired, if it is monitored during the pressure increase and it does not become potentially hazardous.

        (b)  Each operator who uprates a segment of pipeline shall retain for the life of the segment a record of each investigation required by this subpart, of all work performed, and of each pressure test conducted, in connection with the uprating.

        (c)  Each operator who uprates a segment of pipeline shall establish a written procedure that will ensure that each applicable requirement of this subpart is complied with.

        (d)  Except as provided in § 192.555(c), a new maximum allowable operating pressure established under this subpart may not exceed the maximum that would be allowed under §§ 192.619 and 192.621 for a new segment of pipeline constructed of the same materials in the same location. However, when uprating a steel pipeline, if any variable necessary to determine the design pressure under the design formula (§ 192.105) is unknown, the MAOP may be increased as provided in § 192.619(a)(1).

> [35 FR 13257, Aug. 10, 1970, as amended by Amdt. 192-78, 61 FR 28785, June 6, 1996; Amdt. 192-93, 68 FR 53901, Sept. 15, 2003]

        § 192.555   Uprating to a pressure that will produce a hoop stress of 30 percent or more of SMYS in steel pipelines.

#### § § 192.555

        (a) Unless the requirements of this section have been met, no person may subject any segment of a steel pipeline to an operating pressure that will produce a hoop stress of 30 percent or more of SMYS and that is above the established maximum allowable operating pressure.

        (b) Before increasing operating pressure above the previously established maximum allowable operating pressure the operator shall:

        (1) Review the design, operating, and maintenance history and previous testing of the segment of pipeline and determine whether the proposed increase is safe and consistent with the requirements of this part; and

        (2) Make any repairs, replacements, or alterations in the segment of pipeline that are necessary for safe operation at the increased pressure.

        (c) After complying with paragraph (b) of this section, an operator may increase the maximum allowable operating pressure of a segment of pipeline constructed before September 12, 1970, to the highest pressure that is permitted under § 192.619, using as test pressure the highest pressure to which the segment of pipeline was previously subjected (either in a strength test or in actual operation).

        (d) After complying with paragraph (b) of this section, an operator that does not qualify under paragraph (c) of this section may increase the previously established maximum allowable operating pressure if at least one of the following requirements is met:

        (1) The segment of pipeline is successfully tested in accordance with the requirements of this part for a new line of the same material in the same location.

        (2) An increased maximum allowable operating pressure may be established for a segment of pipeline in a Class 1 location if the line has not previously been tested, and if:

        (i) It is impractical to test it in accordance with the requirements of this part;

        (ii) The new maximum operating pressure does not exceed 80 percent of that allowed for a new line of the same design in the same location; and

        (iii) The operator determines that the new maximum allowable operating pressure is consistent with the condition of the segment of pipeline and the design requirements of this part.

        (e) Where a segment of pipeline is uprated in accordance with paragraph (c) or (d)(2) of this section, the increase in pressure must be made in increments that are equal to:

        (1) 10 percent of the pressure before the uprating; or

        (2) 25 percent of the total pressure increase,

        § 192.557   Uprating: Steel pipelines to a pressure that will produce a hoop stress less than 30 percent of SMYS: plastic, cast iron, and ductile iron pipelines.

#### § § 192.557

        (a) Unless the requirements of this section have been met, no person may subject:

        (1) A segment of steel pipeline to an operating pressure that will produce a hoop stress less than 30 percent of SMYS and that is above the previously established maximum allowable operating pressure; or

        (2) A plastic, cast iron, or ductile iron pipeline segment to an operating pressure that is above the previously established maximum allowable operating pressure.

        (b) Before increasing operating pressure above the previously established maximum allowable operating pressure, the operator shall:

        (1) Review the design, operating, and maintenance history of the segment of pipeline;

        (2) Make a leakage survey (if it has been more than 1 year since the last survey) and repair any leaks that are found, except that a leak determined not to be potentially hazardous need not be repaired, if it is monitored during the pressure increase and it does not become potentially hazardous;

        (3) Make any repairs, replacements, or alterations in the segment of pipeline that are necessary for safe operation at the increased pressure;

        (4) Reinforce or anchor offsets, bends and dead ends in pipe joined by compression couplings or bell and spigot joints to prevent failure of the pipe joint, if the offset, bend, or dead end is exposed in an excavation;

        (5) Isolate the segment of pipeline in which the pressure is to be increased from any adjacent segment that will continue to be operated at a lower pressure; and

        (6) If the pressure in mains or service lines, or both, is to be higher than the pressure delivered to the customer, install a service regulator on each service line and test each regulator to determine that it is functioning. Pressure may be increased as necessary to test each regulator, after a regulator has been installed on each pipeline subject to the increased pressure.

        (c) After complying with paragraph (b) of this section, the increase in maximum allowable operating pressure must be made in increments that are equal to 10 p.s.i. (69 kPa) gage or 25 percent of the total pressure increase, whichever produces the fewer number of increments. Whenever the requirements of paragraph (b)(6) of this section apply, there must be at least two approximately equal incremental increases.

        (d) If records for cast iron or ductile iron pipeline facilities are not complete enough to determine stresses produced by internal pressure, trench loading, rolling loads, beam stresses, and other bending loads, in evaluating the level of safety of the pipeline when operating at the proposed increased pressure, the following procedures must be followed:

        (1) In estimating the stresses, if the original laying conditions cannot be ascertained, the operator shall assume that cast iron pipe was supported on blocks with tamped backfill and that ductile iron pipe was laid without blocks with tamped backfill.

        (2) Unless the actual maximum cover depth is known, the operator shall measure the actual cover in at least three places where the cover is most likely to be greatest and shall use the greatest cover measured.

        (3) Unless the actual nominal wall thickness is known, the operator shall determine the wall thickness by cutting and measuring coupons from at least three separate pipe lengths. The coupons must be cut from pipe lengths in areas where the cover depth is most likely to be the greatest. The average of all measurements taken must be increased by the allowance indicated in the following table:

        (4) For cast iron pipe, unless the pipe manufacturing process is known, the operator shall assume that the pipe is pit cast pipe with a bursting tensile strength of 11,000 p.s.i. (76 MPa) gage and a modulus of rupture of 31,000 p.s.i. (214 MPa) gage.

        § 192.607   Verification of Pipeline Material Properties and Attributes: Onshore steel transmission pipelines.

#### § § 192.607

        (a)  Wherever required by this part, operators of onshore steel transmission pipelines must document and verify material properties and attributes in accordance with this section.

        (b)  Records established under this section documenting physical pipeline characteristics and attributes, including diameter, wall thickness, seam type, and grade ( yield strength, ultimate tensile strength, or pressure rating for valves and flanges, etc.), must be maintained for the life of the pipeline and be traceable, verifiable, and complete. Charpy v-notch toughness values established under this section needed to meet the requirements of the ECA method at § 192.624(c)(3) or the fracture mechanics requirements at § 192.712 must be maintained for the life of the pipeline.

        (c)  If an operator does not have traceable, verifiable, and complete records required by paragraph (b) of this section, the operator must develop and implement procedures for conducting nondestructive or destructive tests, examinations, and assessments in order to verify the material properties of aboveground line pipe and components, and of buried line pipe and components when excavations occur at the following opportunities: Anomaly direct examinations,  evaluations, repairs, remediations, maintenance, and excavations that are associated with replacements or relocations of pipeline segments that are removed from service. The procedures must also provide for the following:

        (1) For nondestructive tests, at each test location, material properties for minimum yield strength and ultimate tensile strength must be determined at a minimum of 5 places in at least 2 circumferential quadrants of the pipe for a minimum total of 10 test readings at each pipe cylinder location.

        (2) For destructive tests, at each test location, a set of material properties tests for minimum yield strength and ultimate tensile strength must be conducted on each test pipe cylinder removed from each location, in accordance with API Specification 5L.

        (3) Tests, examinations, and assessments must be appropriate for verifying the necessary material properties and attributes.

        (4) If toughness properties are not documented, the procedures must include accepted industry methods for verifying pipe material toughness.

        (5) Verification of material properties and attributes for non-line pipe components must comply with paragraph (f) of this section.

        (d)  Procedures developed in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section for verification of material properties and attributes using nondestructive methods must:

        (1) Use methods, tools, procedures, and techniques that have been validated by a subject matter expert based on comparison with destructive test results on material of comparable grade and vintage;

        (2) Conservatively account for measurement inaccuracy and uncertainty using reliable engineering tests and analyses; and

        (3) Use test equipment that has been properly calibrated for comparable test materials prior to usage.

        (e)  To verify material properties and attributes for a population of multiple, comparable segments of pipe without traceable, verifiable, and complete records, an operator may use a sampling program in accordance with the following requirements:

        (1) The operator must define separate populations of similar segments of pipe for each combination of the following material properties and attributes: Nominal wall thicknesses, grade, manufacturing process, pipe manufacturing dates, and construction dates. If the dates between the manufacture or construction of the pipeline segments exceeds 2 years, those segments cannot be considered as the same vintage for the purpose of defining a population under this section. The total population mileage is the cumulative mileage of pipeline segments in the population. The pipeline segments need not be continuous.

        (2) For each population defined according to paragraph (e)(1) of this section, the operator must determine material properties at all excavations that expose the pipe associated with anomaly direct examinations,  evaluations, repairs, remediations, or maintenance, except for pipeline segments exposed during excavation activities pursuant to § 192.614, until completion of the lesser of the following:

        (i) One excavation per mile rounded up to the nearest whole number; or

        (ii) 150 excavations if the population is more than 150 miles.

        (3) Prior tests conducted for a single excavation according to the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section may be counted as one sample under the sampling requirements of this paragraph (e).

        (4) If the test results identify line pipe with properties that are not consistent with available information or existing expectations or assumed properties used for operations and maintenance in the past, the operator must establish an expanded sampling program. The expanded sampling program must use valid statistical bases designed to achieve at least a 95% confidence level that material properties used in the operation and maintenance of the pipeline are valid. The approach must address how the sampling plan will be expanded to address findings that reveal material properties that are not consistent with all available information or existing expectations or assumed material properties used for pipeline operations and maintenance in the past. Operators must notify PHMSA in advance of using an expanded sampling approach in accordance with § 192.18.

        (5) An operator may use an alternative statistical sampling approach that differs from the requirements specified in paragraph (e)(2) of this section. The alternative sampling program must use valid statistical bases designed to achieve at least a 95% confidence level that material properties used in the operation and maintenance of the pipeline are valid. The approach must address how the sampling plan will be expanded to address findings that reveal material properties that are not consistent with all available information or existing expectations or assumed material properties used for pipeline operations and maintenance in the past. Operators must notify PHMSA in advance of using an alternative sampling approach in accordance with § 192.18.

        (f)  For mainline pipeline components other than line pipe, an operator must develop and implement procedures in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section for establishing and documenting the ANSI rating or pressure rating (in accordance with ASME/ANSI B16.5 (incorporated by reference,  § 192.7)),

        (1) Operators are not required to test for the chemical and mechanical properties of components in compressor stations, meter stations, regulator stations, separators, river crossing headers, mainline valve assemblies, valve operator piping, or cross-connections with isolation valves from the mainline pipeline.

        (2) Verification of material properties is required for non-line pipe components, including valves, flanges, fittings, fabricated assemblies, and other pressure retaining components and appurtenances that are:

        (i) Larger than 2 inches in nominal outside diameter,

        (ii) Material grades of 42,000 psi (Grade X-42) or greater, or

        (iii) Appurtenances of any size that are directly installed on the pipeline and cannot be isolated from mainline pipeline pressures.

        (3) Procedures for establishing material properties of non-line pipe components must be based on the documented manufacturing specification for the components. If specifications are not known, usage of manufacturer's stamped, marked, or tagged material pressure ratings and material type may be used to establish pressure rating. Operators must document the method used to determine the pressure rating and the findings of that determination.

        (g)  The material properties determined from the destructive or nondestructive tests required by this section cannot be used to raise the grade or specification of the material, unless the original grade or specification is unknown and MAOP is based on an assumed yield strength of 24,000 psi in accordance with § 192.107(b)(2).

        (b) The design, construction, and testing procedures followed in the original construction, and a comparison of these procedures with those required for the present class location by the applicable provisions of this part.

        (c) The physical condition of the segment to the extent it can be ascertained from available records;

        (d) The operating and maintenance history of the segment;

        (e) The maximum actual operating pressure and the corresponding operating hoop stress, taking pressure gradient into account, for the segment of pipeline involved; and

        (f) The actual area affected by the population density increase, and physical barriers or other factors which may limit further expansion of the more densely populated area.

        § 192.610   Change in class location: Change in valve spacing.

#### § § 192.610

        (a) If a class location change on a transmission pipeline occurs after October 5, 2022, and results in pipe replacement, of 2 or more miles, in the aggregate, within any 5 contiguous miles within a 24-month period, to meet the maximum allowable operating pressure (MAOP) requirements in § 192.611, § 192.619, or § 192.620, then the requirements in §§ 192.179, 192.634, and 192.636, as applicable, apply to the new class location, and the operator must install valves, including rupture-mitigation valves (RMV) or alternative equivalent technologies, as necessary, to comply with those sections. Such valves must be installed within 24 months of the class location change in accordance with the timing requirement in § 192.611(d) for compliance after a class location change.

        (b) If a class location change on a gas transmission pipeline occurs after October 5, 2022, and results in pipe replacement of less than 2 miles within 5 contiguous miles during a 24-month period, to meet the MAOP requirements in § 192.611, § 192.619, or § 192.620, then within 24 months of the class location change, in accordance with § 192.611(d), the operator must either:

        (1) Comply with the valve spacing requirements of § 192.179(a) for the replaced pipeline segment; or

        (2) Install or use existing RMVs or alternative equivalent technologies so that the entirety of the replaced pipeline segments are between at least two RMVs or alternative equivalent technologies. The distance between RMVs and alternative equivalent technologies for the replaced segment must not exceed 20 miles. The RMVs and alternative equivalent technologies must comply with the applicable requirements of § 192.636.

        (c) The provisions of paragraph (b) of this section do not apply to pipeline replacements that amount to less than 1,000 feet within any one contiguous mile during any 24-month period.

        § 192.611   Change in class location: Confirmation or revision of maximum allowable operating pressure.

#### § § 192.611

        (a) If the hoop stress corresponding to the established maximum allowable operating pressure of a segment of pipeline is not commensurate with the present class location, and the segment is in satisfactory physical condition, the maximum allowable operating pressure of that segment of pipeline must be confirmed or revised according to one of the following requirements:

        (1) If the segment involved has been previously tested in place for a period of not less than 8 hours:

        (i) The maximum allowable operating pressure is 0.8 times the test pressure in Class 2 locations, 0.667 times the test pressure in Class 3 locations, or 0.555 times the test pressure in Class 4 locations. The corresponding hoop stress may not exceed 72 percent of the SMYS of the pipe in Class 2 locations, 60 percent of SMYS in Class 3 locations, or 50 percent of SMYS in Class 4 locations.

        (ii) The alternative maximum allowable operating pressure is 0.8 times the test pressure in Class 2 locations and 0.667 times the test pressure in Class 3 locations. For pipelines operating at alternative maximum allowable pressure per § 192.620, the corresponding hoop stress may not exceed 80 percent of the SMYS of the pipe in Class 2 locations and 67 percent of SMYS in Class 3 locations.

        (2) The maximum allowable operating pressure of the segment involved must be reduced so that the corresponding hoop stress is not more than that allowed by this part for new segments of pipelines in the existing class location.

        (3) The segment involved must be tested in accordance with the applicable requirements of subpart J of this part, and its maximum allowable operating pressure must then be established according to the following criteria:

        (i) The maximum allowable operating pressure after the requalification test is 0.8 times the test pressure for Class 2 locations, 0.667 times the test pressure for Class 3 locations, and 0.555 times the test pressure for Class 4 locations.

        (ii) The corresponding hoop stress may not exceed 72 percent of the SMYS of the pipe in Class 2 locations, 60 percent of SMYS in Class 3 locations, or 50 percent of SMYS in Class 4 locations.

        (iii) For pipeline operating at an alternative maximum allowable operating pressure per § 192.620, the alternative maximum allowable operating pressure after the requalification test is 0.8 times the test pressure for Class 2 locations and 0.667 times the test pressure for Class 3 locations. The corresponding hoop stress may not exceed 80 percent of the SMYS of the pipe in Class 2 locations and 67 percent of SMYS in Class 3 locations.

        (b) The maximum allowable operating pressure confirmed or revised in accordance with this section, may not exceed the maximum allowable operating pressure established before the confirmation or revision.

        (c) Confirmation or revision of the maximum allowable operating pressure of a segment of pipeline in accordance with this section does not preclude the application of §§ 192.553 and 192.555.

        (d) Confirmation or revision of the maximum allowable operating pressure that is required as a result of a study under § 192.609 must be completed within 24 months of the change in class location. Pressure reduction under paragraph (a) (1) or (2) of this section within the 24-month period does not preclude establishing a maximum allowable operating pressure under paragraph (a)(3) of this section at a later date.

        § 192.614   Damage prevention program.

#### § § 192.614

        (a) Except as provided in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section, each operator of a buried pipeline must carry out, in accordance with this section, a written program to prevent damage to that pipeline from excavation activities. For the purposes of this section, the term “excavation activities” includes excavation, blasting, boring, tunneling, backfilling, the removal of aboveground structures by either explosive or mechanical means, and other earthmoving operations.

        (b) An operator may comply with any of the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section through participation in a public service program, such as a one-call system, but such participation does not relieve the operator of responsibility for compliance with this section. However, an operator must perform the duties of paragraph (c)(3) of this section through participation in a one-call system, if that one-call system is a qualified one-call system. In areas that are covered by more than one qualified one-call system, an operator need only join one of the qualified one-call systems if there is a central telephone number for excavators to call for excavation activities, or if the one-call systems in those areas communicate with one another. An operator's pipeline system must be covered by a qualified one-call system where there is one in place. For the purpose of this section, a one-call system is considered a “qualified one-call system” if it meets the requirements of section (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section.

        (1) The state has adopted a one-call damage prevention program under § 198.37 of this chapter; or

        (2) The one-call system:

        (i) Is operated in accordance with § 198.39 of this chapter;

        (ii) Provides a pipeline operator an opportunity similar to a voluntary participant to have a part in management responsibilities; and

        (iii) Assesses a participating pipeline operator a fee that is proportionate to the costs of the one-call system's coverage of the operator's pipeline.

        (c) The damage prevention program required by paragraph (a) of this section must, at a minimum:

        (1) Include the identity, on a current basis, of persons who normally engage in excavation activities in the area in which the pipeline is located.

        (2) Provides for notification of the public in the vicinity of the pipeline and actual notification of the persons identified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section of the following as often as needed to make them aware of the damage prevention program:

        (i) The program's existence and purpose; and

        (ii) How to learn the location of underground pipelines before excavation activities are begun.

        (3) Provide a means of receiving and recording notification of planned excavation activities.

        (4) If the operator has buried pipelines in the area of excavation activity, provide for actual notification of persons who give notice of their intent to excavate of the type of temporary marking to be provided and how to identify the markings.

        (5) Provide for temporary marking of buried pipelines in the area of excavation activity before, as far as practical, the activity begins.

        (6) Provide as follows for inspection of pipelines that an operator has reason to believe could be damaged by excavation activities:

        (i) The inspection must be done as frequently as necessary during and after the activities to verify the integrity of the pipeline; and

        (ii) In the case of blasting, any inspection must include leakage surveys.

        (d) A damage prevention program under this section is not required for the following pipelines:

        (1) Pipelines located offshore.

        (2) Pipelines, other than those located offshore, in Class 1 or 2 locations until September 20, 1995.

        (3) Pipelines to which access is physically controlled by the operator.

        (e) Pipelines operated by persons other than municipalities (including operators of master meters) whose primary activity does not include the transportation of gas need not comply with the following:

        (1) The requirement of paragraph (a) of this section that the damage prevention program be written; and

        (2) The requirements of paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section.

        (1) Receiving, identifying, and classifying notices of events which require immediate response by the operator.

        (2) Establishing and maintaining adequate means of communication with the appropriate public safety answering point ( 9-1-1 emergency call center), where direct access to a 9-1-1 emergency call center is available from the location of the pipeline, and fire, police, and other public officials. Operators may establish liaison with the appropriate local emergency coordinating agencies, such as 9-1-1 emergency call centers or county emergency managers, in lieu of communicating individually with each fire, police, or other public entity. An operator must determine the responsibilities, resources, jurisdictional area(s), and emergency contact telephone number(s) for both local and out-of-area calls of each Federal, State, and local government organization that may respond to a pipeline emergency, and inform such officials about the operator's ability to respond to a pipeline emergency and the means of communication during emergencies.

        (3) Prompt and effective response to a notice of each type of emergency, including the following:

        (i) Gas detected inside or near a building.

        (ii) Fire located near or directly involving a pipeline facility.

        (iii) Explosion occurring near or directly involving a pipeline facility.

        (iv) Natural disaster.

        (4) The availability of personnel, equipment, tools, and materials, as needed at the scene of an emergency.

        (5) Actions directed toward protecting people first and then property.

        (6) Taking necessary actions, including but not limited to, emergency shutdown, valve shut-off, or pressure reduction, in any section of the operator's pipeline system, to minimize hazards of released gas to life, property, or the environment.

        (7) Making safe any actual or potential hazard to life or property.

        (8) Notifying the appropriate public safety answering point ( 9-1-1 emergency call center) where direct access to a 9-1-1 emergency call center is available from the location of the pipeline, and fire, police, and other public officials, of gas pipeline emergencies to coordinate and share information to determine the location of the emergency, including both planned responses and actual responses during an emergency. The operator must immediately and directly notify the appropriate public safety answering point or other coordinating agency for the communities and jurisdictions in which the pipeline is located after receiving a notification of potential rupture, as defined in § 192.3, to coordinate and share information to determine the location of any release, regardless of whether the segment is subject to the requirements of § 192.179, § 192.634, or § 192.636.

        (9) Safely restoring any service outage.

        (10) Beginning action under § 192.617, if applicable, as soon after the end of the emergency as possible.

        (11) Actions required to be taken by a controller during an emergency in accordance with the operator's emergency plans and requirements set forth in §§ 192.631, 192.634, and 192.636.

        (12) Each operator must develop written rupture identification procedures to evaluate and identify whether a notification of potential rupture, as defined in § 192.3, is an actual rupture event or a non-rupture event. These procedures must, at a minimum, specify the sources of information, operational factors, and other criteria that operator personnel use to evaluate a notification of potential rupture and identify an actual rupture. For operators installing valves in accordance with § 192.179(e), § 192.179(f), or that are subject to the requirements in § 192.634, those procedures must provide for rupture identification as soon as practicable.

        (b) Each operator shall:

        (1) Furnish its supervisors who are responsible for emergency action a copy of that portion of the latest edition of the emergency procedures established under paragraph (a) of this section as necessary for compliance with those procedures.

        (2) Train the appropriate operating personnel to assure that they are knowledgeable of the emergency procedures and verify that the training is effective.

        (3) Review employee activities to determine whether the procedures were effectively followed in each emergency.

        (c) Each operator must establish and maintain liaison with the appropriate public safety answering point( 9-1-1 emergency call center) where direct access to a 9-1-1 emergency call center is available from the location of the pipeline, as well as fire, police, and other public officials, to:

        (1) Learn the responsibility and resources of each government organization that may respond to a gas pipeline emergency;

        (2) Acquaint the officials with the operator's ability in responding to a gas pipeline emergency;

        (3) Identify the types of gas pipeline emergencies of which the operator notifies the officials; and

        (4) Plan how the operator and officials can engage in mutual assistance to minimize hazards to life or property.

        (a) Except for an operator of a master meter or petroleum gas system covered under paragraph (j) of this section, each pipeline operator must develop and implement a written continuing public education program that follows the guidance provided in the American Petroleum Institute's (API) Recommended Practice (RP) 1162 (incorporated by reference,  § 192.7).

        (b) The operator's program must follow the general program recommendations of API RP 1162 and assess the unique attributes and characteristics of the operator's pipeline and facilities.

        (c) The operator must follow the general program recommendations, including baseline and supplemental requirements of API RP 1162, unless the operator provides justification in its program or procedural manual as to why compliance with all or certain provisions of the recommended practice is not practicable and not necessary for safety.

        (d) The operator's program must specifically include provisions to educate the public, appropriate government organizations, and persons engaged in excavation related activities on:

        (1) Use of a one-call notification system prior to excavation and other damage prevention activities;

        (2) Possible hazards associated with unintended releases from a gas pipeline facility;

        (3) Physical indications that such a release may have occurred;

        (4) Steps that should be taken for public safety in the event of a gas pipeline release; and

        (5) Procedures for reporting such an event.

        (e) The program must include activities to advise affected municipalities, school districts, businesses, and residents of pipeline facility locations.

        (f) The program and the media used must be as comprehensive as necessary to reach all areas in which the operator transports gas.

        (g) The program must be conducted in English and in other languages commonly understood by a significant number and concentration of the non-English speaking population in the operator's area.

        (h) Operators in existence on June 20, 2005, must have completed their written programs no later than June 20, 2006. The operator of a master meter or petroleum gas system covered under paragraph (j) of this section must complete development of its written procedure by June 13, 2008. Upon request, operators must submit their completed programs to PHMSA or, in the case of an intrastate pipeline facility operator, the appropriate State agency.

        (i) The operator's program documentation and evaluation results must be available for periodic review by appropriate regulatory agencies.

        (j) Unless the operator transports gas as a primary activity, the operator of a master meter or petroleum gas system is not required to develop a public awareness program as prescribed in paragraphs (a) through (g) of this section. Instead the operator must develop and implement a written procedure to provide its customers public awareness messages twice annually. If the master meter or petroleum gas system is located on property the operator does not control, the operator must provide similar messages twice annually to persons controlling the property. The public awareness message must include:

        (1) A description of the purpose and reliability of the pipeline;

        (2) An overview of the hazards of the pipeline and prevention measures used;

        (3) Information about damage prevention;

An operator must still comply with § 192.611.

        (2) For any Type C gas gathering pipeline under § 192.9 existing on or before May 16, 2022, that was not previously subject to this part and the operator cannot determine the actual operating pressure of the pipeline for the 5 years preceding May 16, 2023, the operator may establish MAOP using other criteria based on a combination of operating conditions, other tests, and design with approval from PHMSA.

        (5) The pipeline segment does not contain any mechanical couplings used in place of girth welds;

        (6) If a pipeline segment has been previously operated, the segment has not experienced any failure during normal operations indicative of a systemic fault in material as determined by a root cause analysis, including metallurgical examination of the failed pipe. The results of this root cause analysis must be reported to each PHMSA pipeline safety regional office where the pipeline is in service at least 60 days prior to operation at the alternative MAOP. An operator must also notify a State pipeline safety authority when the pipeline is located in a State where PHMSA has an interstate agent agreement, or an intrastate pipeline is regulated by that State; and

        (7) At least 95 percent of girth welds on a segment that was constructed prior to December 22, 2008, must have been non-destructively examined in accordance with § 192.243(b) and (c).

        (c)  If an operator elects to use the alternative maximum allowable operating pressure calculated under paragraph (a) of this section for a pipeline segment, the operator must do each of the following:

An operator must also notify the state pipeline safety authority when the pipeline is located in a state where PHMSA has an interstate agent agreement or where an intrastate pipeline is regulated by that state.

        (2) Certify, by signature of a senior executive officer of the company, as follows:

        (i) The pipeline segment meets the conditions described in paragraph (b) of this section; and

        (ii) The operating and maintenance procedures include the additional operating and maintenance requirements of paragraph (d) of this section; and

        (8) A Class 1 and Class 2 location can be upgraded one class due to class changes per § 192.611(a). All class location changes from Class 1 to Class 2 and from Class 2 to Class 3 must have all anomalies evaluated and remediated per: The “original pipeline class grade” § 192.620(d)(11) anomaly repair requirements; and all anomalies with a wall loss equal to or greater than 40 percent must be excavated and remediated. Pipelines in Class 4 may not operate at an alternative MAOP.

        (d)  In addition to compliance with other applicable safety standards in this part, if an operator establishes a maximum allowable operating pressure for a pipeline segment under paragraph (a) of this section, an operator must comply with the additional operation and maintenance requirements as follows:

        (e)  Notwithstanding the required capacity of pressure relieving and limiting stations otherwise required by § 192.201, if an operator establishes a maximum allowable operating pressure for a pipeline segment in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section, an operator must:

        (1) Provide overpressure protection that limits mainline pressure to a maximum of 104 percent of the maximum allowable operating pressure; and

#### § § 192.624

        (a)  Operators of onshore steel transmission pipeline segments must reconfirm the maximum allowable operating pressure (MAOP) of all pipeline segments in accordance with the requirements of this section if either of the following conditions are met:

        (1) Records necessary to establish the MAOP in accordance with § 192.619(a)(2), including records required by § 192.517(a), are not traceable, verifiable, and complete and the pipeline is located in one of the following locations:

        (i) A high consequence area as defined in § 192.903; or

        (ii) A Class 3 or Class 4 location.

        (2) The pipeline segment's MAOP was established in accordance with § 192.619(c), the pipeline segment's MAOP is greater than or equal to 30 percent of the specified minimum yield strength, and the pipeline segment is located in one of the following areas:

        (i) A high consequence area as defined in § 192.903;

        (ii) A Class 3 or Class 4 location; or

        (iii) A moderate consequence area as defined in § 192.3, if the pipeline segment can accommodate inspection by means of instrumented inline inspection tools.

        (b)  Operators of a pipeline subject to this section must develop and document procedures for completing all actions required by this section by July 1, 2021. These procedures must include a process for reconfirming MAOP for any pipelines that meet a condition of § 192.624(a), and for performing a spike test or material verification in accordance with §§ 192.506 and 192.607, if applicable. All actions required by this section must be completed according to the following schedule:

        (2) Operators must complete all actions required by this section on 100% of the pipeline mileage by July 2, 2035 or as soon as practicable, but not to exceed 4 years after the pipeline segment first meets a condition of § 192.624(a) ( due to a location becoming a high consequence area), whichever is later.

        (3) If operational and environmental constraints limit an operator from meeting the deadlines in § 192.624, the operator may petition for an extension of the completion deadlines by up to 1 year, upon submittal of a notification in accordance with § 192.18. The notification must include an up-to-date plan for completing all actions in accordance with this section, the reason for the requested extension, current status, proposed completion date, outstanding remediation activities, and any needed temporary measures needed to mitigate the impact on safety.

        (c)  Operators of a pipeline segment meeting a condition in paragraph (a) of this section must reconfirm its MAOP using one of the following methods:

        (1)  Perform a pressure test and verify material properties records in accordance with § 192.607 and the following requirements:

        (i)  Perform a pressure test in accordance with subpart J of this part. The MAOP must be equal to the test pressure divided by the greater of either 1.25 or the applicable class location factor in § 192.619(a)(2)(ii).

        (ii)  Determine if the following material properties records are documented in traceable, verifiable, and complete records: Diameter, wall thickness, seam type, and grade (minimum yield strength, ultimate tensile strength).

        (iii)  If any of the records required by paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section are not documented in traceable, verifiable, and complete records, the operator must obtain the missing records in accordance with § 192.607. An operator must test the pipe materials cut out from the test manifold sites at the time the pressure test is conducted. If there is a failure during the pressure test, the operator must test any removed pipe from the pressure test failure in accordance with § 192.607.

        (2)  Reduce pressure, as necessary, and limit MAOP to no greater than the highest actual operating pressure sustained by the pipeline during the 5 years preceding October 1, 2019, divided by the greater of 1.25 or the applicable class location factor in § 192.619(a)(2)(ii). The highest actual sustained pressure must have been reached for a minimum cumulative duration of 8 hours during a continuous 30-day period. The value used as the highest actual sustained operating pressure must account for differences between upstream and downstream pressure on the pipeline by use of either the lowest maximum pressure value for the entire pipeline segment or using the operating pressure gradient along the entire pipeline segment ( the location-specific operating pressure at each location).

        (i) Where the pipeline segment has had a class location change in accordance with § 192.611, and records documenting diameter, wall thickness, seam type, grade (minimum yield strength and ultimate tensile strength), and pressure tests are not documented in traceable, verifiable, and complete records, the operator must reduce the pipeline segment MAOP as follows:

        (A) For pipeline segments where a class location changed from Class 1 to Class 2, from Class 2 to Class 3, or from Class 3 to Class 4, reduce the pipeline MAOP to no greater than the highest actual operating pressure sustained by the pipeline during the 5 years preceding October 1, 2019, divided by 1.39 for Class 1 to Class 2, 1.67 for Class 2 to Class 3, and 2.00 for Class 3 to Class 4.

        (ii) Future uprating of the pipeline segment in accordance with subpart K is allowed if the MAOP is established using Method 2.

        (iii) If an operator elects to use Method 2, but desires to use a less conservative pressure reduction factor or longer look-back period, the operator must notify PHMSA in accordance with § 192.18 no later than 7 calendar days after establishing the reduced MAOP. The notification must include the following details:

        (A) Descriptions of the operational constraints, special circumstances, or other factors that preclude, or make it impractical, to use the pressure reduction factor specified in § 192.624(c)(2);

        (B) The fracture mechanics modeling for failure stress pressures and cyclic fatigue crack growth analysis that complies with § 192.712;

        (C) Justification that establishing MAOP by another method allowed by this section is impractical;

        (D) Justification that the reduced MAOP determined by the operator is safe based on analysis of the condition of the pipeline segment, including material properties records, material properties verified in accordance § 192.607, and the history of the pipeline segment, particularly known corrosion and leakage, and the actual operating pressure, and additional compensatory preventive and mitigative measures taken or planned; and

        (E) Planned duration for operating at the requested MAOP, long-term remediation measures and justification of this operating time interval, including fracture mechanics modeling for failure stress pressures and cyclic fatigue growth analysis and other validated forms of engineering analysis that have been reviewed and confirmed by subject matter experts.

        (3)  Conduct an ECA in accordance with § 192.632.

        (4)  Replace the pipeline segment in accordance with this part.

        (5)  Pipelines with a potential impact radius (PIR) less than or equal to 150 feet may establish the MAOP as follows:

        (i) Reduce the MAOP to no greater than the highest actual operating pressure sustained by the pipeline during 5 years preceding October 1, 2019, divided by 1.1. The highest actual sustained pressure must have been reached for a minimum cumulative duration of 8 hours during one continuous 30-day period. The reduced MAOP must account for differences between discharge and upstream pressure on the pipeline by use of either the lowest value for the entire pipeline segment or the operating pressure gradient ( the location specific operating pressure at each location);

        (ii) Conduct patrols in accordance with § 192.705 paragraphs (a) and (c) and conduct instrumented leakage surveys in accordance with § 192.706 at intervals not to exceed those in the following table 1 to § 192.624(c)(5)(ii):

        (iii) Under Method 5, future uprating of the pipeline segment in accordance with subpart K is allowed.

        (6)  Operators may use an alternative technical evaluation process that provides a documented engineering analysis for establishing MAOP. If an operator elects to use alternative technology, the operator must notify PHMSA in advance in accordance with § 192.18. The notification must include descriptions of the following details:

        (i) The technology or technologies to be used for tests, examinations, and assessments; the method for establishing material properties; and analytical techniques with similar analysis from prior tool runs done to ensure the results are consistent with the required corresponding hydrostatic test pressure for the pipeline segment being evaluated;

        (iii) Pipeline segment data, including original design, maintenance and operating history, anomaly or flaw characterization;

        (iv) Assessment techniques and acceptance criteria, including anomaly detection confidence level, probability of detection, and uncertainty of the predicted failure pressure quantified as a fraction of specified minimum yield strength;

        (v) If any pipeline segment contains cracking or may be susceptible to cracking or crack-like defects found through or identified by assessments, leaks, failures, manufacturing vintage histories, or any other available information about the pipeline, the operator must estimate the remaining life of the pipeline in accordance with paragraph § 192.712;

        (vi) Operational monitoring procedures;

        (vii) Methodology and criteria used to justify and establish the MAOP; and

        (vii) Documentation of the operator's process and procedures used to implement the use of the alternative technology, including any records generated through its use.

        (2) The procedures required by this section must be integrated, as appropriate, with operating and emergency procedures required by §§ 192.605 and 192.615. An operator must develop the procedures no later than August 1, 2011, and must implement the procedures according to the following schedule. The procedures required by paragraphs (b), (c)(5), (d)(2) and (d)(3), (f) and (g) of this section must be implemented no later than October 1, 2011. The procedures required by paragraphs (c)(1) through (4), (d)(1), (d)(4), and (e) must be implemented no later than August 1, 2012. The training procedures required by paragraph (h) must be implemented no later than August 1, 2012, except that any training required by another paragraph of this section must be implemented no later than the deadline for that paragraph.

        (b)  Each operator must define the roles and responsibilities of a controller during normal, abnormal, and emergency operating conditions. To provide for a controller's prompt and appropriate response to operating conditions, an operator must define each of the following:

        (1) A controller's authority and responsibility to make decisions and take actions during normal operations;

        (2) A controller's role when an abnormal operating condition is detected, even if the controller is not the first to detect the condition, including the controller's responsibility to take specific actions and to communicate with others;

        (3) A controller's role during an emergency, even if the controller is not the first to detect the emergency, including the controller's responsibility to take specific actions and to communicate with others;

        (4) A method of recording controller shift-changes and any hand-over of responsibility between controllers; and

        (5) The roles, responsibilities and qualifications of others with the authority to direct or supersede the specific technical actions of a controller.

        (c)  Each operator must provide its controllers with the information, tools, processes and procedures necessary for the controllers to carry out the roles and responsibilities the operator has defined by performing each of the following:

        (1) Implement sections 1, 4, 8, 9, 11.1, and 11.3 of API RP 1165 (incorporated by reference, see § 192.7) whenever a SCADA system is added, expanded or replaced, unless the operator demonstrates that certain provisions of sections 1, 4, 8, 9, 11.1, and 11.3 of API RP 1165 are not practical for the SCADA system used;

        (2) Conduct a point-to-point verification between SCADA displays and related field equipment when field equipment is added or moved and when other changes that affect pipeline safety are made to field equipment or SCADA displays;

        (4) Test any backup SCADA systems at least once each calendar year, but at intervals not to exceed 15 months; and

        (5) Establish and implement procedures for when a different controller assumes responsibility, including the content of information to be exchanged.

        (d)  Each operator must implement the following methods to reduce the risk associated with controller fatigue that could inhibit a controller's ability to carry out the roles and responsibilities the operator has defined:

        (1) Establish shift lengths and schedule rotations that provide controllers off-duty time sufficient to achieve eight hours of continuous sleep;

        (2) Educate controllers and supervisors in fatigue mitigation strategies and how off-duty activities contribute to fatigue;

        (3) Train controllers and supervisors to recognize the effects of fatigue; and

        (4) Establish a maximum limit on controller hours-of-service, which may provide for an emergency deviation from the maximum limit if necessary for the safe operation of a pipeline facility.

        (e)  Each operator using a SCADA system must have a written alarm management plan to provide for effective controller response to alarms. An operator's plan must include provisions to:

        (1) Review SCADA safety-related alarm operations using a process that ensures alarms are accurate and support safe pipeline operations;

        (2) Identify at least once each calendar month points affecting safety that have been taken off scan in the SCADA host, have had alarms inhibited, generated false alarms, or that have had forced or manual values for periods of time exceeding that required for associated maintenance or operating activities;

        (3) Verify the correct safety-related alarm set-point values and alarm descriptions at least once each calendar year, but at intervals not to exceed 15 months;

        (g)  Each operator must assure that lessons learned from its operating experience are incorporated, as appropriate, into its control room management procedures by performing each of the following:

        (1) Review incidents that must be reported pursuant to 49 CFR part 191 to determine if control room actions contributed to the event and, if so, correct, where necessary, deficiencies related to:

        (i) Controller fatigue;

        (ii) Field equipment;

        (iii) The operation of any relief device;

        (iv) Procedures;

        (v) SCADA system configuration; and

        (vi) SCADA system performance.

        (2) Include lessons learned from the operator's experience in the training program required by this section.

        (h)  Each operator must establish a controller training program and review the training program content to identify potential improvements at least once each calendar year, but at intervals not to exceed 15 months.

        § 192.632   Engineering Critical Assessment for Maximum Allowable Operating Pressure Reconfirmation: Onshore steel transmission pipelines.

#### § § 192.632

        When an operator conducts an MAOP reconfirmation in accordance with § 192.624(c)(3) “Method 3” using an ECA to establish the material strength and MAOP of the pipeline segment, the ECA must comply with the requirements of this section. The ECA must assess: Threats; loadings and operational circumstances relevant to those threats, including along the pipeline right-of way; outcomes of the threat assessment; relevant mechanical and fracture properties; in-service degradation or failure processes; and initial and final defect size relevance. The ECA must quantify the interacting effects of threats on any defect in the pipeline.

        (a)  (1) The material properties required to perform an ECA analysis in accordance with this paragraph are as follows: Diameter, wall thickness, seam type, grade (minimum yield strength and ultimate tensile strength), and Charpy v-notch toughness values based upon the lowest operational temperatures, if applicable. If any material properties required to perform an ECA for any pipeline segment in accordance with this paragraph are not documented in traceable, verifiable and complete records, an operator must use conservative assumptions and include the pipeline segment in its program to verify the undocumented information in accordance with § 192.607. The ECA must integrate, analyze, and account for the material properties, the results of all tests, direct examinations, destructive tests, and assessments performed in accordance with this section, along with other pertinent information related to pipeline integrity, including close interval surveys, coating surveys, interference surveys required by subpart I of this part, cause analyses of prior incidents, prior pressure test leaks and failures, other leaks, pipe inspections, and prior integrity assessments, including those required by §§ 192.617, 192.710, and subpart O of this part.

        (2) The ECA must analyze and determine the predicted failure pressure for the defect being assessed using procedures that implement the appropriate failure criteria and justification as follows:

        (i) The ECA must analyze any cracks or crack-like defects remaining in the pipe, or that could remain in the pipe, to determine the predicted failure pressure of each defect in accordance with § 192.712.

        (ii) The ECA must analyze any metal loss defects not associated with a dent, including corrosion, gouges, scrapes or other metal loss defects that could remain in the pipe, to determine the predicted failure pressure. ASME/ANSI B31G (incorporated by reference,  § 192.7) or R-STRENG (incorporated by reference,  § 192.7) must be used for corrosion defects. Both procedures and their analysis apply to corroded regions that do not penetrate the pipe wall over 80 percent of the wall thickness and are subject to the limitations prescribed in the equations' procedures. The ECA must use conservative assumptions for metal loss dimensions (length, width, and depth).

        (iii) When determining the predicted failure pressure for gouges, scrapes, selective seam weld corrosion, crack-related defects, or any defect within a dent, appropriate failure criteria and justification of the criteria must be used and documented.

        (iv) If SMYS or actual material yield and ultimate tensile strength is not known or not documented by traceable, verifiable, and complete records, then the operator must assume 30,000 p.s.i. or determine the material properties using § 192.607.

        (3) The ECA must analyze the interaction of defects to conservatively determine the most limiting predicted failure pressure. Examples include, but are not limited to, cracks in or near locations with corrosion metal loss, dents with gouges or other metal loss, or cracks in or near dents or other deformation damage. The ECA must document all evaluations and any assumptions used in the ECA process.

        (4) The MAOP must be established at the lowest predicted failure pressure for any known or postulated defect, or interacting defects, remaining in the pipe divided by the greater of 1.25 or the applicable factor listed in § 192.619(a)(2)(ii).

        (b)  An operator must utilize previous pressure tests or develop and implement an assessment program to determine the size of defects remaining in the pipe to be analyzed in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section.

        (1) An operator may use a previous pressure test that complied with subpart J to determine the defects remaining in the pipe if records for a pressure test meeting the requirements of subpart J of this part exist for the pipeline segment. The operator must calculate the largest defect that could have survived the pressure test. The operator must predict how much the defects have grown since the date of the pressure test in accordance with § 192.712. The ECA must analyze the predicted size of the largest defect that could have survived the pressure test that could remain in the pipe at the time the ECA is performed. The operator must calculate the remaining life of the most severe defects that could have survived the pressure test and establish a re-assessment interval in accordance with the methodology in § 192.712.

        (2) Operators may use an inline inspection program in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section.

        (3) Operators may use “other technology” if it is validated by a subject matter expert to produce an equivalent understanding of the condition of the pipe equal to or greater than pressure testing or an inline inspection program. If an operator elects to use “other technology” in the ECA, it must notify PHMSA in advance of using the other technology in accordance with § 192.18. The “other technology” notification must have:

        (i) Descriptions of the technology or technologies to be used for all tests, examinations, and assessments, including characterization of defect size used in the crack assessments (length, depth, and volumetric); and

        (ii) Procedures and processes to conduct tests, examinations, assessments and evaluations, analyze defects, and remediate defects discovered.

        (c)  An inline inspection (ILI) program to determine the defects remaining the pipe for the ECA analysis must be performed using tools that can detect wall loss, deformation from dents, wrinkle bends, ovalities, expansion, seam defects, including cracking and selective seam weld corrosion, longitudinal, circumferential and girth weld cracks, hard spot cracking, and stress corrosion cracking.

        (1) If a pipeline has segments that might be susceptible to hard spots based on assessment, leak, failure, manufacturing vintage history, or other information, then the ILI program must include a tool that can detect hard spots.

        (2) If the pipeline has had a reportable incident, as defined in § 191.3, attributed to a girth weld failure since its most recent pressure test, then the ILI program must include a tool that can detect girth weld defects unless the ECA analysis performed in accordance with this section includes an engineering evaluation program to analyze and account for the susceptibility of girth weld failure due to lateral stresses.

        (3) Inline inspection must be performed in accordance with § 192.493.

        (4) An operator must use unity plots or equivalent methodologies to validate the performance of the ILI tools in identifying and sizing actionable manufacturing and construction related anomalies. Enough data points must be used to validate tool performance at the same or better statistical confidence level provided in the tool specifications. The operator must have a process for identifying defects outside the tool performance specifications and following up with the ILI vendor to conduct additional in-field examinations, reanalyze ILI data, or both.

        (5) Interpretation and evaluation of assessment results must meet the requirements of §§ 192.710, 192.713, and subpart O of this part, and must conservatively account for the accuracy and reliability of ILI, in-the-ditch examination methods and tools, and any other assessment and examination results used to determine the actual sizes of cracks, metal loss, deformation and other defect dimensions by applying the most conservative limit of the tool tolerance specification. ILI and in-the-ditch examination tools and procedures for crack assessments (length and depth) must have performance and evaluation standards confirmed for accuracy through confirmation tests for the defect types and pipe material vintage being evaluated. Inaccuracies must be accounted for in the procedures for evaluations and fracture mechanics models for predicted failure pressure determinations.

        (6) Anomalies detected by ILI assessments must be remediated in accordance with applicable criteria in §§ 192.713 and 192.933.

        (d)  If any pipeline segment contains cracking or may be susceptible to cracking or crack-like defects found through or identified by assessments, leaks, failures, manufacturing vintage histories, or any other available information about the pipeline, the operator must estimate the remaining life of the pipeline in accordance with § 192.712.

        (e)  An operator must retain records of investigations, tests, analyses, assessments, repairs, replacements, alterations, and other actions taken in accordance with the requirements of this section for the life of the pipeline.

        § 192.634   Transmission lines: Onshore valve shut-off for rupture mitigation.

#### § § 192.634

        (a)  For new or entirely replaced onshore transmission pipeline segments with diameters of 6 inches or greater that are located in high-consequence areas (HCA) or Class 3 or Class 4 locations and that are installed after April 10, 2023, an operator must install or use existing rupture-mitigation valves (RMV), or an alternative equivalent technology, according to the requirements of this section and §§ 192.179 and 192.636. RMVs and alternative equivalent technologies must be operational within 14 days of placing the new or replaced pipeline segment into service. An operator may request an extension of this 14-day operation requirement if it can demonstrate to PHMSA, in accordance with the notification procedures in § 192.18, that application of that requirement would be economically, technically, or operationally infeasible. The requirements of this section apply to all applicable pipe replacement projects, even those that do not otherwise involve the addition or replacement of a valve. This section does not apply to pipe segments in Class 1 or Class 2 locations that have a potential impact radius (PIR), as defined in § 192.903, that is less than or equal to 150 feet.

        (b)  RMVs, or alternative equivalent technology, must be installed in accordance with the following requirements:

        (1)  For purposes of this section, a “shut-off segment” means the segment of pipe located between the upstream valve closest to the upstream endpoint of the new or replaced Class 3 or Class 4 or HCA pipeline segment and the downstream valve closest to the downstream endpoint of the new or replaced Class 3 or Class 4 or HCA pipeline segment so that the entirety of the segment that is within the HCA or the Class 3 or Class 4 location is between at least two RMVs or alternative equivalent technologies. If any crossover or lateral pipe for gas receipts or deliveries connects to the shut-off segment between the upstream and downstream valves, the shut-off segment also must extend to a valve on the crossover connection(s) or lateral(s), such that, when all valves are closed, there is no flow path for gas to be transported to the rupture site (except for residual gas already in the shut-off segment). Multiple Class 3 or Class 4 locations or HCA segments may be contained within a single shut-off segment. The operator is not required to select the closest valve to the shut-off segment as the RMV, as that term is defined in § 192.3, or the alternative equivalent technology. An operator may use a manual compressor station valve at a continuously manned station as an alternative equivalent technology, but it must be able to be closed within 30 minutes following rupture identification, as that term is defined at § 192.3. Such a valve used as an alternative equivalent technology would not require a notification to PHMSA in accordance with § 192.18.

        (2)  A pipeline subject to paragraph (a) of this section must have RMVs or alternative equivalent technology on the upstream and downstream side of the pipeline segment. The distance between RMVs or alternative equivalent technologies must not exceed:

        (i) Eight (8) miles for any Class 4 location,

        (ii) Fifteen (15) miles for any Class 3 location, or

        (iii) Twenty (20) miles for all other locations.

        (3)  Laterals extending from shut-off segments that contribute less than 5 percent of the total shut-off segment volume may have RMVs or alternative equivalent technologies that meet the actuation requirements of this section at locations other than mainline receipt/delivery points, as long as all of the laterals contributing gas volumes to the shut-off segment do not contribute more than 5 percent of the total shut-off segment gas volume based upon maximum flow volume at the operating pressure. For laterals that are 12 inches in diameter or less, a check valve that allows gas to flow freely in one direction and contains a mechanism to automatically prevent flow in the other direction may be used as an alternative equivalent technology where it is positioned to stop flow into the shut-off segment. Such check valves that are used as an alternative equivalent technology in accordance with this paragraph (b)(3) are not subject to § 192.636, but they must be inspected, operated, and remediated in accordance with § 192.745, including for closure and leakage to ensure operational reliability. An operator using such a check valve as an alternative equivalent technology must notify PHMSA in accordance with §§ 192.18 and 192.179 and develop and implement maintenance procedures for such equipment that meet § 192.745.

        (4)  An operator may use a manual valve as an alternative equivalent technology in lieu of an RMV for a crossover connection if, during normal operations, the valve is closed to prevent the flow of gas by the use of a locking device or other means designed to prevent the opening of the valve by persons other than those authorized by the operator. The operator must develop and implement operating procedures and document that the valve has been closed and locked in accordance with the operator's lock-out and tag-out procedures to prevent the flow of gas. An operator using such a manual valve as an alternative equivalent technology must notify PHMSA in accordance with §§ 192.18 and 192.179.

        § 192.635   Notification of potential rupture.

#### § § 192.635

        (a) As used in this part, a “notification of potential rupture” refers to the notification of, or observation by, an operator (e.g., by or to its controller(s) in a control room, field personnel, nearby pipeline or utility personnel, the public, local responders, or public authorities) of one or more of the below indicia of a potential unintentional or uncontrolled release of a large volume of gas from a pipeline:

        (1) An unanticipated or unexplained pressure loss outside of the pipeline's normal operating pressures, as defined in the operator's written procedures. The operator must establish in its written procedures that an unanticipated or unplanned pressure loss is outside of the pipeline's normal operating pressures when there is a pressure loss greater than 10 percent occurring within a time interval of 15 minutes or less, unless the operator has documented in its written procedures the operational need for a greater pressure-change threshold due to pipeline flow dynamics (including changes in operating pressure, flow rate, or volume), that are caused by fluctuations in gas demand, gas receipts, or gas deliveries; or

        (2) An unanticipated or unexplained flow rate change, pressure change, equipment function, or other pipeline instrumentation indication at the upstream or downstream station that may be representative of an event meeting paragraph (a)(1) of this section; or

        (3) Any unanticipated or unexplained rapid release of a large volume of gas, a fire, or an explosion in the immediate vicinity of the pipeline.

        (b) A notification of potential rupture occurs when an operator first receives notice of or observes an event specified in paragraph (a) of this section.

        (c) This section does not apply to any gas gathering line.

> [Amdt. 192-130, 87 FR 20985, Apr. 8, 2022, as amended by Amdt. 192-136, 89 FR 53880, June 28, 2024]

        § 192.636   Transmission lines: Response to a rupture; capabilities of rupture-mitigation valves (RMVs) or alternative equivalent technologies.

#### § § 192.636

        (a)  The requirements in this section apply to rupture-mitigation valves (RMVs), as defined in § 192.3, or alternative equivalent technologies, installed pursuant to §§ 192.179(e), (f), and (g) and 192.634.

        (b)  An operator must, as soon as practicable but within 30 minutes of rupture identification ( § 192.615(a)(12)), fully close any RMVs or alternative equivalent technologies necessary to minimize the volume of gas released from a pipeline and mitigate the consequences of a rupture.

        (c)  An operator may leave an RMV or alternative equivalent technology open for more than 30 minutes, as required by paragraph (b) of this section, if the operator has previously established in its operating procedures and demonstrated within a notice submitted under § 192.18 for PHMSA review, that closing the RMV or alternative equivalent technology would be detrimental to public safety. The request must have been coordinated with appropriate local emergency responders, and the operator and emergency responders must determine that it is safe to leave the valve open. Operators must have written procedures for determining whether to leave an RMV or alternative equivalent technology open, including plans to communicate with local emergency responders and minimize environmental impacts, which must be submitted as part of its notification to PHMSA.

        (d)  An RMV, as defined in § 192.3, or alternative equivalent technology, must be capable of being monitored or controlled either remotely or by on-site personnel as follows:

        (1) Operated during normal, abnormal, and emergency operating conditions;

        (2) Monitored for valve status ( open, closed, or partial closed/open), upstream pressure, and downstream pressure. For automatic shut-off valves (ASV), an operator does not need to monitor remotely a valve's status if the operator has the capability to monitor pressures or gas flow rate within each pipeline segment located between RMVs or alternative equivalent technologies to identify and locate a rupture. Pipeline segments that use manual valves or other alternative equivalent technologies must have the capability to monitor pressures or gas flow rates on the pipeline to identify and locate a rupture; and

        (3) Have a back-up power source to maintain SCADA systems or other remote communications for remote-control valve (RCV) or automatic shut-off valve (ASV) operational status, or be monitored and controlled by on-site personnel.

        (e)  The position and operational status of an RMV must be appropriately monitored through electronic communication with remote instrumentation or other equivalent means. An operator does not need to monitor remotely an ASV's status if the operator has the capability to monitor pressures or gas flow rate on the pipeline to identify and locate a rupture.

        (f)  Prior to using an ASV as an RMV, an operator must conduct flow modeling for the shut-off segment and any laterals that feed the shut-off segment, so that the valve will close within 30 minutes or less following rupture identification, consistent with the operator's procedures, and in accordance with § 192.3 and this section. The flow modeling must include the anticipated maximum, normal, or any other flow volumes, pressures, or other operating conditions that may be encountered during the year, not exceeding a period of 15 months, and it must be modeled for the flow between the RMVs or alternative equivalent technologies, and any looped pipelines or gas receipt tie-ins. If operating conditions change that could affect the ASV set pressures and the 30-minute valve closure time after notification of potential rupture, as defined at § 192.3, an operator must conduct a new flow model and reset the ASV set pressures prior to the next review for ASV set pressures in accordance with § 192.745. The flow model must include a time/pressure chart for the segment containing the ASV if a rupture occurs. An operator must conduct this flow modeling prior to making flow condition changes in a manner that could render the 30-minute valve closure time unachievable.

        (g)  For pipeline segments in a Class 1 location that do not meet the definition of a high consequence area (HCA), an operator submitting a notification pursuant to §§ 192.18 and 192.179 for use of manual valves as an alternative equivalent technology may also request an exemption from the requirements of § 192.636(b).

        (h)  Operators using a manual valve as an alternative equivalent technology as authorized pursuant to §§ 192.18, 192.179, and 192.634 and this section must develop and implement operating procedures that appropriately designate and locate nearby personnel to ensure valve shutoff in accordance with this section and § 192.634. Manual operation of valves must include time for the assembly of necessary operating personnel, the acquisition of necessary tools and equipment, driving time under heavy traffic conditions and at the posted speed limit, walking time to access the valve, and time to shut off all valves manually, not to exceed the maximum response time allowed under paragraph (b) or (c) of this section.

        § 192.710   Transmission lines: Assessments outside of high consequence areas.

#### § § 192.710

        (a)  This section applies to onshore steel transmission pipeline segments with a maximum allowable operating pressure of greater than or equal to 30% of the specified minimum yield strength and are located in:

        (1) A Class 3 or Class 4 location; or

        (2) A moderate consequence area as defined in § 192.3, if the pipeline segment can accommodate inspection by means of an instrumented inline inspection tool ( “smart pig”).

        (3) This section does not apply to a pipeline segment located in a high consequence area as defined in § 192.903.

        (b) —(1)  An operator must perform initial assessments in accordance with this section based on a risk-based prioritization schedule and complete initial assessment for all applicable pipeline segments no later than July 3, 2034, or as soon as practicable but not to exceed 10 years after the pipeline segment first meets the conditions of § 192.710(a) ( due to a change in class location or the area becomes a moderate consequence area), whichever is later.

        (2)  An operator must perform periodic reassessments at least once every 10 years, with intervals not to exceed 126 months, or a shorter reassessment interval based upon the type of anomaly, operational, material, and environmental conditions found on the pipeline segment, or as necessary to ensure public safety.

        (3)  An operator may use a prior assessment conducted before July 1, 2020 as an initial assessment for the pipeline segment, if the assessment met the subpart O requirements of part 192 for in-line inspection at the time of the assessment. If an operator uses this prior assessment as its initial assessment, the operator must reassess the pipeline segment according to the reassessment interval specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section calculated from the date of the prior assessment.

        (4)  An integrity assessment conducted in accordance with the requirements of § 192.624(c) for establishing MAOP may be used as an initial assessment or reassessment under this section.

        (c)  The initial assessments and the reassessments required by paragraph (b) of this section must be capable of identifying anomalies and defects associated with each of the threats to which the pipeline segment is susceptible and must be performed using one or more of the following methods:

        (1)  Internal inspection tool or tools capable of detecting those threats to which the pipeline is susceptible, such as corrosion, deformation and mechanical damage ( dents, gouges and grooves), material cracking and crack-like defects ( stress corrosion cracking, selective seam weld corrosion, environmentally assisted cracking, and girth weld cracks), hard spots with cracking, and any other threats to which the covered segment is susceptible. When performing an assessment using an in-line inspection tool, an operator must comply with § 192.493;

        (2)  Pressure test conducted in accordance with subpart J of this part. The use of subpart J pressure testing is appropriate for threats such as internal corrosion, external corrosion, and other environmentally assisted corrosion mechanisms; manufacturing and related defect threats, including defective pipe and pipe seams; and stress corrosion cracking, selective seam weld corrosion, dents and other forms of mechanical damage;

        (3)  A spike hydrostatic pressure test conducted in accordance with § 192.506. A spike hydrostatic pressure test is appropriate for time-dependent threats such as stress corrosion cracking; selective seam weld corrosion; manufacturing and related defects, including defective pipe and pipe seams; and other forms of defect or damage involving cracks or crack-like defects;

        (4)  Excavation and  direct examination by means of visual examination, direct measurement, and recorded non-destructive examination results and data needed to assess all applicable threats. Based upon the threat assessed, examples of appropriate non-destructive examination methods include ultrasonic testing (UT), phased array ultrasonic testing (PAUT), Inverse Wave Field Extrapolation (IWEX), radiography, and magnetic particle inspection (MPI);

        (5)  Guided Wave Ultrasonic Testing (GWUT) as described in Appendix F;

        (6)  Direct assessment to address threats of external corrosion, internal corrosion, and stress corrosion cracking. The use of use of direct assessment to address threats of external corrosion, internal corrosion, and stress corrosion cracking is allowed only if appropriate for the threat and pipeline segment being assessed. Use of direct assessment for threats other than the threat for which the direct assessment method is suitable is not allowed. An operator must conduct the direct assessment in accordance with the requirements listed in § 192.923 and with the applicable requirements specified in §§ 192.925, 192.927 and 192.929; or

        (7)  Other technology that an operator demonstrates can provide an equivalent understanding of the condition of the line pipe for each of the threats to which the pipeline is susceptible. An operator must notify PHMSA in advance of using the other technology in accordance with § 192.18.

        (d)  An operator must analyze and account for the data obtained from an assessment performed under paragraph (c) of this section to determine if a condition could adversely affect the safe operation of the pipeline using personnel qualified by knowledge, training, and experience. In addition, when analyzing inline inspection data, an operator must account for uncertainties in reported results ( tool tolerance, detection threshold, probability of detection, probability of identification, sizing accuracy, conservative anomaly interaction criteria, location accuracy, anomaly findings, and unity chart plots or equivalent for determining uncertainties and verifying actual tool performance) in identifying and characterizing anomalies.

        (e)  Discovery of a condition occurs when an operator has adequate information about a condition to determine that the condition presents a potential threat to the integrity of the pipeline. An operator must promptly, but no later than 180 days after conducting an integrity assessment, obtain sufficient information about a condition to make that determination, unless the operator demonstrates that 180 days is impracticable.

        (f)  An operator must comply with the requirements in §§ 192.485, 192.711, 192.712, 192.713, and 192.714, where applicable, if a condition that could adversely affect the safe operation of a pipeline is discovered.

        (g)  An operator must analyze and account for all available relevant information about a pipeline in complying with the requirements in paragraphs (a) through (f) of this section.

        § 192.711   Transmission lines: General requirements for repair procedures.

#### § § 192.711

        (a)  Each operator must take immediate temporary measures to protect the public whenever:

        (1) A leak, imperfection, or damage that impairs its serviceability is found in a segment of steel transmission line operating at or above 40 percent of the SMYS; and

        (2) It is not feasible to make a permanent repair at the time of discovery.

        (b)  An operator must make permanent repairs on its pipeline system according to the following:

        (1)(i) Non-integrity management repairs for gathering lines and offshore transmission lines: For gathering lines subject to this section in accordance with § 192.9 and for offshore transmission lines, an operator must make permanent repairs as soon as feasible.

        (ii) Non-integrity management repairs for onshore transmission lines: Except for gathering lines exempted from this section in accordance with § 192.9 and offshore transmission lines, after May 24, 2023, whenever an operator discovers any condition that could adversely affect the safe operation of a pipeline segment not covered by an integrity management program under subpart O of this part, it must correct the condition as prescribed in § 192.714.

        (2) Integrity management repairs: When an operator discovers a condition on a pipeline covered under Subpart O-Gas Transmission Pipeline Integrity Management, the operator must remediate the condition as prescribed by § 192.933(d).

        (c)  Except as provided in § 192.717(b)(3), no operator may use a welded patch as a means of repair.

        § 192.712   Analysis of predicted failure pressure and critical strain level.

#### § § 192.712

        (a)  Whenever required by this part, operators of onshore steel transmission pipelines must analyze anomalies or defects to determine the predicted failure pressure at the location of the anomaly or defect, and the remaining life of the pipeline segment at the location of the anomaly or defect, in accordance with this section.

        (b)  When analyzing corrosion metal loss under this section, an operator must use a suitable remaining strength calculation method including, ASME/ANSI B31G (incorporated by reference,  § 192.7); R-STRENG (incorporated by reference,  § 192.7); or an alternative equivalent method of remaining strength calculation that will provide an equally conservative result.

        (1) If an operator would choose to use a remaining strength calculation method that could provide a less conservative result than the methods listed in paragraph (b) introductory text, the operator must notify PHMSA in advance in accordance with § 192.18(c).

        (2) The notification provided for by paragraph (b)(1) of this section must include a comparison of its predicted failure pressures to R-STRENG or ASME/ANSI B31G, all burst pressure tests used, and any other technical reviews used to qualify the calculation method(s) for varying corrosion profiles.

        (c)  To evaluate dents and other mechanical damage that could result in a stress riser or other integrity impact, an operator must develop a procedure and perform an engineering critical assessment as follows:

        (1) Identify and evaluate potential threats to the pipe segment in the vicinity of the anomaly or defect, including ground movement, external loading, fatigue, cracking, and corrosion.

        (2) Review high-resolution magnetic flux leakage (HR-MFL) high-resolution deformation, inertial mapping, and crack detection inline inspection data for damage in the dent area and any associated weld region, including available data from previous inline inspections.

        (3) Perform pipeline curvature-based strain analysis using recent HR-Deformation inspection data.

        (4) Compare the dent profile between the most recent and previous in-line inspections to identify significant changes in dent depth and shape.

        (5) Identify and quantify all previous and present significant loads acting on the dent.

        (6) Evaluate the strain level associated with the anomaly or defect and any nearby welds using Finite Element Analysis, or other technology in accordance with this section. Using Finite Element Analysis to quantify the dent strain, and then estimating and evaluating the damage using the Strain Limit Damage (SLD) and Ductile Failure Damage Indicator (DFDI) at the dent, are appropriate evaluation methods.

        (7) The analyses performed in accordance with this section must account for material property uncertainties, model inaccuracies, and inline inspection tool sizing tolerances.

        (8) Dents with a depth greater than 10 percent of the pipe outside diameter or with geometric strain levels that exceed the lessor of 10 percent or exceed the critical strain for the pipe material properties must be remediated in accordance with § 192.713, § 192.714, or § 192.933, as applicable.

        (9) Using operational pressure data, a valid fatigue life prediction model that is appropriate for the pipeline segment, and assuming a reassessment safety factor of 5 or greater for the assessment interval, estimate the fatigue life of the dent by Finite Element Analysis or other analytical technique that is technically appropriate for dent assessment and reassessment intervals in accordance with this section. Multiple dent or other fatigue models must be used for the evaluation as a part of the engineering critical assessment.

        (10) If the dent or mechanical damage is suspected to have cracks, then a crack growth rate assessment is required to ensure adequate life for the dent with crack(s) until remediation or the dent with crack(s) must be evaluated and remediated in accordance with the criteria and timing requirements in § 192.713, § 192.714, or § 192.933, as applicable.

        (11) An operator using an engineering critical assessment procedure, other technologies, or techniques to comply with paragraph (c) of this section must submit advance notification to PHMSA, with the relevant procedures, in accordance with § 192.18.

        (d) —(1)  When analyzing cracks and crack-like defects under this section, an operator must determine predicted failure pressure, failure stress pressure, and crack growth using a technically proven fracture mechanics model appropriate to the failure mode (ductile, brittle or both), material properties (pipe and weld properties), and boundary condition used (pressure test, ILI, or other).

        (2)  If the pipeline segment is susceptible to cyclic fatigue or other loading conditions that could lead to fatigue crack growth, fatigue analysis must be performed using an applicable fatigue crack growth law (for example, Paris Law) or other technically appropriate engineering methodology. For other degradation processes that can cause crack growth, appropriate engineering analysis must be used. The above methodologies must be validated by a subject matter expert to determine conservative predictions of flaw growth and remaining life at the maximum allowable operating pressure. The operator must calculate the remaining life of the pipeline by determining the amount of time required for the crack to grow to a size that would fail at maximum allowable operating pressure.

        (i) When calculating crack size that would fail at MAOP, and the material toughness is not documented in traceable, verifiable, and complete records, the same Charpy v-notch toughness value established in paragraph (e)(2) of this section must be used.

        (ii) Initial and final flaw size must be determined using a fracture mechanics model appropriate to the failure mode (ductile, brittle or both) and boundary condition used (pressure test, ILI, or other).

        (iii) An operator must re-evaluate the remaining life of the pipeline before 50% of the remaining life calculated by this analysis has expired. The operator must determine and document if further pressure tests or use of other assessment methods are required at that time. The operator must continue to re-evaluate the remaining life of the pipeline before 50% of the remaining life calculated in the most recent evaluation has expired.

        (3)  For cases in which the operator does not have in-line inspection crack anomaly data and is analyzing potential crack defects that could have survived a pressure test, the operator must calculate the largest potential crack defect sizes using the methods in paragraph (d)(1) of this section. If pipe material toughness is not documented in traceable, verifiable, and complete records, the operator must use one of the following for Charpy v-notch toughness values based upon minimum operational temperature and equivalent to a full-size specimen value:

        (i) Charpy v-notch toughness values from comparable pipe with known properties of the same vintage and from the same steel and pipe manufacturer;

        (ii) A conservative Charpy v-notch toughness value to determine the toughness based upon the material properties verification process specified in § 192.607;

        (iii) A full size equivalent Charpy v-notch upper-shelf toughness level of 120 ft.-lbs.; or

        (iv) Other appropriate values that an operator demonstrates can provide conservative Charpy v-notch toughness values of the crack-related conditions of the pipeline segment. Operators using an assumed Charpy v-notch toughness value must notify PHMSA in accordance with § 192.18.

        (e)  In performing the analyses of predicted or assumed anomalies or defects in accordance with this section, an operator must use data as follows.

        (1) An operator must explicitly analyze and account for uncertainties in reported assessment results (including tool tolerance, detection threshold, probability of detection, probability of identification, sizing accuracy, conservative anomaly interaction criteria, location accuracy, anomaly findings, and unity chart plots or equivalent for determining uncertainties and verifying tool performance) in identifying and characterizing the type and dimensions of anomalies or defects used in the analyses, unless the defect dimensions have been verified using  direct measurements.

        (2) The analyses performed in accordance with this section must utilize pipe and material properties that are documented in traceable, verifiable, and complete records. If documented data required for any analysis is not available, an operator must obtain the undocumented data through § 192.607. Until documented material properties are available, the operator shall use conservative assumptions as follows:

        (i)  An operator must use one of the following for material toughness:

        (A) Charpy v-notch toughness values from comparable pipe with known properties of the same vintage and from the same steel and pipe manufacturer;

        (B) A conservative Charpy v-notch toughness value to determine the toughness based upon the ongoing material properties verification process specified in § 192.607;

        (C) If the pipeline segment does not have a history of reportable incidents caused by cracking or crack-like defects, maximum Charpy v-notch toughness values of 13.0 ft.-lbs. for body cracks and 4.0 ft.-lbs. for cold weld, lack of fusion, and selective seam weld corrosion defects;

        (D) If the pipeline segment has a history of reportable incidents caused by cracking or crack-like defects, maximum Charpy v-notch toughness values of 5.0 ft.-lbs. for body cracks and 1.0 ft.-lbs. for cold weld, lack of fusion, and selective seam weld corrosion; or

        (E) Other appropriate values that an operator demonstrates can provide conservative Charpy v-notch toughness values of crack-related conditions of the pipeline segment. Operators using an assumed Charpy v-notch toughness value must notify PHMSA in advance in accordance with § 192.18 and include in the notification the bases for demonstrating that the Charpy v-notch toughness values proposed are appropriate and conservative for use in analysis of crack-related conditions.

        (ii)  An operator must assume one of the following for material strength:

        (A) Grade A pipe (30,000 psi), or

        (B) The specified minimum yield strength that is the basis for the current maximum allowable operating pressure.

        (iii)  Until pipe wall thickness, diameter, or other data are determined and documented in accordance with § 192.607, the operator must use values upon which the current MAOP is based.

        (f)  Analyses conducted in accordance with this section must be reviewed and confirmed by a subject matter expert.

        (g)  An operator must keep for the life of the pipeline records of the investigations, analyses, and other actions taken in accordance with the requirements of this section. Records must document justifications, deviations, and determinations made for the following, as applicable:

        (1) The technical approach used for the analysis;

        (2) All data used and analyzed;

        (3) Pipe and weld properties;

        (4) Procedures used;

        (5) Evaluation methodology used;

        (6) Models used;

        (7) Direct in situ examination data;

        (8) In-line inspection tool run information evaluated, including any multiple in-line inspection tool runs;

        (9) Pressure test data and results;

        (10) In-the-ditch assessments;

        (11) All measurement tool, assessment, and evaluation accuracy specifications and tolerances used in technical and operational results;

        (12) All finite element analysis results;

        (13) The number of pressure cycles to failure, the equivalent number of annual pressure cycles, and the pressure cycle counting method;

        (14) The predicted fatigue life and predicted failure pressure from the required fatigue life models and fracture mechanics evaluation methods;

        (15) Safety factors used for fatigue life and/or predicted failure pressure calculations;

        (16) Reassessment time interval and safety factors;

        (17) The date of the review;

        (18) Confirmation of the results by qualified technical subject matter experts; and

        (19) Approval by responsible operator management personnel.

        (h)  If an operator uses an engineering critical assessment method in accordance with paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section to determine the maximum reevaluation intervals, the operator must reassess the anomalies as follows:

        (1) If the anomaly is in an HCA, the operator must reassess the anomaly within a maximum of 7 years in accordance with § 192.939(a), unless the safety factor is expected to go below what is specified in paragraph (c) or (d) of this section.

        (2) If the anomaly is outside of an HCA, the operator must perform a reassessment of the anomaly within a maximum of 10 years in accordance with § 192.710(b), unless the anomaly safety factor is expected to go below what is specified in paragraph (c) or (d) of this section.

        § 192.714   Transmission lines: Repair criteria for onshore transmission pipelines.

#### § § 192.714

        (a)  This section applies to onshore transmission pipelines not subject to the repair criteria in subpart O of this part, and which do not operate under an alternative MAOP in accordance with §§ 192.112, 192.328, and 192.620. Pipeline segments that are located in high consequence areas, as defined in § 192.903, must comply with the applicable actions specified by the integrity management requirements in subpart O. Pipeline segments operating under an alternative MAOP in accordance with §§ 192.112, 192.328, and 192.620 must comply with § 192.620(d)(11).

        (b)  Each operator must, in repairing its pipeline systems, ensure that the repairs are made in a safe manner and are made to prevent damage to persons, property, and the environment. A pipeline segment's operating pressure must be less than the predicted failure pressure determined in accordance with § 192.712 during repair operations. Repairs performed in accordance with this section must use pipe and material properties that are documented in traceable, verifiable, and complete records. If documented data required for any analysis, including predicted failure pressure for determining MAOP, is not available, an operator must obtain the undocumented data through § 192.607. Until documented material properties are available, the operator must use the conservative assumptions in either § 192.712(e)(2) or, if appropriate following a pressure test, in § 192.712(d)(3).

        (c)  An operator must remediate conditions according to a schedule that prioritizes the conditions for evaluation and remediation. Unless paragraph (d) of this section provides a special requirement for remediating certain conditions, an operator must calculate the predicted failure pressure of anomalies or defects and follow the schedule in ASME B31.8S (incorporated by reference,  § 192.7), . If an operator cannot meet the schedule for any condition, the operator must document the reasons why it cannot meet the schedule and how the changed schedule will not jeopardize public safety. Each condition that meets any of the repair criteria in paragraph (d) of this section in an onshore steel transmission pipeline must be—

        (1) Removed by cutting out and replacing a cylindrical piece of pipe that will permanently restore the pipeline's MAOP based on the use of § 192.105 and the design factors for the class location in which it is located; or

        (2) Repaired by a method, shown by technically proven engineering tests and analyses, that will permanently restore the pipeline's MAOP based upon the determined predicted failure pressure times the design factor for the class location in which it is located.

        (d)  For onshore transmission pipelines not located in high consequence areas, an operator must remediate a listed condition according to the following criteria:

#### § § 192.743

        (a) Pressure relief devices at pressure limiting stations and pressure regulating stations must have sufficient capacity to protect the facilities to which they are connected. Except as provided in § 192.739(b), the capacity must be consistent with the pressure limits of § 192.201(a). This capacity must be determined at intervals not exceeding 15 months, but at least once each calendar year, by testing the devices in place or by review and calculations.

        (b) If review and calculations are used to determine if a device has sufficient capacity, the calculated capacity must be compared with the rated or experimentally determined relieving capacity of the device for the conditions under which it operates. After the initial calculations, subsequent calculations need not be made if the annual review documents that parameters have not changed to cause the rated or experimentally determined relieving capacity to be insufficient.

        (c) If a relief device is of insufficient capacity, a new or additional device must be installed to provide the capacity required by paragraph (a) of this section.

        § 192.745   Valve maintenance: Transmission lines.

#### § § 192.745

        (a) Each transmission line valve that might be required during any emergency must be inspected and partially operated at intervals not exceeding 15 months, but at least once each calendar year.

        (b) Each operator must take prompt remedial action to correct any valve found inoperable, unless the operator designates an alternative valve.

        (c) For each remote-control valve (RCV) installed in accordance with § 192.179 or § 192.634, an operator must conduct a point-to-point verification between SCADA system displays and the installed valves, sensors, and communications equipment, in accordance with § 192.631(c) and (e).

        (d) For each alternative equivalent technology installed on an onshore pipeline under § 192.179(e) or (f) or § 192.634 that is manually or locally operated ( not a rupture-mitigation valve (RMV), as that term is defined in § 192.3):

        (1) Operators must achieve a valve closure time of 30 minutes or less, pursuant to § 192.636(b), through an initial drill and through periodic validation as required in paragraph (d)(2) of this section. An operator must review and document the results of each phase of the drill response to validate the total response time, including confirming the rupture, and valve shut-off time as being less than or equal to 30 minutes after rupture identification.

        (2) Within each pipeline system and within each operating or maintenance field work unit, operators must randomly select a valve serving as an alternative equivalent technology in lieu of an RMV for an annual 30-minute-total response time validation drill that simulates worst-case conditions for that location to ensure compliance with § 192.636. Operators are not required to close the valve fully during the drill; a minimum 25 percent valve closure is sufficient to demonstrate compliance with drill requirements unless the operator has operational information that requires an additional closure percentage for maintaining reliability. The response drill must occur at least once each calendar year, with intervals not to exceed 15 months. Operators must include in their written procedures the method they use to randomly select which alternative equivalent technology is tested in accordance with this paragraph.

        (3) If the 30-minute-maximum response time cannot be achieved during the drill, the operator must revise response efforts to achieve compliance with § 192.636 as soon as practicable but no later than 12 months after the drill. Alternative valve shut-off measures must be in place in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section within 7 days of a failed drill.

        (4) Based on the results of response-time drills, the operator must include lessons learned in:

        (i) Training and qualifications programs;

        (ii) Design, construction, testing, maintenance, operating, and emergency procedures manuals; and

        (iii) Any other areas identified by the operator as needing improvement.

        (5) The requirements of this paragraph (d) do not apply to manual valves who, pursuant to § 192.636(g), have been exempted from the requirements of § 192.636(b).

        (e) Each operator must develop and implement remedial measures to correct any valve installed on an onshore pipeline under § 192.179(e) or (f) or § 192.634 that is indicated to be inoperable or unable to maintain effective shut-off as follows:

        (1) Repair or replace the valve as soon as practicable but no later than 12 months after finding that the valve is inoperable or unable to maintain effective shut-off. An operator must request an extension from PHMSA in accordance with § 192.18 if repair or replacement of a valve within 12 months would be economically, technically, or operationally infeasible; and

        (2) Designate an alternative valve acting as an RMV within 7 calendar days of the finding while repairs are being made and document an interim response plan to maintain safety. Such valves are not required to comply with the valve spacing requirements of this part.

        (f) An operator using an ASV as an RMV, in accordance with §§ 192.3, 192.179, 192.634, and 192.636, must document and confirm the ASV shut-in pressures, in accordance with § 192.636(f), on a calendar year basis not to exceed 15 months. ASV shut-in set pressures must be proven and reset individually at each ASV, as required, on a calendar year basis not to exceed 15 months.

      Subpart O—Gas Transmission Pipeline Integrity Management

**Source:** Source: 68 FR 69817, Dec. 15, 2003, unless otherwise noted.

        § 192.901   What do the regulations in this subpart cover?

#### § § 192.901

        This subpart prescribes minimum requirements for an integrity management program on any gas transmission pipeline covered under this part. For gas transmission pipelines constructed of plastic, only the requirements in §§ 192.917, 192.921, 192.935 and 192.937 apply.

        § 192.903   What definitions apply to this subpart?

#### § § 192.903

        The following definitions apply to this subpart:

        is the use of testing techniques as allowed in this subpart to ascertain the condition of a covered pipeline segment.

        is an integrity assessment method using more focused application of the principles and techniques of direct assessment to identify internal and external corrosion in a covered transmission pipeline segment.

        means a segment of gas transmission pipeline located in a high consequence area. The terms gas and transmission line are defined in § 192.3.

        is an integrity assessment method that utilizes a process to evaluate certain threats ( external corrosion, internal corrosion and stress corrosion cracking) to a covered pipeline segment's integrity. The process includes the gathering and integration of risk factor data, indirect examination or analysis to identify areas of suspected corrosion, direct examination of the pipeline in these areas, and post assessment evaluation.

        means an area established by one of the methods described in paragraphs (1) or (2) as follows:

        (1) An area defined as—

        (i) A Class 3 location under § 192.5; or

        (ii) A Class 4 location under § 192.5; or

        (iii) Any area in a Class 1 or Class 2 location where the potential impact radius is greater than 660 feet (200 meters), and the area within a potential impact circle contains 20 or more buildings intended for human occupancy; or

        (iv) Any area in a Class 1 or Class 2 location where the potential impact circle contains an identified site.

        (2) The area within a potential impact circle containing—

        (i) 20 or more buildings intended for human occupancy, unless the exception in paragraph (4) applies; or

        (ii) An identified site.

        (3) Where a potential impact circle is calculated under either method (1) or (2) to establish a high consequence area, the length of the high consequence area extends axially along the length of the pipeline from the outermost edge of the first potential impact circle that contains either an identified site or 20 or more buildings intended for human occupancy to the outermost edge of the last contiguous potential impact circle that contains either an identified site or 20 or more buildings intended for human occupancy. (See figure E.I.A. in appendix E.)

        (4) If in identifying a high consequence area under paragraph (1)(iii) of this definition or paragraph (2)(i) of this definition, the radius of the potential impact circle is greater than 660 feet (200 meters), the operator may identify a high consequence area based on a prorated number of buildings intended for human occupancy with a distance of 660 feet (200 meters) from the centerline of the pipeline until December 17, 2006. If an operator chooses this approach, the operator must prorate the number of buildings intended for human occupancy based on the ratio of an area with a radius of 660 feet (200 meters) to the area of the potential impact circle (, the prorated number of buildings intended for human occupancy is equal to 20 × (660 feet) [or 200 meters]/potential impact radius in feet [or meters]  ).

        means each of the following areas:

        (a) An outside area or open structure that is occupied by twenty (20) or more persons on at least 50 days in any twelve (12)-month period. (The days need not be consecutive.) Examples include but are not limited to, beaches, playgrounds, recreational facilities, camping grounds, outdoor theaters, stadiums, recreational areas near a body of water, or areas outside a rural building such as a religious facility; or

        (b) A building that is occupied by twenty (20) or more persons on at least five (5) days a week for ten (10) weeks in any twelve (12)-month period. (The days and weeks need not be consecutive.) Examples include, but are not limited to, religious facilities, office buildings, community centers, general stores, 4-H facilities, or roller skating rinks; or

        (c) A facility occupied by persons who are confined, are of impaired mobility, or would be difficult to evacuate. Examples include but are not limited to hospitals, prisons, schools, day-care facilities, retirement facilities or assisted-living facilities.

        is a circle of radius equal to the potential impact radius (PIR).

        (PIR) means the radius of a circle within which the potential failure of a pipeline could have significant impact on people or property. PIR is determined by the formula r = 0.69* (square root of (p*d  )), where ‘r’ is the radius of a circular area in feet surrounding the point of failure, ‘p’ is the maximum allowable operating pressure (MAOP) in the pipeline segment in pounds per square inch and ‘d’ is the nominal diameter of the pipeline in inches.

        is a repair or mitigation activity an operator takes on a covered segment to limit or reduce the probability of an undesired event occurring or the expected consequences from the event.

        § 192.905   How does an operator identify a high consequence area?

#### § § 192.905

        (a)  To determine which segments of an operator's transmission pipeline system are covered by this subpart, an operator must identify the high consequence areas. An operator must use method (1) or (2) from the definition in § 192.903 to identify a high consequence area. An operator may apply one method to its entire pipeline system, or an operator may apply one method to individual portions of the pipeline system. An operator must describe in its integrity management program which method it is applying to each portion of the operator's pipeline system. The description must include the potential impact radius when utilized to establish a high consequence area. ( appendix E.I. for guidance on identifying high consequence areas.)

        (b)(1)  An operator must identify an identified site, for purposes of this subpart, from information the operator has obtained from routine operation and maintenance activities and from public officials with safety or emergency response or planning responsibilities who indicate to the operator that they know of locations that meet the identified site criteria. These public officials could include officials on a local emergency planning commission or relevant Native American tribal officials.

        (2) If a public official with safety or emergency response or planning responsibilities informs an operator that it does not have the information to identify an identified site, the operator must use one of the following sources, as appropriate, to identify these sites.

        (i) Visible marking (e.g., a sign); or

        (ii) The site is licensed or registered by a Federal, State, or local government agency; or

        (iii) The site is on a list (including a list on an internet web site) or map maintained by or available from a Federal, State, or local government agency and available to the general public.

        (c)  When an operator has information that the area around a pipeline segment not previously identified as a high consequence area could satisfy any of the definitions in § 192.903, the operator must complete the evaluation using method (1) or (2). If the segment is determined to meet the definition as a high consequence area, it must be incorporated into the operator's baseline assessment plan as a high consequence area within one year from the date the area is identified.

        § 192.907   What must an operator do to implement this subpart?

#### § § 192.907

        (a)  No later than December 17, 2004, an operator of a covered pipeline segment must develop and follow a written integrity management program that contains all the elements described in § 192.911 and that addresses the risks on each covered transmission pipeline segment. The initial integrity management program must consist, at a minimum, of a framework that describes the process for implementing each program element, how relevant decisions will be made and by whom, a time line for completing the work to implement the program element, and how information gained from experience will be continuously incorporated into the program. The framework will evolve into a more detailed and comprehensive program. An operator must make continual improvements to the program.

        (b)  In carrying out this subpart, an operator must follow the requirements of this subpart and of ASME B31.8S (incorporated by reference,  § 192.7) and its appendices, where specified. An operator may follow an equivalent standard or practice only when the operator demonstrates the alternative standard or practice provides an equivalent level of safety to the public and property. In the event of a conflict between this subpart and ASME B31.8S, the requirements in this subpart control.

        § 192.909   How can an operator change its integrity management program?

#### § § 192.909

        (a)  An operator must document any change to its program and the reasons for the change before implementing the change.

        (b)  An operator must notify OPS, in accordance with § 192.18, of any change to the program that may substantially affect the program's implementation or may significantly modify the program or schedule for carrying out the program elements. An operator must provide notification within 30 days after adopting this type of change into its program.

        § 192.913   When may an operator deviate its program from certain requirements of this subpart?

#### § § 192.913

        (a)  ASME/ANSI B31.8S (incorporated by reference,  § 192.7) provides the essential features of a performance-based or a prescriptive integrity management program.

        (vii) Semi-annual performance measures beyond those required in § 192.945 that are part of the operator's performance plan. ( § 192.911(i).) An operator must submit these measures, by electronic or other means, on a semi-annual frequency to OPS in accordance with § 192.951; and

        (viii) An analysis that supports the desired integrity reassessment interval and the remediation methods to be used for all covered segments.

        (2) In addition to the requirements for the performance-based plan, an operator must—

        (i) Have completed at least two integrity assessments on each covered pipeline segment the operator is including under the performance-based approach, and be able to demonstrate that each assessment effectively addressed the identified threats on the covered segment.

        (ii) Remediate all anomalies identified in the more recent assessment according to the requirements in § 192.933, and incorporate the results and lessons learned from the more recent assessment into the operator's data integration and risk assessment.

        (c)  Once an operator has demonstrated that it has satisfied the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section, the operator may deviate from the prescriptive requirements of ASME/ANSI B31.8S and of this subpart only in the following instances.

        (1) The time frame for reassessment as provided in § 192.939 except that reassessment by some method allowed under this subpart (e.g., confirmatory direct assessment) must be carried out at intervals no longer than seven years;

        (2) The time frame for remediation as provided in § 192.933 if the operator demonstrates the time frame will not jeopardize the safety of the covered segment.

        § 192.915   What knowledge and training must personnel have to carry out an integrity management program?

#### § § 192.915

        (a)  The integrity management program must provide that each supervisor whose responsibilities relate to the integrity management program possesses and maintains a thorough knowledge of the integrity management program and of the elements for which the supervisor is responsible. The program must provide that any person who qualifies as a supervisor for the integrity management program has appropriate training or experience in the area for which the person is responsible.

        (b)  The integrity management program must provide criteria for the qualification of any person—

        (1) Who conducts an integrity assessment allowed under this subpart; or

        (2) Who reviews and analyzes the results from an integrity assessment and evaluation; or

        (3) Who makes decisions on actions to be taken based on these assessments.

        (c)  The integrity management program must provide criteria for the qualification of any person—

        (1) Who implements preventive and mitigative measures to carry out this subpart, including the marking and locating of buried structures; or

        (2) Who directly supervises excavation work carried out in conjunction with an integrity assessment.

        § 192.917   How does an operator identify potential threats to pipeline integrity and use the threat identification in its integrity program?

#### § § 192.917

        (a)  An operator must identify and evaluate all potential threats to each covered pipeline segment. Potential threats that an operator must consider include, but are not limited to, the threats listed in ASME B31.8S (incorporated by reference,  § 192.7), section 2, which are grouped under the following four threat categories:

        (1) Time dependent threats such as internal corrosion, external corrosion, and stress corrosion cracking;

        (2) Stable threats, such as manufacturing, welding, fabrication, or construction defects;

        (3) Time independent threats, such as third party damage, mechanical damage, incorrect operational procedure, weather related and outside force damage, to include consideration of seismicity, geology, and soil stability of the area; and

        (4) Human error, such as operational or maintenance mishaps, or design and construction mistakes.

        (b)  To identify and evaluate the potential threats to a covered pipeline segment, an operator must gather and integrate existing data and information on the entire pipeline that could be relevant to the covered segment. In performing data gathering and integration, an operator must follow the requirements in ASME B31.8S, section 4. Operators must begin to integrate all pertinent data elements specified in this section starting on May 24, 2023, with all available attributes integrated by February 26, 2024. An operator may request an extension of up to 1 year by submitting a notification to PHMSA at least 90 days before February 26, 2024, in accordance with § 192.18. The notification must include a reasonable and technically justified basis, an up-to-date plan for completing all actions required by this paragraph (b), the reason for the requested extension, current safety or mitigation status of the pipeline segment, the proposed completion date, and any needed temporary safety measures to mitigate the impact on safety. An operator must gather and evaluate the set of data listed in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. The evaluation must analyze both the covered segment and similar non-covered segments, and it must:

        (1) Integrate pertinent information about pipeline attributes to ensure safe operation and pipeline integrity, including information derived from operations and maintenance activities required under this part, and other relevant information, including, but not limited to:

        (xiv) Cathodic protection installed, including, but not limited to, type and location;

        (xv) Coating type;

        (xvi) Gas quality;

        (xvii) Flow rate;

        (xviii) Normal maximum and minimum operating pressures, including maximum allowable operating pressure (MAOP);

        (xix) Class location;

        (xx) Leak and failure history, including any in-service ruptures or leaks from incident reports, abnormal operations, safety-related conditions (both reported and unreported) and failure investigations required by § 192.617, and their identified causes and consequences;

        (xxi) Coating condition;

        (xxii) Cathodic protection (CP) system performance;

        (D) CP test point survey readings and locations;

        (E) Alternating current, direct current, and foreign structure interference surveys;

        (F) Pipe coating surveys, including surveys to detect coating damage, disbonded coatings, or other conditions that compromise the effectiveness of corrosion protection, including, but not limited to, direct current voltage gradient or alternating current voltage gradient inspections;

        (G) Results of examinations of exposed portions of buried pipelines (e.g., pipe and pipe coating condition,  § 192.459), including the results of any non-destructive examinations of the pipe, seam, or girth weld ( bell hole inspections);

        (H) Stress corrosion cracking excavations and findings;

        (I) Selective seam weld corrosion excavations and findings;

        (J) Any indication of seam cracking; and

        (xxvi) Operating pressure history and pressure fluctuations, including an analysis of effects of pressure cycling and instances of exceeding MAOP by any amount;

        (xxvii) Performance of regulators, relief valves, pressure control devices, or any other device to control or limit operating pressure to less than MAOP;

        (xxviii) Encroachments;

        (xxxii) Audits and reviews;

        (xxxiii) Industry experience for incident, leak, and failure history;

        (xxxiv) Aerial photography; and

        (xxxv) Exposure to natural forces in the area of the pipeline, including seismicity, geology, and soil stability of the area.

        (2) Use validated information and data as inputs, to the maximum extent practicable. If input is obtained from subject matter experts (SME), an operator must employ adequate control measures to ensure consistency and accuracy of information. Control measures may include training of SMEs or the use of outside technical experts (independent expert reviews) to assess the quality of processes and the judgment of SMEs. An operator must document the names and qualifications of the individuals who approve SME inputs used in the current risk assessment.

        (3) Identify and analyze spatial relationships among anomalous information (e.g., corrosion coincident with foreign line crossings or evidence of pipeline damage where overhead imaging shows evidence of encroachment).

        (4) Analyze the data for interrelationships among pipeline integrity threats, including combinations of applicable risk factors that increase the likelihood of incidents or increase the potential consequences of incidents.

        (c)  An operator must conduct a risk assessment that follows ASME B31.8S, section 5, and that analyzes the identified threats and potential consequences of an incident for each covered segment. An operator must ensure the validity of the methods used to conduct the risk assessment considering the incident, leak, and failure history of the pipeline segments and other historical information. Such a validation must ensure the risk assessment methods produce a risk characterization that is consistent with the operator's and industry experience, including evaluations of the cause of past incidents, as determined by root cause analysis or other equivalent means, and include sensitivity analysis of the factors used to characterize both the likelihood of loss of pipeline integrity and consequences of the postulated loss of pipeline integrity. An operator must use the risk assessment to determine additional preventive and mitigative measures needed for each covered segment in accordance with § 192.935 and periodically evaluate the integrity of each covered pipeline segment in accordance with § 192.937. Beginning February 26, 2024, the risk assessment must:

        (1) Analyze how a potential failure could affect high consequence areas;

        (2) Analyze the likelihood of failure due to each individual threat and each unique combination of threats that interact or simultaneously contribute to risk at a common location;

        (3) Account for, and compensate for, uncertainties in the model and the data used in the risk assessment; and

        (4) Evaluate the potential risk reduction associated with candidate risk reduction activities, such as preventive and mitigative measures, and reduced anomaly remediation and assessment intervals.

        (5) In conjunction with § 192.917(b), an operator may request an extension of up to 1 year for the requirements of this paragraph by submitting a notification to PHMSA at least 90 days before February 26, 2024, in accordance with § 192.18. The notification must include a reasonable and technically justified basis, an up-to-date plan for completing all actions required by this paragraph (c)(5), the reason for the requested extension, current safety or mitigation status of the pipeline segment, the proposed completion date, and any needed temporary safety measures to mitigate the impact on safety.

        (d)  An operator of a plastic transmission pipeline must assess the threats to each covered segment using the information in sections 4 and 5 of ASME B31.8S and consider any threats unique to the integrity of plastic pipe, such as poor joint fusion practices, pipe with poor slow crack growth (SCG) resistance, brittle pipe, circumferential cracking, hydrocarbon softening of the pipe, internal and external loads, longitudinal or lateral loads, proximity to elevated heat sources, and point loading.

        (e)  If an operator identifies any of the following threats, the operator must take the following actions to address the threat.

        (1)  An operator must utilize the data integration required in paragraph (b) of this section and ASME/ANSI B31.8S, Appendix A-8 to determine the susceptibility of each covered segment to the threat of third party damage. If an operator identifies the threat of third party damage, the operator must implement comprehensive additional preventive measures in accordance with § 192.935 and monitor the effectiveness of the preventive measures. If, in conducting a baseline assessment under § 192.921, or a reassessment under § 192.937, an operator uses an internal inspection tool or external corrosion direct assessment, the operator must integrate data from these assessments with data related to any encroachment or foreign line crossing on the covered segment, to define where potential indications of third party damage may exist in the covered segment.  An operator must also have procedures in its integrity management program addressing actions it will take to respond to findings from this data integration.

        (2)  An operator must analyze and account for whether cyclic fatigue or other loading conditions (including ground movement, and suspension bridge condition) could lead to a failure of a deformation, including a dent or gouge, crack, or other defect in the covered segment. The analysis must assume the presence of threats in the covered segment that could be exacerbated by cyclic fatigue. An operator must use the results from the analysis together with the criteria used to determine the significance of the threat(s) to the covered segment to prioritize the integrity baseline assessment or reassessment. Failure stress pressure and crack growth analysis of cracks and crack-like defects must be conducted in accordance with § 192.712. An operator must monitor operating pressure cycles and periodically, but at least every 7 calendar years, with intervals not to exceed 90 months, determine if the cyclic fatigue analysis remains valid or if the cyclic fatigue analysis must be revised based on changes to operating pressure cycles or other loading conditions.

        (3)  An operator must analyze the covered segment to determine and account for the risk of failure from manufacturing and construction defects (including seam defects) in the covered segment. The analysis must account for the results of prior assessments on the covered segment. An operator may consider manufacturing and construction related defects to be stable defects only if the covered segment has been subjected to hydrostatic pressure testing satisfying the criteria of subpart J of at least 1.25 times MAOP, and the covered segment has not experienced a reportable incident attributed to a manufacturing or construction defect since the date of the most recent subpart J pressure test. If any of the following changes occur in the covered segment, an operator must prioritize the covered segment as a high-risk segment for the baseline assessment or a subsequent reassessment.

        (i) The pipeline segment has experienced a reportable incident, as defined in § 191.3, since its most recent successful subpart J pressure test, due to an original manufacturing-related defect, or a construction-, installation-, or fabrication-related defect;

        (ii) MAOP increases; or

        (iii) The stresses leading to cyclic fatigue increase.

        (4)  If a covered pipeline segment contains low frequency ERW pipe, lap welded pipe, pipe with longitudinal joint factor less than 1.0 as defined in § 192.113, or other pipe that satisfies the conditions specified in ASME B31.8S, Appendices A-5.3 and A-5.4, and any covered or non-covered segment in the pipeline system with such pipe has experienced seam failure (including seam cracking and selective seam weld corrosion), or operating pressure on the covered segment has increased over the maximum operating pressure experienced during the preceding 5 years (including abnormal operation as defined in § 192.605(c)), or MAOP has been increased, an operator must select an assessment technology or technologies with a proven application capable of assessing seam integrity and seam corrosion anomalies. The operator must prioritize the covered segment as a high-risk segment for the baseline assessment or a subsequent reassessment. Pipe with seam cracks must be evaluated using fracture mechanics modeling for failure stress pressures and cyclic fatigue crack growth analysis to estimate the remaining life of the pipe in accordance with § 192.712.

        (5)  If an operator identifies corrosion on a covered pipeline segment that could adversely affect the integrity of the line (conditions specified in § 192.933), the operator must evaluate and remediate, as necessary, all pipeline segments (both covered and non-covered) with similar material coating and environmental characteristics. An operator must establish a schedule for evaluating and remediating, as necessary, the similar segments that is consistent with the operator's established operating and maintenance procedures under part 192 for testing and repair.

        (6)  If an operator identifies any crack or crack-like defect (e.g., stress corrosion cracking or other environmentally assisted cracking, seam defects, selective seam weld corrosion, girth weld cracks, hook cracks, and fatigue cracks) on a covered pipeline segment that could adversely affect the integrity of the pipeline, the operator must evaluate, and remediate, as necessary, all pipeline segments (both covered and non-covered) with similar characteristics associated with the crack or crack-like defect. Similar characteristics may include operating and maintenance histories, material properties, and environmental characteristics. An operator must establish a schedule for evaluating, and remediating, as necessary, the similar pipeline segments that is consistent with the operator's established operating and maintenance procedures under this part for testing and repair.

        § 192.919   What must be in the baseline assessment plan?

#### § § 192.919

        An operator must include each of the following elements in its written baseline assessment plan:

        (a) Identification of the potential threats to each covered pipeline segment and the information supporting the threat identification. ( § 192.917.);

        (b) The methods selected to assess the integrity of the line pipe, including an explanation of why the assessment method was selected to address the identified threats to each covered segment. The integrity assessment method an operator uses must be based on the threats identified to the covered segment. ( § 192.917.) More than one method may be required to address all the threats to the covered pipeline segment;

        (c) A schedule for completing the integrity assessment of all covered segments, including risk factors considered in establishing the assessment schedule;

        (d) If applicable, a direct assessment plan that meets the requirements of §§ 192.923, and depending on the threat to be addressed, of § 192.925, § 192.927, or § 192.929; and

        (e) A procedure to ensure that the baseline assessment is being conducted in a manner that minimizes environmental and safety risks.

        § 192.921   How is the baseline assessment to be conducted?

#### § § 192.921

        (a)  An operator must assess the integrity of the line pipe in each covered segment by applying one or more of the following methods for each threat to which the covered segment is susceptible. An operator must select the method or methods best suited to address the threats identified to the covered segment ( § 192.917).

        (1) Internal inspection tool or tools capable of detecting those threats to which the pipeline is susceptible. The use of internal inspection tools is appropriate for threats such as corrosion, deformation and mechanical damage (including dents, gouges and grooves), material cracking and crack-like defects ( stress corrosion cracking, selective seam weld corrosion, environmentally assisted cracking, and girth weld cracks), hard spots with cracking, and any other threats to which the covered segment is susceptible. When performing an assessment using an in-line inspection tool, an operator must comply with § 192.493. In addition, an operator must analyze and account for uncertainties in reported results ( tool tolerance, detection threshold, probability of detection, probability of identification, sizing accuracy, conservative anomaly interaction criteria, location accuracy, anomaly findings, and unity chart plots or equivalent for determining uncertainties and verifying actual tool performance) in identifying and characterizing anomalies;

        (2) Pressure test conducted in accordance with subpart J of this part. The use of subpart J pressure testing is appropriate for threats such as internal corrosion; external corrosion and other environmentally assisted corrosion mechanisms; manufacturing and related defects threats, including defective pipe and pipe seams; stress corrosion cracking; selective seam weld corrosion; dents; and other forms of mechanical damage. An operator must use the test pressures specified in specified in Table 5.6.1-1 of Section 5 of ASME B31.8S (incorporated by reference,  § 192.7) to justify an extended reassessment interval in accordance with § 192.939.

        (3) Spike hydrostatic pressure test conducted in accordance with § 192.506. The use of spike hydrostatic pressure testing is appropriate for time-dependent threats such as stress corrosion cracking; selective seam weld corrosion; manufacturing and related defects, including defective pipe and pipe seams; and other forms of defect or damage involving cracks or crack-like defects;

        (4) Excavation and  direct examination by means of visual examination, direct measurement, and recorded non-destructive examination results and data needed to assess all threats. Based upon the threat assessed, examples of appropriate non-destructive examination methods include ultrasonic testing (UT), phased array ultrasonic testing (PAUT), inverse wave field extrapolation (IWEX), radiography, and magnetic particle inspection (MPI);

        (5) Guided wave ultrasonic testing (GWUT) as described in Appendix F. The use of GWUT is appropriate for internal and external pipe wall loss;

        (6) Direct assessment to address threats of external corrosion, internal corrosion, and stress corrosion cracking. The use of direct assessment to address threats of external corrosion, internal corrosion, and stress corrosion cracking is allowed only if appropriate for the threat and the pipeline segment being assessed. Use of direct assessment for threats other than the threat for which the direct assessment method is suitable is not allowed. An operator must conduct the direct assessment in accordance with the requirements listed in § 192.923 and with the applicable requirements specified in §§ 192.925, 192.927 and 192.929; or

        (7) Other technology that an operator demonstrates can provide an equivalent understanding of the condition of the line pipe for each of the threats to which the pipeline is susceptible. An operator must notify PHMSA in advance of using the other technology in accordance with § 192.18.

        (b)  An operator must prioritize the covered pipeline segments for the baseline assessment according to a risk analysis that considers the potential threats to each covered segment. The risk analysis must comply with the requirements in § 192.917.

        (c)  In choosing an assessment method for the baseline assessment of each covered segment, an operator must take the actions required in § 192.917(e) to address particular threats that it has identified.

        (d)  An operator must prioritize all the covered segments for assessment in accordance with § 192.917 (c) and paragraph (b) of this section. An operator must assess at least 50% of the covered segments beginning with the highest risk segments, by December 17, 2007. An operator must complete the baseline assessment of all covered segments by December 17, 2012.

        (e)  An operator may use a prior integrity assessment conducted before December 17, 2002 as a baseline assessment for the covered segment, if the integrity assessment meets the baseline requirements in this subpart and subsequent remedial actions to address the conditions listed in § 192.933 have been carried out. In addition, if an operator uses this prior assessment as its baseline assessment, the operator must reassess the line pipe in the covered segment according to the requirements of § 192.937 and § 192.939.

        (f)  When an operator identifies a new high consequence area ( § 192.905), an operator must complete the baseline assessment of the line pipe in the newly identified high consequence area within ten (10) years from the date the area is identified.

        (g)  An operator must complete the baseline assessment of a newly-installed segment of pipe covered by this subpart within ten (10) years from the date the pipe is installed. An operator may conduct a pressure test in accordance with paragraph (a)(2) of this section, to satisfy the requirement for a baseline assessment.

        (h)  If the threat analysis required in § 192.917(d) on a plastic transmission pipeline indicates that a covered segment is susceptible to failure from causes other than third-party damage, an operator must conduct a baseline assessment of the segment in accordance with the requirements of this section and of § 192.917. The operator must justify the use of an alternative assessment method that will address the identified threats to the covered segment.

        (i)  An integrity assessment conducted in accordance with the requirements of § 192.624(c) may be used as a baseline assessment under this section.

        § 192.923   How is direct assessment used and for what threats?

#### § § 192.923

        (a)  An operator may use direct assessment either as a primary assessment method or as a supplement to the other assessment methods allowed under this subpart. An operator may only use direct assessment as the primary assessment method to address the identified threats of external corrosion (EC), internal corrosion (IC), and stress corrosion cracking (SCC).

        (b)  An operator using direct assessment as a primary assessment method must have a plan that complies with the requirements in—

        (1) Section 192.925 and ASME B31.8S (incorporated by reference, _see_ § 192.7) Section 6.4, and NACE SP0502 (incorporated by reference,  § 192.7) , if addressing external corrosion (EC).

        (2) Section 192.927 and NACE SP0206 (incorporated by reference,  § 192.7), if addressing internal corrosion (IC).

        (3) Section 192.929 and NACE SP0204 (incorporated by reference,  § 192.7), if addressing stress corrosion cracking (SCC).

        (c)  An operator using direct assessment as a supplemental assessment method for any applicable threat must have a plan that follows the requirements for confirmatory direct assessment in § 192.931.

        § 192.925   What are the requirements for using External Corrosion Direct Assessment (ECDA)?

#### § § 192.925

        (a)  ECDA is a four-step process that combines preassessment, indirect inspection, direct examination, and post assessment to evaluate the threat of external corrosion to the integrity of a pipeline.

        (b)  An operator that uses direct assessment to assess the threat of external corrosion must follow the requirements in this section, in ASME B31.8S (incorporated by reference,  § 192.7), section 6.4, and in NACE SP0502 (incorporated by reference,  § 192.7). An operator must develop and implement a direct assessment plan that has procedures addressing pre-assessment, indirect inspection, direct examination, and post assessment. If the ECDA detects pipeline coating damage, the operator must also integrate the data from the ECDA with other information from the data integration (§ 192.917(b)) to evaluate the covered segment for the threat of third party damage and to address the threat as required by § 192.917(e)(1).

        (1)  In addition to the requirements in ASME B31.8S section 6.4 and NACE SP0502, section 3, the plan's procedures for preassessment must include—

        (i) Provisions for applying more restrictive criteria when conducting ECDA for the first time on a covered segment; and

        (ii) The basis on which an operator selects at least two different, but complementary indirect assessment tools to assess each ECDA Region. If an operator utilizes an indirect inspection method that is not discussed in Appendix A of NACE SP0502, the operator must demonstrate the applicability, validation basis, equipment used, application procedure, and utilization of data for the inspection method.

        (2)  In addition to the requirements in ASME B31.8S, section 6.4 and in NACE SP0502, section 4, the plan's procedures for indirect inspection of the ECDA regions must include—

        (i) Provisions for applying more restrictive criteria when conducting ECDA for the first time on a covered segment;

        (ii) Criteria for identifying and documenting those indications that must be considered for excavation and direct examination. Minimum identification criteria include the known sensitivities of assessment tools, the procedures for using each tool, and the approach to be used for decreasing the physical spacing of indirect assessment tool readings when the presence of a defect is suspected;

        (iii) Criteria for defining the urgency of excavation and direct examination of each indication identified during the indirect examination. These criteria must specify how an operator will define the urgency of excavating the indication as immediate, scheduled or monitored; and

        (iv) Criteria for scheduling excavation of indications for each urgency level.

        (3)  In addition to the requirements in ASME B31.8S section 6.4 and NACE SP0502, section 5, the plan's procedures for direct examination of indications from the indirect examination must include—

        (i) Provisions for applying more restrictive criteria when conducting ECDA for the first time on a covered segment;

        (ii) Criteria for deciding what action should be taken if either:

        (A) Corrosion defects are discovered that exceed allowable limits (Section 5.5.2.2 of NACE SP0502), or

        (B) Root cause analysis reveals conditions for which ECDA is not suitable (Section 5.6.2 of NACE SP0502);

        (iii) Criteria and notification procedures for any changes in the ECDA Plan, including changes that affect the severity classification, the priority of direct examination, and the time frame for direct examination of indications; and

        (iv) Criteria that describe how and on what basis an operator will reclassify and reprioritize any of the provisions that are specified in section 5.9 of NACE SP0502.

        (4)  In addition to the requirements in ASME B31.8S section 6.4 and NACE SP0502, section 6, the plan's procedures for post assessment of the effectiveness of the ECDA process must include—

        (i) Measures for evaluating the long-term effectiveness of ECDA in addressing external corrosion in covered segments; and

        (ii) Criteria for evaluating whether conditions discovered by direct examination of indications in each ECDA region indicate a need for reassessment of the covered segment at an interval less than that specified in § 192.939. (See Appendix D of NACE SP0502.)

        § 192.927   What are the requirements for using Internal Corrosion Direct Assessment (ICDA)?

#### § § 192.927

        (a)  Internal Corrosion Direct Assessment (ICDA) is a process an operator uses to identify areas along the pipeline where fluid or other electrolyte introduced during normal operation or by an upset condition may reside, and then focuses direct examination on the locations in covered segments where internal corrosion is most likely to exist. The process identifies the potential for internal corrosion caused by microorganisms, or fluid with CO, O, hydrogen sulfide or other contaminants present in the gas.

        (b)  An operator using direct assessment as an assessment method to address internal corrosion in a covered pipeline segment must follow the requirements in this section and in NACE SP0206 (incorporated by reference,  § 192.7). The Dry Gas Internal Corrosion Direct Assessment (DG-ICDA) process described in this section applies only for a segment of pipe transporting normally dry natural gas ( § 192.3) and not for a segment with electrolytes normally present in the gas stream. If an operator uses ICDA to assess a covered segment operating with electrolytes present in the gas stream, the operator must develop a plan that demonstrates how it will conduct ICDA in the segment to address internal corrosion effectively and must notify PHMSA in accordance with § 192.18. In the event of a conflict between this section and NACE SP0206, the requirements in this section control.

        (c)  An operator must develop and follow an ICDA plan that meets NACE SP0206 (incorporated by reference,  § 192.7) and that implements all four steps of the DG-ICDA process, including pre-assessment, indirect inspection, detailed examination at excavation locations, and post-assessment evaluation and monitoring. The plan must identify the locations of all ICDA regions within covered segments in the transmission system. An ICDA region is a continuous length of pipe (including weld joints), uninterrupted by any significant change in water or flow characteristics, that includes similar physical characteristics or operating history. An ICDA region extends from the location where liquid may first enter the pipeline and encompasses the entire area along the pipeline where internal corrosion may occur until a new input introduces the possibility of water entering the pipeline. In cases where a single covered segment is partially located in two or more ICDA regions, the four-step ICDA process must be completed for each ICDA region in which the covered segment is partially located to complete the assessment of the covered segment.

        (1)  An operator must comply with NACE SP0206 (incorporated by reference,  § 192.7) in conducting the preassessment step of the ICDA process.

        (2)  An operator must comply with NACE SP0206 (incorporated by reference,  § 192.7), and the following additional requirements, in conducting the Indirect Inspection step of the ICDA process. An operator must explicitly document the results of its feasibility assessment as required by NACE SP0206, section 3.3 (incorporated by reference,  § 192.7); if any condition that precludes the successful application of ICDA applies, then ICDA may not be used, and another assessment method must be selected. When performing the indirect inspection, the operator must use actual pipeline-specific data, exclusively. The use of assumed pipeline or operational data is prohibited. When calculating the critical inclination angle of liquid holdup and the inclination profile of the pipeline, the operator must consider the accuracy, reliability, and uncertainty of the data used to make those calculations, including, but not limited to, gas flow velocity (including during upset conditions), pipeline elevation profile survey data (including specific profile at features with inclinations such as road crossings, river crossings, drains, valves, drips, etc.), topographical data, and depth of cover. An operator must select locations for direct examination and establish the extent of pipe exposure needed ( the size of the bell hole), to account for these uncertainties and their cumulative effect on the precise location of predicted liquid dropout.

        (3)  An operator must comply with NACE SP0206 (incorporated by reference,  § 192.7) in conducting the detailed examination step of the ICDA process. When an operator first uses ICDA for a covered segment, an operator must identify a minimum of two locations for excavation within each covered segment associated with the ICDA region and must perform a detailed examination for internal corrosion at each location using ultrasonic thickness measurements, radiography, or other generally accepted measurement techniques that can examine for internal corrosion or other threats that are being assessed. One location must be the low point (e.g., sag, drip, valve, manifold, dead-leg) within the covered segment nearest to the beginning of the ICDA region. The second location must be further downstream, within the covered segment, near the end of the ICDA region. Whenever corrosion is found during ICDA at any location, the operator must:

        (i) Evaluate the severity of the defect (remaining strength) and remediate the defect in accordance with § 192.933 if the condition is in a covered segment, or in accordance with §§ 192.485 and 192.714 if the condition is not in a covered segment;

        (ii) Expand the detailed examination program to determine all locations that have internal corrosion within the ICDA region, and accurately characterize the nature, extent, and root cause of the internal corrosion. In cases where the internal corrosion was identified within the ICDA region but outside the covered segment, the expanded detailed examination program must also include at least two detailed examinations within each covered segment associated with the ICDA region, at the location within the covered segment(s) most likely to have internal corrosion. One location must be the low point (e.g., sags, drips, valves, manifolds, dead-legs, traps) within the covered segment nearest to the beginning of the ICDA region. The second location must be further downstream, within the covered segment. In instances of first use of ICDA for a covered segment, where these locations have already been examined in accordance with paragraph (c)(3) of this section, two additional detailed examinations must be conducted within the covered segment; and

        (iii) Expand the detailed examination program to evaluate the potential for internal corrosion in all pipeline segments (both covered and non-covered) in the operator's pipeline system with similar characteristics to the ICDA region in which the corrosion was found and remediate identified instances of internal corrosion in accordance with either § 192.933 or §§ 192.485 and 192.714, as appropriate.

        (4)  An operator must comply with NACE SP0206 (incorporated by reference,  § 192.7) in performing the post assessment step of the ICDA process. In addition to NACE SP0206, the evaluation and monitoring process must also include—

        (i) An evaluation of the effectiveness of ICDA as an assessment method for addressing internal corrosion and determining whether a covered segment should be reassessed at more frequent intervals than those specified in § 192.939. An operator must carry out this evaluation within 1 year of conducting an ICDA;

        (ii) Validation of the flow modeling calculations by comparison of actual locations of discovered internal corrosion with locations predicted by the model (if the flow model cannot be validated, then ICDA is not feasible for the segment); and

        (iii) Continuous monitoring of each ICDA region that contains a covered segment where internal corrosion has been identified by using techniques such as coupons or ultrasonic (UT) sensors or electronic probes, and by periodically drawing off liquids at low points and chemically analyzing the liquids for the presence of corrosion products. An operator must base the frequency of the monitoring and liquid analysis on results from all integrity assessments that have been conducted in accordance with the requirements of this subpart and risk factors specific to the ICDA region. At a minimum, the monitoring frequency must be two times each calendar year, but at intervals not exceeding 7  months. If an operator finds any evidence of corrosion products in the ICDA region, the operator must take prompt action in accordance with one of the two following required actions, and remediate the conditions the operator finds in accordance with § 192.933 or §§ 192.485 and 192.714, as applicable.

        (A) Conduct excavations of, and detailed examinations at, locations downstream from where the electrolytes might have entered the pipe to investigate and accurately characterize the nature, extent, and root cause of the corrosion; or

        (B) Assess the covered segment using another integrity assessment method allowed by this subpart.

        (5)  The ICDA plan must also include the following:

        (i) Criteria an operator will apply in making key decisions (including, but not limited to, ICDA feasibility, definition of ICDA regions and sub-regions, and conditions requiring excavation) in implementing each stage of the ICDA process; and

        (ii) Provisions that the analysis be carried out on the entire pipeline in which covered segments are present, except that application of the remediation criteria of § 192.933 may be limited to covered segments.

        § 192.929   What are the requirements for using Direct Assessment for Stress Corrosion Cracking?

#### § § 192.929

        (a)  A Stress Corrosion Cracking Direct Assessment (SCCDA) is a process to assess a covered pipeline segment for the presence of stress corrosion cracking (SCC) by systematically gathering and analyzing excavation data from pipe having similar operational characteristics and residing in a similar physical environment.

        (b)  An operator using direct assessment as an integrity assessment method for addressing SCC in a covered pipeline segment must develop and follow an SCCDA plan that meets NACE SP0204 (incorporated by reference,  § 192.7) and that implements all four steps of the SCCDA process, including pre-assessment, indirect inspection, detailed examination at excavation locations, and post-assessment evaluation and monitoring. As specified in NACE SP0204, SCCDA is complementary with other inspection methods for SCC, such as in-line inspection or hydrostatic testing with a spike test, and it is not necessarily an alternative or replacement for these methods in all instances. Additionally, the plan must provide for—

        (1)  An operator's plan must provide for a systematic process to collect and evaluate data for all covered pipeline segments to identify whether the conditions for SCC are present and to prioritize the covered pipeline segments for assessment in accordance with NACE SP0204, sections 3 and 4, and Table 1 (incorporated by reference,  § 192.7). This process must also include gathering and evaluating data related to SCC at all sites an operator excavates while conducting its pipeline operations (both within and outside covered segments) where the criteria in NACE SP0204 (incorporated by reference,  § 192.7) indicate the potential for SCC. This data gathering process must be conducted in accordance with NACE SP0204, section 5.3 (incorporated by reference,  § 192.7), and must include, at a minimum, all data listed in NACE SP0204, Table 2 (incorporated by reference,  § 192.7). Further, the following factors must be analyzed as part of this evaluation:

        (i) The effects of a carbonate-bicarbonate environment, including the implications of any factors that promote the production of a carbonate-bicarbonate environment, such as soil temperature, moisture, the presence or generation of carbon dioxide, or cathodic protection (CP);

        (ii) The effects of cyclic loading conditions on the susceptibility and propagation of SCC in both high-pH and near-neutral-pH environments;

        (iii) The effects of variations in applied CP, such as overprotection, CP loss for extended periods, and high negative potentials;

        (iv) The effects of coatings that shield CP when disbonded from the pipe; and

        (v) Other factors that affect the mechanistic properties associated with SCC, including, but not limited to, historical and present-day operating pressures, high tensile residual stresses, flowing product temperatures, and the presence of sulfides.

        (2)  In addition to NACE SP0204, the plan's procedures for indirect inspection must include provisions for conducting at least two above ground surveys using the complementary measurement tools most appropriate for the pipeline segment based on an evaluation of integrated data.

        (3)  In addition to NACE SP0204, the plan's procedures for direct examination must provide for an operator conducting a minimum of three direct examinations for SCC within the covered pipeline segment spaced at the locations determined to be the most likely for SCC to occur.

        (4)  If SCC is discovered in a covered pipeline segment, an operator must mitigate the threat in accordance with one of the following applicable methods:

        (i) Removing the pipe with SCC; remediating the pipe with a Type B sleeve; performing hydrostatic testing in accordance with paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section; or by grinding out the SCC defect and repairing the pipe. If an operator uses grinding for repair, the operator must also perform the following as a part of the repair procedure: nondestructive testing for any remaining cracks or other defects; a measurement of the remaining wall thickness; and a determination of the remaining strength of the pipe at the repair location that is performed in accordance with § 192.712 and that meets the design requirements of §§ 192.111 and 192.112, as applicable. The pipe and material properties an operator uses in remaining strength calculations must be documented in traceable, verifiable, and complete records. If such records are not available, an operator must base the pipe and material properties used in the remaining strength calculations on properties determined and documented in accordance with § 192.607, if applicable.

        (ii) Performing a spike pressure test in accordance with § 192.506 based upon the class location of the pipeline segment. The MAOP must be no greater than the test pressure specified in § 192.506(a) divided by: 1.39 for Class 1 locations and Class 2 locations that contain Class 1 pipe that has been uprated in accordance with § 192.611; and 1.50 for all other Class 2 locations and all Class 3 and Class 4 locations. An operator must repair any test failures due to SCC by replacing the pipe segment and re-testing the segment until the pipe passes the test without failures (such as pipe seam or gasket leaks, or a pipe rupture). At a minimum, an operator must repair pipe segments that pass the pressure test but have SCC present by grinding the segment in accordance with paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section.

        (5)  An operator's procedures for post-assessment, in addition to the procedures listed in NACE SP0204, sections 6.3, “periodic reassessment,” and 6.4, “effectiveness of SCCDA,” must include the development of a reassessment plan based on the susceptibility of the operator's pipe to SCC as well as the mechanistic behavior of identified cracking. An operator's reassessment intervals must comply with § 192.939. The plan must include the following factors, in addition to any factors the operator determines appropriate:

        (i) The evaluation of discovered crack clusters during the direct examination step in accordance with NACE SP0204, sections 5.3.5.7, 5.4, and 5.5 (incorporated by reference,  § 192.7);

        (ii) Conditions conducive to the creation of a carbonate-bicarbonate environment;

        (iii) Conditions in the application (or loss) of CP that can create or exacerbate SCC;

        (iv) Operating temperature and pressure conditions, including operating stress levels on the pipe;

        (v) Cyclic loading conditions;

        (vi) Mechanistic conditions that influence crack initiation and growth rates;

        (vii) The effects of interacting crack clusters;

        (viii) The presence of sulfides; and

        (ix) Disbonded coatings that shield CP from the pipe.

        § 192.931   How may Confirmatory Direct Assessment (CDA) be used?

#### § § 192.931

        An operator using the confirmatory direct assessment (CDA) method as allowed in § 192.937 must have a plan that meets the requirements of this section and of §§ 192.925 (ECDA) and § 192.927 (ICDA).

        (a)  An operator may only use CDA on a covered segment to identify damage resulting from external corrosion or internal corrosion.

        (b)  An operator's CDA plan for identifying external corrosion must comply with § 192.925 with the following exceptions.

        (1) The procedures for indirect examination may allow use of only one indirect examination tool suitable for the application.

        (2) The procedures for direct examination and remediation must provide that—

        (i) All immediate action indications must be excavated for each ECDA region; and

        (ii) At least one high risk indication that meets the criteria of scheduled action must be excavated in each ECDA region.

        (c)  An operator's CDA plan for identifying internal corrosion must comply with § 192.927 except that the plan's procedures for identifying locations for excavation may require excavation of only one high risk location in each ICDA region.

        (d)  If an assessment carried out under paragraph (b) or (c) of this section reveals any defect requiring remediation prior to the next scheduled assessment, the operator must schedule the next assessment in accordance with NACE SP0502 (incorporated by reference,  § 192.7), section 6.2 and 6.3. If the defect requires immediate remediation, then the operator must reduce pressure consistent with § 192.933 until the operator has completed reassessment using one of the assessment techniques allowed in § 192.937.

        § 192.933   What actions must be taken to address integrity issues?

#### § § 192.933

        (a)  An operator must take prompt action to address all anomalous conditions the operator discovers through the integrity assessment. In addressing all conditions, an operator must evaluate all anomalous conditions and remediate those that could reduce a pipeline's integrity. An operator must be able to demonstrate that the remediation of the condition will ensure the condition is unlikely to pose a threat to the integrity of the pipeline until the next reassessment of the covered segment. Repairs performed in accordance with this section must use pipe and material properties that are documented in traceable, verifiable, and complete records. If documented data required for any analysis is not available, an operator must obtain the undocumented data through § 192.607. Until documented material properties are available, the operator must use the conservative assumptions in either § 192.712(e)(2) or, if appropriate following a pressure test, in § 192.712(d)(3).

        (1)  (i) If an operator is unable to respond within the time limits for certain conditions specified in this section, the operator must temporarily reduce the operating pressure of the pipeline or take other action that ensures the safety of the covered segment. An operator must reduce the operating pressure to one of the following:

        (A) A level not exceeding 80 percent of the operating pressure at the time the condition was discovered;

        (B) A level not exceeding the predicted failure pressure times the design factor for the class location in which the affected pipeline is located; or

        (C) A level not exceeding the predicted failure pressure divided by 1.1.

        (ii) An operator must determine the predicted failure pressure in accordance with § 192.712. An operator must notify PHMSA in accordance with § 192.18 if it cannot meet the schedule for evaluation and remediation required under paragraph (c) or (d) of this section and cannot provide safety through a temporary reduction in operating pressure or other action. The operator must document and keep records of the calculations and decisions used to determine the reduced operating pressure, and the implementation of the actual reduced operating pressure, for a period of 5 years after the pipeline has been remediated.

        (2)  When a pressure reduction exceeds 365 days, an operator must notify PHMSA under § 192.18 and explain the reasons for the remediation delay. This notice must include a technical justification that the continued pressure reduction will not jeopardize the integrity of the pipeline.

        (b)  Discovery of a condition occurs when an operator has adequate information about a condition to determine that the condition presents a potential threat to the integrity of the pipeline. For the purposes of this section, a condition that presents a potential threat includes, but is not limited to, those conditions that require remediation or monitoring listed under paragraphs (d)(1) through (3) of this section. An operator must promptly, but no later than 180 days after conducting an integrity assessment, obtain sufficient information about a condition to make that determination, unless the operator demonstrates that the 180-day period is impracticable. In cases where a determination is not made within the 180-day period, the operator must notify PHMSA, in accordance with § 192.18, and provide an expected date when adequate information will become available. Notification to PHMSA does not alleviate an operator from the discovery requirements of this paragraph (b).

        (c)  An operator must complete remediation of a condition according to a schedule prioritizing the conditions for evaluation and remediation. Unless a special requirement for remediating certain conditions applies, as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, an operator must follow the schedule in ASME B31.8S (incorporated by reference, see § 192.7), section 7, Figure 7.2.1-1. If an operator cannot meet the schedule for any condition, the operator must explain the reasons why it cannot meet the schedule and how the changed schedule will not jeopardize public safety.

        (d) —(1)  An operator's evaluation and remediation schedule must follow ASME/ANSI B31.8S-2004, section 7 (incorporated by reference,  § 192.7) in providing for immediate repair conditions. To maintain safety, an operator must temporarily reduce operating pressure in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section or shut down the pipeline until the operator completes the repair of these conditions. An operator must treat the following conditions as immediate repair conditions:

        (i) A metal loss anomaly where a calculation of the remaining strength of the pipe shows a predicted failure pressure determined in accordance with § 192.712(b) less than or equal to 1.1 times the MAOP at the location of the anomaly.

        (ii) A dent located between the 8 o'clock and 4 o'clock positions (upper   of the pipe) that has metal loss, cracking, or a stress riser, unless engineering analyses performed in accordance with § 192.712(c) demonstrate critical strain levels are not exceeded.

        (iii) Metal loss greater than 80 percent of nominal wall regardless of dimensions.

        (iv) Metal loss preferentially affecting a detected longitudinal seam, if that seam was formed by direct current, low-frequency electric resistance welding, electric flash welding, or has a longitudinal joint factor less than 1.0, and the predicted failure pressure determined in accordance with § 192.712(d) is less than 1.25 times the MAOP.

        (v) A crack or crack-like anomaly meeting any of the following criteria:

        (A) Crack depth plus any metal loss is greater than 50 percent of pipe wall thickness; or

        (B) Crack depth plus any metal loss is greater than the inspection tool's maximum measurable depth.

        (vi) An indication or anomaly that, in the judgment of the person designated by the operator to evaluate the assessment results, requires immediate action.

        (2)  Except for conditions listed in paragraphs (d)(1) and (3) of this section, an operator must remediate any of the following within 1 year of discovery of the condition:

        (i) A smooth dent located between the 8 o'clock and 4 o'clock positions (upper   of the pipe) with a depth greater than 6 percent of the pipeline diameter (greater than 0.50 inches in depth for a pipeline diameter less than Nominal Pipe Size (NPS) 12), unless engineering analyses performed in accordance with § 192.712(c) demonstrate critical strain levels are not exceeded.

        (ii) A dent with a depth greater than 2 percent of the pipeline diameter (0.250 inches in depth for a pipeline diameter less than NPS 12) that affects pipe curvature at a girth weld or at a longitudinal or helical (spiral) seam weld, unless engineering analyses performed in accordance with § 192.712(c) demonstrate critical strain levels are not exceeded.

        (iii) A dent located between the 4 o'clock and 8 o'clock positions (lower   of the pipe) that has metal loss, cracking, or a stress riser, unless engineering analyses performed in accordance with § 192.712(c) demonstrate critical strain levels are not exceeded.

        (iv) Metal loss anomalies where a calculation of the remaining strength of the pipe at the location of the anomaly shows a predicted failure pressure, determined in accordance with § 192.712(b), less than 1.39 times the MAOP for Class 2 locations, and less than 1.50 times the MAOP for Class 3 and 4 locations. For metal loss anomalies in Class 1 locations with a predicted failure pressure greater than 1.1 times MAOP, an operator must follow the remediation schedule specified in ASME B31.8S (incorporated by reference,  § 192.7), section 7, Figure 4, in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section.

        (v) Metal loss that is located at a crossing of another pipeline, or is in an area with widespread circumferential corrosion, or could affect a girth weld, that has a predicted failure pressure, determined in accordance with § 192.712(b), of less than 1.39 times the MAOP for Class 1 locations or where Class 2 locations contain Class 1 pipe that has been uprated in accordance with § 192.611, or less than 1.50 times the MAOP for all other Class 2 locations and all Class 3 and 4 locations.

        (vi) Metal loss preferentially affecting a detected longitudinal seam, if that seam was formed by direct current, low-frequency or high-frequency electric resistance welding, electric flash welding, or with a longitudinal joint factor less than 1.0, and where the predicted failure pressure, determined in accordance with § 192.712(d), is less than 1.39 times the MAOP for Class 1 locations or where Class 2 locations contain Class 1 pipe that has been uprated in accordance with § 192.611, or less than 1.50 times the MAOP for all other Class 2 locations and all Class 3 and 4 locations.

        (vii) A crack or crack-like anomaly that has a predicted failure pressure, determined in accordance with § 192.712(d), that is less than 1.39 times the MAOP for Class 1 locations or where Class 2 locations contain Class 1 pipe that has been uprated in accordance with § 192.611, or less than 1.50 times the MAOP for all other Class 2 locations and all Class 3 and 4 locations.

        (3)  An operator is not required by this section to schedule remediation of the following less severe conditions but must record and monitor the conditions during subsequent risk assessments and integrity assessments for any change that may require remediation. Monitored indications are the least severe and do not require an operator to examine and evaluate them until the next scheduled integrity assessment interval, but if an anomaly is expected to grow to dimensions or have a predicted failure pressure (with a safety factor) meeting a 1-year condition prior to the next scheduled assessment, then the operator must repair the condition:

        (i) A dent with a depth greater than 6 percent of the pipeline diameter (greater than 0.50 inches in depth for a pipeline diameter less than NPS 12), located between the 4 o'clock position and the 8 o'clock position (bottom   of the pipe), and for which engineering analyses of the dent, performed in accordance with § 192.712(c), demonstrate critical strain levels are not exceeded.

        (ii) A dent located between the 8 o'clock and 4 o'clock positions (upper   of the pipe) with a depth greater than 6 percent of the pipeline diameter (greater than 0.50 inches in depth for a pipeline diameter less than NPS 12), and for which engineering analyses of the dent, performed in accordance with § 192.712(c), demonstrate critical strain levels are not exceeded.

        (iii) A dent with a depth greater than 2 percent of the pipeline diameter (0.250 inches in depth for a pipeline diameter less than NPS 12) that affects pipe curvature at a girth weld or longitudinal or helical (spiral) seam weld, and for which engineering analyses, performed in accordance with § 192.712(c), of the dent and girth or seam weld demonstrate that critical strain levels are not exceeded.

        (iv) A dent that has metal loss, cracking, or a stress riser, and where engineering analyses performed in accordance with § 192.712(c) demonstrate critical strain levels are not exceeded.

        (v) Metal loss preferentially affecting a detected longitudinal seam, if that seam was formed by direct current, low-frequency or high-frequency electric resistance welding, electric flash welding, or with a longitudinal joint factor less than 1.0, and where the predicted failure pressure, determined in accordance with § 192.712(d), is greater than or equal to 1.39 times the MAOP for Class 1 locations or where Class 2 locations contain Class 1 pipe that has been uprated in accordance with § 192.611, or greater than or equal to 1.50 times the MAOP for all other Class 2 locations and all Class 3 and 4 locations.

        (vi) A crack or crack-like anomaly for which the predicted failure pressure, determined in accordance with § 192.712(d), is greater than or equal to 1.39 times the MAOP for Class 1 locations or where Class 2 locations contain Class 1 pipe that has been uprated in accordance with § 192.611, or greater than or equal to 1.50 times the MAOP for all other Class 2 locations and all Class 3 and 4 locations.

        (e)  Whenever an operator finds conditions that require the pipeline to be repaired, in accordance with this section, an operator must perform a direct examination of known locations of cracks or crack-like defects using technology that has been validated to detect tight cracks (equal to or less than 0.008 inches crack opening), such as inverse wave field extrapolation (IWEX), phased array ultrasonic testing (PAUT), ultrasonic testing (UT), or equivalent technology. “In situ” examination tools and procedures for crack assessments (length, depth, and volumetric) must have performance and evaluation standards, including pipe or weld surface cleanliness standards for the inspection, confirmed by subject matter experts qualified by knowledge, training, and experience in direct examination inspection for accuracy of the type of defects and pipe material being evaluated. The procedures must account for inaccuracies in evaluations and fracture mechanics models for failure pressure determinations.

        § 192.935   What additional preventive and mitigative measures must an operator take?

#### § § 192.935

        (a)  (1) An operator must take additional measures beyond those already required by this part to prevent a pipeline failure and to mitigate the consequences of a pipeline failure in a high consequence area. Such additional measures must be based on the risk analyses required by § 192.917. Measures that operators must consider in the analysis, if necessary, to prevent or mitigate the consequences of a pipeline failure include, but are not limited to:

        (i) Correcting the root causes of past incidents to prevent recurrence;

        (ii) Establishing and implementing adequate operations and maintenance processes that could increase safety;

        (iii) Establishing and deploying adequate resources for the successful execution of preventive and mitigative measures;

        (iv) Installing automatic shut-off valves or remote-control valves;

        (v) Installing pressure transmitters on both sides of automatic shut-off valves and remote-control valves that communicate with the pipeline control center;

        (vi) Installing computerized monitoring and leak detection systems;

        (vii) Replacing pipe segments with pipe of heavier wall thickness or higher strength;

        (viii) Conducting additional right-of-way patrols;

        (ix) Conducting hydrostatic tests in areas where pipe material has quality issues or lost records;

        (x) Testing to determine material mechanical and chemical properties for unknown properties that are needed to assure integrity or substantiate MAOP evaluations, including material property tests from removed pipe that is representative of the in-service pipeline;

        (xi) Re-coating damaged, poorly performing, or disbonded coatings;

        (xii) Performing additional depth-of-cover surveys at roads, streams, and rivers;

        (xiii) Remediating inadequate depth-of-cover;

        (xiv) Providing additional training to personnel on response procedures and conducting drills with local emergency responders; and

        (xv) Implementing additional inspection and maintenance programs.

        (2) Operators must document the risk analysis, the preventive and mitigative measures considered, and the basis for implementing or not implementing any preventive and mitigative measures considered, in accordance with § 192.947(d).

        (b) Third party damage and outside force damage—

        (1)  An operator must enhance its damage prevention program, as required under § 192.614 of this part, with respect to a covered segment to prevent and minimize the consequences of a release due to third party damage. Enhanced measures to an existing damage prevention program include, at a minimum—

        (i) Using qualified personnel ( § 192.915) for work an operator is conducting that could adversely affect the integrity of a covered segment, such as marking, locating, and direct supervision of known excavation work.

        (ii) Collecting in a central database information that is location specific on excavation damage that occurs in covered and non covered segments in the transmission system and the root cause analysis to support identification of targeted additional preventative and mitigative measures in the high consequence areas. This information must include recognized damage that is not required to be reported as an incident under part 191.

        (iii) Participating in one-call systems in locations where covered segments are present.

        (iv) Monitoring of excavations conducted on covered pipeline segments by pipeline personnel. If an operator finds physical evidence of encroachment involving excavation that the operator did not monitor near a covered segment, an operator must either excavate the area near the encroachment or conduct an above ground survey using methods defined in NACE SP0502 (incorporated by reference,  § 192.7). An operator must excavate, and remediate, in accordance with ASME B31.8S and § 192.933 any indication of coating holidays or discontinuity warranting direct examination.

        (2)  If an operator determines that outside force (e.g., earth movement, loading, longitudinal, or lateral forces, seismicity of the area, floods, unstable suspension bridge) is a threat to the integrity of a covered segment, the operator must take measures to minimize the consequences to the covered segment from outside force damage. These measures include increasing the frequency of aerial, foot or other methods of patrols; adding external protection; reducing external stress; relocating the line; or inline inspections with geospatial and deformation tools.

        (c)  If an operator determines, based on a risk analysis, that a rupture-mitigation valve (RMV) or alternative equivalent technology would be an efficient means of adding protection to a high-consequence area (HCA) in the event of a gas release, an operator must install the RMV or alternative equivalent technology. In making that determination, an operator must, at least, evaluate the following factors—timing of leak detection and pipe shutdown capabilities, the type of gas being transported, operating pressure, the rate of potential release, pipeline profile, the potential for ignition, and location of nearest response personnel. An RMV or alternative equivalent technology installed under this paragraph must meet all of the other applicable requirements in this part.

        (d)  An operator of a transmission pipeline operating below 30% SMYS located in a high consequence area must follow the requirements in paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) of this section. An operator of a transmission pipeline operating below 30% SMYS located in a Class 3 or Class 4 area but not in a high consequence area must follow the requirements in paragraphs (d)(1), (d)(2) and (d)(3) of this section.

        (1) Apply the requirements in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) and (b)(1)(iii) of this section to the pipeline; and

        (2) Either monitor excavations near the pipeline, or conduct patrols as required by § 192.705 of the pipeline at bi-monthly intervals. If an operator finds any indication of unreported construction activity, the operator must conduct a follow up investigation to determine if mechanical damage has occurred.

        (3) Perform instrumented leak surveys using leak detector equipment at least twice each calendar year, at intervals not exceeding 7   months. For unprotected pipelines or cathodically protected pipe where electrical surveys are impractical, instrumented leak surveys must be performed at least four times each calendar year, at intervals not exceeding 4   months. Electrical surveys are indirect assessments that include close interval surveys, alternating current voltage gradient surveys, direct current voltage gradient surveys, or their equivalent.

        (e)  An operator of a plastic transmission pipeline must apply the requirements in paragraphs (b)(1)(i), (b)(1)(iii) and (b)(1)(iv) of this section to the covered segments of the pipeline.

        (f)  Risk analyses and assessments conducted under paragraph (c) of this section must be reviewed by the operator and certified by a senior executive of the company, for operational matters that could affect rupture-mitigation processes and procedures. Review and certification must occur once per calendar year, with the period between reviews not to exceed 15 months, and must also occur within 3 months of an incident or safety-related condition, as those terms are defined at §§ 191.3 and 191.23, respectively.

        § 192.937   What is a continual process of evaluation and assessment to maintain a pipeline's integrity?

#### § § 192.937

        (a)  After completing the baseline integrity assessment of a covered segment, an operator must continue to assess the line pipe of that segment at the intervals specified in § 192.939 and periodically evaluate the integrity of each covered pipeline segment as provided in paragraph (b) of this section. An operator must reassess a covered segment on which a prior assessment is credited as a baseline under § 192.921(e) by no later than December 17, 2009. An operator must reassess a covered segment on which a baseline assessment is conducted during the baseline period specified in § 192.921(d) by no later than seven years after the baseline assessment of that covered segment unless the evaluation under paragraph (b) of this section indicates earlier reassessment.

        (b)  An operator must conduct a periodic evaluation as frequently as needed to assure the integrity of each covered segment. The periodic evaluation must be based on a data integration and risk assessment of the entire pipeline as specified in § 192.917. For plastic transmission pipelines, the periodic evaluation is based on the threat analysis specified in 192.917(d). For all other transmission pipelines, the evaluation must consider the past and present integrity assessment results, data integration and risk assessment information (§ 192.917), and decisions about remediation (§ 192.933) and additional preventive and mitigative actions (§ 192.935). An operator must use the results from this evaluation to identify the threats specific to each covered segment and the risk represented by these threats.

        (c)  In conducting the integrity reassessment, an operator must assess the integrity of the line pipe in each covered segment by applying one or more of the following methods for each threat to which the covered segment is susceptible. An operator must select the method or methods best suited to address the threats identified on the covered segment ( § 192.917).

        (1)  When performing an assessment using an in-line inspection tool, an operator must comply with the following requirements:

        (i) Perform the in-line inspection in accordance with § 192.493;

        (ii) Select a tool or combination of tools capable of detecting the threats to which the pipeline segment is susceptible such as corrosion, deformation and mechanical damage ( dents, gouges and grooves), material cracking and crack-like defects ( stress corrosion cracking, selective seam weld corrosion, environmentally assisted cracking, and girth weld cracks), hard spots with cracking, and any other threats to which the covered segment is susceptible; and

        (iii) Analyze and account for uncertainties in reported results ( tool tolerance, detection threshold, probability of detection, probability of identification, sizing accuracy, conservative anomaly interaction criteria, location accuracy, anomaly findings, and unity chart plots or equivalent for determining uncertainties and verifying actual tool performance) in identifying and characterizing anomalies.

        (2)  The use of pressure testing is appropriate for threats such as: Internal corrosion; external corrosion and other environmentally assisted corrosion mechanisms; manufacturing and related defects threats, including defective pipe and pipe seams; stress corrosion cracking; selective seam weld corrosion; dents; and other forms of mechanical damage. An operator must use the test pressures specified in Table 5.6.1-1 of section 5 of ASME B31.8S (incorporated by reference,  § 192.7) to justify an extended reassessment interval in accordance with § 192.939.

        (3)  The use of spike hydrostatic pressure testing is appropriate for time-dependent threats such as: Stress corrosion cracking; selective seam weld corrosion; manufacturing and related defects, including defective pipe and pipe seams; and other forms of defect or damage involving cracks or crack-like defects;

        (4) Excavation and  direct examination by means of visual examination, direct measurement, and recorded non-destructive examination results and data needed to assess all threats. Based upon the threat assessed, examples of appropriate non-destructive examination methods include ultrasonic testing (UT), phased array ultrasonic testing (PAUT), inverse wave field extrapolation (IWEX), radiography, or magnetic particle inspection (MPI);

        (5) Guided wave ultrasonic testing (GWUT) as described in Appendix F. The use of GWUT is appropriate for internal and external pipe wall loss;

        (6) Direct assessment to address threats of external corrosion, internal corrosion, and stress corrosion cracking. The use of direct assessment to address threats of external corrosion, internal corrosion, and stress corrosion cracking is allowed only if appropriate for the threat and pipeline segment being assessed. Use of direct assessment for threats other than the threat for which the direct assessment method is suitable is not allowed. An operator must conduct the direct assessment in accordance with the requirements listed in § 192.923 and with the applicable requirements specified in §§ 192.925, 192.927, and 192.929;

        (7) Other technology that an operator demonstrates can provide an equivalent understanding of the condition of the line pipe for each of the threats to which the pipeline is susceptible. An operator must notify PHMSA in advance of using the other technology in accordance with § 192.18; or

        (8) Confirmatory direct assessment when used on a covered segment that is scheduled for reassessment at a period longer than 7 calendar years. An operator using this reassessment method must comply with § 192.931.

        (d)  An integrity assessment conducted in accordance with the requirements of § 192.624(c) may be used as a reassessment under this section.

        § 192.939   What are the required reassessment intervals?

#### § § 192.939

        An operator must comply with the following requirements in establishing the reassessment interval for the operator's covered pipeline segments.

        (a)  An operator must establish a reassessment interval for each covered segment operating at or above 30% SMYS in accordance with the requirements of this section. The maximum reassessment interval by an allowable reassessment method is 7 calendar years. Operators may request a 6-month extension of the 7-calendar-year reassessment interval if the operator submits written notice to OPS, in accordance with § 192.18, with sufficient justification of the need for the extension. If an operator establishes a reassessment interval that is greater than 7 calendar years, the operator must, within the 7-calendar-year period, conduct a confirmatory direct assessment on the covered segment, and then conduct the follow-up reassessment at the interval the operator has established. A reassessment carried out using confirmatory direct assessment must be done in accordance with § 192.931. The table that follows this section sets forth the maximum allowed reassessment intervals.

        (1)  An operator that uses pressure testing or internal inspection as an assessment method must establish the reassessment interval for a covered pipeline segment by—

        (i) Basing the interval on the identified threats for the covered segment (see § 192.917) and on the analysis of the results from the last integrity assessment and from the data integration and risk assessment required by § 192.917; or

        (ii) Using the intervals specified for different stress levels of pipeline (operating at or above 30% SMYS) listed in ASME B31.8S (incorporated by reference,  § 192.7), Table 5.6.1-1 of Section 5.

        (2)  An operator that uses ECDA that meets the requirements of this subpart must determine the reassessment interval according to the requirements in paragraphs 6.2 and 6.3 of NACE SP0502 (incorporated by reference,  § 192.7).

        (3)  An operator that uses ICDA or SCCDA in accordance with the requirements of this subpart must determine the reassessment interval according to the following method. However, the reassessment interval cannot exceed those specified for direct assessment in ASME B31.8S, Table 5.6.1-1 of Section 5.

        (i) Determine the largest defect most likely to remain in the covered segment and the corrosion rate appropriate for the pipe, soil and protection conditions;

        (ii) Use the largest remaining defect as the size of the largest defect discovered in the SCC or ICDA segment; and

        (iii) Estimate the reassessment interval as half the time required for the largest defect to grow to a critical size.

        (b)  An operator must establish a reassessment interval for each covered segment operating below 30% SMYS in accordance with the requirements of this section. The maximum reassessment interval by an allowable reassessment method is 7 calendar years. Operators may request a 6-month extension of the 7-calendar-year reassessment interval if the operator submits written notice to OPS in accordance with § 192.18. The notice must include sufficient justification of the need for the extension. An operator must establish reassessment by at least one of the following—

        (1) Reassessment by pressure test, internal inspection or other equivalent technology following the requirements in paragraph (a)(1) of this section except that the stress level referenced in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section would be adjusted to reflect the lower operating stress level. If an established interval is more than 7 calendar years, an operator must conduct by the seventh calendar year of the interval either a confirmatory direct assessment in accordance with § 192.931, or a low stress reassessment in accordance with § 192.941.

        (2) Reassessment by ECDA following the requirements in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.

        (3) Reassessment by ICDA or SCCDA following the requirements in paragraph (a)(3) of this section.

        (4) Reassessment by confirmatory direct assessment at 7-year intervals in accordance with § 192.931, with reassessment by one of the methods listed in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(3) of this section by year 20 of the interval.

        (5) Reassessment by the low stress assessment method at 7-year intervals in accordance with § 192.941 with reassessment by one of the methods listed in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(3) of this section by year 20 of the interval.

        (6) The following table sets forth the maximum reassessment intervals. Also refer to Appendix E.II for guidance on Assessment Methods and Assessment Schedule for Transmission Pipelines Operating Below 30% SMYS. In case of conflict between the rule and the guidance in the Appendix, the requirements of the rule control. An operator must comply with the following requirements in establishing a reassessment interval for a covered segment:

        § 192.941   What is a low stress reassessment?

#### § § 192.941

        (a)  An operator of a transmission line that operates below 30% SMYS may use the following method to reassess a covered segment in accordance with § 192.939. This method of reassessment addresses the threats of external and internal corrosion. The operator must have conducted a baseline assessment of the covered segment in accordance with the requirements of §§ 192.919 and 192.921.

        (b)  An operator must take one of the following actions to address external corrosion on the low stress covered segment.

        (1)  To address the threat of external corrosion on cathodically protected pipe in a covered segment, an operator must perform an indirect assessment on the covered segment at least once every 7 calendar years. The indirect assessment must be conducted using one of the following means: indirect examination method, such as a close interval survey; alternating current voltage gradient survey; direct current voltage gradient survey; or the equivalent of any of these methods. An operator must evaluate the cathodic protection and corrosion threat for the covered segment and include the results of each indirect assessment as part of the overall evaluation. This evaluation must also include, at a minimum, the leak repair and inspection records, corrosion monitoring records, exposed pipe inspection records, and the pipeline environment.

        (2)  If an external corrosion assessment is impractical on the covered segment an operator must—

        (i) Conduct leakage surveys as required by § 192.706 at 4-month intervals; and

        (ii) Every 18 months, identify and remediate areas of active corrosion by evaluating leak repair and inspection records, corrosion monitoring records, exposed pipe inspection records, and the pipeline environment.

        (c)  To address the threat of internal corrosion on a covered segment, an operator must—

        (1) Conduct a gas analysis for corrosive agents at least once each calendar year;

        (2) Conduct periodic testing of fluids removed from the segment. At least once each calendar year test the fluids removed from each storage field that may affect a covered segment; and

        (3) At least every seven (7) years, integrate data from the analysis and testing required by paragraphs (c)(1)-(c)(2) with applicable internal corrosion leak records, incident reports, safety-related condition reports, repair records, patrol records, exposed pipe reports, and test records, and define and implement appropriate remediation actions.

        § 192.943   When can an operator deviate from these reassessment intervals?

#### § § 192.943

        (a)  In the following limited instances, OPS may allow a waiver from a reassessment interval required by § 192.939 if OPS finds a waiver would not be inconsistent with pipeline safety.

        (1)  An operator who uses internal inspection as an assessment method may be able to justify a longer reassessment period for a covered segment if internal inspection tools are not available to assess the line pipe. To justify this, the operator must demonstrate that it cannot obtain the internal inspection tools within the required reassessment period and that the actions the operator is taking in the interim ensure the integrity of the covered segment.

        (2)  An operator may be able to justify a longer reassessment period for a covered segment if the operator demonstrates that it cannot maintain local product supply if it conducts the reassessment within the required interval.

        (b)  If one of the conditions specified in paragraph (a) (1) or (a) (2) of this section applies, an operator may seek a waiver of the required reassessment interval. An operator must apply for a waiver in accordance with 49 U.S.C. 60118(c), at least 180 days before the end of the required reassessment interval, unless local product supply issues make the period impractical. If local product supply issues make the period impractical, an operator must apply for the waiver as soon as the need for the waiver becomes known.

#### § § 192.945

        (a)  An operator must include in its integrity management program methods to measure whether the program is effective in assessing and evaluating the integrity of each covered pipeline segment and in protecting the high consequence areas. These measures must include the four overall performance measures specified in ASME/ANSI B31.8S (incorporated by reference,  § 192.7 of this part), section 9.4, and the specific measures for each identified threat specified in ASME/ANSI B31.8S, Appendix A. An operator must submit the four overall performance measures as part of the annual report required by § 191.17 of this subchapter.

        (b)  In addition to the general requirements for performance measures in paragraph (a) of this section, an operator using direct assessment to assess the external corrosion threat must define and monitor measures to determine the effectiveness of the ECDA process. These measures must meet the requirements of § 192.925.

        § 192.1007   What are the required elements of an integrity management plan?

#### § § 192.1007

        A written integrity management plan must contain procedures for developing and implementing the following elements:

        (a)  An operator must demonstrate an understanding of its gas distribution system developed from reasonably available information.

        (1) Identify the characteristics of the pipeline's design and operations and the environmental factors that are necessary to assess the applicable threats and risks to its gas distribution pipeline.

        (2) Consider the information gained from past design, operations, and maintenance.

        (3) Identify additional information needed and provide a plan for gaining that information over time through normal activities conducted on the pipeline (for example, design, construction, operations or maintenance activities).

        (4) Develop and implement a process by which the IM program will be reviewed periodically and refined and improved as needed.

        (5) Provide for the capture and retention of data on any new pipeline installed. The data must include, at a minimum, the location where the new pipeline is installed and the material of which it is constructed.

        (b)  The operator must consider the following categories of threats to each gas distribution pipeline: Corrosion (including atmospheric corrosion), natural forces, excavation damage, other outside force damage, material or welds, equipment failure, incorrect operations, and other issues that could threaten the integrity of its pipeline. An operator must consider reasonably available information to identify existing and potential threats. Sources of data may include incident and leak history, corrosion control records (including atmospheric corrosion records), continuing surveillance records, patrolling records, maintenance history, and excavation damage experience.

        (c)  An operator must evaluate the risks associated with its distribution pipeline. In this evaluation, the operator must determine the relative importance of each threat and estimate and rank the risks posed to its pipeline. This evaluation must consider each applicable current and potential threat, the likelihood of failure associated with each threat, and the potential consequences of such a failure. An operator may subdivide its pipeline into regions with similar characteristics (e.g., contiguous areas within a distribution pipeline consisting of mains, services and other appurtenances; areas with common materials or environmental factors), and for which similar actions likely would be effective in reducing risk.

        (d)  Determine and implement measures designed to reduce the risks from failure of its gas distribution pipeline. These measures must include an effective leak management program (unless all leaks are repaired when found).

        (e)  (1) Develop and monitor performance measures from an established baseline to evaluate the effectiveness of its IM program. An operator must consider the results of its performance monitoring in periodically re-evaluating the threats and risks. These performance measures must include the following:

        (i) Number of hazardous leaks either eliminated or repaired as required by § 192.703(c) of this subchapter (or total number of leaks if all leaks are repaired when found), categorized by cause;

        (ii) Number of excavation damages;

        (iii) Number of excavation tickets (receipt of information by the underground facility operator from the notification center);

        (iv) Total number of leaks either eliminated or repaired, categorized by cause;

        (v) Number of hazardous leaks either eliminated or repaired as required by § 192.703(c) (or total number of leaks if all leaks are repaired when found), categorized by material; and

        (vi) Any additional measures the operator determines are needed to evaluate the effectiveness of the operator's IM program in controlling each identified threat.

        (f)  An operator must re-evaluate threats and risks on its entire pipeline and consider the relevance of threats in one location to other areas. Each operator must determine the appropriate period for conducting complete program evaluations based on the complexity of its system and changes in factors affecting the risk of failure. An operator must conduct a complete program re-evaluation at least every five years. The operator must consider the results of the performance monitoring in these evaluations.

        (g)  Report, on an annual basis, the four measures listed in paragraphs (e)(1)(i) through (e)(1)(iv) of this section, as part of the annual report required by § 191.11. An operator also must report the four measures to the state pipeline safety authority if a state exercises jurisdiction over the operator's pipeline.

        § 192.1013   When may an operator deviate from required periodic inspections under this part?

#### § § 192.1013

        (a) An operator may propose to reduce the frequency of periodic inspections and tests required in this part on the basis of the engineering analysis and risk assessment required by this subpart.

        (b) An operator must submit its proposal to the PHMSA Associate Administrator for Pipeline Safety or, in the case of an intrastate pipeline facility regulated by the State, the appropriate State agency. The applicable oversight agency may accept the proposal on its own authority, with or without conditions and limitations, on a showing that the operator's proposal, which includes the adjusted interval, will provide an equal or greater overall level of safety.

        (c) An operator may implement an approved reduction in the frequency of a periodic inspection or test only where the operator has developed and implemented an integrity management program that provides an equal or improved overall level of safety despite the reduced frequency of periodic inspections.

        § 192.1015   What must a small LPG operator do to implement this subpart?

#### § § 192.1015

        (a)  No later than August 2, 2011, a small LPG operator must develop and implement an IM program that includes a written IM plan as specified in paragraph (b) of this section. The IM program for these pipelines should reflect the relative simplicity of these types of pipelines.

        (b)  A written integrity management plan must address, at a minimum, the following elements:

        (1)  The operator must demonstrate knowledge of its pipeline, which, to the extent known, should include the approximate location and material of its pipeline. The operator must identify additional information needed and provide a plan for gaining knowledge over time through normal activities conducted on the pipeline (for example, design, construction, operations or maintenance activities).

        (2)  The operator must consider, at minimum, the following categories of threats (existing and potential): Corrosion (including atmospheric corrosion), natural forces, excavation damage, other outside force damage, material or weld failure, equipment failure, and incorrect operation.

        (3)  The operator must evaluate the risks to its pipeline and estimate the relative importance of each identified threat.

        (4)  The operator must determine and implement measures designed to reduce the risks from failure of its pipeline.

        (5)  The operator must monitor, as a performance measure, the number of leaks eliminated or repaired on its pipeline and their causes.

        (6)  The operator must determine the appropriate period for conducting IM program evaluations based on the complexity of its pipeline and changes in factors affecting the risk of failure. An operator must re-evaluate its entire program at least every 5 years. The operator must consider the results of the performance monitoring in these evaluations.

        (c)  The operator must maintain, for a period of at least 10 years, the following records:

        (1) A written IM plan in accordance with this section, including superseded IM plans;

        (2) Documents supporting threat identification; and

        (3) Documents showing the location and material of all piping and appurtenances that are installed after the effective date of the operator's IM program and, to the extent known, the location and material of all pipe and appurtenances that were existing on the effective date of the operator's program.

        § 194.103   Significant and substantial harm; operator's statement.

#### § § 194.103

        (a) Each operator shall submit a statement with its response plan, as required by §§ 194.107 and 194.113, identifying which line sections in a response zone can be expected to cause significant and substantial harm to the environment in the event of a discharge of oil into or on the navigable waters or adjoining shorelines.

        (b) If an operator expects a line section in a response zone to cause significant and substantial harm, then the entire response zone must, for the purpose of response plan review and approval, be treated as if it is expected to cause significant and substantial harm. However, an operator will not have to submit separate plans for each line section.

        (c) A line section can be expected to cause significant and substantial harm to the environment in the event of a discharge of oil into or on the navigable waters or adjoining shorelines if; the pipeline is greater than 6  inches (168 millimeters) in outside nominal diameter, greater than 10 miles (16 kilometers) in length, and the line section—

        (1) Has experienced a release greater than 1,000 barrels (159 cubic meters) within the previous five years,

        (2) Has experienced two or more reportable releases, as defined in § 195.50, within the previous five years,

        (3) Containing any electric resistance welded pipe, manufactured prior to 1970, operates at a maximum operating pressure established under § 195.406 that corresponds to a stress level greater than 50 percent of the specified minimum yield strength of the pipe,

        (4) Is located within a 5 mile (8 kilometer) radius of potentially affected public drinking water intakes and could reasonably be expected to reach public drinking water intakes, or

        (5) Is located within a 1 mile (1.6 kilometer) radius of potentially affected environmentally sensitive areas, and could reasonably be expected to reach these areas.

        § 194.105   Worst case discharge.

#### § § 194.105

        (a) Each operator shall determine the worst case discharge for each of its response zones and provide the methodology, including calculations, used to arrive at the volume.

        (b) The worst case discharge is the largest volume, in barrels (cubic meters), of the following:

        (1) The pipeline's maximum release time in hours, plus the maximum shutdown response time in hours (based on historic discharge data or in the absence of such historic data, the operator's best estimate), multiplied by the maximum flow rate expressed in barrels per hour (based on the maximum daily capacity of the pipeline), plus the largest line drainage volume after shutdown of the line section(s) in the response zone expressed in barrels (cubic meters); or

        (2) The largest foreseeable discharge for the line section(s) within a response zone, expressed in barrels (cubic meters), based on the maximum historic discharge, if one exists, adjusted for any subsequent corrective or preventive action taken; or

        (3) If the response zone contains one or more breakout tanks, the capacity of the single largest tank or battery of tanks within a single secondary containment system, adjusted for the capacity or size of the secondary containment system, expressed in barrels (cubic meters).

        (4) Operators may claim prevention credits for breakout tank secondary containment and other specific spill prevention measures as follows:

        § 194.107   General response plan requirements.

#### § § 194.107

        (a) Each response plan must include procedures and a list of resources for responding, to the maximum extent practicable, to a worst case discharge and to a substantial threat of such a discharge. The “substantial threat” term is equivalent to abnormal operations outlined in 49 CFR 195.402(d). To comply with this requirement, an operator can incorporate by reference into the response plan the appropriate procedures from its manual for operations, maintenance, and emergencies, which is prepared in compliance with 49 CFR 195.402.

        (b) An operator must certify in the response plan that it reviewed the NCP and each applicable ACP and that its response plan is consistent with the NCP and each applicable ACP as follows:

        (1) As a minimum to be consistent with the NCP a facility response plan must:

        (i) Demonstrate an operator's clear understanding of the function of the Federal response structure, including procedures to notify the National Response Center reflecting the relationship between the operator's response organization's role and the Federal On Scene Coordinator's role in pollution response;

        (ii) Establish provisions to ensure the protection of safety at the response site; and

        (iii) Identify the procedures to obtain any required Federal and State permissions for using alternative response strategies such as in-situ burning and dispersants as provided for in the applicable ACPs; and

        (2) As a minimum, to be consistent with the applicable ACP the plan must:

        (i) Address the removal of a worst case discharge and the mitigation or prevention of a substantial threat of a worst case discharge;

        (ii) Identify environmentally and economically sensitive areas;

        (iii) Describe the responsibilities of the operator and of Federal, State and local agencies in removing a discharge and in mitigating or preventing a substantial threat of a discharge; and

        (iv) Establish the procedures for obtaining an expedited decision on use of dispersants or other chemicals.

        (c) Each response plan must include:

        (1) A core plan consisting of—

        (i) An information summary as required in § 194.113,

        (ii) Immediate notification procedures,

        (iii) Spill detection and mitigation procedures,

        (iv) The name, address, and telephone number of the oil spill response organization, if appropriate,

        (v) Response activities and response resources,

        (vi) Names and telephone numbers of Federal, State and local agencies which the operator expects to have pollution control responsibilities or support,

        (vii) Training procedures,

        (viii) Equipment testing,

        (ix) Drill program—an operator will satisfy the requirement for a drill program by following the National Preparedness for Response Exercise Program (PREP) guidelines. An operator choosing not to follow PREP guidelines must have a drill program that is equivalent to PREP. The operator must describe the drill program in the response plan and OPS will determine if the program is equivalent to PREP.

        (x) Plan review and update procedures;

        (2) An appendix for each response zone that includes the information required in paragraph (c)(1)(i)-(ix) of this section and the worst case discharge calculations that are specific to that response zone. An operator submitting a response plan for a single response zone does not need to have a core plan and a response zone appendix. The operator of a single response zone onshore pipeline shall have a single summary in the plan that contains the required information in § 194.113.7; and

        (3) A description of the operator's response management system including the functional areas of finance, logistics, operations, planning, and command. The plan must demonstrate that the operator's response management system uses common terminology and has a manageable span of control, a clearly defined chain of command, and sufficient trained personnel to fill each position.

        (b)  This Part does not apply to any of the following:

        (1) Transportation of a hazardous liquid transported in a gaseous state;

        (2) Except for the reporting requirements of subpart B of this part, see § 195.13, transportation of a hazardous liquid through a pipeline by gravity.

        (3) Transportation of a hazardous liquid through any of the following low-stress pipelines:

        (i) A pipeline subject to safety regulations of the U.S. Coast Guard; or

        (ii) A pipeline that serves refining, manufacturing, or truck, rail, or vessel terminal facilities, if the pipeline is less than one mile long (measured outside facility grounds) and does not cross an offshore area or a waterway currently used for commercial navigation;

        (4) Except for the reporting requirements of subpart B of this part, see § 195.15, transportation of petroleum through an onshore rural gathering line that does not meet the definition of a “regulated rural gathering line” as provided in § 195.11. This exception does not apply to gathering lines in the inlets of the Gulf of Mexico subject to § 195.413.

        (5) Transportation of hazardous liquid or carbon dioxide in an offshore pipeline in state waters where the pipeline is located upstream from the outlet flange of the following farthest downstream facility: The facility where hydrocarbons or carbon dioxide are produced or the facility where produced hydrocarbons or carbon dioxide are first separated, dehydrated, or otherwise processed;

        (6) Transportation of hazardous liquid or carbon dioxide in a pipeline on the OCS where the pipeline is located upstream of the point at which operating responsibility transfers from a producing operator to a transporting operator;

        (7) A pipeline segment upstream (generally seaward) of the last valve on the last production facility on the OCS where a pipeline on the OCS is producer-operated and crosses into state waters without first connecting to a transporting operator's facility on the OCS. Safety equipment protecting PHMSA-regulated pipeline segments is not excluded. A producing operator of a segment falling within this exception may petition the Administrator, under § 190.9 of this chapter, for approval to operate under PHMSA regulations governing pipeline design, construction, operation, and maintenance;

        (8) Transportation of hazardous liquid or carbon dioxide through onshore production (including flow lines), refining, or manufacturing facilities or storage or in-plant piping systems associated with such facilities;

        (i) By vessel, aircraft, tank truck, tank car, or other non-pipeline mode of transportation; or

        (ii) Through facilities located on the grounds of a materials transportation terminal if the facilities are used exclusively to transfer hazardous liquid or carbon dioxide between non-pipeline modes of transportation or between a non-pipeline mode and a pipeline. These facilities do not include any device and associated piping that are necessary to control pressure in the pipeline under § 195.406(b); or

        (10) Transportation of carbon dioxide downstream from the applicable following point:

        (i) The inlet of a compressor used in the injection of carbon dioxide for oil recovery operations, or the point where recycled carbon dioxide enters the injection system, whichever is farther upstream; or

        (ii) The connection of the first branch pipeline in the production field where the pipeline transports carbon dioxide to an injection well or to a header or manifold from which a pipeline branches to an injection well.

        (c)  Breakout tanks that are subject to this part must comply with requirements that apply specifically to breakout tanks and, to the extent applicable, with requirements that apply to pipeline systems and pipeline facilities. If a conflict exists between a requirement that applies specifically to breakout tanks and a requirement that applies to pipeline systems or pipeline facilities, the requirement that applies specifically to breakout tanks prevails. Anhydrous ammonia breakout tanks need not comply with §§ 195.132(b); 195.205(b); 195.264(b) and (e); 195.307; 195.428(c) through (d); and 195.432(b) and (c).

        § 195.5   Conversion to service subject to this part.

#### § § 195.5

        (a) A steel pipeline previously used in service not subject to this part qualifies for use under this part if the operator prepares and follows a written procedure to accomplish the following:

        (1) The design, construction, operation, and maintenance history of the pipeline must be reviewed and, where sufficient historical records are not available, appropriate tests must be performed to determine if the pipeline is in satisfactory condition for safe operation. If one or more of the variables necessary to verify the design pressure under § 195.106 or to perform the testing under paragraph (a)(4) of this section is unknown, the design pressure may be verified and the maximum operating pressure determined by—

        (i) Testing the pipeline in accordance with ASME B31.8 (incorporated by reference,  § 195.3), Appendix N, to produce a stress equal to the yield strength; and

        (ii) Applying, to not more than 80 percent of the first pressure that produces a yielding, the design factor F in § 195.106(a) and the appropriate factors in § 195.106(e).

        (2) The pipeline right-of-way, all aboveground segments of the pipeline, and appropriately selected underground segments must be visually inspected for physical defects and operating conditions which reasonably could be expected to impair the strength or tightness of the pipeline.

        (3) All known unsafe defects and conditions must be corrected in accordance with this part.

        (4) The pipeline must be tested in accordance with subpart E of this part to substantiate the maximum operating pressure permitted by § 195.406.

        (b) A pipeline that qualifies for use under this section need not comply with the corrosion control requirements of subpart H of this part until 12 months after it is placed into service, notwithstanding any previous deadlines for compliance.

        (c) Each operator must keep for the life of the pipeline a record of the investigations, tests, repairs, replacements, and alterations made under the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section.

        (d) An operator converting a pipeline from service not previously covered by this part must notify PHMSA 60 days before the conversion occurs as required by § 195.64.

        § 195.6   Unusually Sensitive Areas (USAs).

#### § § 195.6

        As used in this part, a USA means a drinking water or ecological resource area that is unusually sensitive to environmental damage from a hazardous liquid pipeline release.

        (a) An USA drinking water resource is:

        (1) The water intake for a Community Water System (CWS) or a Non-transient Non-community Water System (NTNCWS) that obtains its water supply primarily from a surface water source and does not have an adequate alternative drinking water source;

        (2) The Source Water Protection Area (SWPA) for a CWS or a NTNCWS that obtains its water supply from a Class I or Class IIA aquifer and does not have an adequate alternative drinking water source. Where a state has not yet identified the SWPA, the Wellhead Protection Area (WHPA) will be used until the state has identified the SWPA; or

        (3) The sole source aquifer recharge area where the sole source aquifer is a karst aquifer in nature.

        (b) An USA ecological resource is:

        (1) An area containing a critically imperiled species or ecological community;

        (2) A multi-species assemblage area;

        (3) A migratory waterbird concentration area;

        (4) An area containing an imperiled species, threatened or endangered species, depleted marine mammal species, or an imperiled ecological community where the species or community is aquatic, aquatic dependent, or terrestrial with a limited range;

        (5) An area containing an imperiled species, threatened or endangered species, depleted marine mammal species, or imperiled ecological community where the species or community occurrence is considered to be one of the most viable, highest quality, or in the best condition, as identified by an element occurrence ranking (EORANK) of A (excellent quality) or B (good quality) or

        (6) A coastal beach; or

        (7) Certain coastal waters.

        (c) Definitions used in this part—

        means a source of water that currently exists, can be used almost immediately with a minimal amount of effort and cost, involves no decline in water quality, and will meet the consumptive, hygiene, and fire fighting requirements of the existing population of impacted customers for at least one month for a surface water source of water and at least six months for a groundwater source.

        means a species or community that primarily occurs in aquatic, marine, or wetland habitats, as well as species that may use terrestrial habitats during all or some portion of their life cycle, but that are still closely associated with or dependent upon aquatic, marine, or wetland habitats for some critical component or portion of their life-history ( reproduction, rearing and development, feeding, etc).

        means an aquifer that is surficial or shallow, permeable, and is highly vulnerable to contamination. Class I aquifers include:

        (1) Unconsolidated Aquifers (Class Ia) that consist of surficial, unconsolidated, and permeable alluvial, terrace, outwash, beach, dune and other similar deposits. These aquifers generally contain layers of sand and gravel that, commonly, are interbedded to some degree with silt and clay. Not all Class Ia aquifers are important water-bearing units, but they are likely to be both permeable and vulnerable. The only natural protection of these aquifers is the thickness of the unsaturated zone and the presence of fine-grained material;

        (2) Soluble and Fractured Bedrock Aquifers (Class Ib). Lithologies in this class include limestone, dolomite, and, locally, evaporitic units that contain documented karst features or solution channels, regardless of size. Generally these aquifers have a wide range of permeability. Also included in this class are sedimentary strata, and metamorphic and igneous (intrusive and extrusive) rocks that are significantly faulted, fractured, or jointed. In all cases groundwater movement is largely controlled by secondary openings. Well yields range widely, but the important feature is the potential for rapid vertical and lateral ground water movement along preferred pathways, which result in a high degree of vulnerability;

        (3) Semiconsolidated Aquifers (Class Ic) that generally contain poorly to moderately indurated sand and gravel that is interbedded with clay and silt. This group is intermediate to the unconsolidated and consolidated end members. These systems are common in the Tertiary age rocks that are exposed throughout the Gulf and Atlantic coastal states. Semiconsolidated conditions also arise from the presence of intercalated clay and caliche within primarily unconsolidated to poorly consolidated units, such as occurs in parts of the High Plains Aquifer; or

        (4) Covered Aquifers (Class Id) that are any Class I aquifer overlain by less than 50 feet of low permeability, unconsolidated material, such as glacial till, lacustrian, and loess deposits.

        means the territorial sea of the United States; the Great Lakes and their connecting waters; and the marine and estuarine waters of the United States up to the head of tidal influence.

        means a Higher Yield Bedrock Aquifer that is consolidated and is moderately vulnerable to contamination. These aquifers generally consist of fairly permeable sandstone or conglomerate that contain lesser amounts of interbedded fine grained clastics (shale, siltstone, mudstone) and occasionally carbonate units. In general, well yields must exceed 50 gallons per minute to be included in this class. Local fracturing may contribute to the dominant primary porosity and permeability of these systems.

        means any land between the high- and low-water marks of certain coastal waters.

        means a public water system that serves at least 15 service connections used by year-round residents of the area or regularly serves at least 25 year-round residents.

        means an animal or plant species or an ecological community of extreme rarity, based on The Nature Conservancy's Global Conservation Status Rank. There are generally 5 or fewer occurrences, or very few remaining individuals (less than 1,000) or acres (less than 2,000). These species and ecological communities are extremely vulnerable to extinction due to some natural or man-made factor.

        means a species that has been identified and is protected under the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972, as amended (MMPA) (16 U.S.C. 1361 ). The term “depleted” refers to marine mammal species that are listed as threatened or endangered, or are below their optimum sustainable populations (16 U.S.C. 1362). The term “marine mammal” means “any mammal which is morphologically adapted to the marine environment (including sea otters and members of the orders Sirenia, Pinnipedia, and Cetacea), or primarily inhabits the marine environment (such as the polar bear)” (16 U.S.C. 1362). The order Sirenia includes manatees, the order Pinnipedia includes seals, sea lions, and walruses, and the order Cetacea includes dolphins, porpoises, and whales.

        means an interacting assemblage of plants and animals that recur under similar environmental conditions across the landscape.

        means the condition or viability of a species or ecological community occurrence, based on a population's size, condition, and landscape context. EORANKs are assigned by the Natural Heritage Programs. An EORANK of A means an excellent quality and an EORANK of B means good quality.

        means a rare species or ecological community, based on The Nature Conservancy's Global Conservation Status Rank. There are generally 6 to 20 occurrences, or few remaining individuals (1,000 to 3,000) or acres (2,000 to 10,000). These species and ecological communities are vulnerable to extinction due to some natural or man-made factor.

        means an aquifer that is composed of limestone or dolomite where the porosity is derived from connected solution cavities. _Karst aquifer_s are often cavernous with high rates of flow.

        means a designated Ramsar site or a Western Hemisphere Shorebird Reserve Network site.

        means an area where three or more different critically imperiled or imperiled species or ecological communities, threatened or endangered species, depleted marine mammals, or migratory waterbird concentrations co-occur.

        means a public water system that regularly serves at least 25 of the same persons over six months per year. Examples of these systems include schools, factories, and hospitals that have their own water supplies.

        means a system that provides the public water for human consumption through pipes or other constructed conveyances, if such system has at least 15 service connections or regularly serves an average of at least 25 individuals daily at least 60 days out of the year. These systems include the sources of the water supplies— surface or ground. PWS can be community, non-transient non-community, or transient non-community systems.

        means a site that has been designated under The Convention on Wetlands of International Importance Especially as Waterfowl Habitat program. _Ramsar site_s are globally critical wetland areas that support migratory waterfowl. These include wetland areas that regularly support 20,000 waterfowl; wetland areas that regularly support substantial numbers of individuals from particular groups of waterfowl, indicative of wetland values, productivity, or diversity; and wetland areas that regularly support 1% of the individuals in a population of one species or subspecies of waterfowl.

        means an area designated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency under the Sole Source Aquifer program as the “sole or principal” source of drinking water for an area. Such designations are made if the aquifer's ground water supplies 50% or more of the drinking water for an area, and if that aquifer were to become contaminated, it would pose a public health hazard. A sole source aquifer that is karst in nature is one composed of limestone where the porosity is derived from connected solution cavities. They are often cavernous, with high rates of flow.

        means the area delineated by the state for a public water supply system (PWS) or including numerous PWSs, whether the source is ground water or surface water or both, as part of the state source water assessment program (SWAP) approved by EPA under section 1453 of the Safe Drinking Water Act.

        means species, subspecies, population stocks, or distinct vertebrate populations.

        means a non-aquatic or non-aquatic dependent ecological community that covers less than five (5) acres.

        means an animal or plant species that has been listed and is protected under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (ESA73) (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.). “Endangered species” is defined as “any species which is in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its range” (16 U.S.C. 1532). “Threatened species” is defined as “any species which is likely to become an endangered species within the foreseeable future throughout all or a significant portion of its range” (16 U.S.C. 1532).

        means a public water system that does not regularly serve at least 25 of the same persons over six months per year. This type of water system serves a transient population found at rest stops, campgrounds, restaurants, and parks with their own source of water.

        means the surface and subsurface area surrounding a well or well field that supplies a public water system through which contaminants are likely to pass and eventually reach the water well or well field.

        means an area that contains migratory shorebird concentrations and has been designated as a hemispheric reserve, international reserve, regional reserve, or endangered species reserve. Hemispheric reserves host at least 500,000 shorebirds annually or 30% of a species flyway population. International reserves host 100,000 shorebirds annually or 15% of a species flyway population. Regional reserves host 20,000 shorebirds annually or 5% of a species flyway population. Endangered species reserves are critical to the survival of endangered species and no minimum number of birds is required.

        § 195.8   Transportation of hazardous liquid or carbon dioxide in pipelines constructed with other than steel pipe.

#### § § 195.8

        No person may transport any hazardous liquid or carbon dioxide through a pipe that is constructed after October 1, 1970, for hazardous liquids or after July 12, 1991 for carbon dioxide of material other than steel unless the person has notified the Administrator in writing at least 90 days before the transportation is to begin. The notice must state whether carbon dioxide or a hazardous liquid is to be transported and the chemical name, common name, properties and characteristics of the hazardous liquid to be transported and the material used in construction of the pipeline. If the Administrator determines that the transportation of the hazardous liquid or carbon dioxide in the manner proposed would be unduly hazardous, he will, within 90 days after receipt of the notice, order the person that gave the notice, in writing, not to transport the hazardous liquid or carbon dioxide in the proposed manner until further notice.

        § 195.9   Outer continental shelf pipelines.

#### § § 195.9

        Operators of transportation pipelines on the Outer Continental Shelf must identify on all their respective pipelines the specific points at which operating responsibility transfers to a producing operator. For those instances in which the transfer points are not identifiable by a durable marking, each operator will have until September 15, 1998 to identify the transfer points. If it is not practicable to durably mark a transfer point and the transfer point is located above water, the operator must depict the transfer point on a schematic maintained near the transfer point. If a transfer point is located subsea, the operator must identify the transfer point on a schematic which must be maintained at the nearest upstream facility and provided to PHMSA upon request. For those cases in which adjoining operators have not agreed on a transfer point by September 15, 1998 the Regional Director and the MMS Regional Supervisor will make a joint determination of the transfer point.

        § 195.12   What requirements apply to low-stress pipelines in rural areas?

#### § § 195.12

        (a)  This Section sets forth the requirements for each category of low-stress pipeline in a rural area set forth in paragraph (b) of this Section. This Section does not apply to a rural low-stress pipeline regulated under this Part as a low-stress pipeline that crosses a waterway currently used for commercial navigation; these pipelines are regulated pursuant to § 195.1(a)(2).

        (b)  An operator of a rural low-stress pipeline must meet the applicable requirements and compliance deadlines for the category of pipeline set forth in paragraph (c) of this Section. For purposes of this Section, a rural low-stress pipeline is a Category 1, 2, or 3 pipeline based on the following criteria:

        (d)  (1) An operator may notify PHMSA in accordance with § 195.452(m) of a situation meeting the following criteria:

        (i) The pipeline is a Category 1 rural low-stress pipeline;

        (ii) The pipeline carries crude oil from a production facility;

        (iii) The pipeline, when in operation, operates at a flow rate less than or equal to 14,000 barrels per day; and

        (iv) The operator determines it would abandon or shut-down the pipeline as a result of the economic burden to comply with the assessment requirements in § 195.452(d) or 195.452(j).

        (2) A notification submitted under this provision must include, at minimum, the following information about the pipeline: its operating, maintenance and leak history; the estimated cost to comply with the integrity assessment requirements (with a brief description of the basis for the estimate); the estimated amount of production from affected wells per year, whether wells will be shut in or alternate transportation used, and if alternate transportation will be used, the estimated cost to do so.

        (3) When an operator notifies PHMSA in accordance with paragraph (d)(1) of this Section, PHMSA will stay compliance with §§ 195.452(d) and 195.452(j)(3) until it has completed an analysis of the notification. PHMSA will consult the Department of Energy, as appropriate, to help analyze the potential energy impact of loss of the pipeline. Based on the analysis, PHMSA may grant the operator a special permit to allow continued operation of the pipeline subject to alternative safety requirements.

        (e)  (1) If, after June 3, 2008, for Category 1 rural low-stress pipelines or October 1, 2011 for Category 2 rural low-stress pipelines, an operator identifies a new USA that causes a segment of pipeline to meet the criteria in paragraph (b) of this Section as a Category 1 or Category 2 rural low-stress pipeline, the operator must:

        (i) Comply with the IM program requirement in paragraph (c)(1)(iii)(A) or (c)(2)(iii)(A) of this Section, as appropriate, within 12 months following the date the area is identified regardless of the prior categorization of the pipeline; and

        (ii) Complete the baseline assessment required by paragraph (c)(1)(iii)(C) or (c)(2)(iii)(C) of this Section, as appropriate, according to the schedule in § 195.452(d)(3).

        (2) If a change to the boundaries of a USA causes a Category 1 or Category 2 pipeline segment to no longer be within one-half mile of a USA, an operator must continue to comply with paragraph (c)(1)(iii) or paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section, as applicable, with respect to that segment unless the operator determines that a release from the pipeline could not affect the USA.

        (f)  An operator must maintain records demonstrating compliance with each requirement applicable to the category of pipeline according to the following schedule.

        (1) An operator must maintain the segment identification records required in paragraph (c)(1)(i), (c)(2)(i) or (c)(3)(i) of this Section for the life of the pipe.

        § 195.106   Internal design pressure.

#### § § 195.106

        (a) Internal design pressure for the pipe in a pipeline is determined in accordance with the following formula:

        (b) The yield strength to be used in determining the internal design pressure under paragraph (a) of this section is the specified minimum yield strength. If the specified minimum yield strength is not known, the yield strength to be used in the design formula is one of the following:

        (1)(i) The yield strength determined by performing all of the tensile tests of API Spec 5L (incorporated by reference, see § 195.3) on randomly selected specimens with the following number of tests:

        (ii) If the average yield-tensile ratio exceeds 0.85, the yield strength shall be taken as 24,000 p.s.i. (165,474 kPa). If the average yield-tensile ratio is 0.85 or less, the yield strength of the pipe is taken as the lower of the following:

        (A) Eighty percent of the average yield strength determined by the tensile tests.

        (B) The lowest yield strength determined by the tensile tests.

        (2) If the pipe is not tensile tested as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the yield strength shall be taken as 24,000 p.s.i. (165,474 kPa).

        (c) If the nominal wall thickness to be used in determining internal design pressure under paragraph (a) of this section is not known, it is determined by measuring the thickness of each piece of pipe at quarter points on one end. However, if the pipe is of uniform grade, size, and thickness, only 10 individual lengths or 5 percent of all lengths, whichever is greater, need be measured. The thickness of the lengths that are not measured must be verified by applying a gage set to the minimum thickness found by the measurement. The nominal wall thickness to be used is the next wall thickness found in commercial specifications that is below the average of all the measurements taken. However, the nominal wall thickness may not be more than 1.14 times the smallest measurement taken on pipe that is less than 20 inches (508 mm) nominal outside diameter, nor more than 1.11 times the smallest measurement taken on pipe that is 20 inches (508 mm) or more in nominal outside diameter.

        (d) The minimum wall thickness of the pipe may not be less than 87.5 percent of the value used for nominal wall thickness in determining the internal design pressure under paragraph (a) of this section. In addition, the anticipated external loads and external pressures that are concurrent with internal pressure must be considered in accordance with §§ 195.108 and 195.110 and, after determining the internal design pressure, the nominal wall thickness must be increased as necessary to compensate for these concurrent loads and pressures.

        (e)(1) The seam joint factor used in paragraph (a) of this section is determined in accordance with the following standards incorporated by reference ( § 195.3):

#### § § 195.260

        A valve must be installed at each of the following locations:

        (a) On the suction end and the discharge end of a pump station in a manner that permits isolation of the pump station equipment in the event of an emergency.

        (b) On each pipeline entering or leaving a breakout storage tank area in a manner that permits isolation of the tank from other facilities.

        (c) On each pipeline at locations along the pipeline system that will minimize or prevent safety risks, property damage, or environmental harm from accidental hazardous liquid or carbon dioxide discharges, as appropriate for onshore areas, offshore areas, and high-consequence areas (HCA). For newly constructed or entirely replaced onshore hazardous liquid or carbon dioxide pipeline segments, as that term is defined at § 195.2, that are installed after April 10, 2023, valve spacing must not exceed 15 miles for pipeline segments that could affect or are in HCAs, as defined in § 195.450, and 20 miles for pipeline segments that could not affect HCAs. Valves on pipeline segments that are located in HCAs or which could affect HCAs must be installed at locations as determined by the operator's process for identifying preventive and mitigative measures established pursuant to § 195.452(i) and by using the selection process in section I.B of appendix C of part 195, but with a maximum distance that does not exceed 7  miles from the endpoints of the HCA segment or the segment that could affect an HCA. An operator may request an exemption from the compliance deadline requirements of this section for valve installation at the specified valve spacing if it can demonstrate to PHMSA, in accordance with the notification procedures in § 195.18, that those compliance deadline requirements would be economically, technically, or operationally infeasible.

        (d) On each lateral takeoff from a pipeline in a manner that permits shutting off the lateral without interrupting flow in the pipeline.

        (e) On each side of one or more adjacent water crossings that are more than 100 feet (30 meters) wide from high water mark to high water mark, as follows:

        (1) Valves must be installed at locations outside of the 100-year flood plain or be equipped with actuators or other control equipment that is installed so as not to be impacted by flood conditions; and

        (2) The maximum spacing interval between valves that protect multiple adjacent water crossings cannot exceed 1 mile in length.

        (f) On each side of a reservoir holding water for human consumption.

        (g) On each highly volatile liquid (HVL) pipeline that is located in a high-population area or other populated area, as defined in § 195.450, and that is constructed, or where 2 or more miles of pipe have been replaced within any 5 contiguous miles within any 24-month period, after April 10, 2023, with a maximum valve spacing of 7  miles. The maximum valve spacing intervals may be increased by 1.25 times the distance up to a 9  -mile spacing, provided the operator:

        (1) Submits for PHMSA review a notification pursuant to § 195.18 requesting alternative spacing because installation of a valve at a particular location between a 7-mile to a 7 -mile spacing would be economically, technically, or operationally infeasible, and that an alternative spacing would not adversely impact safety; and

        (2) Keeps the records necessary to support that determination for the useful life of the pipeline.

        (h) An operator may submit for PHMSA review, in accordance with § 195.18, a notification requesting site-specific exemption from the valve installation requirements or valve spacing requirements of paragraph (c), (e), or (f) of this section and demonstrating such exemption would not adversely affect safety. An operator may also submit for PHMSA review, in accordance with § 195.18, a notification requesting an extension of the compliance deadline requirements for valve installation and spacing of this section because those compliance deadline requirements would be economically, technically, or operationally infeasible for a particular new construction or pipeline replacement project.

        (i) An operator of a gathering line must only comply with the requirements of 49 CFR 195.260 effective as of October 4, 2022, and need not comply with the other requirements of this section.

        (i) High risk if the product transported is highly toxic or is both highly volatile and flammable;

        (ii) Medium risk if the product transported is flammable with a flashpoint of less than 100 °F, but not highly volatile; or

        (iii) Low risk if the product transported is not high or medium risk.

        (3) The volume indicator is—

        (i) High risk if the line is at least 18 inches in nominal diameter;

        (ii) Medium risk if the line is at least 10 inches, but less than 18 inches, in nominal diameter; or

        (iii) Low risk if the line is not high or medium risk.

        (4) The probability of failure indicator is—

        (i) High risk if the segment has experienced more than three failures in the last 10 years due to time-dependent defects (e.g., corrosion, gouges, or problems developed during manufacture, construction or operation, etc.); or

        (ii) Low risk if the segment has experienced three failures or less in the last 10 years due to time-dependent defects.

        (c) The program under paragraph (a) of this section shall provide for pressure testing for a segment constructed of electric resistance-welded (ERW) pipe and lapwelded pipe manufactured prior to 1970 susceptible to longitudinal seam failures as determined through paragraph (d) of this section. The timing of such pressure test may be determined based on risk classifications discussed under paragraph (b) of this section. For other segments, the program may provide for use of a magnetic flux leakage or ultrasonic internal inspection survey as an alternative to pressure testing and, in the case of such segments in Risk Classification A, may provide for no additional measures under this subpart.

        (d) All pre-1970 ERW pipe and lapwelded pipe is deemed susceptible to longitudinal seam failures unless an engineering analysis shows otherwise. In conducting an engineering analysis an operator must consider the seam-related leak history of the pipe and pipe manufacturing information as available, which may include the pipe steel's mechanical properties, including fracture toughness; the manufacturing process and controls related to seam properties, including whether the ERW process was high-frequency or low-frequency, whether the weld seam was heat treated, whether the seam was inspected, the test pressure and duration during mill hydrotest; the quality control of the steel-making process; and other factors pertinent to seam properties and quality.

        (e) Pressure testing done under this section must be conducted in accordance with this subpart. Except for segments in Risk Classification B which are not constructed with pre-1970 ERW pipe, water must be the test medium.

        (f) An operator electing to follow a program under paragraph (a) must develop plans that include the method of testing and a schedule for the testing by December 7, 1998. The compliance deadlines for completion of testing are as shown in the table below:

        (g) An operator must review the risk classifications for those pipeline segments which have not yet been tested under paragraph (a) of this section or otherwise inspected under paragraph (c) of this section at intervals not to exceed 15 months. If the risk classification of an untested or uninspected segment changes, an operator must take appropriate action within two years, or establish the maximum operating pressure under § 195.406(a)(5).

        (h) An operator must maintain records establishing compliance with this section, including records verifying the risk classifications, the plans and schedule for testing, the conduct of the testing, and the review of the risk classifications.

        (i) An operator may discontinue a program under this section only after written notification to the Administrator and approval, if needed, of a schedule for pressure testing.

        Pipeline Integrity Management

          § 195.452   Pipeline integrity management in high consequence areas.

#### § § 195.452

          (a)  This section applies to each hazardous liquid pipeline and carbon dioxide pipeline that could affect a high consequence area, including any pipeline located in a high consequence area unless the operator effectively demonstrates by risk assessment that the pipeline could not affect the area. (Appendix C of this part provides guidance on determining if a pipeline could affect a high consequence area.) Covered pipelines are categorized as follows:

          (1) Category 1 includes pipelines existing on May 29, 2001, that were owned or operated by an operator who owned or operated a total of 500 or more miles of pipeline subject to this part.

          (2) Category 2 includes pipelines existing on May 29, 2001, that were owned or operated by an operator who owned or operated less than 500 miles of pipeline subject to this part.

          (3) Category 3 includes pipelines constructed or converted after May 29, 2001, and low-stress pipelines in rural areas under § 195.12.

          (4) Low stress pipelines as specified in § 195.12.

          (b)  Each operator of a pipeline covered by this section must:

          (1) Develop a written integrity management program that addresses the risks on each segment of pipeline in the first column of the following table no later than the date in the second column:

          (2) Include in the program an identification of each pipeline or pipeline segment in the first column of the following table not later than the date in the second column:

          (3) Include in the program a plan to carry out baseline assessments of line pipe as required by paragraph (c) of this section.

          (4) Include in the program a framework that—

          (i) Addresses each element of the integrity management program under paragraph (f) of this section, including continual integrity assessment and evaluation under paragraph (j) of this section; and

          (ii) Initially indicates how decisions will be made to implement each element.

          (5) Implement and follow the program.

          (6) Follow recognized industry practices in carrying out this section, unless—

          (i) This section specifies otherwise; or

          (ii) The operator demonstrates that an alternative practice is supported by a reliable engineering evaluation and provides an equivalent level of public safety and environmental protection.

          (c)  (1) An operator must include each of the following elements in its written baseline assessment plan:

          (i) The methods selected to assess the integrity of the line pipe. An operator must assess the integrity of the line pipe by in-line inspection tool(s) described in paragraph (c)(1)(i)(A) of this section for the range of relevant threats to the pipeline segment. If it is impracticable based upon the construction of the pipeline ( diameter changes, sharp bends, and elbows) or operational limits including operating pressure, low flow, pipeline length, or availability of in-line inspection tool technology for the pipe diameter, then the operator must use the appropriate method(s) in paragraphs (c)(1)(i)(B), (C), or (D) of this section for the range of relevant threats to the pipeline segment. The methods an operator selects to assess low-frequency electric resistance welded pipe, pipe with a seam factor less than 1.0 as defined in § 195.106(e) or lap-welded pipe susceptible to longitudinal seam failure, must be capable of assessing seam integrity, cracking, and of detecting corrosion and deformation anomalies.

          (A) In-line inspection tool or tools capable of detecting corrosion and deformation anomalies including dents, gouges, and grooves. For pipeline segments with an identified or probable risk or threat related to cracks (such as at pipe body or weld seams) based on the risk factors specified in paragraph (e), an operator must use an in-line inspection tool or tools capable of detecting crack anomalies. When performing an assessment using an in-line inspection tool, an operator must comply with § 195.591. An operator using this method must explicitly consider uncertainties in reported results (including tool tolerance, anomaly findings, and unity chart plots or equivalent for determining uncertainties) in identifying anomalies;

          (B) Pressure test conducted in accordance with subpart E of this part;

          (C) External corrosion direct assessment in accordance with § 195.588; or

          (D) Other technology that the operator demonstrates can provide an equivalent understanding of the condition of the line pipe. An operator choosing this option must notify the Office of Pipeline Safety (OPS) 90 days before conducting the assessment, by sending a notice to the address or facsimile number specified in paragraph (m) of this section.

          (ii) A schedule for completing the integrity assessment;

          (iii) An explanation of the assessment methods selected and evaluation of risk factors considered in establishing the assessment schedule.

          (2) An operator must document, prior to implementing any changes to the plan, any modification to the plan, and reasons for the modification.

          (d)

          (1)  An operator must complete the baseline assessment before a new or conversion-to-service pipeline begins operation through the development of procedures, identification of high consequence areas, and pressure testing of could-affect high consequence areas in accordance with § 195.304.

          (2)  If an operator obtains information (whether from the information analysis required under paragraph (g) of this section, Census Bureau maps, or any other source) demonstrating that the area around a pipeline segment has changed to meet the definition of a high consequence area ( § 195.450), that area must be incorporated into the operator's baseline assessment plan within 1 year from the date that the information is obtained. An operator must complete the baseline assessment of any pipeline segment that could affect a newly identified high consequence area within 5 years from the date an operator identifies the area.

          (e)  (1) An operator must establish an integrity assessment schedule that prioritizes pipeline segments for assessment (see paragraphs (d)(1) and (j)(3) of this section). An operator must base the assessment schedule on all risk factors that reflect the risk conditions on the pipeline segment. The factors an operator must consider include, but are not limited to:

          (i) Results of the previous integrity assessment, defect type and size that the assessment method can detect, and defect growth rate;

          (ii) Pipe size, material, manufacturing information, coating type and condition, and seam type;

          (iii) Leak history, repair history and cathodic protection history;

          (iv) Product transported;

          (v) Operating stress level;

          (vi) Existing or projected activities in the area;

          (vii) Local environmental factors that could affect the pipeline ( seismicity, corrosivity of soil, subsidence, climatic);

          (viii) geo-technical hazards; and

          (ix) Physical support of the segment such as by a cable suspension bridge.

          (2) Appendix C of this part provides further guidance on risk factors.

          (f)  An integrity management program begins with the initial framework. An operator must continually change the program to reflect operating experience, conclusions drawn from results of the integrity assessments, and other maintenance and surveillance data, and evaluation of consequences of a failure on the high consequence area. An operator must include, at minimum, each of the following elements in its written integrity management program:

          (1) A process for identifying which pipeline segments could affect a high consequence area;

          (2) A baseline assessment plan meeting the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section;

          (3) An analysis that integrates all available information about the integrity of the entire pipeline and the consequences of a failure (see paragraph (g) of this section);

          (4) Criteria for remedial actions to address integrity issues raised by the assessment methods and information analysis (see paragraph (h) of this section);

          (5) A continual process of assessment and evaluation to maintain a pipeline's integrity (see paragraph (j) of this section);

          (6) Identification of preventive and mitigative measures to protect the high consequence area (see paragraph (i) of this section);

          (7) Methods to measure the program's effectiveness (see paragraph (k) of this section);

          (8) A process for review of integrity assessment results and information analysis by a person qualified to evaluate the results and information (see paragraph (h)(2) of this section).

          (g)  In periodically evaluating the integrity of each pipeline segment ( paragraph (j) of this section), an operator must analyze all available information about the integrity of its entire pipeline and the consequences of a possible failure along the pipeline. Operators must continue to comply with the data integration elements specified in § 195.452(g) that were in effect on October 1, 2018, until October 1, 2022. Operators must begin to integrate all the data elements specified in this section starting October 1, 2020, with all attributes integrated by October 1, 2022. This analysis must:

          (1) Integrate information and attributes about the pipeline that include, but are not limited to:

          (i) Pipe diameter, wall thickness, grade, and seam type;

          (ii) Pipe coating, including girth weld coating;

          (iii) Maximum operating pressure (MOP) and temperature;

          (iv) Endpoints of segments that could affect high consequence areas (HCAs);

          (v) Hydrostatic test pressure including any test failures or leaks—if known;

          (vi) Location of casings and if shorted;

          (vii) Any in-service ruptures or leaks—including identified causes;

          (viii) Data gathered through integrity assessments required under this section;

          (ix) Close interval survey (CIS) survey results;

          (x) Depth of cover surveys;

          (xi) Corrosion protection (CP) rectifier readings;

          (xii) CP test point survey readings and locations;

          (xiii) AC/DC and foreign structure interference surveys;

          (xiv) Pipe coating surveys and cathodic protection surveys.

          (xv) Results of examinations of exposed portions of buried pipelines ( pipe and pipe coating condition, see § 195.569);

          (xvi) Stress corrosion cracking (SCC) and other cracking (pipe body or weld) excavations and findings, including in-situ non-destructive examinations and analysis results for failure stress pressures and cyclic fatigue crack growth analysis to estimate the remaining life of the pipeline;

          (xvii) Aerial photography;

          (xviii) Location of foreign line crossings;

          (xix) Pipe exposures resulting from repairs and encroachments;

          (xx) Seismicity of the area; and

          (xxi) Other pertinent information derived from operations and maintenance activities and any additional tests, inspections, surveys, patrols, or monitoring required under this part.

          (2) Consider information critical to determining the potential for, and preventing, damage due to excavation, including current and planned damage prevention activities, and development or planned development along the pipeline;

          (3) Consider how a potential failure would affect high consequence areas, such as location of a water intake.

          (4) Identify spatial relationships among anomalous information ( corrosion coincident with foreign line crossings; evidence of pipeline damage where aerial photography shows evidence of encroachment). Storing the information in a geographic information system (GIS), alone, is not sufficient. An operator must analyze for interrelationships among the data.

          (h) —(1)  An operator must take prompt action to address all anomalous conditions in the pipeline that the operator discovers through the integrity assessment or information analysis. In addressing all conditions, an operator must evaluate all anomalous conditions and remediate those that could reduce a pipeline's integrity, as required by this part. An operator must be able to demonstrate that the remediation of the condition will ensure that the condition is unlikely to pose a threat to the long-term integrity of the pipeline. An operator must comply with all other applicable requirements in this part in remediating a condition. Each operator must, in repairing its pipeline systems, ensure that the repairs are made in a safe and timely manner and are made so as to prevent damage to persons, property, or the environment. The calculation method(s) used for anomaly evaluation must be applicable for the range of relevant threats.

          (i)  An operator must notify PHMSA, in accordance with paragraph (m) of this section, if the operator cannot meet the schedule for evaluation and remediation required under paragraph (h)(3) of this section and cannot provide safety through a temporary reduction in operating pressure.

          (ii)  When a pressure reduction exceeds 365 days, the operator must notify PHMSA in accordance with paragraph (m) of this section and explain the reasons for the delay. An operator must also take further remedial action to ensure the safety of the pipeline.

          (2)  Discovery of a condition occurs when an operator has adequate information to determine that a condition presenting a potential threat to the integrity of the pipeline exists. An operator must promptly, but no later than 180 days after an assessment, obtain sufficient information about a condition to make that determination, unless the operator can demonstrate the 180-day interval is impracticable. If the operator believes that 180 days are impracticable to make a determination about a condition found during an assessment, the pipeline operator must notify PHMSA in accordance with paragraph (m) of this section and provide an expected date when adequate information will become available.

          (3)  An operator must complete remediation of a condition according to a schedule prioritizing the conditions for evaluation and remediation. If an operator cannot meet the schedule for any condition, the operator must explain the reasons why it cannot meet the schedule and how the changed schedule will not jeopardize public safety or environmental protection.

          (4) —(i)  An operator's evaluation and remediation schedule must provide for immediate repair conditions. To maintain safety, an operator must temporarily reduce the operating pressure or shut down the pipeline until the operator completes the repair of these conditions. An operator must calculate the temporary reduction in operating pressure using the formulas referenced in paragraph (h)(4)(i)(B) of this section. If no suitable remaining strength calculation method can be identified, an operator must implement a minimum 20 percent or greater operating pressure reduction, based on actual operating pressure for two months prior to the date of inspection, until the anomaly is repaired. An operator must treat the following conditions as immediate repair conditions:

          (A) Metal loss greater than 80% of nominal wall regardless of dimensions.

          (B) A calculation of the remaining strength of the pipe shows a predicted burst pressure less than the established maximum operating pressure at the location of the anomaly. Suitable remaining strength calculation methods include, but are not limited to, ASME/ANSI B31G (incorporated by reference, _see_ § 195.3) and PRCI PR-3-805 (R-STRENG) (incorporated by reference,  § 195.3).

          (C) A dent located on the top of the pipeline (above the 4 and 8 o'clock positions) that has any indication of metal loss, cracking or a stress riser.

          (D) A dent located on the top of the pipeline (above the 4 and 8 o'clock positions) with a depth greater than 6% of the nominal pipe diameter.

          (E) An anomaly that in the judgment of the person designated by the operator to evaluate the assessment results requires immediate action.

          (ii)  Except for conditions listed in paragraph (h)(4)(i) of this section, an operator must schedule evaluation and remediation of the following conditions within 60 days of discovery of condition.

          (A) A dent located on the top of the pipeline (above the 4 and 8 o'clock positions) with a depth greater than 3% of the pipeline diameter (greater than 0.250 inches in depth for a pipeline diameter less than Nominal Pipe Size (NPS) 12).

          (B) A dent located on the bottom of the pipeline that has any indication of metal loss, cracking or a stress riser.

          (iii)  Except for conditions listed in paragraph (h)(4)(i) or (ii) of this section, an operator must schedule evaluation and remediation of the following within 180 days of discovery of the condition:

          (A) A dent with a depth greater than 2% of the pipeline's diameter (0.250 inches in depth for a pipeline diameter less than NPS 12) that affects pipe curvature at a girth weld or a longitudinal seam weld.

          (B) A dent located on the top of the pipeline (above 4 and 8 o'clock position) with a depth greater than 2% of the pipeline's diameter (0.250 inches in depth for a pipeline diameter less than NPS 12).

          (C) A dent located on the bottom of the pipeline with a depth greater than 6% of the pipeline's diameter.

          (D) A calculation of the remaining strength of the pipe shows an operating pressure that is less than the current established maximum operating pressure at the location of the anomaly. Suitable remaining strength calculation methods include, but are not limited to, ASME/ANSI B31G and PRCI PR-3-805 (R-STRENG).

          (E) An area of general corrosion with a predicted metal loss greater than 50% of nominal wall.

          (F) Predicted metal loss greater than 50% of nominal wall that is located at a crossing of another pipeline, or is in an area with widespread circumferential corrosion, or is in an area that could affect a girth weld.

          (G) A potential crack indication that when excavated is determined to be a crack.

          (H) Corrosion of or along a longitudinal seam weld.

          (I) A gouge or groove greater than 12.5% of nominal wall.

          (iv)  In addition to the conditions listed in paragraphs (h)(4)(i) through (iii) of this section, an operator must evaluate any condition identified by an integrity assessment or information analysis that could impair the integrity of the pipeline, and as appropriate, schedule the condition for remediation. Appendix C of this part contains guidance concerning other conditions that an operator should evaluate.

          (i) —(1)  An operator must take measures to prevent and mitigate the consequences of a pipeline failure that could affect a high consequence area. These measures include conducting a risk analysis of the pipeline segment to identify additional actions to enhance public safety or environmental protection. Such actions may include, but are not limited to, implementing damage prevention best practices, better monitoring of cathodic protection where corrosion is a concern, establishing shorter inspection intervals, installing EFRDs on the pipeline segment, modifying the systems that monitor pressure and detect leaks, providing additional training to personnel on response procedures, conducting drills with local emergency responders and adopting other management controls.

          (2)  In identifying the need for additional preventive and mitigative measures, an operator must evaluate the likelihood of a pipeline release occurring and how a release could affect the high consequence area. This determination must consider all relevant risk factors, including, but not limited to:

          (i) Terrain surrounding the pipeline segment, including drainage systems such as small streams and other smaller waterways that could act as a conduit to the high consequence area;

          (ii) Elevation profile;

          (iii) Characteristics of the product transported;

          (iv) Amount of product that could be released;

          (v) Possibility of a spillage in a farm field following the drain tile into a waterway;

          (vi) Ditches along side a roadway the pipeline crosses;

          (vii) Physical support of the pipeline segment such as by a cable suspension bridge;

          (viii) Exposure of the pipeline to operating pressure exceeding established maximum operating pressure;

          (ix) Seismicity of the area.

          (3)  An operator must have a means to detect leaks on its pipeline system. An operator must evaluate the capability of its leak detection means and modify, as necessary, to protect the high consequence area. An operator's evaluation must, at least, consider, the following factors—length and size of the pipeline, type of product carried, the pipeline's proximity to the high consequence area, the swiftness of leak detection, location of nearest response personnel, leak history, and risk assessment results.

          (4)  If an operator determines that an EFRD is needed on a pipeline segment that is located in, or which could affect, a high-consequence area (HCA) in the event of a hazardous liquid pipeline release, an operator must install the EFRD. In making this determination, an operator must, at least, evaluate the following factors—the swiftness of leak detection and pipeline shutdown capabilities, the type of commodity carried, the rate of potential leakage, the volume that can be released, topography or pipeline profile, the potential for ignition, proximity to power sources, location of nearest response personnel, specific terrain within the HCA or between the pipeline segment and the HCA it could affect, and benefits expected by reducing the spill size. An RMV installed under this paragraph (i)(4) must meet all of the other applicable requirements in this part, provided that the requirement of this sentence does not apply to gathering lines.

          (i) Where EFRDs are installed on pipeline segments in HCAs and that could affect HCAs with diameters of 6 inches or greater and that are placed into service or that have had 2 or more miles of pipe replaced within 5 contiguous miles within a 24-month period after April 10, 2023, the location, installation, actuation, operation, and maintenance of such EFRDs (including valve actuators, personnel response, operational control centers, supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA), communications, and procedures) must meet the design, operation, testing, maintenance, and rupture-mitigation requirements of §§ 195.258, 195.260, 195.402, 195.418, 195.419, and 195.420.

          (ii) The EFRD analysis and assessments specified in this paragraph (i)(4) must be completed prior to placing into service all onshore pipelines with diameters of 6 inches or greater and that are constructed or that have had 2 or more miles of pipe within any 5 contiguous miles within any 24-month period replaced after April 10, 2023. Implementation of EFRD findings for RMVs must meet § 195.418.

          (iii) An operator may request an exemption from the compliance deadline requirements of this section if it can demonstrate to PHMSA, in accordance with the notification procedures in § 195.18, that installing an EFRD by that compliance deadline would be economically, technically, or operationally infeasible.

          (iv) The requirements of paragraphs (i)(4)(i) through (iii) of this section do not apply to gathering lines.

          (j) —(1)  After completing the baseline integrity assessment, an operator must continue to assess the line pipe at specified intervals and periodically evaluate the integrity of each pipeline segment that could affect a high consequence area.

          (2)  An operator must verify the risk factors used in identifying pipeline segments that could affect a high consequence area on at least an annual basis not to exceed 15 months (Appendix C of this part provides additional guidance on factors that can influence whether a pipeline segment could affect a high consequence area). If a change in circumstance indicates that the prior consideration of a risk factor is no longer valid or that an operator should consider new risk factors, an operator must perform a new integrity analysis and evaluation to establish the endpoints of any previously identified covered segments. The integrity analysis and evaluation must include consideration of the results of any baseline and periodic integrity assessments ( paragraphs (b), (c), (d), and (e) of this section), information analyses ( paragraph (g) of this section), and decisions about remediation and preventive and mitigative actions ( paragraphs (h) and (i) of this section). An operator must complete the first annual verification under this paragraph no later than July 1, 2021.

          (3)  An operator must establish five-year intervals, not to exceed 68 months, for continually assessing the line pipe's integrity. An operator must base the assessment intervals on the risk the line pipe poses to the high consequence area to determine the priority for assessing the pipeline segments. An operator must establish the assessment intervals based on the factors specified in paragraph (e) of this section, the analysis of the results from the last integrity assessment, and the information analysis required by paragraph (g) of this section.

          (4) —(i)  An operator may be able to justify an engineering basis for a longer assessment interval on a segment of line pipe. The justification must be supported by a reliable engineering evaluation combined with the use of other technology, such as external monitoring technology, that provides an understanding of the condition of the line pipe equivalent to that which can be obtained from the assessment methods allowed in paragraph (j)(5) of this section. An operator must notify OPS 270 days before the end of the five-year (or less) interval of the justification for a longer interval, and propose an alternative interval. An operator must send the notice to the address specified in paragraph (m) of this section.

          (ii)  An operator may require a longer assessment period for a segment of line pipe (for example, because sophisticated internal inspection technology is not available). An operator must justify the reasons why it cannot comply with the required assessment period and must also demonstrate the actions it is taking to evaluate the integrity of the pipeline segment in the interim. An operator must notify OPS 180 days before the end of the five-year (or less) interval that the operator may require a longer assessment interval, and provide an estimate of when the assessment can be completed. An operator must send a notice to the address specified in paragraph (m) of this section.

          (5)  An operator must assess the integrity of the line pipe by any of the following methods. The methods an operator selects to assess low frequency electric resistance welded pipe or lap welded pipe susceptible to longitudinal seam failure must be capable of assessing seam integrity and of detecting corrosion and deformation anomalies.

          (i) In-Line Inspection tool or tools capable of detecting corrosion and deformation anomalies, including dents, gouges, and grooves. For pipeline segments that are susceptible to cracks (pipe body and weld seams), an operator must use an in-line inspection tool or tools capable of detecting crack anomalies. When performing an assessment using an In-Line Inspection tool, an operator must comply with § 195.591;

          (ii) Pressure test conducted in accordance with subpart E of this part;

          (iii) External corrosion direct assessment in accordance with § 195.588; or

          (iv) Other technology that the operator demonstrates can provide an equivalent understanding of the condition of the line pipe. An operator choosing this option must notify OPS 90 days before conducting the assessment, by sending a notice to the address or facsimile number specified in paragraph (m) of this section.

          (k)  An operator's program must include methods to measure whether the program is effective in assessing and evaluating the integrity of each pipeline segment and in protecting the high consequence areas. See Appendix C of this part for guidance on methods that can be used to evaluate a program's effectiveness.

          (l)  (1) An operator must maintain, for the useful life of the pipeline, records that demonstrate compliance with the requirements of this subpart. At a minimum, an operator must maintain the following records for review during an inspection:

          (i) A written integrity management program in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.

          (ii) Documents to support the decisions and analyses, including any modifications, justifications, deviations and determinations made, variances, and actions taken, to implement and evaluate each element of the integrity management program listed in paragraph (f) of this section.

          (2) See Appendix C of this part for examples of records an operator would be required to keep.

          (m) How does an operator notify PHMSA? An operator must provide any notification required by this section by:

          (1) Sending the notification by electronic mail to  or

          (2) Sending the notification by mail to ATTN: Information Resources Manager, DOT/PHMSA/OPS, East Building, 2nd Floor, E22-321, 1200 New Jersey Ave SE., Washington, DC 20590.

          (n) —

          (1)  This paragraph does not apply to any pipeline facilities listed in § 195.120(b).

          (2)  An operator must ensure that each pipeline is modified to accommodate the passage of an instrumented internal inspection device by July 2, 2040.

          (3)  If a pipeline could affect a newly identified high consequence area ( paragraph (d)(2) of this section) after July 2, 2035, an operator must modify the pipeline to accommodate the passage of an instrumented internal inspection device within 5 years of the date of identification or before performing the baseline assessment, whichever is sooner.

          (4)  An operator may file a petition under § 190.9 of this chapter for a finding that the basic construction ( length, diameter, operating pressure, or location) of a pipeline cannot be modified to accommodate the passage of an instrumented internal inspection device or that the operator determines it would abandon or shut-down a pipeline as a result of the cost to comply with the requirement of this section.

          (5)  An operator may file a petition under § 190.9 of this chapter for a finding that a pipeline cannot be modified to accommodate the passage of an instrumented internal inspection device as a result of an emergency. An operator must file such a petition within 30 days after discovering the emergency. If the petition is denied, the operator must modify the pipeline to allow the passage of an instrumented internal inspection device within 1 year after the date of the notice of the denial.

        (10) Abandoning pipeline facilities, including safe disconnection from an operating pipeline system, purging of combustibles, and sealing abandoned facilities left in place to minimize safety and environmental hazards. For each abandoned offshore pipeline facility or each abandoned onshore pipeline facility that crosses over, under or through commercially navigable waterways the last operator of that facility must file a report upon abandonment of that facility in accordance with § 195.59 of this part.

        (11) Minimizing the likelihood of accidental ignition of vapors in areas near facilities identified under paragraph (c)(4) of this section where the potential exists for the presence of flammable liquids or gases.

        (12) Establishing and maintaining adequate means of communication with the appropriate public safety answering point ( 9-1-1 emergency call center), where direct access to a 9-1-1 emergency call center is available from the location of the pipeline, and fire, police, and other public officials. Operators must determine the responsibilities, resources, jurisdictional area(s), and emergency contact telephone numbers for both local and out-of-area calls of each Federal, State, and local government organization that may respond to a pipeline emergency, and inform the officials about the operator's ability to respond to the pipeline emergency and means of communication during emergencies. Operators may establish liaison with the appropriate local emergency coordinating agencies, such as 9-1-1 emergency call centers or county emergency managers, in lieu of communicating individually with each fire, police, or other public entity.

        (13) Periodically reviewing the work done by operator personnel to determine the effectiveness of the procedures used in normal operation and maintenance and taking corrective action where deficiencies are found.

        (14) Taking adequate precautions in excavated trenches to protect personnel from the hazards of unsafe accumulations of vapor or gas, and making available when needed at the excavation, emergency rescue equipment, including a breathing apparatus and, a rescue harness and line.

        (15) Implementing the applicable control room management procedures required by § 195.446.

        (d)  The manual required by paragraph (a) of this section must include procedures for the following to provide safety when operating design limits have been exceeded:

        (ii) Increase or decrease in pressure or flow rate outside normal operating limits;

        (iii) Loss of communications;

        (iv) Operation of any safety device;

        (v) Any other malfunction of a component, deviation from normal operation, or personnel error which could cause a hazard to persons or property.

        (2) Checking variations from normal operation after abnormal operation has ended at sufficient critical locations in the system to determine continued integrity and safe operation.

        (3) Correcting variations from normal operation of pressure and flow equipment and controls.

        (4) Notifying responsible operator personnel when notice of an abnormal operation is received.

        (5) Periodically reviewing the response of operator personnel to determine the effectiveness of the procedures controlling abnormal operation and taking corrective action where deficiencies are found.

        (e)  The manual required by paragraph (a) of this section must include procedures for the following to provide safety when an emergency condition occurs:

        (1) Receiving, identifying, and classifying notices of events that need immediate response by the operator or notice to the appropriate public safety answering point ( 9-1-1 emergency call center), where direct access to a 9-1-1 emergency call center is available from the location of the pipeline, and fire, police, and other appropriate public officials, and communicating this information to appropriate operator personnel for prompt corrective action. Operators may establish liaison with the appropriate local emergency coordinating agencies, such as 9-1-1 emergency call centers or county emergency managers, in lieu of communicating individually with each fire, police, or other public entity.

        (2) Prompt and effective response to a notice of each type emergency, including fire or explosion occurring near or directly involving a pipeline facility, accidental release of hazardous liquid or carbon dioxide from a pipeline facility, operational failure causing a hazardous condition, and natural disaster affecting pipeline facilities.

        (4) Taking necessary actions, including but not limited to, emergency shutdown, valve shut-off, or pressure reduction, in any section of the operator's pipeline system, to minimize hazards of released hazardous liquid or carbon dioxide to life, property, or the environment. Each operator must also develop written rupture identification procedures to evaluate and identify whether a notification of potential rupture, as defined in § 195.2, is an actual rupture event or non-rupture event. These procedures must, at a minimum, specify the sources of information, operational factors, and other criteria that operator personnel use to evaluate a notification of potential rupture, as defined at § 195.2. For operators installing valves in accordance with § 195.258(c), § 195.258(d), or that are subject to the requirements in § 195.418, those procedures should provide for rupture identification as soon as practicable.

        (5) Control of released hazardous liquid or carbon dioxide at an accident scene to minimize the hazards, including possible intentional ignition in the cases of flammable highly volatile liquid.

        (6) Minimization of public exposure to injury and probability of accidental ignition by assisting with evacuation of residents and assisting with halting traffic on roads and railroads in the affected area, or taking other appropriate action.

        (7) Notifying the appropriate public safety answering point ( 9-1-1 emergency call center), where direct access to a 9-1-1 emergency call center is available from the location of the pipeline, and fire, police, and other public officials, of hazardous liquid or carbon dioxide pipeline emergencies to coordinate and share information to determine the location of the release, including both planned responses and actual responses during an emergency, and any additional precautions necessary for an emergency involving a pipeline transporting a highly volatile liquid (HVL). The operator must immediately and directly notify the appropriate public safety answering point or other coordinating agency for the communities and jurisdiction(s) in which the pipeline is located after notification of potential rupture, as defined at § 195.2, has occurred to coordinate and share information to determine the location of the release, regardless of whether the segment is subject to the requirements of § 195.258 (c) or (d), § 195.418, or § 195.419.

        § 195.413   Underwater inspection and reburial of pipelines in the Gulf of Mexico and its inlets.

#### § § 195.413

        (a) Except for gathering lines of 4  inches (114mm) nominal outside diameter or smaller, each operator shall prepare and follow a procedure to identify its pipelines in the Gulf of Mexico and its inlets in waters less than 15 feet (4.6 meters) deep as measured from mean low water that are at risk of being an exposed underwater pipeline or a hazard to navigation. The procedures must be in effect August 10, 2005.

        (b) Each operator shall conduct appropriate periodic underwater inspections of its pipelines in the Gulf of Mexico and its inlets in waters less than 15 feet (4.6 meters) deep as measured from mean low water based on the identified risk.

        (c) If an operator discovers that its pipeline is an exposed underwater pipeline or poses a hazard to navigation, the operator shall—

        (1) Promptly, but not later than 24 hours after discovery, notify the National Response Center, telephone: 1-800-424-8802, of the location and, if available, the geographic coordinates of that pipeline.

        (2) Promptly, but not later than 7 days after discovery, mark the location of the pipeline in accordance with 33 CFR Part 64 at the ends of the pipeline segment and at intervals of not over 500 yards (457 meters) long, except that a pipeline segment less than 200 yards (183 meters) long need only be marked at the center; and

        (3) Within 6 months after discovery, or not later than November 1 of the following year if the 6 month period is later than November 1 of the year of discovery, bury the pipeline so that the top of the pipe is 36 inches (914 millimeters) below the underwater natural bottom (as determined by recognized and generally accepted practices) for normal excavation or 18 inches (457 millimeters) for rock excavation.

        (i) An operator may employ engineered alternatives to burial that meet or exceed the level of protection provided by burial.

        (ii) If an operator cannot obtain required state or Federal permits in time to comply with this section, it must notify OPS; specify whether the required permit is State or Federal; and, justify the delay.

        § 195.414   Inspections of pipelines in areas affected by extreme weather and natural disasters.

#### § § 195.414

        (a)  Following an extreme weather event or natural disaster that has the likelihood of damage to infrastructure by the scouring or movement of the soil surrounding the pipeline, such as a named tropical storm or hurricane; a flood that exceeds the river, shoreline, or creek high-water banks in the area of the pipeline; a landslide in the area of the pipeline; or an earthquake in the area of the pipeline, an operator must inspect all potentially affected pipeline facilities to detect conditions that could adversely affect the safe operation of that pipeline.

        (b)  An operator must consider the nature of the event and the physical characteristics, operating conditions, location, and prior history of the affected pipeline in determining the appropriate method for performing the initial inspection to determine the extent of any damage and the need for the additional assessments required under paragraph (a) of this section.

        (c)  The inspection required under paragraph (a) of this section must commence within 72 hours after the cessation of the event, defined as the point in time when the affected area can be safely accessed by the personnel and equipment required to perform the inspection as determined under paragraph (b) of this section. In the event that the operator is unable to commence the inspection due to the unavailability of personnel or equipment, the operator must notify the appropriate PHMSA Region Director as soon as practicable.

        (d)  An operator must take prompt and appropriate remedial action to ensure the safe operation of a pipeline based on the information obtained as a result of performing the inspection required under paragraph (a) of this section. Such actions might include, but are not limited to:

        (1) Reducing the operating pressure or shutting down the pipeline;

        (2) Modifying, repairing, or replacing any damaged pipeline facilities;

        (3) Preventing, mitigating, or eliminating any unsafe conditions in the pipeline right-of-way;

        (4) Performing additional patrols, surveys, tests, or inspections;

        (5) Implementing emergency response activities with Federal, State, or local personnel; and

        (6) Notifying affected communities of the steps that can be taken to ensure public safety.

#### § § 195.415

        § 195.416   Pipeline assessments.

#### § § 195.416

        (a)  This section applies to onshore line pipe that can accommodate inspection by means of in-line inspection tools and is not subject to the integrity management requirements in § 195.452.

        (b)  An operator must perform an initial assessment of each of its pipeline segments by October 1, 2029, and perform periodic assessments of its pipeline segments at least once every 10 calendar years from the year of the prior assessment or as otherwise necessary to ensure public safety or the protection of the environment.

        (c)  Except as specified in paragraph (d) of this section, an operator must perform the integrity assessment for the range of relevant threats to the pipeline segment by the use of an appropriate in-line inspection tool(s). When performing an assessment using an in-line inspection tool, an operator must comply with § 195.591. An operator must explicitly consider uncertainties in reported results (including tool tolerance, anomaly findings, and unity chart plots or other equivalent methods for determining uncertainties) in identifying anomalies. If this is impracticable based on operational limits, including operating pressure, low flow, and pipeline length or availability of in-line inspection tool technology for the pipe diameter, then the operator must perform the assessment using the appropriate method(s) in paragraphs (c)(1), (2), or (3) of this section for the range of relevant threats being assessed. The methods an operator selects to assess low-frequency electric resistance welded pipe, pipe with a seam factor less than 1.0 as defined in § 195.106(e) or lap-welded pipe susceptible to longitudinal seam failure must be capable of assessing seam integrity, cracking, and of detecting corrosion and deformation anomalies. The following alternative assessment methods may be used as specified in this paragraph:

        (1) A pressure test conducted in accordance with subpart E of this part;

        (2) External corrosion direct assessment in accordance with § 195.588; or

        (3) Other technology in accordance with paragraph (d).

        (d)  Operators may elect to use other technologies if the operator can demonstrate the technology can provide an equivalent understanding of the condition of the line pipe for threat being assessed. An operator choosing this option must notify the Office of Pipeline Safety (OPS) 90 days before conducting the assessment by:

        (1) Sending the notification, along with the information required to demonstrate compliance with this paragraph, to the Information Resources Manager, Office of Pipeline Safety, Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, 1200 New Jersey Avenue SE, Washington, DC 20590; or

        (2) Sending the notification, along with the information required to demonstrate compliance with this paragraph, to the Information Resources Manager by facsimile to (202) 366-7128.

        (3) Prior to conducting the “other technology” assessments, the operator must receive a notice of “no objection” from the PHMSA Information Services Manager or Designee.

        (e)  A person qualified by knowledge, training, and experience must analyze the data obtained from an assessment performed under paragraph (b) of this section to determine if a condition could adversely affect the safe operation of the pipeline. Operators must consider uncertainties in any reported results (including tool tolerance) as part of that analysis.

        (f)  For purposes of § 195.401(b)(1), discovery of a condition occurs when an operator has adequate information to determine that a condition presenting a potential threat to the integrity of the pipeline exists. An operator must promptly, but no later than 180 days after an assessment, obtain sufficient information about a condition to make that determination required under paragraph (e) of this section, unless the operator can demonstrate the 180-day interval is impracticable. If the operator believes that 180 days are impracticable to make a determination about a condition found during an assessment, the pipeline operator must notify PHMSA and provide an expected date when adequate information will become available. This notification must be made in accordance with § 195.452 (m).

        (g)  An operator must comply with the requirements in § 195.401 if a condition that could adversely affect the safe operation of a pipeline is discovered in complying with paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section.

        (h)  An operator must consider all relevant information about a pipeline in complying with the requirements in paragraphs (a) through (g) of this section.

        § 195.417   Notification of potential rupture.

#### § § 195.417

        (a) As used in this part, a notification of potential rupture means the notification to, or observation by, an operator ( by or to its controller(s) in a control room, field personnel, nearby pipeline or utility personnel, the public, local responders, or public authorities) of one or more of the below indicia of a potential unintentional or uncontrolled release of a large volume of hazardous liquids or carbon dioxide from a pipeline:

        (1) An unanticipated or unexplained pressure loss outside of the pipeline's normal operating pressures, as defined in the operator's written procedures. The operator must establish in its written procedures that an unanticipated or unplanned pressure loss is outside of the pipeline's normal operating pressures when there is a pressure loss greater than 10 percent occurring within a time interval of 15 minutes or less, unless the operator has documented in its written procedures the operational need for a greater pressure-change threshold due to pipeline flow dynamics (including changes in operating pressure, flow rate, or volume), that are caused by fluctuations in product demand, receipts, or deliveries;

        (2) An unanticipated or unexplained flow rate change, pressure change, equipment function, or other pipeline instrumentation indication at the upstream or downstream station that may be representative of an event meeting paragraph (a)(1) of this section; or

        (3) Any unanticipated or unexplained rapid release of a large volume of hazardous liquid or carbon dioxide, a fire, or an explosion, in the immediate vicinity of the pipeline.

        (b) A notification of potential rupture occurs when an operator first receives notice of or observes an event specified in paragraph (a) of this section.

        (c) The requirements of this section do not apply to gathering lines.

        § 195.418   Valves: Onshore valve shut-off for rupture mitigation.

#### § § 195.418

        (a)  For newly constructed and entirely replaced onshore hazardous liquid or carbon dioxide pipeline segments, as defined at § 195.2, with diameters of 6 inches or greater that could affect high-consequence areas or are located in high consequence areas (HCA), and that have been installed after April 10, 2023, an operator must install or use existing rupture-mitigation valves (RMV), as defined at § 195.2, or alternative equivalent technologies according to the requirements of this section and § 195.419. RMVs and alternative equivalent technologies must be operational within 14 days of placing the new or replaced pipeline segment in service. An operator may request an extension of this 14-day operation requirement if it can demonstrate to PHMSA, in accordance with the notification procedures in § 195.18, that application of that requirement would be economically, technically, or operationally infeasible. The requirements of this section apply to all applicable pipe replacements, even those that do not otherwise directly involve the addition or replacement of a valve.

        (b)  RMVs and alternative equivalent technology must be installed in accordance with the following requirements:

        (1)  For purposes of this section, a “shut-off segment” means the segment of pipeline located between the upstream valve closest to the upstream endpoint of the replaced pipeline segment in the HCA or the pipeline segment that could affect an HCA and the downstream valve closest to the downstream endpoint of the replaced pipeline segment of the HCA or the pipeline segment that could affect an HCA so that the entirety of the segment that could affect the HCA or the segment within the HCA is between at least two RMVs or alternative equivalent technologies. If any crossover or lateral pipe for commodity receipts or deliveries connects to the replaced segment between the upstream and downstream valves, the shut-off segment also extends to a valve on the crossover connection(s) or lateral(s), such that, when all valves are closed, there is no flow path for commodity to be transported to the rupture site (except for residual liquids already in the shut-off segment). Multiple segments that could affect HCAs or are in HCAs may be contained within a single shut-off segment. All entirely replaced onshore hazardous liquid or carbon dioxide pipeline segments, as defined in § 195.2, that could affect or are in an HCA must include a minimum of one valve that meets the requirements of this section and section 195.419. The operator is not required to select the closest valve to the shut-off segment as the RMV or alternative equivalent technology. An operator may use a manual pump station valve at a continuously manned station as an alternative equivalent technology. Such a manual valve used as an alternative equivalent technology would not require a notification to PHMSA in accordance with § 195.18.

        (2)  Pipeline segments subject to paragraph (a) of this section must be protected on the upstream and downstream side with RMVs or alternative equivalent technologies. The distance between RMVs or alternative equivalent technologies must not exceed:

        (i) For pipeline segments carrying non-highly volatile liquids (HVL): 15 miles, with a maximum distance not to exceed 7  miles from the endpoints of a shut-off segment: or

        (ii) For pipeline segments carrying HVLs: 7  miles. The maximum valve spacing intervals for these valves may be increased by 1.25 times the spacing distance, up to a 9 -mile spacing at an endpoint, provided the operator notify PHMSA in accordance with § 195.260 (g).

        (3)  Laterals extending from shut-off segments that contribute less than 5 percent of the total shut-off segment volume may have RMVs or alternative equivalent technologies that meet the actuation requirements of this section at locations other than mainline receipt/delivery points, as long as all of these laterals contributing hazardous liquid or carbon dioxide volumes to the shut-off segment do not contribute more than 5 percent of the total shut-off segment volume, based upon maximum flow volume at the operating pressure. A check valve may be used as an alternative equivalent technology where it is positioned to stop flow into the lateral. Check valves used as an alternative equivalent technology in accordance with this paragraph (b)(3) are not subject to § 195.419 but must be inspected, operated, and remediated in accordance with § 195.420, including for closure and leakage, to ensure operational reliability. An operator using such a valve as an alternative equivalent technology must submit a request to PHMSA in accordance with § 195.18.

        (4)  An operator may use a manual valve as an alternative equivalent technology for a crossover connection if, during normal operations, the valve is closed to prevent the flow of hazardous liquid or carbon dioxide with a locking device or other means designed to prevent the opening of the valve by persons other than those authorized by the operator. The operator must document that the valve has been closed and locked in accordance with the operator's lock-out and tag-out procedures to prevent the flow of hazardous liquid or carbon dioxide. An operator using a such a valve as an alternative equivalent technology must submit a request to PHMSA in accordance with § 195.18.

        (c)  Operators using a manual valve as an alternative equivalent technology pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section must develop and implement operating procedures and appropriately designate and locate nearby personnel to ensure valve shut-off in accordance with this section and § 195.419. Manual operation of valves must include time for the assembly of necessary operating personnel, the acquisition of necessary tools and equipment, driving time under heavy traffic conditions and at the posted speed limit, walking time to access the valve, and time to manually shut off all valves, not to exceed the response time in § 195.419(b).

        (d)  The requirements of this section do not apply to gathering lines.

        § 195.419   Valve capabilities.

#### § § 195.419

        (a)  The requirements in this section apply to rupture-mitigation valves (RMV), as defined in § 195.2, or alternative equivalent technology, installed pursuant to §§ 195.258 and 195.418.

        (b)  If an operator observes or is notified of a release of hazardous liquid or carbon dioxide that may be representative of an unintentional or uncontrolled release event meeting a notification of potential rupture ( §§ 195.2 and 195.417), including any unexplained flow rate changes, pressure changes, equipment functions, or other pipeline instrumentation indications observed by the operator, the operator must, as soon as practicable but within 30 minutes of rupture identification ( § 195.402(e)(4)), identify the rupture and fully close any RMVs or alternative equivalent technologies necessary to minimize the volume of hazardous liquid or carbon dioxide released from a pipeline and mitigate the consequences of a rupture.

        (c)  A valve must have the actuation capability necessary to close an RMV or alternative equivalent technology to mitigate the consequences of a rupture in accordance with the requirements of this section.

        (d)  An RMV, as defined in § 195.2, or alternative equivalent technology, must be capable of being monitored or controlled by either remote or onsite personnel as follows:

        (1) Operated during normal, abnormal, and emergency operating conditions;

        (2) Monitored for valve status ( open, closed, or partial closed/open), upstream pressure, and downstream pressure. For automatic shut-off valves (ASV), an operator does not need to monitor remotely a valve's status if the operator has the capability to monitor pressures or flow rate within each pipeline segment located between RMVs or alternative equivalent technologies to identify and locate a rupture. Pipeline segments that use an alternative equivalent technology must have the capability to monitor pressures and hazardous liquid or carbon dioxide flow rates on the pipeline in order to identify and locate a rupture; and

        (3) Have a back-up power source to maintain supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems or other remote communications for remote-control valve (RCV) or ASV operational status or be monitored and controlled by on-site personnel.

        (e)  The position and operational status of an RMV must be appropriately monitored through electronic communication with remote instrumentation or other equivalent means. An operator does not need to monitor remotely an ASV's status if the operator has the capability to monitor pressures or hazardous liquid or carbon dioxide s flow rate on the pipeline to identify and locate a rupture.

        (f)  Prior to using an ASV as an RMV, the operator must conduct flow modeling for the shut-off segment and any laterals that feed the shut-off segment, so that the valve will close within 30 minutes or less following rupture identification, consistent with the operator's procedures, and in accordance with § 195.2 and this section. The flow modeling must include the anticipated maximum, normal, or any other flow volumes, pressures, or other operating conditions that may be encountered during the year, not to exceed a period of 15 months, and it must be modeled for the flow between the RMVs or alternative equivalent technologies, and any looped pipelines or hazardous liquid or carbon dioxide receipt tie-ins. If operating conditions change that could affect the ASV set pressures and the 30-minute valve closure time following a notification of potential rupture, as defined at § 195.2, an operator must conduct a new flow model and reset the ASV set pressures prior to the next review for ASV set pressures in accordance with § 195.420. The flow model must include a time/pressure chart for the segment containing the ASV if a rupture event occurs. An operator must conduct this flow modeling prior to making flow condition changes in a manner that could render the 30-minute valve closure time unachievable.

        (g)  For pipeline segments that are not in a high-consequence area (HCA) or that could not affect an HCA, an operator submitting a notification pursuant to §§ 195.18 and 195.258 for use of manual valves as an alternative equivalent technology may also request an exemption from the valve operation requirements of § 195.419(b).

        (h)  The requirements of this section do not apply to gathering lines.

        § 195.420   Valve maintenance.

#### § § 195.420

        (a) Each operator shall maintain each valve that is necessary for the safe operation of its pipeline systems in good working order at all times.

        (b) Each operator must, at least twice each calendar year, but at intervals not exceeding 7  months, inspect each mainline valve to determine that it is functioning properly. Each rupture-mitigation valve (RMV), as defined in § 195.2 and not contained in a gathering line, or alternative equivalent technology that is installed under § 195.258(c) or § 195.418, must also be partially operated. Operators are not required to close the valve fully during the inspection; a minimum 25 percent valve closure is sufficient to demonstrate compliance, unless the operator has operational information that requires an additional closure percentage for maintaining reliability.

        (c) Each operator shall provide protection for each valve from unauthorized operation and from vandalism.

        (d) For each remote-control valve (RCV) installed in accordance with § 195.258(c) or § 195.418, an operator must conduct a point-to-point verification between SCADA system displays and the installed valves, sensors, and communications equipment, in accordance with § 195.446(c) and (e).

        (e) For each alternative equivalent technology installed under § 195.258(c) or (d) or § 195.418(a) that is manually or locally operated ( not an RMV, as that term is defined in § 195.2):

        (1) Operators must achieve a response time of 30 minutes or less, as required by § 195.419(b), through an initial drill and through periodic validation as required by paragraph (e)(2) of this section. An operator must review each phase of the drill response and document the results to validate the total response time, including the identification of a rupture, and valve shut-off time as being less than or equal to 30 minutes after rupture identification.

        (2) Within each pipeline system, and within each operating or maintenance field work unit, operators must randomly select an authorized rupture-mitigation alternative equivalent technology for an annual 30-minute-total response time validation drill simulating worst-case conditions for that location to ensure compliance with § 195.419. Operators are not required to close the alternative equivalent technology fully during the drill; a minimum 25 percent valve closure is sufficient to demonstrate compliance with the drill requirements unless the operator has operational information that requires an additional closure percentage for maintaining reliability. The response drill must occur at least once each calendar year, at intervals not to exceed 15 months. Operators must include in their written procedures the method they use to randomly select which alternative equivalent technology is tested in accordance with this paragraph.

        (3) If the 30-minute-maximum response time cannot be achieved in the drill, the operator must revise response efforts to achieve compliance with § 195.419 no later than 12 months after the drill. Alternative valve shut-off measures must be in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section within 7 days of the drill.

        (4) Based on the results of the response-time drills, the operator must include lessons learned in:

        (i) Training and qualifications programs;

        (ii) Design, construction, testing, maintenance, operating, and emergency procedures manuals; and

        (iii) Any other areas identified by the operator as needing improvement.

        (f) Each operator must implement remedial measures as follows to correct any valve installed on an onshore pipeline in accordance with § 195.258(c), or an RMV or alternative equivalent technology installed in accordance with § 195.418, that is indicated to be inoperable or unable to maintain effective shut-off:

        (1) Repair or replace the valve as soon as practicable but no later than 12 months after finding that the valve is inoperable or unable to maintain shut-off. An operator may request an extension of the compliance deadline requirements of this section if it can demonstrate to PHMSA, in accordance with the notification procedures in § 195.18, that repairing or replacing a valve within 12 months would be economically, technically, or operationally infeasible; and

        (2) Designate an alternative compliant valve within 7 calendar days of the finding while repairs are being made and document an interim response plan to maintain safety. Alternative compliant valves are not required to comply with valve spacing requirements of this part.

        (g) An operator using an ASV as an RMV, in accordance with §§ 195.2, 195.260, 195.418, and 195.419, must document, in accordance with § 195.419(f), and confirm the ASV shut-in pressures on a calendar year basis not to exceed 15 months. ASV shut-in set pressures must be proven and reset individually at each ASV, as required by § 195.419(f), at least each calendar year, but at intervals not to exceed 15 months.

        (h) The requirements of paragraphs (d) through (g) of this section do not apply to gathering lines.

        (b) No operator may move any pipeline containing highly volatile liquids where materials in the line section involved are joined by welding unless—

        (1) Movement when the pipeline does not contain highly volatile liquids is impractical;

        (2) The procedures of the operator under § 195.402 contain precautions to protect the public against the hazard in moving pipelines containing highly volatile liquids, including the use of warnings, where necessary, to evacuate the area close to the pipeline; and

        (3) The pressure in that line section is reduced to the lower of the following:

        (i) Fifty percent or less of the maximum operating pressure; or

        (ii) The lowest practical level that will maintain the highly volatile liquid in a liquid state with continuous flow, but not less than 50  p.s.i. (345 kPa) gage above the vapor pressure of the commodity.

        (c) No operator may move any pipeline containing highly volatile liquids where materials in the line section involved are not joined by welding unless—

        (1) The operator complies with paragraphs (b) (1) and (2) of this section; and

        (2) That line section is isolated to prevent the flow of highly volatile liquid.

#### § § 195.428

        (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, each operator shall, at intervals not exceeding 15 months, but at least once each calendar year, or in the case of pipelines used to carry highly volatile liquids, at intervals not to exceed 7  months, but at least twice each calendar year, inspect and test each pressure limiting device, relief valve, pressure regulator, or other item of pressure control equipment to determine that it is functioning properly, is in good mechanical condition, and is adequate from the standpoint of capacity and reliability of operation for the service in which it is used.

        (b) In the case of relief valves on pressure breakout tanks containing highly volatile liquids, each operator shall test each valve at intervals not exceeding 5 years.

        (c) Aboveground breakout tanks that are constructed or significantly altered according to API Std 2510 (incorporated by reference,  § 195.3) after October 2, 2000, must have an overfill protection system installed according to API Std 2510, section 7.1.2. Other aboveground breakout tanks with 600 gallons (2271 liters) or more of storage capacity that are constructed or significantly altered after October 2, 2000, must have an overfill protection system installed according to API Std 2350 (incorporated by reference,  § 195.3). However, an operator need not comply with any part of API Std 2350 for a particular breakout tank if the operator describes in the manual required by § 195.402 why compliance with that part is not necessary for safety of the tank.

        (d) After October 2, 2000, the requirements of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section for inspection and testing of pressure control equipment apply to the inspection and testing of overfill protection systems.

        § 195.442   Damage prevention program.

#### § § 195.442

        (a) Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, each operator of a buried pipeline must carry out, in accordance with this section, a written program to prevent damage to that pipeline from excavation activities. For the purpose of this section, the term “excavation activities” includes excavation, blasting, boring, tunneling, backfilling, the removal of aboveground structures by either explosive or mechanical means, and other earthmoving operations.

        (b) An operator may comply with any of the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section through participation in a public service program, such as a one-call system, but such participation does not relieve the operator of the responsibility for compliance with this section. However, an operator must perform the duties of paragraph (c)(3) of this section through participation in a one-call system, if that one-call system is a qualified one-call system. In areas that are covered by more than one qualified one-call system, an operator need only join one of the qualified one-call systems if there is a central telephone number for excavators to call for excavation activities, or if the one-call systems in those areas communicate with one another. An operator's pipeline system must be covered by a qualified one-call system where there is one in place. For the purpose of this section, a one-call system is considered a “qualified one-call system” if it meets the requirements of section (b)(1) or (b)(2) or this section.

        (1) The state has adopted a one-call damage prevention program under § 198.37 of this chapter; or

        (2) The one-call system:

        (i) Is operated in accordance with § 198.39 of this chapter;

        (ii) Provides a pipeline operator an opportunity similar to a voluntary participant to have a part in management responsibilities; and

        (iii) Assesses a participating pipeline operator a fee that is proportionate to the costs of the one-call system's coverage of the operator's pipeline.

        (c) The damage prevention program required by paragraph (a) of this section must, at a minimum:

        (1) Include the identity, on a current basis, of persons who normally engage in excavation activities in the area in which the pipeline is located.

        (2) Provides for notification of the public in the vicinity of the pipeline and actual notification of persons identified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section of the following as often as needed to make them aware of the damage prevention program:

        (i) The program's existence and purpose; and

        (ii) How to learn the location of underground pipelines before excavation activities are begun.

        (3) Provide a means of receiving and recording notification of planned excavation activities.

        (4) If the operator has buried pipelines in the area of excavation activity, provide for actual notification of persons who give notice of their intent to excavate of the type of temporary marking to be provided and how to identify the markings.

        (5) Provide for temporary marking of buried pipelines in the area of excavation activity before, as far as practical, the activity begins.

        (6) Provide as follows for inspection of pipelines that an operator has reason to believe could be damaged by excavation activities:

        (i) The inspection must be done as frequently as necessary during and after the activities to verify the integrity of the pipeline; and

        (ii) In the case of blasting, any inspection must include leakage surveys.

        (d) A damage prevention program under this section is not required for the following pipelines:

        (1) Pipelines located offshore.

        (2) Pipelines to which access is physically controlled by the operator.

        § 195.444   Leak detection.

#### § § 195.444

        (a)  Except for offshore gathering and regulated rural gathering pipelines, this section applies to all hazardous liquid pipelines transporting liquid in single phase (without gas in the liquid).

        (b)  A pipeline must have an effective system for detecting leaks in accordance with §§ 195.134 or 195.452, as appropriate. An operator must evaluate the capability of its leak detection system to protect the public, property, and the environment and modify it as necessary to do so. At a minimum, an operator's evaluation must consider the following factors—length and size of the pipeline, type of product carried, the swiftness of leak detection, location of nearest response personnel, and leak history.

        (c)  Each computational pipeline monitoring (CPM) leak detection system installed on a hazardous liquid pipeline must comply with API RP 1130 (incorporated by reference, see § 195.3) in operating, maintaining, testing, record keeping, and dispatcher training of the system.

        § 195.446   Control room management.

#### § § 195.446

        (a)  This section applies to each operator of a pipeline facility with a controller working in a control room who monitors and controls all or part of a pipeline facility through a SCADA system. Each operator must have and follow written control room management procedures that implement the requirements of this section. The procedures required by this section must be integrated, as appropriate, with the operator's written procedures required by § 195.402. An operator must develop the procedures no later than August 1, 2011, and must implement the procedures according to the following schedule. The procedures required by paragraphs (b), (c)(5), (d)(2) and (d)(3), (f) and (g) of this section must be implemented no later than October 1, 2011. The procedures required by paragraphs (c)(1) through (4), (d)(1), (d)(4), and (e) must be implemented no later than August 1, 2012. The training procedures required by paragraph (h) must be implemented no later than August 1, 2012, except that any training required by another paragraph of this section must be implemented no later than the deadline for that paragraph.

        (b)  Each operator must define the roles and responsibilities of a controller during normal, abnormal, and emergency operating conditions. To provide for a controller's prompt and appropriate response to operating conditions, an operator must define each of the following:

        (1) A controller's authority and responsibility to make decisions and take actions during normal operations;

        (2) A controller's role when an abnormal operating condition is detected, even if the controller is not the first to detect the condition, including the controller's responsibility to take specific actions and to communicate with others;

        (3) A controller's role during an emergency, even if the controller is not the first to detect the emergency, including the controller's responsibility to take specific actions and to communicate with others;

        (4) A method of recording controller shift-changes and any hand-over of responsibility between controllers; and

        (5) The roles, responsibilities and qualifications of others who have the authority to direct or supersede the specific technical actions of controllers.

        (c)  Each operator must provide its controllers with the information, tools, processes and procedures necessary for the controllers to carry out the roles and responsibilities the operator has defined by performing each of the following:

        (1) Implement API RP 1165 (incorporated by reference,  § 195.3) whenever a SCADA system is added, expanded or replaced, unless the operator demonstrates that certain provisions of API RP 1165 are not practical for the SCADA system used;

        (2) Conduct a point-to-point verification between SCADA displays and related field equipment when field equipment is added or moved and when other changes that affect pipeline safety are made to field equipment or SCADA displays;

        (3) Test and verify an internal communication plan to provide adequate means for manual operation of the pipeline safely, at least once each calendar year, but at intervals not to exceed 15 months;

        (4) Test any backup SCADA systems at least once each calendar year, but at intervals not to exceed 15 months; and

        (5) Implement section 5 of API RP 1168 (incorporated by reference,  § 195.3) to establish procedures for when a different controller assumes responsibility, including the content of information to be exchanged.

        (d)  Each operator must implement the following methods to reduce the risk associated with controller fatigue that could inhibit a controller's ability to carry out the roles and responsibilities the operator has defined:

        (1) Establish shift lengths and schedule rotations that provide controllers off-duty time sufficient to achieve eight hours of continuous sleep;

        (2) Educate controllers and supervisors in fatigue mitigation strategies and how off-duty activities contribute to fatigue;

        (3) Train controllers and supervisors to recognize the effects of fatigue; and

        (4) Establish a maximum limit on controller hours-of-service, which may provide for an emergency deviation from the maximum limit if necessary for the safe operation of a pipeline facility.

        (e)  Each operator using a SCADA system must have a written alarm management plan to provide for effective controller response to alarms. An operator's plan must include provisions to:

        (1) Review SCADA safety-related alarm operations using a process that ensures alarms are accurate and support safe pipeline operations;

        (2) Identify at least once each calendar month points affecting safety that have been taken off scan in the SCADA host, have had alarms inhibited, generated false alarms, or that have had forced or manual values for periods of time exceeding that required for associated maintenance or operating activities;

        (3) Verify the correct safety-related alarm set-point values and alarm descriptions when associated field instruments are calibrated or changed and at least once each calendar year, but at intervals not to exceed 15 months;

        (4) Review the alarm management plan required by this paragraph at least once each calendar year, but at intervals not exceeding 15 months, to determine the effectiveness of the plan;

        (5) Monitor the content and volume of general activity being directed to and required of each controller at least once each calendar year, but at intervals not exceeding 15 months, that will assure controllers have sufficient time to analyze and react to incoming alarms; and

        (6) Address deficiencies identified through the implementation of paragraphs (e)(1) through (e)(5) of this section.

        (f)  Each operator must assure that changes that could affect control room operations are coordinated with the control room personnel by performing each of the following:

        (1) Implement section 7 of API RP 1168 (incorporated by reference, see § 195.3) for control room management change and require coordination between control room representatives, operator's management, and associated field personnel when planning and implementing physical changes to pipeline equipment or configuration; and

        (2) Require its field personnel to contact the control room when emergency conditions exist and when making field changes that affect control room operations.

        (g)  Each operator must assure that lessons learned from its operating experience are incorporated, as appropriate, into its control room management procedures by performing each of the following:

        (1) Review accidents that must be reported pursuant to § 195.50 and 195.52 to determine if control room actions contributed to the event and, if so, correct, where necessary, deficiencies related to:

        (i) Controller fatigue;

        (ii) Field equipment;

        (iii) The operation of any relief device;

        (iv) Procedures;

        (v) SCADA system configuration; and

        (vi) SCADA system performance.

        (2) Include lessons learned from the operator's experience in the training program required by this section.

        (h)  Each operator must establish a controller training program and review the training program content to identify potential improvements at least once each calendar year, but at intervals not to exceed 15 months. An operator's program must provide for training each controller to carry out the roles and responsibilities defined by the operator. In addition, the training program must include the following elements:

        (1) Responding to abnormal operating conditions likely to occur simultaneously or in sequence;

        (2) Use of a computerized simulator or non-computerized (tabletop) method for training controllers to recognize abnormal operating conditions;

        (3) Training controllers on their responsibilities for communication under the operator's emergency response procedures;

        (4) Training that will provide a controller a working knowledge of the pipeline system, especially during the development of abnormal operating conditions;

        (5) For pipeline operating setups that are periodically, but infrequently used, providing an opportunity for controllers to review relevant procedures in advance of their application; and

        (6) Control room team training and exercises that include both controllers and other individuals, defined by the operator, who would reasonably be expected to operationally collaborate with controllers (control room personnel) during normal, abnormal or emergency situations. Operators must comply with the team training requirements under this paragraph no later than January 23, 2018.

        (i)  Upon request, operators must submit their procedures to PHMSA or, in the case of an intrastate pipeline facility regulated by a State, to the appropriate State agency.

        (j)  An operator must maintain for review during inspection:

        (1) Records that demonstrate compliance with the requirements of this section; and

        (2) Documentation to demonstrate that any deviation from the procedures required by this section was necessary for the safe operation of the pipeline facility.

        § 195.567   Which pipelines must have test leads and what must I do to install and maintain the leads?

#### § § 195.567

        (a)  Except for offshore pipelines, each buried or submerged pipeline or segment of pipeline under cathodic protection required by this subpart must have electrical test leads for external corrosion control. However, this requirement does not apply until December 27, 2004 to pipelines or pipeline segments on which test leads were not required by regulations in effect before January 28, 2002.

        (b)  You must install test leads as follows:

        (1) Locate the leads at intervals frequent enough to obtain electrical measurements indicating the adequacy of cathodic protection.

        (2) Provide enough looping or slack so backfilling will not unduly stress or break the lead and the lead will otherwise remain mechanically secure and electrically conductive.

        (3) Prevent lead attachments from causing stress concentrations on pipe.

        (4) For leads installed in conduits, suitably insulate the lead from the conduit.

        (5) At the connection to the pipeline, coat each bared test lead wire and bared metallic area with an electrical insulating material compatible with the pipe coating and the insulation on the wire.

        (c)  You must maintain the test lead wires in a condition that enables you to obtain electrical measurements to determine whether cathodic protection complies with § 195.571.

        § 195.569   Do I have to examine exposed portions of buried pipelines?

#### § § 195.569

        Whenever you have knowledge that any portion of a buried pipeline is exposed, you must examine the exposed portion for evidence of external corrosion if the pipe is bare, or if the coating is deteriorated. If you find external corrosion requiring corrective action under § 195.585, you must investigate circumferentially and longitudinally beyond the exposed portion (by visual examination, indirect method, or both) to determine whether additional corrosion requiring remedial action exists in the vicinity of the exposed portion.

        § 195.571   What criteria must I use to determine the adequacy of cathodic protection?

#### § § 195.571

        Cathodic protection required by this subpart must comply with one or more of the applicable criteria and other considerations for cathodic protection contained paragraphs 6.2.2, 6.2.3, 6.2.4, 6.2.5 and 6.3 in NACE SP 0169 (incorporated by reference,  § 195.3).

        § 195.573   What must I do to monitor external corrosion control?

#### § § 195.573

        (a)  You must do the following to determine whether cathodic protection required by this subpart complies with § 195.571:

        (1) Conduct tests on the protected pipeline at least once each calendar year, but with intervals not exceeding 15 months. However, if tests at those intervals are impractical for separately protected short sections of bare or ineffectively coated pipelines, testing may be done at least once every 3 calendar years, but with intervals not exceeding 39 months.

        (2) Identify not more than 2 years after cathodic protection is installed, the circumstances in which a close-interval survey or comparable technology is practicable and necessary to accomplish the objectives of paragraph 10.1.1.3 of NACE SP 0169 (incorporated by reference,  § 195.3).

        (b)  You must reevaluate your unprotected buried or submerged pipe and cathodically protect the pipe in areas in which active corrosion is found, as follows:

        (1) Determine the areas of active corrosion by electrical survey, or where an electrical survey is impractical, by other means that include review and analysis of leak repair and inspection records, corrosion monitoring records, exposed pipe inspection records, and the pipeline environment.

        (2) For the period in the first column, the second column prescribes the frequency of evaluation.

        (c)  You must electrically check for proper performance each device in the first column at the frequency stated in the second column.

        (d)  You must inspect each cathodic protection system used to control corrosion on the bottom of an aboveground breakout tank to ensure that operation and maintenance of the system are in accordance with API RP 651 (incorporated by reference,  § 195.3). However, this inspection is not required if you note in the corrosion control procedures established under § 195.402(c)(3) why complying with all or certain operation and maintenance provisions of API RP 651 is not necessary for the safety of the tank.

        (e)  You must correct any identified deficiency in corrosion control as required by § 195.401(b). However, if the deficiency involves a pipeline in an integrity management program under § 195.452, you must correct the deficiency as required by § 195.452(h).

        § 195.575   Which facilities must I electrically isolate and what inspections, tests, and safeguards are required?

#### § § 195.575

        (a) You must electrically isolate each buried or submerged pipeline from other metallic structures, unless you electrically interconnect and cathodically protect the pipeline and the other structures as a single unit.

        (b) You must install one or more insulating devices where electrical isolation of a portion of a pipeline is necessary to facilitate the application of corrosion control.

        (c) You must inspect and electrically test each electrical isolation to assure the isolation is adequate.

        (d) If you install an insulating device in an area where a combustible atmosphere is reasonable to foresee, you must take precautions to prevent arcing.

        (e) If a pipeline is in close proximity to electrical transmission tower footings, ground cables, or counterpoise, or in other areas where it is reasonable to foresee fault currents or an unusual risk of lightning, you must protect the pipeline against damage from fault currents or lightning and take protective measures at insulating devices.

        § 195.577   What must I do to alleviate interference currents?

#### § § 195.577

        (a) For pipelines exposed to stray currents, you must have a program to identify, test for, and minimize the detrimental effects of such currents.

        (b) You must design and install each impressed current or galvanic anode system to minimize any adverse effects on existing adjacent metallic structures.

        § 195.579   What must I do to mitigate internal corrosion?

#### § § 195.579

        (a)  If you transport any hazardous liquid or carbon dioxide that would corrode the pipeline, you must investigate the corrosive effect of the hazardous liquid or carbon dioxide on the pipeline and take adequate steps to mitigate internal corrosion.

        (b)  If you use corrosion inhibitors to mitigate internal corrosion, you must—

        (1) Use inhibitors in sufficient quantity to protect the entire part of the pipeline system that the inhibitors are designed to protect;

        (2) Use coupons or other monitoring equipment to determine the effectiveness of the inhibitors in mitigating internal corrosion; and

        (3) Examine the coupons or other monitoring equipment at least twice each calendar year, but with intervals not exceeding 7  months.

        (c)  Whenever you remove pipe from a pipeline, you must inspect the internal surface of the pipe for evidence of corrosion. If you find internal corrosion requiring corrective action under § 195.585, you must investigate circumferentially and longitudinally beyond the removed pipe (by visual examination, indirect method, or both) to determine whether additional corrosion requiring remedial action exists in the vicinity of the removed pipe.

        (d)  After October 2, 2000, when you install a tank bottom lining in an aboveground breakout tank built to API Spec 12F (incorporated by reference,  § 195.3), API Std 620 (incorporated by reference,  § 195.3), API Std 650 (incorporated by reference,  § 195.3), or API Std 650's predecessor, Standard 12C, you must install the lining in accordance with API RP 652 (incorporated by reference,  § 195.3). However, you don't need to comply with API RP 652 when installing any tank for which you note in the corrosion control procedures established under § 195.402(c)(3) why compliance with all or certain provisions of API RP 652 is not necessary for the safety of the tank.

        § 195.581   Which pipelines must I protect against atmospheric corrosion and what coating material may I use?

#### § § 195.581

        (a) You must clean and coat each pipeline or portion of pipeline that is exposed to the atmosphere, except pipelines under paragraph (c) of this section.

        (b) Coating material must be suitable for the prevention of atmospheric corrosion.

        (c) Except portions of pipelines in offshore splash zones or soil-to-air interfaces, you need not protect against atmospheric corrosion any pipeline for which you demonstrate by test, investigation, or experience appropriate to the environment of the pipeline that corrosion will—

        (1) Only be a light surface oxide; or

        (2) Not affect the safe operation of the pipeline before the next scheduled inspection.

        § 195.583   What must I do to monitor atmospheric corrosion control?

#### § § 195.583

        (c) If you find atmospheric corrosion during an inspection, you must provide protection against the corrosion as required by § 195.581.

        § 195.585   What must I do to correct corroded pipe?

#### § § 195.585

        (a)  If you find pipe so generally corroded that the remaining wall thickness is less than that required for the maximum operating pressure of the pipeline, you must replace the pipe. However, you need not replace the pipe if you—

        (1) Reduce the maximum operating pressure commensurate with the strength of the pipe needed for serviceability based on actual remaining wall thickness; or

        (2) Repair the pipe by a method that reliable engineering tests and analyses show can permanently restore the serviceability of the pipe.

        (b)  If you find pipe that has localized corrosion pitting to a degree that leakage might result, you must replace or repair the pipe, unless you reduce the maximum operating pressure commensurate with the strength of the pipe based on actual remaining wall thickness in the pits.

        § 195.587   What methods are available to determine the strength of corroded pipe?

#### § § 195.587

        Under § 195.585, you may use the procedure in ASME/ANSI B31G (incorporated by reference,  § 195.3) or in PRCI PR-3-805 (R-STRENG) (incorporated by reference,  § 195.3) to determine the strength of corroded pipe based on actual remaining wall thickness.

        § 195.588   What standards apply to direct assessment?

#### § § 195.588

        (a) If you use direct assessment on an onshore pipeline to evaluate the effects of external corrosion or stress corrosion cracking, you must follow the requirements of this section. This section does not apply to methods associated with direct assessment, such as close interval surveys, voltage gradient surveys, or examination of exposed pipelines, when used separately from the direct assessment process.

        (b) The requirements for performing external corrosion direct assessment are as follows:

        (1)  You must follow the requirements of NACE SP0502 (incorporated by reference,  § 195.3). Also, you must develop and implement a External Corrosion Direct Assessment (ECDA) plan that includes procedures addressing pre-assessment, indirect examination, direct examination, and post-assessment.

        (2)  In addition to the requirements in Section 3 of NACE SP0502 (incorporated by reference,  § 195.3), the ECDA plan procedures for pre-assessment must include—

        (i) Provisions for applying more restrictive criteria when conducting ECDA for the first time on a pipeline segment;

        (ii) The basis on which you select at least two different, but complementary, indirect assessment tools to assess each ECDA region; and

        (iii) If you utilize an indirect inspection method not described in Appendix A of NACE SP0502 (incorporated by reference,  § 195.3), you must demonstrate the applicability, validation basis, equipment used, application procedure, and utilization of data for the inspection method.

        (3)  In addition to the requirements in Section 4 of NACE SP0502 (incorporated by reference,  § 195.3), the procedures for indirect examination of the ECDA regions must include—

        (i) Provisions for applying more restrictive criteria when conducting ECDA for the first time on a pipeline segment;

        (ii) Criteria for identifying and documenting those indications that must be considered for excavation and direct examination, including at least the following:

        (A) The known sensitivities of assessment tools;

        (B) The procedures for using each tool; and

        (C) The approach to be used for decreasing the physical spacing of indirect assessment tool readings when the presence of a defect is suspected;

        (iii) For each indication identified during the indirect examination, criteria for—

        (A) Defining the urgency of excavation and direct examination of the indication; and

        (B) Defining the excavation urgency as immediate, scheduled, or monitored; and

        (iv) Criteria for scheduling excavations of indications in each urgency level.

        (4)  In addition to the requirements in Section 5 of NACE SP0502 (incorporated by reference,  § 195.3), the procedures for direct examination of indications from the indirect examination must include—

        (i) Provisions for applying more restrictive criteria when conducting ECDA for the first time on a pipeline segment;

        (ii) Criteria for deciding what action should be taken if either:

        (A) Corrosion defects are discovered that exceed allowable limits (Section 5.5.2.2 of NACE SP0502 (incorporated by reference,  § 195.3) provides guidance for criteria); or

        (B) Root cause analysis reveals conditions for which ECDA is not suitable (Section 5.6.2 of NACE SP0502 (incorporated by reference,  § 195.3) provides guidance for criteria);

        (iii) Criteria and notification procedures for any changes in the ECDA plan, including changes that affect the severity classification, the priority of direct examination, and the time frame for direct examination of indications; and

        (iv) Criteria that describe how and on what basis you will reclassify and re-prioritize any of the provisions specified in Section 5.9 of NACE SP0502 (incorporated by reference,  § 195.3).

        (5)  In addition to the requirements in Section 6 of NACE SP 0502 (incorporated by reference,  § 195.3), the procedures for post assessment of the effectiveness of the ECDA process must include—

        (i) Measures for evaluating the long-term effectiveness of ECDA in addressing external corrosion in pipeline segments; and

        (ii) Criteria for evaluating whether conditions discovered by direct examination of indications in each ECDA region indicate a need for reassessment of the pipeline segment at an interval less than that specified in Sections 6.2 and 6.3 of NACE SP0502 ( appendix D of NACE SP0502) (incorporated by reference,  § 195.3).

        (c) If you use direct assessment on an onshore pipeline to evaluate the effects of stress corrosion cracking, you must develop and follow a Stress Corrosion Cracking Direct Assessment plan that meets all requirements and recommendations of NACE SP0204 (incorporated by reference,  § 195.3) and that implements all four steps of the Stress Corrosion Cracking Direct Assessment process including pre-assessment, indirect inspection, detailed examination and post-assessment. As specified in NACE SP0204, Section 1.1.7, Stress Corrosion Cracking Direct Assessment is complementary with other inspection methods such as in-line inspection or hydrostatic testing and is not necessarily an alternative or replacement for these methods in all instances. In addition, the plan must provide for—

        (1)  An operator's plan must provide for a systematic process to collect and evaluate data to identify whether the conditions for stress corrosion cracking are present and to prioritize the segments for assessment in accordance with NACE SP0204, Sections 3 and 4, and Table 1. This process must also include gathering and evaluating data related to SCC at all sites an operator excavates during the conduct of its pipeline operations (both within and outside covered segments) where the criteria in NACE SP0204 indicate the potential for Stress Corrosion Cracking Direct Assessment. This data gathering process must be conducted in accordance with NACE SP0204, Section 5.3, and must include, at a minimum, all data listed in NACE SP0204, Table 2. Further, an operator must analyze the following factors as part of this evaluation:

        (i) The effects of a carbonate-bicarbonate environment, including the implications of any factors that promote the production of a carbonate-bicarbonate environment such as soil temperature, moisture, factors that affect the rate of carbon dioxide generation, and/or cathodic protection.

        (ii) The effects of cyclic loading conditions on the susceptibility and propagation of SCC in both high-pH and near-neutral-pH environments.

        (iii) The effects of variations in applied cathodic protection such as overprotection, cathodic protection loss for extended periods, and high negative potentials.

        (iv) The effects of coatings that shield cathodic protection when disbonded from the pipe.

        (v) Other factors that affect the mechanistic properties associated with SCC including but not limited to operating pressures, high tensile residual stresses, and the presence of sulfides.

        (2)  In addition to the requirements and recommendations of NACE SP0204, Section 4, the plan's procedures for indirect inspection must include provisions for conducting at least two different, but complementary, indirect assessment electrical surveys, and the basis on the selections as the most appropriate for the pipeline segment based on the data gathering and integration step.

        (3)  In addition to the requirements and recommendations of NACE SP0204, Section 5, the plan's procedures for direct examination must provide for conducting a minimum of four direct examinations within the SCC segment at locations determined to be the most likely for SCC to occur.

        (4)  If any indication of SCC is discovered in a segment, an operator must mitigate the threat in accordance with one of the following applicable methods:

        (i) Non-significant SCC, as defined by NACE SP0204, may be mitigated by either hydrostatic testing in accordance with paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section, or by grinding out with verification by Non-Destructive Examination (NDE) methods that the SCC defect is removed and repairing the pipe. If grinding is used for repair, the remaining strength of the pipe at the repair location must be determined using ASME/ANSI B31G or RSTRENG (incorporated by reference,  § 195.3) and must be sufficient to meet the design requirements of subpart C of this part.

        (ii) Significant SCC must be mitigated using a hydrostatic testing program with a minimum test pressure between 100% up to 110% of the specified minimum yield strength for a 30-minute spike test immediately followed by a pressure test in accordance with subpart E of this part. The test pressure for the entire sequence must be continuously maintained for at least 8 hours, in accordance with subpart E of this part. Any test failures due to SCC must be repaired by replacement of the pipe segment, and the segment retested until the pipe passes the complete test without leakage. Pipe segments that have SCC present, but that pass the pressure test, may be repaired by grinding in accordance with paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section.

        (5)  In addition to the requirements and recommendations of NACE SP0204, sections 6.3, periodic reassessment, and 6.4, effectiveness of Stress Corrosion Cracking Direct Assessment, the plan's procedures for post assessment must include development of a reassessment plan based on the susceptibility of the operator's pipe to Stress Corrosion Cracking as well as on the behavior mechanism of identified cracking. Factors to be considered include, but are not limited to:

        (i) Evaluation of discovered crack clusters during the direct examination step in accordance with NACE SP0204, sections 5.3.5.7, 5.4, and 5.5;

        (ii) Conditions conducive to creation of the carbonate-bicarbonate environment;

        (iii) Conditions in the application (or loss) of cathodic protection that can create or exacerbate SCC;

        (iv) Operating temperature and pressure conditions;

        (v) Cyclic loading conditions;

        (vi) Conditions that influence crack initiation and growth rates;

        (vii) The effects of interacting crack clusters;

        (viii) The presence of sulfides; and

        (ix) Disbonded coatings that shield CP from the pipe.

        (2) Quality of state inspections, investigations, and enforcement/compliance actions;

        (3) Adequacy of state recordkeeping;

        (4) Extent of state safety regulatory jurisdiction over pipeline facilities;

        (5) Qualifications of state inspectors;

        (6) Number of state inspection person-days;

        (7) State adoption of applicable federal pipeline safety standards; and

        (8) Any other factor the Administrator deems necessary to measure performance.

        (d) Notwithstanding these performance factors, the Administrator may, in 1993 and subsequent years, continue funding any state at the 1991 level, provided its request is at the 1991 level or higher and appropriated funds are at the 1991 level or higher.

        (e) The Administrator notifies each state agency in writing of the specific performance factors to be used and the weights to be assigned to each factor at least 9 months prior to allocating funds. Prior to notification, PHMSA seeks state agency comments on any proposed changes to the allocation formula.

        (f) Grants are limited to the appropriated funds available. If total state agency requests for grants exceed the funds available, the Administrator prorates each state agency's allocation.

      Subpart D—State Damage Prevention Enforcement Programs

**Source:** Source: 80 FR 43868, July 23, 2015, unless otherwise noted.

        § 198.51   What is the purpose and scope of this subpart?

#### § § 198.51

        This subpart establishes standards for effective State damage prevention enforcement programs and prescribes the administrative procedures available to a State that elects to contest a notice of inadequacy.

        § 198.53   When and how will PHMSA evaluate State damage prevention enforcement programs?

#### § § 198.53

        PHMSA conducts annual program evaluations and certification reviews of State pipeline safety programs. PHMSA will also conduct annual reviews of State excavation damage prevention law enforcement programs. PHMSA will use the criteria described in § 198.55 as the basis for the enforcement program reviews, utilizing information obtained from any State agency or office with a role in the State's excavation damage prevention law enforcement program. If PHMSA finds a State's enforcement program inadequate, PHMSA may take immediate enforcement against excavators in that State. The State will have five years from the date of the finding to make program improvements that meet PHMSA's criteria for minimum adequacy. A State that fails to establish an adequate enforcement program in accordance with § 198.55 within five years of the finding of inadequacy may be subject to reduced grant funding established under 49 U.S.C. 60107. PHMSA will determine the amount of the reduction using the same process it uses to distribute the grant funding; PHMSA will factor the findings from the annual review of the excavation damage prevention enforcement program into the 49 U.S.C. 60107 grant funding distribution to State pipeline safety programs. The amount of the reduction in 49 U.S.C. 60107 grant funding will not exceed four percent (4%) of prior year funding (not cumulative). If a State fails to implement an adequate enforcement program within five years of a finding of inadequacy, the Governor of that State may petition the Administrator of PHMSA, in writing, for a temporary waiver of the penalty, provided the petition includes a clear plan of action and timeline for achieving program adequacy.

        § 198.55   What criteria will PHMSA use in evaluating the effectiveness of State damage prevention enforcement programs?

#### § § 198.55

        (a) PHMSA will use the following criteria to evaluate the effectiveness of a State excavation damage prevention enforcement program:

        (1) Does the State have the authority to enforce its State excavation damage prevention law using civil penalties and other appropriate sanctions for violations?

        (2) Has the State designated a State agency or other body as the authority responsible for enforcement of the State excavation damage prevention law?

        (3) Is the State assessing civil penalties and other appropriate sanctions for violations at levels sufficient to deter noncompliance and is the State making publicly available information that demonstrates the effectiveness of the State's enforcement program?

        (4) Does the enforcement authority (if one exists) have a reliable mechanism (e.g., mandatory reporting, complaint-driven reporting) for learning about excavation damage to underground facilities?

        (5) Does the State employ excavation damage investigation practices that are adequate to determine the responsible party or parties when excavation damage to underground facilities occurs?

        (6) At a minimum, do the State's excavation damage prevention requirements include the following:

        (i) Excavators may not engage in excavation activity without first using an available one-call notification system to establish the location of underground facilities in the excavation area.

        (ii) Excavators may not engage in excavation activity in disregard of the marked location of a pipeline facility as established by a pipeline operator.

        (iii) An excavator who causes damage to a pipeline facility:

        (A) Must report the damage to the operator of the facility at the earliest practical moment following discovery of the damage; and

        (B) If the damage results in the escape of any PHMSA regulated natural and other gas or hazardous liquid, must promptly report to other appropriate authorities by calling the 911 emergency telephone number or another emergency telephone number.

        (7) Does the State limit exemptions for excavators from its excavation damage prevention law? A State must provide to PHMSA a written justification for any exemptions for excavators from State damage prevention requirements. PHMSA will make the written justifications available to the public.

        (b) PHMSA may consider individual enforcement actions taken by a State in evaluating the effectiveness of a State's damage prevention enforcement program.

        § 198.57   What is the process PHMSA will use to notify a State that its damage prevention enforcement program appears to be inadequate?

#### § § 198.57

        PHMSA will issue a notice of inadequacy to the State in accordance with 49 CFR 190.5. The notice will state the basis for PHMSA's determination that the State's damage prevention enforcement program appears inadequate for purposes of this subpart and set forth the State's response options.

        § 198.59   How may a State respond to a notice of inadequacy?

#### § § 198.59

        A State receiving a notice of inadequacy will have 30 days from receipt of the notice to submit a written response to the PHMSA official who issued the notice. In its response, the State may include information and explanations concerning the alleged inadequacy or contest the allegation of inadequacy and request the notice be withdrawn.

        § 198.61   How is a State notified of PHMSA's final decision?

#### § § 198.61

        PHMSA will issue a final decision on whether the State's damage prevention enforcement program has been found inadequate in accordance with 49 CFR 190.5.

        § 198.63   How may a State with an inadequate damage prevention enforcement program seek reconsideration by PHMSA?

#### § § 198.63

        At any time following a finding of inadequacy, the State may petition PHMSA to reconsider such finding based on changed circumstances including improvements in the State's enforcement program. Upon receiving a petition, PHMSA will reconsider its finding of inadequacy promptly and will notify the State of its decision on reconsideration promptly but no later than the time of the next annual certification review.

        § 199.105   Drug tests required.

#### § § 199.105

        Each operator shall conduct the following drug tests for the presence of a prohibited drug:

        (a)  No operator may hire or contract for the use of any person as an employee unless that person passes a drug test or is covered by an anti-drug program that conforms to the requirements of this part.

        (b)  (1) As soon as possible but no later than 32 hours after an accident, an operator must drug test each surviving covered employee whose performance of a covered function either contributed to the accident or cannot be completely discounted as a contributing factor to the accident. An operator may decide not to test under this paragraph but such a decision must be based on specific information that the covered employee's performance had no role in the cause(s) or severity of the accident.

        (2) If a test required by this section is not administered within the 32 hours following the accident, the operator must prepare and maintain its decision stating the reasons why the test was not promptly administered. If a test required by paragraph (b)(1) of this section is not administered within 32 hours following the accident, the operator must cease attempts to administer a drug test and must state in the record the reasons for not administering the test.

        (c)  (1) Except as provided in paragraphs (c)(2) through (4) of this section, the minimum annual percentage rate for random drug testing shall be 50 percent of covered employees.

        (2) The Administrator's decision to increase or decrease the minimum annual percentage rate for random drug testing is based on the reported positive rate for the entire industry. All information used for this determination is drawn from the drug MIS reports required by this subpart. In order to ensure reliability of the data, the Administrator considers the quality and completeness of the reported data, may obtain additional information or reports from operators, and may make appropriate modifications in calculating the industry positive rate. Each year, the Administrator will publish in the  the minimum annual percentage rate for random drug testing of covered employees. The new minimum annual percentage rate for random drug testing will be applicable starting January 1 of the calendar year following publication.

        (3) When the minimum annual percentage rate for random drug testing is 50 percent, the Administrator may lower this rate to 25 percent of all covered employees if the Administrator determines that the data received under the reporting requirements of § 199.119 for two consecutive calendar years indicate that the reported positive rate is less than 1.0 percent.

        (4) When the minimum annual percentage rate for random drug testing is 25 percent, and the data received under the reporting requirements of § 199.119 for any calendar year indicate that the reported positive rate is equal to or greater than 1.0 percent, the Administrator will increase the minimum annual percentage rate for random drug testing to 50 percent of all covered employees.

        (5) The selection of employees for random drug testing shall be made by a scientifically valid method, such as a random number table or a computer-based random number generator that is matched with employees' Social Security numbers, payroll identification numbers, or other comparable identifying numbers. Under the selection process used, each covered employee shall have an equal chance of being tested each time selections are made.

        (6) The operator shall randomly select a sufficient number of covered employees for testing during each calendar year to equal an annual rate not less than the minimum annual percentage rate for random drug testing determined by the Administrator. If the operator conducts random drug testing through a consortium, the number of employees to be tested may be calculated for each individual operator or may be based on the total number of covered employees covered by the consortium who are subject to random drug testing at the same minimum annual percentage rate under this subpart or any DOT drug testing rule.

        (7) Each operator shall ensure that random drug tests conducted under this subpart are unannounced and that the dates for administering random tests are spread reasonably throughout the calendar year.

        (8) If a given covered employee is subject to random drug testing under the drug testing rules of more than one DOT agency for the same operator, the employee shall be subject to random drug testing at the percentage rate established for the calendar year by the DOT agency regulating more than 50 percent of the employee's function.

        (9) If an operator is required to conduct random drug testing under the drug testing rules of more than one DOT agency, the operator may—

        (i) Establish separate pools for random selection, with each pool containing the covered employees who are subject to testing at the same required rate; or

        (ii) Randomly select such employees for testing at the highest percentage rate established for the calendar year by any DOT agency to which the operator is subject.

        (d)  Each operator shall drug test each employee when there is reasonable cause to believe the employee is using a prohibited drug. The decision to test must be based on a reasonable and articulable belief that the employee is using a prohibited drug on the basis of specific, contemporaneous physical, behavioral, or performance indicators of probable drug use. At least two of the employee's supervisors, one of whom is trained in detection of the possible symptoms of drug use, shall substantiate and concur in the decision to test an employee. The concurrence between the two supervisors may be by telephone. However, in the case of operators with 50 or fewer employees subject to testing under this part, only one supervisor of the employee trained in detecting possible drug use symptoms shall substantiate the decision to test.

        (e)  A covered employee who refuses to take or has a positive drug test may not return to duty in the covered function until the covered employee has complied with applicable provisions of DOT Procedures concerning substance abuse professionals and the return-to-duty process.

        (f)  A covered employee who refuses to take or has a positive drug test shall be subject to unannounced follow-up drug tests administered by the operator following the covered employee's return to duty. The number and frequency of such follow-up testing shall be determined by a substance abuse professional, but shall consist of at least six tests in the first 12 months following the covered employee's return to duty. In addition, follow-up testing may include testing for alcohol as directed by the substance abuse professional, to be performed in accordance with 49 CFR part 40. Follow-up testing shall not exceed 60 months from the date of the covered employee's return to duty. The substance abuse professional may terminate the requirement for follow-up testing at any time after the first six tests have been administered, if the substance abuse professional determines that such testing is no longer necessary.

        § 199.119   Reporting of anti-drug testing results.

#### § § 199.119

        (a) Each large operator (having more than 50 covered employees) must submit an annual Management Information System (MIS) report to PHMSA of its anti-drug testing using the MIS form and instructions as required by 49 CFR part 40 (at § 40.26 and appendix H to part 40), not later than March 15 of each year for the prior calendar year (January 1 through December 31). The Administrator may require by notice in the PHMSA Portal () that small operators (50 or fewer covered employees), not otherwise required to submit annual MIS reports, to prepare and submit such reports to PHMSA.

        (b) Each report required under this section must be submitted electronically at  An operator may obtain the user name and password needed for electronic reporting from the PHMSA Portal (). If electronic reporting imposes an undue burden and hardship, the operator may submit a written request for an alternative reporting method to the Information Resources Manager, Office of Pipeline Safety, Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, 1200 New Jersey Avenue SE., Washington, DC 20590. The request must describe the undue burden and hardship. PHMSA will review the request and may authorize, in writing, an alternative reporting method. An authorization will state the period for which it is valid, which may be indefinite. An operator must contact PHMSA at 202-366-8075, or electronically to  to make arrangements for submitting a report that is due after a request for alternative reporting is submitted but before an authorization or denial is received.

        (c) To calculate the total number of covered employees eligible for random testing throughout the year, as an operator, you must add the total number of covered employees eligible for testing during each random testing period for the year and divide that total by the number of random testing periods. Covered employees, and only covered employees, are to be in an employer's random testing pool, and all covered employees must be in the random pool. If you are an employer conducting random testing more often than once per month (e.g., you select daily, weekly, bi-weekly), you do not need to compute this total number of covered employees rate more than on a once per month basis.

        (d) As an employer, you may use a service agent (e.g., C/TPA) to perform random selections for you; and your covered employees may be part of a larger random testing pool of covered employees. However, you must ensure that the service agent you use is testing at the appropriate percentage established for your industry and that only covered employees are in the random testing pool.

        (e) Each operator that has a covered employee who performs multi-DOT agency functions (e.g., an employee performs pipeline maintenance duties and drives a commercial motor vehicle), count the employee only on the MIS report for the DOT agency under which he or she is randomly tested. Normally, this will be the DOT agency under which the employee performs more than 50% of his or her duties. Operators may have to explain the testing data for these employees in the event of a DOT agency inspection or audit.

        (f) A service agent (e.g., Consortia/Third Party Administrator as defined in 49 CFR part 40) may prepare the MIS report on behalf of an operator. However, each report shall be certified by the operator's anti-drug manager or designated representative for accuracy and completeness.

        § 199.219   Pre-duty use.

#### § § 199.219

        Each operator shall prohibit a covered employee from using alcohol within four hours prior to performing covered functions, or, if an employee is called to duty to respond to an emergency, within the time period after the employee has been notified to report for duty. No operator having actual knowledge that a covered employee has used alcohol within four hours prior to performing covered functions or within the time period after the employee has been notified to report for duty shall permit that covered employee to perform or continue to perform covered functions.

        § 199.221   Use following an accident.

#### § § 199.221

        Each operator shall prohibit a covered employee who has actual knowledge of an accident in which his or her performance of covered functions has not been discounted by the operator as a contributing factor to the accident from using alcohol for eight hours following the accident, unless he or she has been given a post-accident test under § 199.225(a), or the operator has determined that the employee's performance could not have contributed to the accident.

        § 199.223   Refusal to submit to a required alcohol test.

#### § § 199.223

        Each operator shall require a covered employee to submit to a post-accident alcohol test required under § 199.225(a), a reasonable suspicion alcohol test required under § 199.225(b), or a follow-up alcohol test required under § 199.225(d). No operator shall permit an employee who refuses to submit to such a test to perform or continue to perform covered functions.

        § 199.225   Alcohol tests required.

#### § § 199.225

        Each operator must conduct the following types of alcohol tests for the presence of alcohol:

        (a)  (1) As soon as practicable following an accident, each operator must test each surviving covered employee for alcohol if that employee's performance of a covered function either contributed to the accident or cannot be completely discounted as a contributing factor to the accident. The decision not to administer a test under this section must be based on specific information that the covered employee's performance had no role in the cause(s) or severity of the accident.

        (2)(i) If a test required by this section is not administered within 2 hours following the accident, the operator shall prepare and maintain on file a record stating the reasons the test was not promptly administered. If a test required by paragraph (a) is not administered within 8 hours following the accident, the operator shall cease attempts to administer an alcohol test and shall state in the record the reasons for not administering the test.

        (ii) [Reserved]

        (3) A covered employee who is subject to post-accident testing who fails to remain readily available for such testing, including notifying the operator or operator representative of his/her location if he/she leaves the scene of the accident prior to submission to such test, may be deemed by the operator to have refused to submit to testing. Nothing in this section shall be construed to require the delay of necessary medical attention for injured people following an accident or to prohibit a covered employee from leaving the scene of an accident for the period necessary to obtain assistance in responding to the accident or to obtain necessary emergency medical care.

        (b)  (1) Each operator shall require a covered employee to submit to an alcohol test when the operator has reasonable suspicion to believe that the employee has violated the prohibitions in this subpart.

        (2) The operator's determination that reasonable suspicion exists to require the covered employee to undergo an alcohol test shall be based on specific, contemporaneous, articulable observations concerning the appearance, behavior, speech, or body odors of the employee. The required observations shall be made by a supervisor who is trained in detecting the symptoms of alcohol misuse. The supervisor who makes the determination that reasonable suspicion exists shall not conduct the breath alcohol test on that employee.

        (3) Alcohol testing is authorized by this section only if the observations required by paragraph (b)(2) of this section are made during, just preceding, or just after the period of the work day that the employee is required to be in compliance with this subpart. A covered employee may be directed by the operator to undergo reasonable suspicion testing for alcohol only while the employee is performing covered functions; just before the employee is to perform covered functions; or just after the employee has ceased performing covered functions.

        (4)(i) If a test required by this section is not administered within 2 hours following the determination under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the operator shall prepare and maintain on file a record stating the reasons the test was not promptly administered. If a test required by this section is not administered within 8 hours following the determination under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the operator shall cease attempts to administer an alcohol test and shall state in the record the reasons for not administering the test. Records shall be submitted to PHMSA upon request of the Administrator.

        (ii) [Reserved]

        (iii) Notwithstanding the absence of a reasonable suspicion alcohol test under this section, an operator shall not permit a covered employee to report for duty or remain on duty requiring the performance of covered functions while the employee is under the influence of or impaired by alcohol, as shown by the behavioral, speech, or performance indicators of alcohol misuse, nor shall an operator permit the covered employee to perform or continue to perform covered functions, until:

        (A) An alcohol test is administered and the employee's alcohol concentration measures less than 0.02; or

        (B) The start of the employee's next regularly scheduled duty period, but not less than 8 hours following the determination under paragraph (b)(2) of this section that there is reasonable suspicion to believe that the employee has violated the prohibitions in this subpart.

        (iv) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(4)(ii), no operator shall take any action under this subpart against a covered employee based solely on the employee's behavior and appearance in the absence of an alcohol test. This does not prohibit an operator with the authority independent of this subpart from taking any action otherwise consistent with law.

        (c)  Each operator shall ensure that before a covered employee returns to duty requiring the performance of a covered function after engaging in conduct prohibited by §§ 199.215 through 199.223, the employee shall undergo a return-to-duty alcohol test with a result indicating an alcohol concentration of less than 0.02.

        (d)  (1) Following a determination under § 199.243(b) that a covered employee is in need of assistance in resolving problems associated with alcohol misuse, each operator shall ensure that the employee is subject to unannounced follow-up alcohol testing as directed by a substance abuse professional in accordance with the provisions of § 199.243(c)(2)(ii).

        (2) Follow-up testing shall be conducted when the covered employee is performing covered functions; just before the employee is to perform covered functions; or just after the employee has ceased performing such functions.

        (e)  Each operator shall retest a covered employee to ensure compliance with the provisions of § 199.237, if an operator chooses to permit the employee to perform a covered function within 8 hours following the administration of an alcohol test indicating an alcohol concentration of 0.02 or greater but less than 0.04.
