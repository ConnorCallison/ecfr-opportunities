Such application must be made to the Regional Director prior to the hearing, and to the Administrative Law Judge during and subsequent to the hearing but before transfer of the case to the Board pursuant to § 102.45 or § 102.50. Such application must be served on the Regional Director or the Administrative Law Judge, as the case may be, and on all other parties, not less than 7 days (when the deposition is to be taken within the continental United States) and 15 days (if the deposition is to be taken elsewhere) prior to the time when it is desired that the deposition be taken.

If the deposition is not signed by the witness because the witness is ill, dead, cannot be found, or refuses to sign it, such fact will be included in the certificate of the officer and the deposition may then be used as fully as though signed. The officer will immediately deliver the transcript, together with the certificate, in person, by registered or certified mail, or by E-File to the Regional Director or Division of Judges' office handling the matter.\n",

A motion for reconsideration shall state with particularity the material error claimed and with respect to any finding of material fact shall specify the page of the record relied on for the motion. A motion for rehearing or to reopen the record shall specify briefly the error alleged to require a rehearing or hearing de novo, the prejudice to the movant alleged to result from such error, the additional evidence sought to be adduced, why it was not presented previously, and what result it would require if adduced and credited. Only newly discovered evidence—evidence which has become available only since the close of the hearing—or evidence which the Regional Director or the Board believes should have been taken at the hearing will be taken at any further hearing.\n",

Any request for an extension of time to file such a motion shall be served promptly on the other parties. A motion to reopen the record shall be filed promptly on discovery of the evidence sought to be adduced.\n",

The request for access must be made in writing or in person during normal business hours to the person designated for that purpose and at the address set forth in the published notice of system of records. Copies of such notices, and assistance in preparing a request for access, may be obtained from any Regional Office of the Board or at the Board offices in Washington, DC. Reasonable verification of the identity of the requester, as described in paragraph (e) of this section, will be required to assure that records are disclosed to the proper person. A request for access to records or the accounting of disclosures from such records will be acknowledged in writing by the Agency within 10 days of receipt (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays) and, wherever practicable, the acknowledgment will inform the requester whether access will be granted and, if so, the time and location at which the records or accounting will be made available. If access to the record of accounting is to be granted, the record or accounting will normally be provided within 30 days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays) of the request, unless for good cause shown the Agency is unable to do so, in which case the individual will be informed in writing within that 30-day period of the reasons therefor and when it is anticipated that access will be granted.

A first copy of any such record or information will ordinarily be provided without charge to the individual or representative in a form comprehensible to the individual. Fees for any other copies of requested records will be assessed at the rate of 12 cents for each sheet of duplication.\n",
                  "(d) An individual may request amendment of a record pertaining to such individual in a system of records maintained by the Agency. A request for amendment of a record must be in writing and submitted during normal business hours to the person designated for that purpose and at the address set forth in the published notice for the system of records containing the record of which amendment is sought. Copies of such notices, and assistance in preparing a request for amendment, may be obtained from any Regional Office of the Board or at the Board offices in Washington, DC. The requester must provide verification of identity as described in paragraph (e) of this section, and the request must set forth the specific amendment requested and the reason for the requested amendment. The Agency will acknowledge in writing receipt of the request within 10 days of receipt (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays) and, whenever practicable, the acknowledgement will advise the individual of the determination of the request. If the review of the request for amendment cannot be completed and a determination made within 10 days, the review will be completed as soon as possible, normally within 30 days (Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays excluded) of receipt of the request unless unusual circumstances preclude completing the review within that time, in which event the requester will be notified in writing within that 30-day period of the reasons for the delay and when the determination of the request may be expected. If the determination is to amend the record, the requester will be so notified in writing and the record will be amended in accordance with that determination. If any disclosures accountable under the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a(c) have been made, all previous recipients of the record which was amended must be advised of the amendment and its substance. If it is determined that the request may not be granted, the requester will be notified in writing of that determination and of the reasons therefor, and advised of the right to obtain review of the adverse determination under the provisions of paragraph (f) of this section. The provisions of this paragraph (d) do not apply to the extent that requested information from the relevant system of records has been exempted from this Privacy Act requirement.\n",

Disclosure of a record to an individual will normally be made upon the presentation of acceptable identification. Disclosure of records by mail may be made on the basis of the identifying information set forth in the request. Depending on the nature, location, and sensitivity of the requested record, a signed notarized statement verifying identity may be required by the Agency. Proof of authorization as representative to have access to a record of an individual must be in writing, and a signed notarized statement of such authorization may be required by the Agency if the record requested is of a sensitive nature.\n",

Consistent with the provisions of Section 3(d) of the Act, and the delegation of authority from the Board to the General Counsel, the request may be made to the General Counsel if the system of records is maintained by an office of the Agency other than those enumerated above. Either the Chairman of the Board or the General Counsel may designate in writing another officer of the Agency to review the refusal of the request. Such review will be completed within 30 days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays) from the receipt of the request for review unless the Chairman of the Board or the General Counsel, as the case may be, for good cause shown, extends such 30-day period.\n",

If the reviewing officer determines that the information was properly denied, the individual will be so informed in writing with a brief statement of the reasons therefor.\n",
                  "(3) If, upon review of a refusal under paragraph (b) or (g) of this section, the reviewing officer determines that access to a record or to an accounting of disclosures may be granted, the requester will be so notified and the record or accounting will be promptly made available to the requester. If the reviewing officer determines that the request for access was properly denied, the individual will be so informed in writing with a brief statement of the reasons therefor, and of the right to judicial review of that determination under the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a(g)(1)(B).\n",
                  "(4) If, upon review of a refusal under paragraph (i) of this section, the reviewing official grants a request to amend, the requester will be so notified, the record will be amended in accordance with the determination, and, if any disclosures accountable under the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a(c) have been made, all previous recipients of the record which was amended will be advised of the amendment and its substance. If the reviewing officer determines that the denial of a request for amendment may be sustained, the Agency will advise the requester of the determination and the reasons therefor, and that the individual may file with the Agency a concise statement of the reason for disagreeing with the determination, and may seek judicial review of the Agency's denial of the request to amend the record. In the event a statement of disagreement is filed, that statement:\n",
                  "(i) Will be made available to anyone to whom the record is subsequently disclosed together with, at the discretion of the Agency, a brief statement summarizing the Agency's reasons for declining to amend the record; and\n",

To the extent that portions of systems of records described in notices of Government-wide systems of records published by the Department of Labor are identified by those notices as being subject to the management of an officer of the Agency, or an officer of the Agency is designated as the official to contact for information, access, or contents of those records, individual requests for access to those records, requests for their amendment, and review of denials of requests for amendment will be in accordance with the provisions of this section. Review of a refusal to inform an individual whether such a system of records contains a record pertaining to that individual and review of a refusal to grant an individual's request for access to a record in such a system may be obtained in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (f) of this section.\n",

                  "(j) Privacy Act exemptions contained in paragraphs (h) and (i) of this section are justified for the following reasons:\n",
                  "(1) 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3) requires an agency to make the accounting of each disclosure of records available to the individual named in the record at that individual's request. These accountings must state the date, nature, and purpose of each disclosure of a record and the name and address of the recipient. Accounting for each disclosure would alert the subjects of an investigation to the existence of the investigation and the fact that they are subjects of the investigation. The release of such information to the subjects of an investigation would provide them with significant information concerning the nature of the investigation and could seriously impede or compromise the investigation, endanger the physical safety of confidential sources, witnesses, law enforcement personnel, and their families and lead to the improper influencing of witnesses, the destruction of evidence, or the fabrication of testimony.\n",
                  "(2) 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(4) requires an agency to inform any person or other agency about any correction or notation of dispute made by the agency in accordance with subsection (d) of the Act. Since this system of records is being exempted from subsection (d) of the Act, concerning access to records, this section is inapplicable to the extent that this system of records will be exempted from subsection (d) of the Act.\n",
                  "(3) 5 U.S.C. 552a(d) requires an agency to permit an individual to gain access to records pertaining to the individual, to request amendment to such records, to request a review of an agency decision not to amend such records, and to contest the information contained in such records. Granting access to records in this system of records could inform the subject of an investigation of an actual or potential criminal violation, of the existence of that investigation, of the nature and scope of the information and evidence obtained as to the individual's activities, or of the identity of confidential sources, witnesses, and law enforcement personnel and could provide information to enable the subject to avoid detection or apprehension. Granting access to such information could seriously impede or compromise an investigation, endanger the physical safety of confidential sources, witnesses, law enforcement personnel, and their families, lead to the improper influencing of witnesses, the destruction of evidence, or the fabrication of testimony, and disclose investigative techniques and procedures. In addition, granting access to such information could disclose classified, security-sensitive, or confidential business information and could constitute an unwarranted invasion of the personal privacy of others.\n",
                  "(4) 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(1) requires each agency to maintain in its records only such information about an individual as is relevant and necessary to accomplish a purpose of the agency required by statute or by executive order of the President. The application of this provision could impair investigations and law enforcement because it is not always possible to detect the relevance or necessity of specific information in the early stages of an investigation. Relevance and necessity are often questions of judgment and timing, and it is only after the information is evaluated that the relevance and necessity of such information can be established. In addition, during the course of the investigation, the investigator may obtain information which is incidental to the main purpose of the investigative jurisdiction of another agency. Such information cannot readily be segregated. Furthermore, during the course of the investigation, the investigator may obtain information concerning the violation of laws other than those which are within scope of the investigator's jurisdiction. In the interest of effective law enforcement, OIG investigators may retain this information, since it can aid in establishing patterns of criminal activity and can provide valuable leads for other law enforcement agencies.\n",
                  "(5) 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(2) requires an agency to collect information to the greatest extent practicable directly from the subject individual when the information may result in adverse determinations about an individual's rights, benefits, and privileges under Federal programs. The application of this provision could impair investigations and law enforcement by alerting the subject of an investigation, thereby enabling the subject to avoid detection or apprehension, to influence witnesses improperly, to destroy evidence, or to fabricate testimony. Moreover, in certain circumstances, the subject of an investigation cannot be required to provide information to investigators and information must be collected from other sources. Furthermore, it is often necessary to collect information from sources other than the subject of the investigation to verify the accuracy of the evidence collected.\n",
                  "(6) 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(3) requires an agency to inform each person whom it asks to supply information, on a form that can be retained by the person, of the authority under which the information is sought and whether disclosure is mandatory or voluntary; of the principal purposes for which the information is intended to be used; of the routine uses which may be made of the information; and of the effects on the person, if any, of not providing all or any part of the requested information. The application of this provision could provide the subject of an investigation with substantial information about the nature of that investigation that could interfere with the investigation. Moreover, providing such a notice to the subject of an investigation could seriously impede or compromise an undercover investigation by revealing its existence and could endanger the physical safety of confidential sources, witnesses, and investigators by revealing their identities.\n",

Since this system of records is being exempted from subsection (f) of the Act, concerning agency rules, and subsection (d) of the Act, concerning access to records, these requirements are inapplicable to the extent that this system of records will be exempt from subsections (f) and (d) of the Act.

The application of this provision could impede or compromise an investigation or prosecution if the subject of an investigation were able to use such rules to learn of the existence of an investigation before it could be completed. In addition, mere notice of the fact of an investigation could inform the subject and others that their activities are under or may become the subject of an investigation and could enable the subjects to avoid detection or apprehension, to influence witnesses improperly, to destroy evidence, or to fabricate testimony.

Providing such an accounting of investigatory information to a party in an unfair labor practice or representation matter under investigation could inform that individual of the precise scope of an Agency investigation, or the existence or scope of another law enforcement investigation.

Such disclosure of investigatory information could seriously impede or compromise the Agency's investigation by revealing the identity of confidential sources or confidential business information, or causing the improper influencing of witnesses, retaliation against witnesses, destruction of evidence, fabrication of testimony, or unwarranted invasion of the privacy of others. Amendment of the records could interfere with ongoing law enforcement proceedings and impose an undue administrative burden by requiring investigations to be continuously reinvestigated.\n",

Similarly, personnel investigations may contain evaluation material used to determine potential for promotion in the armed services. Application of exemption 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(7) is necessary to the extent that the disclosure of data would compromise the anonymity of a source under an express promise that the identity of the source would be held in confidence, or, prior to September 27, 1975, under an implied promise that the identity of the source would be held in confidence.

This requirement could foreclose investigators from acquiring or receiving information the relevance and necessity of which is not readily apparent and could only be ascertained after a complete review and evaluation of all the evidence. This system of records is exempt from this requirement because in the course of personnel background investigations, the accuracy of information obtained or introduced occasionally may be unclear, or the information may not be strictly relevant or necessary to favorably or unfavorably adjudicate a specific investigation at a specific point in time.

                  "(b) Misconduct by any person at any hearing before an Administrative Law Judge, Hearing Officer, or the Board may be grounds for summary exclusion from the hearing. Notwithstanding the procedures set forth in paragraph (e) of this section for handling allegations of misconduct, the Administrative Law Judge, Hearing Officer, or Board has the authority in the proceeding in which the misconduct occurred to admonish or reprimand, after due notice, any person who engages in misconduct at a hearing.\n",
                  "(c) The refusal of a witness at any such hearing to answer any question which has been ruled to be proper may, in the discretion of the Administrative Law Judge or Hearing Officer, be grounds for striking all testimony previously given by such witness on related matters.\n",
                  "(d) Misconduct by an attorney or other representative at any stage of any Agency proceeding, including but not limited to misconduct at a hearing, may be grounds for discipline. Such misconduct of an aggravated character may be grounds for suspension and/or disbarment from practice before the Agency and/or other sanctions.\n",
                  "(e) All allegations of misconduct pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section, except for those involving the conduct of Agency employees, will be handled in accordance with the following procedures:\n",
                  "(1) Allegations that an attorney or party representative has engaged in misconduct may be brought to the attention of the Investigating Officer by any person. The Investigating Officer, for purposes of this paragraph (e)(1), is the head of the Division of Operations-Management, or designee.\n",
                  "(2) The Investigating Officer or designee will conduct such investigation as is deemed appropriate and will have the usual powers of investigation provided in Section 11 of the Act. Following the investigation, the Investigating Officer will make a recommendation to the General Counsel, who will make the determination whether to institute disciplinary proceedings against the attorney or party representative. The General Counsel's authority to make this determination is not delegable to the Regional Director or other personnel in the Regional Office. If the General Counsel determines not to institute disciplinary proceedings, all interested persons will be notified of the determination, which is final.\n",
                  "(3) If the General Counsel decides to institute disciplinary proceedings against the attorney or party representative, the General Counsel or designee will serve the respondent with a complaint which will include: A statement of the acts which are claimed to constitute misconduct including the approximate date and place of such acts together with a statement of the discipline recommended; notification of the right to a hearing before an Administrative Law Judge with respect to any material issues of fact or mitigation; and an explanation of the method by which a hearing may be requested. The complaint will not be issued until the respondent has been notified of the allegations in writing and has been afforded a reasonable opportunity to respond.\n",
                  "(4) Within 14 days of service of the disciplinary complaint, the Respondent must file an answer admitting or denying the allegations, and may request a hearing. If no answer is filed or no material issue of fact or relevant to mitigation warranting a hearing is raised, the matter may be submitted directly to the Board. If no answer is filed, then the allegations will be deemed admitted.\n",
                  "(5) Sections 102.24 through 102.51, rules applicable to unfair labor practice proceedings, apply to disciplinary proceedings under this section to the extent that they are not contrary to the provisions of this section.\n",
                  "(6) The hearing will be conducted at a reasonable time, date, and place. In setting the hearing date, the Administrative Law Judge will give due regard to the Respondent's need for time to prepare an adequate defense and the need of the Agency and the Respondent for an expeditious resolution of the allegations.\n",
                  "(7) The hearing will be public unless otherwise ordered by the Board or the Administrative Law Judge.\n",
                  "(8) Any person bringing allegations of misconduct or filing a petition for disciplinary proceedings against an attorney or party representative will be given notice of the scheduled hearing. Any such person will not be a party to the disciplinary proceeding, however, and will not be afforded the rights of a party to call, examine or cross-examine witnesses and introduce evidence at the hearing, to file exceptions to the Administrative Law Judge's decision, or to appeal the Board's decision.\n",
                  "(9) The Respondent will, upon request, be provided with an opportunity to read the transcript or listen to a recording of the hearing.\n",
                  "(10) The General Counsel must establish the alleged misconduct by a preponderance of the evidence.\n",
                  "(11) At any stage of the proceeding prior to hearing, the Respondent may submit a settlement proposal to the General Counsel, who may approve the settlement or elect to continue with the proceedings. Any formal settlement reached between the General Counsel and the Respondent, providing for entry of a Board order reprimanding, suspending, disbarring or taking other disciplinary action against the Respondent, is subject to final approval by the Board. In the event any settlement, formal or informal, is reached after opening of the hearing, such settlement must be submitted to the Administrative Law Judge for approval. In the event the Administrative Law Judge rejects the settlement, either the General Counsel or the Respondent may appeal such ruling to the Board as provided in § 102.26.\n",
                  "(12) If it is found that the Respondent has engaged in misconduct in violation of paragraph (d) of this section, the Board may issue a final order imposing such disciplinary sanctions as it deems appropriate, including, where the misconduct is of an aggravated character, suspension and/or disbarment from practice before the Agency, and/or other sanctions.\n",
                  "(f) Any person found to have engaged in misconduct warranting disciplinary sanctions under paragraph (d) of this section may seek judicial review of the administrative determination.\n"
