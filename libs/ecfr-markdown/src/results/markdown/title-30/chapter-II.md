      Subpart A—General Provisions

        § 203.0   What definitions apply to this part?

#### § § 203.0

        means a field:

        (1) Located in a water depth of at least 200 meters and in the Gulf of Mexico (GOM) west of 87 degrees, 30 minutes West longitude;

        (2) That includes one or more pre-Act leases; and

        (3) From which no current pre-Act lease produced, other than test production, before November 28, 1995.

        means an original well or a sidetrack with a sidetrack measured depth ( length) of at least 10,000 feet, on your lease that:

        (1) You begin drilling on or after March 26, 2003, and before May 3, 2009, on a lease that is located in water partly or entirely less than 200 meters deep and that is not a non-converted lease, or on or after May 18, 2007, and before May 3, 2013, on a lease that is located in water entirely more than 200 meters and entirely less than 400 meters deep;

        (2) You begin drilling before your lease produces gas or oil from a well with a perforated interval the top of which is at least 18,000 feet true vertical depth subsea (TVD SS), ( below the datum at mean sea level);

        (3) You drill to at least 18,000 feet TVD SS with a target reservoir on your lease, identified from seismic and related data, deeper than that depth;

        (4) Fails to meet the producibility requirements of 30 CFR part 550, subpart A, and does not produce gas or oil, or meets those producibility requirements and Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) agrees it is not commercially producible; and

        (5) For which you have provided the notices and information required under § 203.47.

        means an original and two copies of the six reports consisting of the data specified in §§ 203.81, 203.83, and 203.85 through 203.89, along with one set of digital information, which Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) has reviewed and found complete.

        means either an original well or a sidetrack with a perforated interval the top of which is at least 15,000 feet TVD SS and less than 20,000 feet TVD SS. A deep well subsequently re-perforated at less than 15,000 feet TVD SS in the same reservoir is still a deep well.

        means the binding decision by BSEE on whether your field qualifies for relief or how large a royalty-suspension volume must be to make the field economically viable.

        means a project to develop one or more oil or gas reservoirs located on one or more contiguous leases that have had no production (other than test production) before the current application for royalty relief and are either:

        (1) Located in a planning area offshore Alaska; or

        (2) Located in the GOM in a water depth of at least 200 meters and wholly west of 87 degrees, 30 minutes West longitude, and were issued in a sale held after November 28, 2000.

        means the preliminary set of information and assumptions you submit to seek a nonbinding assessment on whether a field could be expected to qualify for royalty relief.

        means a lease that:

        (1) Is issued as part of an OCS lease sale held after November 28, 1995, and before November 28, 2000;

        (2) Is located in the Gulf of Mexico in water depths of 200 meters or deeper;

        (3) Lies wholly west of 87 degrees, 30 minutes West longitude; and

        (4) Is offered subject to a royalty suspension volume.

        means a project that meets the following requirements:

        (1) You must propose the project in a (BOEM) Development and Production Plan, a BOEM Development Operations Coordination Document (DOCD), or a BOEM Supplement to a DOCD, approved by the Secretary of the Interior after November 28, 1995.

        (2) The project must be located on either:

        (i) A pre-Act lease in the GOM, or a lease in the GOM issued in a sale held after November 28, 2000, located wholly west of 87 degrees, 30 minutes West longitude; or

        (ii) A lease in a planning area offshore Alaska.

        (3) On a pre-Act lease in the GOM, the project:

        (i) Must significantly increase the ultimate recovery of resources from one or more reservoirs that have not previously produced (extending recovery from reservoirs already in production does not constitute a significant increase); and

        (ii) Must involve a substantial capital investment (e.g., fixed-leg platform, subsea template and manifold, tension-leg platform, multiple well project, ).

        (4) For a lease issued in a planning area offshore Alaska, or in the GOM after November 28, 2000, the project must involve a new well drilled into a reservoir that has not previously produced.

        (5) On a lease in the GOM, the project must not include a reservoir the production from which an RSV under §§ 203.30 through 203.36 or §§ 203.40 through 203.48 would be applied.

        means evidence of an irreversible commitment to a concept and scale of development. Evidence includes copies of a binding contract between you (as applicant) and a fabrication yard, a letter from a fabricator certifying that continuous construction has begun, and a receipt for the customary down payment.

        means an area consisting of a single reservoir or multiple reservoirs all grouped on, or related to, the same general geological structural feature or stratigraphic trapping condition. Two or more reservoirs may be in a field, separated vertically by intervening impervious strata or laterally by local geologic barriers, or both.

        means a lease or unit.

        means any production from a current pre-Act lease from which no royalties are due on production, other than test production, before November 28, 1995. Also, it means any additional production resulting from new lease-development activities on a lease issued in a sale after November 28, 2000, or a current pre-Act lease under a BOEM DOCD or a BOEM Supplement approved by the Secretary of the Interior after November 28, 1995.

        means an opinion by BSEE of whether your field could qualify for royalty relief. It is based on your draft application and does not entitle the field to relief.

        means a lease located partly or entirely in water less than 200 meters deep issued in a lease sale held after January 1, 2001, and before January 1, 2004, whose original lease terms provided for an RSV for deep gas production and the lessee has not exercised the option under § 203.49 to replace the lease terms for royalty relief with those in § 203.0 and §§ 203.40 through 203.48.

        means a well that is drilled without utilizing an existing wellbore. An original well includes all sidetracks drilled from the original wellbore either before the drilling rig moves off the well location or after a temporary rig move that BSEE agrees was forced by a weather or safety threat and drilling resumes within 1 year. A bypass from an original well (e.g., drilling around material blocking the hole or to straighten crooked holes) is part of the original well.

        means that part of the unit area that BSEE determines is reasonably proven by drilling and completion of producible wells, geological and geophysical information, and engineering data to be capable of producing hydrocarbons in paying quantities.

        mean minimum conditions you must meet, after we have granted relief and before production begins, to remain qualified for that relief. If you do not meet each one of these performance conditions, we consider it a change in material fact significant enough to invalidate our original evaluation and approval.

        means an ultra-deep well on a lease that is located in water partly or entirely less than 200 meters deep for which drilling began before May 18, 2007, and that begins production before May 3, 2009, or that meets the requirements to be a certified unsuccessful well.

        means an ultra-deep well for which drilling began on or after May 18, 2007; and that either meets the requirements to be a certified unsuccessful well or that begins production:

        (1) Before the date which is 5 years after the lease issuance date on a non-converted lease; or

        (2) Before May 3, 2009, on all other leases located in water partly or entirely less than 200 meters deep; or

        (3) Before May 3, 2013, on a lease that is located in water entirely more than 200 meters and entirely less than 400 meters deep.

        means an ultra-deep well for which drilling began on or after May 18, 2007, and that begins production:

        (1) On or after the date which is 5 years after the lease issuance date on a non-converted lease; or

        (2) On or after May 3, 2009, on all other leases located in water partly or entirely less than 200 meters deep; or

        (3) On or after May 3, 2013, on a lease that is located in water entirely more than 200 meters and entirely less than 400 meters deep.

        means a lease that:

        (1) Results from a sale held before November 28, 1995;

        (2) Is located in the GOM in water depths of 200 meters or deeper; and

        (3) Lies wholly west of 87 degrees, 30 minutes West longitude.

        means all oil, gas, and other relevant products you save, remove, or sell from a tract or those quantities allocated to your tract under a unitization formula, as measured for the purposes of determining the amount of royalty payable to the United States.

        means any activity that requires at least a permit to drill.

        means:

        (1) On a lease that is located in water partly or entirely less than 200 meters deep that is not a non-converted lease, a deep well for which drilling began on or after March 26, 2003, that produces natural gas (other than test production), including gas associated with oil production, before May 3, 2009, and for which you have met the requirements prescribed in § 203.44;

        (2) On a non-converted lease, a deep well that produces natural gas (other than test production) before the date which is 5 years after the lease issuance date from a reservoir that has not produced from a deep well on any lease; or

        (3) On a lease that is located in water entirely more than 200 meters but entirely less than 400 meters deep, a deep well for which drilling began on or after May 18, 2007, that produces natural gas (other than test production), including gas associated with oil production before May 3, 2013, and for which you have met the requirements prescribed in § 203.44.

        means:

        (1) On a lease that is located in water partly or entirely less than 200 meters deep that is not a non-converted lease, an ultra-deep well for which drilling began on or after March 26, 2003, that produces natural gas (other than test production), including gas associated with oil production, and for which you have met the requirements prescribed in § 203.35 or § 203.44, as applicable; or

        (2) On a lease that is located in water entirely more than 200 meters and entirely less than 400 meters deep, or on a non-converted lease, an ultra-deep well for which drilling began on or after May 18, 2007, that produces natural gas (other than test production), including gas associated with oil production, and for which you have met the requirements prescribed in § 203.35.

        means either a qualified deep well or a qualified ultra-deep well.

        means our reconsideration of our determination on royalty relief because you request it after:

        (1) We have rejected your application;

        (2) We have granted relief but you want a larger suspension volume;

        (3) We withdraw approval; or

        (4) You renounce royalty relief.

        means action you take to give up relief after we have granted it and before you start production.

        means an underground accumulation of oil or natural gas, or both, characterized by a single pressure system and segregated from other such accumulations.

        means a lease that:

        (1) Is issued as part of an OCS lease sale held after November 28, 2000;

        (2) Is in locations or planning areas specified in a particular Notice of OCS Lease Sale offering that lease; and

        (3) Is offered subject to a royalty suspension specified in a Notice of OCS Lease Sale published in the

        means a royalty suspension volume resulting from drilling a certified unsuccessful well that is applied to future natural gas and oil production generated at any drilling depth on, or allocated under a BSEE-approved unit agreement to, the same lease.

        means a volume of production from a lease that is not subject to royalty under the provisions of this part.

        means, for the purpose of this subpart, a well resulting from drilling an additional hole to a new objective bottom-hole location by leaving a previously drilled hole. A sidetrack also includes drilling a well from a platform slot reclaimed from a previously drilled well or re-entering and deepening a previously drilled well. A bypass from a sidetrack (e.g., drilling around material blocking the hole, or to straighten crooked holes) is part of the sidetrack.

        means the actual distance or length in feet a sidetrack is drilled beginning where it exits a previously drilled hole to the bottom hole of the sidetrack, that is, to its total depth.

        means the after-tax eligible costs that you (not third parties) incur for exploration, development, and production from the spud date of the first discovery on the field to the date we receive your complete application for royalty relief. The discovery well must be qualified as producible under 30 CFR part 550, subpart A. Sunk costs include the rig mobilization and material costs for the discovery well that you incurred before its spud date.

        means the after-tax eligible costs that you (not third parties) incur for only the first well that encounters hydrocarbons in the reservoir(s) included in the application and that meets the producibility requirements under 30 CFR part 550, subpart A on each lease participating in the application. Sunk costs include rig mobilization and material costs for the discovery wells that you incurred before their spud dates.

        means either an original well or a sidetrack completed with a perforated interval the top of which is at least 20,000 feet TVD SS. An ultra-deep well subsequently re-perforated less than 20,000 feet TVD SS in the same reservoir is still an ultra-deep well.

        means action we take on a field that has qualified for relief if you have not met one or more of the performance conditions.

        § 203.1   What is BSEE's authority to grant royalty relief?

#### § § 203.1

        The Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) Lands Act, 43 U.S.C. 1337, as amended by the OCS Deep Water Royalty Relief Act (DWRRA), Public Law 104-58 and the Energy Policy Act of 2005, Public Law 109-058 authorizes us to grant royalty relief in four situations.

        (a) Under 43 U.S.C. 1337(a)(3)(A), we may reduce or eliminate any royalty or a net profit share specified for an OCS lease to promote increased production.

        (b) Under 43 U.S.C. 1337(a)(3)(B), we may reduce, modify, or eliminate any royalty or net profit share to promote development, increase production, or encourage production of marginal resources on certain leases or categories of leases. This authority is restricted to leases in the GOM that are west of 87 degrees, 30 minutes West longitude, and in the planning areas offshore Alaska.

        (c) Under 43 U.S.C. 1337(a)(3)(C), we may suspend royalties for designated volumes of new production from any lease if:

        (1) Your lease is in deep water (water at least 200 meters deep);

        (2) Your lease is in designated areas of the GOM (west of 87 degrees, 30 minutes West longitude);

        (3) Your lease was acquired in a lease sale held before the DWRRA (before November 28, 1995);

        (4) We find that your new production would not be economic without royalty relief; and

        (5) Your lease is on a field that did not produce before enactment of the DWRRA, or if you propose a project to significantly expand production under a Development Operations Coordination Document (DOCD) or a supplementary DOCD, that the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) approved after November 28, 1995.

        (d) Under 42 U.S.C. 15904-15905, we may suspend royalties for designated volumes of gas production from deep and ultra-deep wells on a lease if:

        (1) Your lease is in shallow water (water less than 400 meters deep) and you produce from an ultra-deep well (top of the perforated interval is at least 20,000 feet TVD SS) or your lease is in waters entirely more than 200 meters and entirely less than 400 meters deep and you produce from a deep well (top of the perforated interval is at least 15,000 feet TVD SS);

        (2) Your lease is in the designated area of the GOM (wholly west of 87 degrees, 30 minutes west longitude); and

        (3) Your lease is not eligible for deep water royalty relief.

        § 203.2   How can I obtain royalty relief?

#### § § 203.2

        We may reduce or suspend royalties for Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) leases or projects that meet the criteria in the following table.

        § 203.3   Do I have to pay a fee to request royalty relief?

#### § § 203.3

        When you submit an application or ask for a preview assessment, you must include a fee to reimburse us for our costs of processing your application or assessment. Federal policy and law require us to recover the cost of services that confer special benefits to identifiable non-Federal recipients. The Independent Offices Appropriation Act (31 U.S.C. 9701), Office of Management and Budget Circular A-25, and the Omnibus Appropriations Bill (Pub. L. 104-134, 110 Stat. 1321, April 26, 1996) authorize us to collect these fees.

        (a) We will specify the necessary fees for each of the types of royalty relief applications and possible BSEE audits in a Notice to Lessees. We will periodically update the fees to reflect changes in costs, as well as provide other information necessary to administer royalty relief.

        (b) You must file all payments electronically through the  page on the BSEE Web site at  and you must include a copy of the  confirmation receipt page with your application or assessment.

        § 203.4   How do the provisions in this part apply to different types of leases and projects?

#### § § 203.4

        The tables in this section summarize the similar application and approval provisions for the discretionary end-of-life and deep water royalty relief programs in §§ 203.50 to 203.91. Because royalty relief for deep gas on leases not subject to deep water royalty relief, as provided for under §§ 203.40 to 203.48, does not involve an application, its provisions do not parallel the other two royalty relief programs and are not summarized in this section.

        (a) We require the information elements indicated by an X in the following table and described in §§ 203.51, 203.62, and 203.81 through 203.89 for applications for royalty relief.

        (b) We require the confirmation elements indicated by an X in the following table and described in §§ 203.70, 203.81, 203.90 and 203.91 to retain royalty relief.

        (c) The following table indicates by an X, and §§ 203.50, 203.52, 203.60 and 203.67 describe, the prerequisites for our approval of your royalty relief application.

        (d) The following table indicates by an X, and §§ 203.52, 203.74, and 203.75 describe, the prerequisites for a redetermination of our royalty relief decision.

        (e) The following table indicates by an X, and §§ 203.53 and 203.69 describe, the characteristics of approved royalty relief.

        (f) The following table indicates by an X, and §§ 203.54 and 203.78 describe, circumstances under which we discontinue your royalty relief.

        (g) The following table indicates by an X, and §§ 203.55, 203.76, and 203.77 describe, circumstances under which we end or reduce royalty relief.

        § 203.5   What is BSEE's authority to collect information?

#### § § 203.5

        (a) The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has approved the information collection requirements in this part under 44 U.S.C. 3501  and assigned OMB Control Number 1014-0005. The title of this information collection is “30 CFR part 203, Relief or Reduction in Royalty Rates.”

        (b) BSEE collects this information to make decisions on the economic viability of leases requesting a suspension or elimination of royalty or net profit share. Responses are required to obtain a benefit or are mandatory according to 43 U.S.C. 1331  BSEE will protect information considered proprietary under applicable law and under regulations at § 203.61, “How do I assess my chances for getting relief?” and 30 CFR 250.197, “Data and information to be made available to the public or for limited inspection.”

        (c) An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to a collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number.

        (d) Send comments regarding any aspect of the collection of information under this part, including suggestions for reducing the burden, to the Information Collection Clearance Officer, Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement, 45600 Woodland Road, Sterling, VA 20166.

      Subpart B—OCS Oil, Gas, and Sulfur General

        Royalty Relief for Drilling Ultra-Deep Wells on Leases Not Subject to Deep Water Royalty Relief

          § 203.30   Which leases are eligible for royalty relief as a result of drilling a phase 2 or phase 3 ultra-deep well?

#### § § 203.30

          Your lease may receive a royalty suspension volume (RSV) under §§ 203.31 through 203.36 if the lease meets all the requirements of this section.

          (a) The lease is located in the GOM wholly west of 87 degrees, 30 minutes West longitude in water depths entirely less than 400 meters deep.

          (b) The lease has not produced gas or oil from a deep well or an ultra-deep well, except as provided in § 203.31(b).

          (c) If the lease is located entirely in more than 200 meters and entirely less than 400 meters of water, it must either:

          (1) Have been issued before November 28, 1995, and not been granted deep water royalty relief under 43 U.S.C. 1337(a)(3)(C), added by section 302 of the Deep Water Royalty Relief Act; or

          (2) Have been issued after November 28, 2000, and not been granted deep water royalty relief under §§ 203.60 through 203.79.

          § 203.31   If I have a qualified phase 2 or qualified phase 3 ultra-deep well, what royalty relief would that well earn for my lease?

#### § § 203.31

          (a) Subject to the administrative requirements of § 203.35 and the price conditions in § 203.36, your qualified well earns your lease an RSV shown in the following table in billions of cubic feet (BCF) or in thousands of cubic feet (MCF) as prescribed in § 203.33:

          (b)(1) This paragraph applies if your lease:

          (i) Has produced gas or oil from a deep well with a perforated interval the top of which is less than 18,000 feet TVD SS;

          (ii) Was issued in a lease sale held between January 1, 2004, and December 31, 2005; and

          (iii) The terms of your lease expressly incorporate the provisions of §§ 203.41 through 203.47 as they existed at the time the lease was issued.

          (2) Subject to the administrative requirements of § 203.35 and the price conditions in § 203.36, your qualified well earns your lease an RSV shown in the following table in BCF or MCF as prescribed in § 203.33:

          (c) Lessees may request a refund of or recoup royalties paid on production from qualified phase 2 or phase 3 ultra-deep wells that:

          (1) Occurs before December 18, 2008, and

          (2) Is subject to application of an RSV under either § 203.31 or § 203.41.

          (d) The following examples illustrate how this section applies. These examples assume that your lease is located in the GOM west of 87 degrees, 30 minutes West longitude and in water less than 400 meters deep (see § 203.30(a)), has no existing deep or ultra-deep wells and that the price thresholds prescribed in § 203.36 have not been exceeded.

          § 203.32   What other requirements or restrictions apply to royalty relief for a qualified phase 2 or phase 3 ultra-deep well?

#### § § 203.32

          (a) If a qualified ultra-deep well on your lease is within a unitized portion of your lease, the RSV earned by that well under this section applies only to your lease and not to other leases within the unit or to the unit as a whole.

          (b) If your qualified ultra-deep well is a directional well (either an original well or a sidetrack) drilled across a lease line, then either:

          (1) The lease with the perforated interval that initially produces earns the RSV or

          (2) If the perforated interval crosses a lease line, the lease where the surface of the well is located earns the RSV.

          (c) Any RSV earned under § 203.31 is in addition to any royalty suspension supplement (RSS) for your lease under § 203.45 that results from a different wellbore.

          (d) If your lease earns an RSV under § 203.31 and later produces from a deep well that is not a qualified well, the RSV is not forfeited or terminated, but you may not apply the RSV earned under § 203.31 to production from the non-qualified well.

          (e) You owe minimum royalties or rentals in accordance with your lease terms notwithstanding any RSVs allowed under paragraphs (a) and (b) of § 203.31.

          (f) Unused RSVs transfer to a successor lessee and expire with the lease.

          § 203.33   To which production do I apply the RSV earned by qualified phase 2 and phase 3 ultra-deep wells on my lease or in my unit?

#### § § 203.33

          (a) You must apply the RSV allowed in § 203.31(a) and (b) to gas volumes produced from qualified wells on or after May 18, 2007, reported on the Oil and Gas Operations Report, Part A (OGOR-A) for your lease under 30 CFR 1210.102. All gas production from qualified wells reported on the OGOR-A, including production not subject to royalty, counts toward the total lease RSV earned by both deep or ultra-deep wells on the lease.

          (b) This paragraph applies to any lease with a qualified phase 2 or phase 3 ultra-deep well that is not within a BSEE-approved unit. Subject to the price conditions of § 203.36, you must apply the RSV prescribed in § 203.31 as required under the following paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section.

          (1) You must apply the RSV to the earliest gas production occurring on and after the later of May 18, 2007, or the date the first qualified phase 2 or phase 3 ultra-deep well that earns your lease the RSV begins production (other than test production).

          (2) You must apply the RSV to only gas production from qualified wells on your lease, regardless of their depth, for which you have met the requirements in § 203.35 or § 203.44.

          (c) This paragraph applies to any lease with a qualified phase 2 or phase 3 ultra-deep well where all or part of the lease is within a BSEE-approved unit. Under the unit agreement, a share of the production from all the qualified wells in the unit participating area would be allocated to your lease each month according to the participating area percentages. Subject to the price conditions of § 203.36, you must apply the RSV prescribed in § 203.31 as follows:

          (1) You must apply the RSV to the earliest gas production occurring on and after the later of May 18, 2007, or the date that the first qualified phase 2 or phase 3 ultra-deep well that earns your lease the RSV begins production (other than test production).

          (2) You must apply the RSV to only gas production:

          (i) From qualified wells on the non-unitized area of your lease, regardless of their depth, for which you have met the requirements in § 203.35 or § 203.44; and

          (ii) Allocated to your lease under a BSEE-approved unit agreement from qualified wells on unitized areas of your lease and on other leases in participating areas of the unit, regardless of their depth, for which the requirements in § 203.35 or § 203.44 have been met. The allocated share under paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section does not increase the RSV for your lease.

          (d) You must begin paying royalties when the cumulative production of gas from all qualified wells on your lease, or allocated to your lease under paragraph (b) of this section, reaches the applicable RSV allowed under § 203.31 or § 203.41. For the month in which cumulative production reaches this RSV, you owe royalties on the portion of gas production from or allocated to your lease that exceeds the RSV remaining at the beginning of that month.

          § 203.34   To which production may an RSV earned by qualified phase 2 and phase 3 ultra-deep wells on my lease not be applied?

#### § § 203.34

          You may not apply an RSV earned under § 203.31:

          (a) To production from completions less than 15,000 feet TVD SS, except in cases where the qualified well is re-perforated in the same reservoir previously perforated deeper than 15,000 feet TVD SS;

          (b) To production from a deep well or ultra-deep well on any other lease, except as provided in paragraph (c) of § 203.33;

          (c) To any liquid hydrocarbon (oil and condensate) volumes; or

          (d) To production from a deep well or ultra-deep well that commenced drilling before:

          (1) March 26, 2003, on a lease that is located entirely or partly in water less than 200 meters deep; or

          (2) May 18, 2007, on a lease that is located entirely in water more than 200 meters deep.

          § 203.35   What administrative steps must I take to use the RSV earned by a qualified phase 2 or phase 3 ultra-deep well?

#### § § 203.35

          To use an RSV earned under § 203.31:

          (a) You must notify the BSEE Regional Supervisor for Production and Development in writing of your intent to begin drilling operations on all your ultra-deep wells.

          (b) Before beginning production, you must meet any production measurement requirements that the BSEE Regional Supervisor for Production and Development has determined are necessary under 30 CFR part 250, subpart L.

          (c)(1) Within 30 days of the beginning of production from any wells that would become qualified phase 2 or phase 3 ultra-deep wells by satisfying the requirements of this section:

          (i) Provide written notification to the BSEE Regional Supervisor for Production and Development that production has begun; and

          (ii) Request confirmation of the size of the RSV earned by your lease.

          (2) If you produced from a qualified phase 2 or phase 3 ultra-deep well before December 18, 2008, you must provide the information in paragraph (c)(1) of this section no later than January 20, 2009.

          (d) If you cannot produce from a well that otherwise meets the criteria for a qualified phase 2 ultra-deep well that is an ultra-deep short sidetrack before May 3, 2009, on a lease that is located entirely or partly in water less than 200 meters deep, or before May 3, 2013, on a lease that is located entirely in water more than 200 meters but less than 400 meters deep, the BSEE Regional Supervisor for Production and Development may extend the deadline for beginning production for up to 1 year, based on the circumstances of the particular well involved, if it meets all the following criteria.

          (1) The delay occurred after drilling reached the total depth in your well.

          (2) Production (other than test production) was expected to begin from the well before May 3, 2009, on a lease that is located entirely or partly in water less than 200 meters deep or before May 3, 2013, on a lease that is located entirely in water more than 200 meters but less than 400 meters deep. You must provide a credible activity schedule with supporting documentation.

          (3) The delay in beginning production is for reasons beyond your control, such as adverse weather and accidents which BSEE deems were unavoidable.

          § 203.36   Do I keep royalty relief if prices rise significantly?

#### § § 203.36

          (a) You must pay the Office of Natural Resources Revenue royalties on all gas production to which an RSV otherwise would be applied under § 203.33 for any calendar year in which the average daily closing New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) natural gas price exceeds the applicable threshold price shown in the following table.

          (b) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, determine the threshold price for any calendar year after 2007 by:

          (1) Determining the percentage of change during the year in the Department of Commerce's implicit price deflator for the gross domestic product; and

          (2) Adjusting the threshold price for the previous year by that percentage.

          (c) The following examples illustrate how this section applies.

          (d) You must pay any royalty due under this section no later than March 31 of the year following the calendar year for which you owe royalty. If you do not pay by that date, you must pay late payment interest under 30 CFR 1218.54 from April 1 until the date of payment.

          (e) Production volumes on which you must pay royalty under this section count as part of your RSV.

        Royalty Relief for Drilling Deep Gas Wells on Leases Not Subject to Deep Water Royalty Relief

          § 203.40   Which leases are eligible for royalty relief as a result of drilling a deep well or a phase 1 ultra-deep well?

#### § § 203.40

          Your lease may receive an RSV under §§ 203.41 through 203.44, and may receive an RSS under §§ 203.45 through 203.47, if it meets all the requirements of this section.

          (a) The lease is located in the GOM wholly west of 87 degrees, 30 minutes West longitude in water depths entirely less than 400 meters deep.

          (b) The lease has not produced gas or oil from a well with a perforated interval the top of which is 18,000 feet TVD SS or deeper that commenced drilling either:

          (1) Before March 26, 2003, on a lease that is located partly or entirely in water less than 200 meters deep; or

          (2) Before May 18, 2007, on a lease that is located in water entirely more than 200 meters and entirely less than 400 meters deep.

          (c) In the case of a lease located partly or entirely in water less than 200 meters deep, the lease was issued in a lease sale held either:

          (1) Before January 1, 2001;

          (2) On or after January 1, 2001, and before January 1, 2004, and, in cases where the original lease terms provided for an RSV for deep gas production, the lessee has exercised the option provided for in § 203.49; or

          (3) On or after January 1, 2004, and the lease terms provide for royalty relief under §§ 203.41 through 203.47. (Note: Because the original § 203.41 has been divided into new §§ 203.41 and 203.42 and subsequent sections have been redesignated as §§ 203.43 through 203.48, royalty relief in lease terms for leases issued on or after January 1, 2004, should be read as referring to §§ 203.41 through 203.48.)

          (d) If the lease is located entirely in more than 200 meters and less than 400 meters of water, it must either:

          (1) Have been issued before November 28, 1995, and not been granted deep water royalty relief under 43 U.S.C. 1337(a)(3)(C), added by section 302 of the Deep Water Royalty Relief Act; or

          (2) Have been issued after November 28, 2000, and not been granted deep water royalty relief under §§ 203.60 through 203.79.

          § 203.41   If I have a qualified deep well or a qualified phase 1 ultra-deep well, what royalty relief would my lease earn?

#### § § 203.41

          (a) To qualify for a suspension volume under paragraphs (b) or (c) of this section, your lease must meet the requirements in § 203.40 and the requirements in the following table.

          (b) If your lease meets the requirements in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, it earns the RSV prescribed in the following table:

          (c) If your lease meets the requirements in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, it earns the RSV prescribed in the following table. The RSV specified in this paragraph is in addition to any RSV your lease already may have earned from a qualified deep well with a perforated interval whose top is from 15,000 feet to less than 18,000 feet TVD SS.

          (d) Lessees may request a refund of or recoup royalties paid on production from qualified wells on a lease that is located in water entirely deeper than 200 meters but entirely less than 400 meters deep that:

          (1) Occurs before December 18, 2008; and

          (2) Is subject to application of an RSV under either § 203.31 or § 203.41.

          (e) The following examples illustrate how this section applies, assuming your lease meets the location, prior production, and lease issuance conditions in § 203.40 and paragraph (a) of this section:

          § 203.42   What conditions and limitations apply to royalty relief for deep wells and phase 1 ultra-deep wells?

#### § § 203.42

          The conditions and limitations in the following table apply to royalty relief under § 203.41.

          § 203.43   To which production do I apply the RSV earned from qualified deep wells or qualified phase 1 ultra-deep wells on my lease?

#### § § 203.43

          (a) You must apply the RSV prescribed in § 203.41(b) and (c) to gas volumes produced from qualified wells on or after May 3, 2004, reported on the OGOR-A for your lease under 30 CFR 1210.102, as and to the extent prescribed in §§ 203.43 and 203.48.

          (1) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, all gas production from qualified wells reported on the OGOR-A, including production that is not subject to royalty, counts toward the lease RSV.

          (2) Production to which an RSS applies under §§ 203.45 and 203.46 does not count toward the lease RSV.

          (b) This paragraph applies to any lease with a qualified deep well or qualified phase 1 ultra-deep well when no part of the lease is within a BSEE-approved unit. Subject to the price conditions in § 203.48, you must apply the RSV prescribed in § 203.41 as required under the following paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section.

          (1) You must apply the RSV to the earliest gas production occurring on and after the later of:

          (i) May 3, 2004, for an RSV earned by a qualified deep well or qualified phase 1 ultra-deep well on a lease that is located entirely or partly in water less than 200 meters deep;

          (ii) May 18, 2007, for an RSV earned by a qualified deep well on a lease that is located entirely in water more than 200 meters deep; or

          (iii) The date that the first qualified well that earns your lease the RSV begins production (other than test production).

          (2) You must apply the RSV to only gas production from qualified wells on your lease, regardless of their depth, for which you have met the requirements in § 203.35 or § 203.44.

          (c) This paragraph applies to any lease with a qualified deep well or qualified phase 1 ultra-deep well when all or part of the lease is within a BSEE-approved unit. Under the unit agreement, a share of the production from all the qualified wells in the unit participating area would be allocated to your lease each month according to the participating area percentages. Subject to the price conditions in § 203.48, you must apply the RSV prescribed under § 203.41 as required under the following paragraphs (c)(1) through (3) of this section.

          (1) You must apply the RSV to the earliest gas production occurring on and after the later of:

          (i) May 3, 2004, for an RSV earned by a qualified well or qualified phase 1 ultra-deep well on a lease that is located entirely or partly in water less than 200 meters deep;

          (ii) May 18, 2007, for an RSV earned by a qualified deep well on a lease that is located entirely in water more than 200 meters deep; or

          (iii) The date that the first qualified well that earns your lease the RSV begins production (other than test production).

          (2) You must apply the RSV to only gas production:

          (i) From all qualified wells on the non-unitized area of your lease, regardless of their depth, for which you have met the requirements in § 203.35 or § 203.44; and,

          (ii) Allocated to your lease under a BSEE-approved unit agreement from qualified wells on unitized areas of your lease and on unitized areas of other leases in the unit, regardless of their depth, for which the requirements in § 203.35 or § 203.44 have been met.

          (3) The allocated share under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section does not increase the RSV for your lease. None of the volumes produced from a well that is not within a unit participating area may be allocated to other leases in the unit.

          (d) You must begin paying royalties when the cumulative production of gas from all qualified wells on your lease, or allocated to your lease under paragraph (c) of this section, reaches the applicable RSV allowed under § 203.31 or § 203.41. For the month in which cumulative production reaches this RSV, you owe royalties on the portion of gas production that exceeds the RSV remaining at the beginning of that month.

          (e) You may not apply the RSV allowed under § 203.41 to:

          (1) Production from completions less than 15,000 feet TVD SS, except in cases where the qualified deep well is re-perforated in the same reservoir previously perforated deeper than 15,000 feet TVD SS;

          (2) Production from a deep well or phase 1 ultra-deep well on any other lease, except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section;

          (3) Any liquid hydrocarbon (oil and condensate) volumes; or

          (4) Production from a deep well or phase 1 ultra-deep well that commenced drilling before:

          (i) March 26, 2003, on a lease that is located entirely or partly in water less than 200 meters deep, or

          (ii) May 18, 2007, on a lease that is located entirely in water more than 200 meters deep.

          § 203.44   What administrative steps must I take to use the royalty suspension volume?

#### § § 203.44

          (a) You must notify the BSEE Regional Supervisor for Production and Development in writing of your intent to begin drilling operations on all deep wells and phase 1 ultra-deep wells; and

          (b) Within 30 days of the beginning of production from all wells that would become qualified wells by satisfying the requirements of this section, you must:

          (1) Provide written notification to the BSEE Regional Supervisor for Production and Development that production has begun; and

          (2) Request confirmation of the size of the royalty suspension volume earned by your lease.

          (c) Before beginning production, you must meet any production measurement requirements that the BSEE Regional Supervisor for Production and Development has determined are necessary under 30 CFR part 250, subpart L.

          (d) You must provide the information in paragraph (b) of this section by January 20, 2009, if you produced before December 18, 2008, from a qualified deep well or qualified phase 1 ultra-deep well on a lease that is located entirely in water more than 200 meters and less than 400 meters deep.

          (e) The BSEE Regional Supervisor for Production and Development may extend the deadline for beginning production for up to one year for a well that cannot begin production before the applicable date prescribed in the definition of “qualified deep well” in § 203.0 if it meets all of the following criteria.

          (1) The well otherwise meets the criteria in the definition of a qualified deep well in § 203.0.

          (2) The delay in production occurred after reaching total depth in the well.

          (3) Production (other than test production) was expected to begin from the well before the applicable deadline in the definition of a qualified deep well in § 203.0. You must provide a credible activity schedule with supporting documentation.

          (4) The delay in beginning production is for reasons beyond your control, such as adverse weather and accidents which BSEE deems were unavoidable.

          § 203.45   If I drill a certified unsuccessful well, what royalty relief will my lease earn?

#### § § 203.45

          Your lease may earn a royalty suspension supplement. Subject to paragraph (d) of this section, the royalty suspension supplement is in addition to any royalty suspension volume your lease may earn under § 203.41.

          (a) If you drill a certified unsuccessful well and you satisfy the administrative requirements of § 203.47, subject to the price conditions in § 203.48, your lease earns an RSS shown in the following table. The RSS is shown in billions of cubic feet of gas equivalent (BCFE) or in thousands of cubic feet of gas equivalent (MCFE) and is applicable to oil and gas production as prescribed in § 203.46.

          (b) This paragraph applies to oil and gas volumes you report on the OGOR-A for your lease under 30 CFR 1210.102.

          (1) You must apply the RSS prescribed in paragraph (a) of this section, in accordance with the requirements in § 203.46, to all oil and gas produced from the lease:

          (i) On or after December 18, 2008, if your lease is located in water more than 200 meters but less than 400 meters deep; or

          (ii) On or after May 3, 2004, if your lease is located in water partly or entirely less than 200 meters deep.

          (2) Production to which an RSV applies under §§ 203.31 through 203.33 and §§ 203.41 through 203.43 does not count toward the lease RSS. All other production, including production that is not subject to royalty, counts toward the lease RSS.

          (c) The conversion from oil to gas for using the royalty suspension supplement is specified in § 203.73.

          (d) Each lease is eligible for up to two royalty suspension supplements. Therefore, the total royalty suspension supplement for a lease cannot exceed 10 BCFE.

          (1) You may not earn more than one royalty suspension supplement from a single wellbore.

          (2) If you begin drilling a certified unsuccessful well on one lease but the completion target is on a second lease, the entire royalty suspension supplement belongs to the second lease. However, if the target straddles a lease line, the lease where the surface of the well is located earns the royalty suspension supplement.

          (e) If the same wellbore that earns an RSS as a certified unsuccessful well later produces from a perforated interval the top of which is 15,000 feet TVD or deeper and becomes a qualified well, it will be subject to the following conditions:

          (1) Beginning on the date production starts, you must stop applying the royalty suspension supplement earned by that wellbore to your lease production.

          (2) If the completion of this qualified well is on your lease or, in the case of a directional well, is on another lease, then you must subtract from the royalty suspension volume earned by that qualified well the royalty suspension supplement amounts earned by that wellbore that have already been applied either on your lease or any other lease. The difference represents the royalty suspension volume earned by the qualified well.

          (f) If the same wellbore that earned a royalty suspension supplement later has a sidetrack drilled from that wellbore, you are not required to subtract any royalty suspension supplement earned by that wellbore from the royalty suspension volume that may be earned by the sidetrack.

          (g) You owe minimum royalties or rentals in accordance with your lease terms notwithstanding any royalty suspension supplements under this section.

          § 203.46   To which production do I apply the royalty suspension supplements from drilling one or two certified unsuccessful wells on my lease?

#### § § 203.46

          (a) Subject to the requirements of §§ 203.40, 203.43, 203.45, 203.47, and 203.48 you must apply an RSS in § 203.45 to the earliest oil and gas production:

          (1) Occurring on and after the day you file the information under § 203.47(b),

          (2) From, or allocated under a BSEE-approved unit agreement to, the lease on which the certified unsuccessful well was drilled, without regard to the drilling depth of the well producing the gas or oil.

          (b) If you have a royalty suspension volume for the lease under § 203.41, you must use the royalty suspension volumes for gas produced from qualified wells on the lease before using royalty suspension supplements for gas produced from qualified wells.

          (c) If you have no current production on which to apply the RSS allowed under § 203.45, your RSS applies to the earliest subsequent production of gas and oil from, or allocated under a BSEE-approved unit agreement to, your lease.

          (d) Unused royalty suspension supplements transfer to a successor lessee and expire with the lease.

          (e) You may not apply the RSS allowed under § 203.45 to production from any other lease, except for production allocated to your lease from a BSEE-approved unit agreement. If your certified unsuccessful well is on a lease subject to a BSEE-approved unit agreement, the lessees of other leases in the unit may not apply any portion of the RSS for your lease to production from the other leases in the unit.

          (f) You must begin or resume paying royalties when cumulative gas and oil production from, or allocated under a BSEE-approved unit agreement to, your lease (excluding any gas produced from qualified wells subject to a royalty suspension volume allowed under § 203.41) reaches the applicable royalty suspension supplement. For the month in which the cumulative production reaches this royalty suspension supplement, you owe royalties on the portion of gas or oil production that exceeds the amount of the royalty suspension supplement remaining at the beginning of that month.

          § 203.47   What administrative steps do I take to obtain and use the royalty suspension supplement?

#### § § 203.47

          (a) Before you start drilling a well on your lease targeted to a reservoir at least 18,000 feet TVD SS, you must notify, in writing, the BSEE Regional Supervisor for Production and Development of your intent to begin drilling operations and the depth of the target.

          (b) After drilling the well, you must provide the BSEE Regional Supervisor for Production and Development within 60 days after reaching the total depth in your well:

          (1) Information that allows BSEE to confirm that you drilled a certified unsuccessful well as defined under § 203.0, including:

          (i) Well log data, if your original well or sidetrack does not meet the producibility requirements of 30 CFR part 550, subpart A; or

          (ii) Well log, well test, seismic, and economic data, if your well does meet the producibility requirements of 30 CFR part 550, subpart A; and

          (2) Information that allows BSEE to confirm the size of the royalty suspension supplement for a sidetrack, including sidetrack measured depth and supporting documentation.

          (c) If you commenced drilling a well that otherwise meets the criteria for a certified unsuccessful well on a lease located entirely in more than 200 meters and entirely less than 400 meters of water on or after May 18, 2007, and finished it before December 18, 2008, you must provide the information in paragraph (b) of this section no later than February 17, 2009.

          § 203.48   Do I keep royalty relief if prices rise significantly?

#### § § 203.48

          (a) You must pay royalties on all gas and oil production for which an RSV or an RSS otherwise would be allowed under §§ 203.40 through 203.47 for any calendar year when the average daily closing NYMEX natural gas price exceeds the applicable threshold price shown in the following table.

          (b) Determine the threshold price for any calendar year after 2007 by adjusting the threshold price in the previous year by the percentage that the implicit price deflator for the gross domestic product, as published by the Department of Commerce, changed during the calendar year.

          (c) You must pay any royalty due under this section no later than March 31 of the year following the calendar year for which you owe royalty. If you do not pay by that date, you must pay late payment interest under 30 CFR 1218.54 from April 1 until the date of payment.

          (d) Production volumes on which you must pay royalty under this section count as part of your RSV and RSS.

          § 203.49   May I substitute the deep gas drilling provisions in this part for the deep gas royalty relief provided in my lease terms?

#### § § 203.49

          (a) You may exercise an option to replace the applicable lease terms for royalty relief related to deep-well drilling with those in § 203.0 and §§ 203.40 through 203.48 if you have a lease issued with royalty relief provisions for deep-well drilling. Such leases:

          (1) Must be issued as part of an OCS lease sale held after January 1, 2001, and before April 1, 2004; and

          (2) Must be located wholly west of 87 degrees, 30 minutes West longitude in the GOM entirely or partly in water less than 200 meters deep.

          (b) To exercise the option under paragraph (a) of this section, you must notify, in writing, the BSEE Regional Supervisor for Production and Development of your decision before September 1, 2004, or 180 days after your lease is issued, whichever is later, and specify the lease and block number.

          (c) Once you exercise the option under paragraph (a) of this section, you are subject to all the activity, timing, and administrative requirements pertaining to deep gas royalty relief as specified in §§ 203.40 through 203.48.

          (d) Exercising the option under paragraph (a) of this section is irrevocable. If you do not exercise this option, then the terms of your lease apply.

        Royalty Relief for End-of-Life Leases

          § 203.50   Who may apply for end-of-life royalty relief?

#### § § 203.50

          You may apply for royalty relief in two situations.

          (a) Your end-of-life lease (as defined in § 203.2) is an oil and gas lease and has average daily production of at least 100 barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) per month (as calculated in § 203.73) in at least 12 of the past 15 months. The most recent of these 12 months are considered the qualifying months. These 12 months should reflect the basic operation you intend to use until your resources are depleted. If you changed your operation significantly (e.g., begin re-injecting rather than recovering gas) during the qualifying months, or if you do so while we are processing your application, we may defer action on your application until you revise it to show the new circumstances.

          (b) Your end-of-life lease is other than an oil and gas lease (e.g., sulphur) and has production in at least 12 of the past 15 months. The most recent of these 12 months are considered the qualifying months.

          § 203.51   How do I apply for end-of-life royalty relief?

#### § § 203.51

          You must submit a complete application and the required fee to the appropriate BSEE Regional Director. Your BSEE regional office will provide specific guidance on the report formats. A complete application for relief includes:

          (a) An administrative information report (specified in § 203.83) and

          (b) A net revenue and relief justification report (specified in § 203.84).

          § 203.52   What criteria must I meet to get relief?

#### § § 203.52

          (a) To qualify for relief, you must demonstrate that the sum of royalty payments over the 12 qualifying months exceeds 75 percent of the sum of net revenues (before-royalty revenues minus allowable costs, as defined in § 203.84).

          (b) To re-qualify for relief, e.g., either applying for additional relief on top of relief already granted, or applying for relief sometime after your earlier agreement terminated, you must demonstrate that:

          (1) You have met the criterion listed in paragraph (a) of this section, and

          (2) The 12 required qualifying months of operation have occurred under the current royalty arrangement.

          § 203.53   What relief will BSEE grant?

#### § § 203.53

          (a) If we approve your application and you meet certain conditions, we will reduce the pre-application effective royalty rate by one-half on production up to the relief volume amount. If you produce more than the relief volume amount:

          (1) We will impose a royalty rate equal to 1.5 times the effective royalty rate on your additional production up to twice the relief volume amount; and

          (2) We will impose a royalty rate equal to the effective rate on all production greater than twice the relief volume amount.

          (b) Regardless of the level of production or prices (see § 203.54), royalty payments due under end-of-life relief will not exceed the royalty obligations that would have been due at the effective royalty rate.

          (1) The effective royalty rate is the average lease rate paid on production during the 12 qualifying months.

          (2) The relief volume amount is the average monthly BOE production for the 12 qualifying months.

          § 203.54   How does my relief arrangement for an oil and gas lease operate if prices rise sharply?

#### § § 203.54

          In those months when your current reference price rises by at least 25 percent above your base reference price, you must pay the effective royalty rate on all monthly production.

          (a) Your current reference price is a weighted average of daily closing prices on the NYMEX for light sweet crude oil and natural gas over the most recent full 12 calendar months;

          (b) Your base reference price is a weighted average of daily closing prices on the NYMEX for light sweet crude oil and natural gas during the qualifying months; and

          (c) Your weighting factors are the proportions of your total production volume (in BOE) provided by oil and gas during the qualifying months.

          § 203.55   Under what conditions can my end-of-life royalty relief arrangement for an oil and gas lease be ended?

#### § § 203.55

          (a) If you have an end-of-life royalty relief arrangement, you may renounce it at any time. The lease rate will return to the effective rate during the qualifying period in the first full month following our receipt of your renouncement of the relief arrangement.

          (b) If you pay the effective lease rate for 12 consecutive months, we will terminate your relief. The lease rate will return to the effective rate in the first full month following this termination.

          (c) We may stipulate in the letter of approval for individual cases certain events that would cause us to terminate relief because they are inconsistent with an end-of-life situation.

          § 203.56   Does relief transfer when a lease is assigned?

#### § § 203.56

          Yes. Royalty relief is based on the lease circumstances, not ownership. It transfers upon lease assignment.

        Royalty Relief for Pre-Act Deep Water Leases and for Development and Expansion Projects

          § 203.60   Who may apply for royalty relief on a case-by-case basis in deep water in the Gulf of Mexico or offshore of Alaska?

#### § § 203.60

          You may apply for royalty relief under §§ 203.61(b) and 203.62 for an individual lease, unit or project if you:

          (a) Hold a pre-Act lease (as defined in § 203.0) that we have assigned to an authorized field (as defined in § 203.0);

          (b) Propose an expansion project (as defined in § 203.0); or

          (c) Propose a development project (as defined in § 203.0).

          § 203.61   How do I assess my chances for getting relief?

#### § § 203.61

          You may ask for a nonbinding assessment (a formal opinion on whether a field would qualify for royalty relief) before turning in your first complete application on an authorized field. This field must have a qualifying well under 30 CFR part 550, subpart A, or be on a lease that has allocated production under an approved unit agreement.

          (a) To request a nonbinding assessment, you must:

          (1) Submit a draft application in the format and detail specified in guidance from the BSEE regional office for the GOM;

          (2) Propose to drill at least one more appraisal well if you get a favorable assessment; and

          (3) Pay a fee under § 203.3.

          (b) You must wait at least 90 days after receiving our assessment to apply for relief under § 203.62.

          (c) This assessment is not binding because a complete application may contain more accurate information that does not support our original assessment. It will help you decide whether your proposed inputs for evaluating economic viability and your supporting data and assumptions are adequate.

          § 203.62   How do I apply for relief?

#### § § 203.62

          (a) You must send a complete application and the required fee to the BSEE Regional Director for your region.

          (b) Your application for royalty relief offshore Alaska or in deep water in the GOM must include an original and two copies (one set of digital information) of:

          (1) Administrative information report;

          (2) Economic viability and relief justification report;

          (3) G&G report;

          (4) Engineering report;

          (5) Production report; and

          (6) Cost report.

          (c) Section 203.82 explains why we are authorized to require these reports.

          (d) Sections 203.81, 203.83, and 203.85 through 203.89 describe what these reports must include. The BSEE regional office for your region will guide you on the format for the required reports, and we encourage you to contact this office before preparing your application for this guidance.

          § 203.63   Does my application have to include all leases in the field?

#### § § 203.63

          (a) For authorized fields, we will accept only one joint application for all leases that are part of the designated field on the date of application, except as provided in paragraph (a)(3) of this section and § 203.64. However, we will evaluate all acreage that may eventually become part of the authorized field. Therefore, if you have any other leases that you believe may eventually be part of the authorized field, you must submit data for these leases according to § 203.81.

          (1) The Regional Director maintains a Field Names Master List with updates of all leases in each designated field.

          (2) To avoid sharing proprietary data with other lessees on the field, you may submit your proprietary G&G report separately from the rest of your application. Your application is not complete until we receive all the required information for each lease on the field. We will not disclose proprietary data when explaining our assumptions and reasons for our determinations under § 203.67.

          (3) We will not require a joint application if you show good cause and honest effort to get all lessees in the field to participate. If you must exclude a lease from your application because its lessee will not participate, that lease is ineligible for the royalty relief for the designated field.

          (b) If your application seeks only relief for a development project or an expansion project, your application does not have to include all leases in the field.

          § 203.64   How many applications may I file on a field or a development project?

#### § § 203.64

          You may file one complete application for royalty relief during the life of the field or for a development project or an expansion project designed to produce a reservoir or set of reservoirs. However, you may send another application if:

          (a) You are eligible to apply for a redetermination under § 203.74;

          (b) You apply for royalty relief for an expansion project;

          (c) You withdraw the application before we make a determination; or

          (d) You apply for end-of-life royalty relief.

          § 203.65   How long will BSEE take to evaluate my application?

#### § § 203.65

          (a) We will determine within 20 working days if your application for royalty relief is complete. If your application is incomplete, we will explain in writing what it needs. If you withdraw a complete application, you may reapply.

          (b) We will evaluate your first application on a field within 180 days, evaluate your first application on a development project or an expansion project within 150 days and evaluate a redetermination under § 203.75 within 120 days after we determine that it is complete.

          (c) We may ask to extend the review period for your application under the conditions in the following table.

          (d) We may change your assumptions under § 203.62 if our technical evaluation reveals others that are more appropriate. We may consult with you before a final decision and will explain any changes.

          (e) We will notify all designated lease operators within a field when royalty relief is granted.

          § 203.66   What happens if BSEE does not act in the time allowed?

#### § § 203.66

          If we do not act within the timeframes established under § 203.65, you get royalty relief according to the following table.

          § 203.67   What economic criteria must I meet to get royalty relief on an authorized field or project?

#### § § 203.67

          We will not approve applications if we determine that royalty relief cannot make the field, development project, or expansion project economically viable. Your field or project must be uneconomic while you are paying royalties and must become economic with royalty relief.

          § 203.68   What pre-application costs will BSEE consider in determining economic viability?

#### § § 203.68

          (a) We will not consider ineligible costs as set forth in § 203.89(h) in determining economic viability for purposes of royalty relief.

          (b) We will consider sunk costs according to the following table.

          § 203.69   If my application is approved, what royalty relief will I receive?

#### § § 203.69

          If we approve your application, subject to certain conditions, we will not collect royalties on a specified suspension volume for your field, development project, or expansion project. Suspension volumes include volumes allocated to a lease under an approved unit agreement, but exclude any volumes of production that are not normally royalty-bearing under the lease or the regulations of this chapter (e.g., fuel gas).

          (a) For authorized fields, the minimum royalty-suspension volumes are:

          (1) 17.5 million barrels of oil equivalent (MMBOE) for fields in 200 to 400 meters of water;

          (2) 52.5 MMBOE for fields in 400 to 800 meters of water; and

          (3) 87.5 MMBOE for fields in more than 800 meters of water.

          (b) For development projects, any relief we grant applies only to project wells and replaces the royalty relief, if any, with which we issued your lease.

          (c) If your project is economic given the royalty relief with which we issued your lease, we will reject the application.

          (d) If the lease has earned or may earn deep gas royalty relief under §§ 203.40 through 203.49 or ultra-deep gas royalty relief under §§ 203.30 through 203.36, we will take the deep gas royalty relief or ultra-deep gas royalty relief into account in determining whether further royalty relief for a development project is necessary for production to be economic.

          (e) If neither paragraph (c) nor (d) of this section apply, the  royalty suspension volumes are as shown in the following table:

          (f) If your application includes pre-Act leases in different categories of water depth, we apply the minimum royalty suspension volume for the deepest such lease then assigned to the field. We base the water depth and makeup of a field on the water-depth delineations in the “Lease Terms and Economic Conditions” map and the “Fields Directory” documents and updates in effect at the time your application is deemed complete. These publications are available from the BSEE Gulf of Mexico Regional Office.

          (g) You will get a royalty suspension volume above the minimum if we determine that you need more to make the field or development project economic.

          (h) For expansion projects, the minimum royalty suspension volume equals 10 percent of the median of the distribution of known recoverable resources upon which we based approval of your application from all reservoirs included in your project plus any suspension volumes required under § 203.66. If we determine that your expansion project may be economic only with more relief, we will determine and grant you the royalty suspension volume necessary to make the project economic.

          (i) The royalty suspension volume applicable to specific leases will continue through the end of the month in which cumulative production reaches that volume. You must calculate cumulative production from all the leases in the authorized field or project that are entitled to share the royalty suspension volume.

          § 203.70   What information must I provide after BSEE approves relief?

#### § § 203.70

          You must submit reports to us as indicated in the following table. Sections 203.81, 203.90, and 203.91 describe what these reports must include. The BSEE Regional Office for your region will prescribe the formats.

          § 203.71   How does BSEE allocate a field's suspension volume between my lease and other leases on my field?

#### § § 203.71

          The allocation depends on when production occurs, when we issued the lease, when we assigned it to the field, and whether we award the volume suspension by an approved application or establish it in the lease terms, as prescribed in this section.

          (a) If your authorized field has an approved royalty suspension volume under §§ 203.67 and 203.69, we will suspend payment of royalties on production from all leases in the field that participate in the application until their cumulative production equals the approved volume. The following conditions also apply:

          (b) When a project has more than one lease, the royalty suspension volume for each lease equals that lease's actual production from the project (or production allocated under an approved unit agreement) until total production for all leases in the project equals the project's approved royalty suspension volume.

          (c) You may receive a royalty-suspension volume only if your entire lease is west of 87 degrees, 30 minutes West longitude. If the field lies on both sides of this meridian, only leases located entirely west of the meridian will receive a royalty-suspension volume.

          § 203.72   Can my lease receive more than one suspension volume?

#### § § 203.72

          Yes. You may apply for royalty relief that involves more than one suspension volume under § 203.62 in two circumstances.

          (a) Each field that includes your lease may receive a separate royalty-suspension volume, if it meets the evaluation criteria of § 203.67.

          (b) An expansion project on your lease may receive a separate royalty-suspension volume, even if we have already granted a royalty-suspension volume to the field that encompasses the project. But the reserves associated with the project must not have been part of our original determination, and the project must meet the evaluation criteria of § 203.67.

          § 203.73   How do suspension volumes apply to natural gas?

#### § § 203.73

          You must measure natural gas production under the royalty-suspension volume as follows: 5.62 thousand cubic feet of natural gas, measured in accordance with 30 CFR part 250, subpart L, equals one barrel of oil equivalent.

          § 203.74   When will BSEE reconsider its determination?

#### § § 203.74

          You may request a redetermination after we withdraw approval or after you renounce royalty relief, unless we withdraw approval due to your providing false or intentionally inaccurate information. Under certain conditions you may also request a redetermination if we deny your application or if you want your approved royalty suspension volume to change. In these instances, to be eligible for a redetermination, at least one of the following four conditions must occur.

          (a) You have significant new G&G data and you previously have not either requested a redetermination or reapplied for relief after we withdrew approval or you relinquished royalty relief. “Significant” means that the new G&G data:

          (1) Results from drilling new wells or getting new three-dimensional seismic data and information (but not reinterpreting old data);

          (2) Did not exist at the time of the earlier application; and

          (3) Changes your estimates of gross resource size, quality, or projected flow rates enough to materially affect the results of our earlier determination.

          (b) You demonstrate in your new application that the technology that most efficiently develops this field or lease was not considered or deemed feasible in the original application. Your newly proposed technology must improve the profitability, under equivalent market conditions, of the field or lease relative to the development system proposed in the prior application.

          (c) Your current reference price decreases by more than 25 percent from your base reference price as calculated under this paragraph.

          (1) Your current reference price is a weighted-average of daily closing prices on the NYMEX for light sweet crude oil and natural gas over the most recent full 12 calendar months;

          (2) Your base reference price is a weighted average of daily closing prices on the NYMEX for light sweet crude oil and natural gas for the full 12 calendar months preceding the date of your most recently approved application for this royalty relief; and

          (3) The weighting factors are the proportions of the total production volume (in BOE) for oil and gas associated with the most likely scenario (identified in §§ 203.85 and 203.88) from your most recently approved application for this royalty relief.

          (d) Before starting to build your development and production system, you have revised your estimated development costs, and they are more than 120 percent of the eligible development costs associated with the most likely scenario from your most recently approved application for this royalty relief.

          § 203.75   What risk do I run if I request a redetermination?

#### § § 203.75

          If you request a redetermination after we have granted you a suspension volume, you could lose some or all of the previously granted relief. This can happen because you must file a new complete application and pay the required fee, as discussed in § 203.62. We will evaluate your application under § 203.67 using the conditions prevailing at the time of your redetermination request. In our evaluation, we may find that you should receive a larger, equivalent, smaller, or no suspension volume. This means we could find that you do not qualify for the amount of relief previously granted or for any relief at all.

          § 203.76   When might BSEE withdraw or reduce the approved size of my relief?

#### § § 203.76

          We will withdraw approval of relief for any of the following reasons.

          (a) You change the type of development system proposed in your application (e.g., change from a fixed platform to floating production system, or from an independent development and production system to one with subsea wells tied back to a host production facility, ).

          (b) You do not start building the proposed development and production system within 18 months of the date we approved your application, unless the BSEE Director grants you an extension under § 203.79(c). If you start building the proposed system and then suspend its construction before completion, and you do not restart continuous building of the proposed system within 18 months of our approval, we will withdraw the relief we granted.

          (c) Your actual development costs are less than 80 percent of the eligible development costs estimated in your application's most likely scenario, and you do not report that fact in your post-production development report (§ 203.70). Development costs are those expenditures defined in § 203.89(b) incurred between the application submission date and start of production. If you report this fact in the post-production development report, you may retain the lesser of 50 percent of the original royalty suspension volume or 50 percent of the median of the distribution of the potentially recoverable resources anticipated in your application.

          (d) We granted you a royalty-suspension volume after you qualified for a redetermination under § 203.74(c), and we find out your actual development costs are less than 90 percent of the eligible development costs associated with your application's most likely scenario. Development costs are those expenditures defined in § 203.89(b) incurred between your application submission date and start of production.

          (e) You do not send us the fabrication confirmation report or the post-production development report, or you provide false or intentionally inaccurate information that was material to our granting royalty relief under this section. You must pay royalties and late-payment interest determined under 30 U.S.C. 1721 and 30 CFR 1218.54 on all volumes for which you used the royalty suspension. You also may be subject to penalties under other provisions of law.

          § 203.77   May I voluntarily give up relief if conditions change?

#### § § 203.77

          Yes, you may voluntarily give up relief by sending a letter to that effect to the BSEE Regional office for your region.

          § 203.78   Do I keep relief approved by BSEE under this part for my lease, unit or project if prices rise significantly?

#### § § 203.78

          If prices rise above a base price threshold for light sweet crude oil or natural gas, you must pay full royalties on production otherwise subject to royalty relief approved by BSEE under §§ 203.60-203.77 for your lease, unit or project as prescribed in this section.

          (a) The following table shows the base price threshold for various types of leases, subject to paragraph (b) of this section. Note that, for post-November 2000 deepwater leases in the GOM, price thresholds apply on a lease basis, so different leases on the same development project or expansion project approved for royalty relief may have different price thresholds.

          (b) An exception may occur if we determine that the price thresholds in paragraphs (a)(2) or (a)(3) of this section mean the royalty suspension volume set under § 203.69 and in lease terms would provide inadequate encouragement to increase production or development, in which circumstance we could specify a different set of price thresholds on a case-by-case basis.

          (c) Suppose your base oil price threshold set under paragraph (a) is $28.00 per barrel, and the daily closing NYMEX light sweet crude oil prices for the previous calendar year exceeds $28.00 per barrel, as adjusted in paragraph (h) of this section. In this case, we retract the royalty relief authorized in this subpart and you must:

          (1) Pay royalties on all oil production for the previous year at the lease stipulated royalty rate plus interest (under 30 U.S.C. 1721 and 30 CFR 1218.54) by March 31 of the current calendar year, and

          (2) Pay royalties on all your oil production in the current year.

          (d) Suppose your base gas price threshold set under paragraph (a) is $3.50 per million British thermal units (Btu), and the daily closing NYMEX light sweet crude oil prices for the previous calendar year exceeds $3.50 per million Btu, as adjusted in paragraph (h) of this section. In this case, we retract the royalty relief authorized in this subpart and you must:

          (1) Pay royalties on all gas production for the previous year at the lease stipulated royalty rate plus interest (under 30 U.S.C. 1721 and 30 CFR 1218.54) by March 31 of the current calendar year, and

          (2) Pay royalties on all your gas production in the current year.

          (e) Production under both paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section counts as part of the royalty-suspension volume.

          (f) You are entitled to a refund or credit, with interest, of royalties paid on any production (that counts as part of the royalty-suspension volume):

          (1) Of oil if the arithmetic average of the closing prices for the current calendar year is $28.00 per barrel or less, as adjusted in paragraph (h) of this section, and

          (2) Of gas if the arithmetic average of the closing natural gas prices for the current calendar year is $3.50 per million Btu or less, as adjusted in paragraph (h) of this section.

          (g) You must follow our regulations in the Office of Natural Resources Revenue, 30 CFR chapter XII, for receiving refunds or credits.

          (h) We change the prices referred to in paragraphs (c), (d), and (f) of this section periodically. For pre-Act leases, these prices change during each calendar year after 1994 by the percentage that the implicit price deflator for the gross domestic product changed during the preceding calendar year. For post-November 2000 deepwater leases, these prices change as indicated in the lease instrument or in the Notice of Sale under which we issued the lease.

          § 203.79   How do I appeal BSEE's decisions related to royalty relief for a deepwater lease or a development or expansion project?

#### § § 203.79

          (a) Once we have designated your lease as part of a field and notified you and other affected operators of the designation, you can request reconsideration by sending the BSEE Director a letter within 15 days that also states your reasons. The BSEE Director's response is the final agency action.

          (b) Our decisions on your application for relief from paying royalty under § 203.67 and the royalty-suspension volumes under § 203.69 are final agency actions.

          (c) If you cannot start construction by the deadline in § 203.76(b) for reasons beyond your control (e.g., strike at the fabrication yard), you may request an extension up to 1 year by writing the BSEE Director and stating your reasons. The BSEE Director's response is the final agency action.

          (d) We will notify you of all final agency actions by certified mail, return receipt requested. Final agency actions are not subject to appeal to the Interior Board of Land Appeals under 30 CFR part 290 and 43 CFR part 4. They are judicially reviewable under section 10(a) of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 702)  if you file an action within 30 days of the date you receive our decision.

          § 203.80   When can I get royalty relief if I am not eligible for royalty relief under other sections in the subpart?

#### § § 203.80

          We may grant royalty relief when it serves the statutory purposes summarized in § 203.1 and our formal relief programs, including but not limited to the applicable levels of the royalty suspension volumes and price thresholds, provide inadequate encouragement to promote development or increase production. Unless your lease lies offshore of Alaska or wholly west of 87 degrees, 30 minutes West longitude in the GOM, your lease must be producing to qualify for relief. Before you may apply for royalty relief apart from our programs for end-of-life leases or for pre-Act deep water leases and development and expansion projects, we must agree that your lease or project has two or more of the following characteristics:

          (a) The lease has produced for a substantial period and the lessee can recover significant additional resources. Significant additional resources mean enough to allow production for at least a year more than would be profitable without royalty relief.

          (b) Valuable facilities (e.g., a platform or pipeline that would be removed upon lease relinquishment) exist that we do not expect a successor lessee to use. If the facilities are located off the lease, their preservation must depend on continued production from the lease applying for royalty relief. We will only consider an allocable share of costs for off-lease facilities in the relief application.

          (c) A substantial risk exists that no new lessee will recover the resources.

          (d) The lessee made major efforts to reduce operating costs too recently to use the formal program for royalty relief (e.g., recent significant change in operations).

          (e) Circumstances beyond the lessee's control, other than water depth, preclude reliance on one of the existing royalty relief programs.

        Required Reports

          § 203.81   What supplemental reports do royalty-relief applications require?

#### § § 203.81

          (a) You must send us the supplemental reports, indicated in the following table by an X, that apply to your field. Sections 203.83 through 203.91 describe these reports in detail.

          (b) You must certify that all information in your application, fabricator's confirmation and post-production development reports is accurate, complete, and conforms to the most recent content and presentation guidelines available from the BSEE Regional office for your region.

          (c) With your application and post-production development report, you must submit an additional report prepared by an independent CPA that:

          (1) Assesses the accuracy of the historical financial information in your report; and

          (2) Certifies that the content and presentation of the financial data and information conform to our most recent guidelines on royalty relief. This means the data and information must:

          (i) Include only eligible costs that are incurred during the qualification months; and

          (ii) Be shown in the proper format.

          (d) You must identify the people in the CPA firm who prepared the reports referred to in paragraph (c) of this section and make them available to us to respond to questions about the historical financial information. We may also further review your records to support this information.

          § 203.82   What is BSEE's authority to collect this information?

#### § § 203.82

          The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approved the information collection requirements in part 203 under 44 U.S.C. 3501  and assigned OMB control number 1010-0071.

          (a) We use the information to determine whether royalty relief will result in production that wouldn't otherwise occur. We rely largely on your information to make these determinations.

          (1) Your application for royalty relief must contain enough information on finances, economics, reservoirs, G&G characteristics, production, and engineering estimates for us to determine whether:

          (i) We should grant relief under the law, and

          (ii) The requested relief will ultimately recover more resources and return a reasonable profit on project investments.

          (2) Your fabricator confirmation and post-production development reports must contain enough information for us to verify that your application reasonably represented your plans.

          (b) Applicants (respondents) are Federal OCS oil and gas lessees. Applications are required to obtain or retain a benefit. Therefore, if you apply for royalty relief, you must provide this information. We will protect information considered proprietary under applicable law and under regulations at § 203.63 and 30 CFR part 250.

          (c) The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 requires us to inform you that we may not conduct or sponsor, and you are not required to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number.

          (d) Send comments regarding any aspect of the collection of information under this part, including suggestions for reducing the burden, to the Information Collection Clearance Officer, Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement, 45600 Woodland Road, Sterling, VA 20166.

        Naming and Identifying Facilities and Wells (Does Not Include MODUs)

          § 250.150   How do I name facilities and wells in the Gulf of Mexico Region?

#### § § 250.150

          (a) Assign each facility a letter designation except for those types of facilities identified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. For example, A, B, CA, or CB.

          (1) After a facility is installed, rename each predrilled well that was assigned only a number and was suspended temporarily at the mudline or at the surface. Use a letter and number designation. The letter used must be the same as that of the production facility, and the number used must correspond to the order in which the well was completed, not necessarily the number assigned when it was drilled. For example, the first well completed for production on Facility A would be renamed Well A-1, the second would be Well A-2, and so on; and

          (2) When you have more than one facility on a block, each facility installed, and not bridge-connected to another facility, must be named using a different letter in sequential order. For example, EC 222A, EC 222B, EC 222C.

          (3) When you have more than one facility on multiple blocks in a local area being co-developed, each facility installed and not connected with a walkway to another facility should be named using a different letter in sequential order with the block number corresponding to the block on which the platform is located. For example, EC 221A, EC 222B, and EC 223C.

          (b) In naming multiple well caissons, you must assign a letter designation.

          (c) In naming single well caissons, you must use certain criteria as follows:

          (1) For single well caissons not attached to a facility with a walkway, use the well designation. For example, Well No. 1;

          (2) For single well caissons attached to a facility with a walkway, use the same designation as the facility. For example, rename Well No.10 as A-10; and

          (3) For single well caissons with production equipment, use a letter designation for the facility name and a letter plus number designation for the well. For example, the Well No. 1 caisson would be designated as Facility A, and the well would be Well A-1.

          (2) When helicopter landing facilities are present, you must display an additional identification sign that is visible from the air. The sign must use at least 12-inch letters and figures and must also display the weight capacity of the helipad unless noted on the top of the helipad. If this sign is visible to both helicopter and boat traffic, then the sign in paragraph (a)(1) of this section is not required.

          (3) Your identification sign must:

          (i) List the name of the lessee or designated operator;

          (ii) In the GOM OCS Region, list the area designation or abbreviation and the block number of the facility location as depicted on OCS Official Protraction Diagrams or leasing maps;

          (iii) In the Pacific OCS Region, list the lease number on which the facility is located; and

          (iv) List the name of the platform, structure, artificial island, or mobile offshore drilling unit.

          (b) You must identify singly completed wells and multiple completions as follows:

          (1) For each singly completed well, list the lease number and well number on the wellhead or on a sign affixed to the wellhead;

          (2) For wells with multiple completions, downhole splitter wells, and multilateral wells, identify each completion in addition to the well name and lease number individually on the well flowline at the wellhead; and

          (3) For subsea wells that flow individually into separate pipelines, affix the required sign on the pipeline or surface flowline dedicated to that subsea well at a convenient location on the receiving platform. For multiple subsea wells that flow into a common pipeline or pipelines, no sign is required.

          (a) A suspension may extend the term of a lease (see § 250.180(b), (d), and (e)). The extension is equal to the length of time the suspension is in effect, except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section.

          (b) A Directed Suspension does not extend the term of a lease when the Regional Supervisor  a suspension because of:

          (1) Gross negligence; or

          (2) A willful violation of a provision of the lease or governing statutes and regulations.

          § 250.170   How long does a suspension last?

#### § § 250.170

          (a) BSEE may issue suspensions for up to 5 years per suspension. The Regional Supervisor will set the length of the suspension based on the conditions of the individual case involved. BSEE may grant consecutive suspension periods.

          (b) An SOO ends automatically when the suspended operation commences.

          (c) An SOP ends automatically when production begins.

          (d) A Directed Suspension normally ends as specified in the letter directing the suspension.

          (e) BSEE may terminate any suspension when the Regional Supervisor determines the circumstances that justified the suspension no longer exist or that other lease conditions warrant termination. The Regional Supervisor will notify you of the reasons for termination and the effective date.

          § 250.171   How do I request a suspension?

#### § § 250.171

          You must submit your request for a suspension to the Regional Supervisor, and BSEE must receive the request before the end of the lease term ( end of primary term, end of the 1-year period following the last leaseholding operation, and end of a current suspension). Your request must include:

          (a) The justification for the suspension including the length of suspension requested;

          (b) A reasonable schedule of work leading to the commencement or restoration of the suspended activity;

          (c) A statement that a well has been drilled on the lease and determined to be producible according to § 250.1603 (SOP only), 30 CFR 550.115, or 30 CFR 550.116;

        Primary Lease Requirements, Lease Term Extensions, and Lease Cancellations

          § 250.180   What am I required to do to keep my lease term in effect?

#### § § 250.180

          (a) If your lease is in its primary term:

          (1) You must submit a report to the District Manager according to paragraphs (h) and (i) of this section whenever production begins initially, whenever production ceases during the last year of the primary term, and whenever production resumes during the last year of the primary term.

          (2) Your lease expires at the end of its primary term unless you are conducting _operations_ on your lease (see 30 CFR part 556). For purposes of this section, the term  means, drilling, well-reworking, or production in paying quantities. The objective of the drilling or well-reworking must be to establish production in paying quantities on the lease.

          (b) If you stop conducting operations during the last year of your primary lease term, your lease will expire unless you either resume operations or receive an SOO or an SOP from the Regional Supervisor under § 250.172, § 250.173, § 250.174, or § 250.175 before the end of the year after you stop operations.

          (c) If you extend your lease term under paragraph (b) of this section, you must pay rental or minimum royalty, as appropriate, for each year or part of the year during which your lease continues in force beyond the end of the primary lease term.

          (e) You may ask the Regional Supervisor to allow you more than a year to resume operations on a lease continued beyond its primary term when operating conditions warrant. The request must be in writing and explain the operating conditions that warrant a longer period. In allowing additional time, the Regional Supervisor must determine that the longer period is in the National interest, and it conserves resources, prevents waste, or protects correlative rights.

          (f) When you begin conducting operations on a lease that has continued beyond its primary term, you must immediately notify the District Manager either orally or by fax or e-mail and follow up with a written report according to paragraph (g) of this section.

          (g) If your lease is continued beyond its primary term, you must submit a report to the District Manager under paragraphs (h) and (i) of this section whenever production begins initially, whenever production ceases, whenever production resumes before the end of the 1-year period after having ceased, or whenever drilling or well-reworking operations begin before the end of the 1-year period.

          (h) The reports required by paragraphs (a) and (g) of this section must contain:

          (1) Name of lessee or operator;

          (2) The well number, lease number, area, and block;

          (3) As appropriate, the unit agreement name and number; and

          (4) A description of the operation and pertinent dates.

#### § § 250.300

        (a) During the exploration, development, production, and transportation of oil and gas or sulphur, the lessee shall take measures to prevent unauthorized discharge of pollutants into the offshore waters. The lessee shall not create conditions that will pose unreasonable risk to public health, life, property, aquatic life, wildlife, recreation, navigation, commercial fishing, or other uses of the ocean.

        (1) When pollution occurs as a result of operations conducted by or on behalf of the lessee and the pollution damages or threatens to damage life (including fish and other aquatic life), property, any mineral deposits (in areas leased or not leased), or the marine, coastal, or human environment, the control and removal of the pollution to the satisfaction of the District Manager shall be at the expense of the lessee. Immediate corrective action shall be taken in all cases where pollution has occurred. Corrective action shall be subject to modification when directed by the District Manager.

        (2) If the lessee fails to control and remove the pollution, the Director, in cooperation with other appropriate Agencies of Federal, State, and local governments, or in cooperation with the lessee, or both, shall have the right to control and remove the pollution at the lessee's expense. Such action shall not relieve the lessee of any responsibility provided for by law.

        (b)(1) The District Manager may restrict the rate of drilling fluid discharges or prescribe alternative discharge methods. The District Manager may also restrict the use of components that could cause unreasonable degradation to the marine environment. No petroleum-based substances, including diesel fuel, may be added to the drilling mud system without prior approval of the District Manager. For Arctic OCS exploratory drilling, you must capture all petroleum-based mud to prevent its discharge into the marine environment. The Regional Supervisor may also require you to capture, during your Arctic OCS exploratory drilling operations, all water-based mud from operations after completion of the hole for the conductor casing to prevent its discharge into the marine environment, based on various factors including, but not limited to:

        (i) The proximity of your exploratory drilling operation to subsistence hunting and fishing locations;

        (ii) The extent to which discharged mud may cause marine mammals to alter their migratory patterns in a manner that impedes subsistence users' access to, or use of, those resources, or increases the risk of injury to subsistence users; or

        (iii) The extent to which discharged mud may adversely affect marine mammals, fish, or their habitat.

        (2) You must obtain approval from the District Manager of the method you plan to use to dispose of drill cuttings, sand, and other well solids. For Arctic OCS exploratory drilling, you must capture all cuttings from operations that utilize petroleum-based mud to prevent their discharge into the marine environment. The Regional Supervisor may also require you to capture, during your Arctic OCS exploratory drilling operations, all cuttings from operations that utilize water-based mud after completion of the hole for the conductor casing to prevent their discharge into the marine environment, based on various factors including, but not limited to:

        (i) The proximity of your exploratory drilling operation to subsistence hunting and fishing locations;

        (ii) The extent to which discharged cuttings may cause marine mammals to alter their migratory patterns in a manner that impedes subsistence users' access to, or use of, those resources, or increases the risk of injury to subsistence users; or

        (iii) The extent to which discharged cuttings may adversely affect marine mammals, fish, or their habitat.

        (3) All hydrocarbon-handling equipment for testing and production such as separators, tanks, and treaters shall be designed, installed, and operated to prevent pollution. Maintenance or repairs which are necessary to prevent pollution of offshore waters shall be undertaken immediately.

        (4) Curbs, gutters, drip pans, and drains shall be installed in deck areas in a manner necessary to collect all contaminants not authorized for discharge. Oil drainage shall be piped to a properly designed, operated, and maintained sump system which will automatically maintain the oil at a level sufficient to prevent discharge of oil into offshore waters. All gravity drains shall be equipped with a water trap or other means to prevent gas in the sump system from escaping through the drains. Sump piles shall not be used as processing devices to treat or skim liquids but may be used to collect treated-produced water, treated-produced sand, or liquids from drip pans and deck drains and as a final trap for hydrocarbon liquids in the event of equipment upsets. Improperly designed, operated, or maintained sump piles which do not prevent the discharge of oil into offshore waters shall be replaced or repaired.

        (5) On artificial islands, all vessels containing hydrocarbons shall be placed inside an impervious berm or otherwise protected to contain spills. Drainage shall be directed away from the drilling rig to a sump. Drains and sumps shall be constructed to prevent seepage.

        (6) Disposal of equipment, cables, chains, containers, or other materials into offshore waters is prohibited.

        (c) Materials, equipment, tools, containers, and other items used in the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) which are of such shape or configuration that they are likely to snag or damage fishing devices shall be handled and marked as follows:

        (1) All loose material, small tools, and other small objects shall be kept in a suitable storage area or a marked container when not in use and in a marked container before transport over offshore waters;

        (2) All cable, chain, or wire segments shall be recovered after use and securely stored until suitable disposal is accomplished;

        (3) Skid-mounted equipment, portable containers, spools or reels, and drums shall be marked with the owner's name prior to use or transport over offshore waters; and

        (4) All markings must clearly identify the owner and must be durable enough to resist the effects of the environmental conditions to which they may be exposed.

        (d) Any of the items described in paragraph (c) of this section that are lost overboard shall be recorded on the facility's daily operations report, as appropriate, and reported to the District Manager.

        Casing and Cementing Requirements

          § 250.420   What well casing and cementing requirements must I meet?

#### § § 250.420

          You must case and cement all wells. Your casing and cementing programs must meet the applicable requirements of this subpart and of subpart G of this part.

          (a)  Your casing and cementing programs must:

          (1) Properly control formation pressures and fluids;

          (2) Prevent the direct or indirect release of fluids from any stratum through the wellbore into offshore waters;

          (3) Prevent communication between separate hydrocarbon-bearing strata;

          (4) Protect freshwater aquifers from contamination;

          (5) Support unconsolidated sediments;

          (6) Provide adequate centralization consistent with the guidelines of API Standard 65—Part 2 (as incorporated by reference in § 250.198); and

          (7)(i) Include a certification signed by a registered professional engineer that the casing and cementing design is appropriate for the purpose for which it is intended under expected wellbore conditions, and is sufficient to satisfy the tests and requirements of this section and § 250.423. Submit this certification with your APD (Form BSEE-0123).

          (ii) You must have the registered professional engineer involved in the casing and cementing design process.

          (iii) The registered professional engineer must be registered in a state of the United States and have sufficient expertise and experience to perform the certification.

          (b)  (1) You must design casing (including liners) to withstand the anticipated stresses imposed by tensile, compressive, and buckling loads; burst and collapse pressures; thermal effects; and combinations thereof.

          (2) The casing design must include safety measures that ensure well control during drilling and safe operations during the life of the well.

          (3) On all wells that use subsea BOP stacks, you must include two independent barriers, including one mechanical barrier, in each annular flow path (examples of barriers include, but are not limited to, primary cement job and seal assembly). For the final casing string (or liner if it is your final string), you must install one mechanical barrier in addition to cement to prevent flow in the event of a failure in the cement. A dual float valve, by itself, is not considered a mechanical barrier. These barriers cannot be modified prior to or during completion or abandonment operations. The BSEE District Manager may approve alternative options under § 250.141. You must submit documentation of this installation to BSEE in the End-of-Operations Report (Form BSEE-0125).

          (4) If you need to substitute a different size, grade, or weight of casing than what was approved in your APD, you must contact the District Manager for approval prior to installing the casing.

          (c) . (1) You must design and conduct your cementing jobs so that cement composition, placement techniques, and waiting times ensure that the cement placed behind the bottom 500 feet of casing attains a minimum compressive strength of 500 psi before drilling out the casing or before commencing completion operations. (If a liner is used refer to § 250.421(f)).

          (2) You must use a weighted fluid during displacement to maintain an overbalanced hydrostatic pressure during the cement setting time, except when cementing casings or liners in riserless hole sections.

          § 250.422   When may I resume drilling after cementing?

#### § § 250.422

          (a) After cementing surface, intermediate, or production casing (or liners), you may resume drilling after the cement has been held under pressure for 12 hours. For conductor casing, you may resume drilling after the cement has been held under pressure for 8 hours. One acceptable method of holding cement under pressure is to use float valves to hold the cement in place.

          (b) If you plan to nipple down your diverter or BOP stack during the 8- or 12-hour waiting time, you must determine, before nippling down, when it will be safe to do so. You must base your determination on a knowledge of formation conditions, cement composition, effects of nippling down, presence of potential drilling hazards, well conditions during drilling, cementing, and post cementing, as well as past experience.

          § 250.423   What are the requirements for casing and liner installation?

#### § § 250.423

          You must ensure proper installation of casing in the subsea wellhead or liner in the liner hanger.

          (a) You must ensure that the latching mechanisms or lock down mechanisms are engaged upon successfully installing the casing string.

          (b) If you run a liner that has a latching mechanism or lock down mechanism, you must ensure that the latching mechanisms or lock down mechanisms are engaged upon successfully installing the liner.

          (c) You must perform a pressure test on the casing seal assembly to ensure proper installation of casing or liner. You must perform this test for the intermediate and production casing strings or liners.

          (1) You must submit for approval with your APD, test procedures and criteria for a successful test.

          (2) You must document all your test results and make them available to BSEE upon request.

          § 250.427   What are the requirements for pressure integrity tests?

#### § § 250.427

          You must conduct a pressure integrity test below the surface casing or liner and all intermediate casings or liners. The District Manager may require you to run a pressure-integrity test at the conductor casing shoe if warranted by local geologic conditions or the planned casing setting depth. You must conduct each pressure integrity test after drilling at least 10 feet but no more than 50 feet of new hole below the casing shoe. You must test to either the formation leak-off pressure or to an equivalent drilling fluid weight if identified in an approved APD.

          (a) You must use the pressure integrity test and related hole-behavior observations, such as pore-pressure test results, gas-cut drilling fluid, and well kicks to adjust the drilling fluid program and the setting depth of the next casing string. You must record all test results and hole-behavior observations made during the course of drilling related to formation integrity and pore pressure in the driller's report.

          (b) While drilling, you must maintain the safe drilling margin identified in § 250.414. When you cannot maintain the safe drilling margin, you must:

          (1) Suspend drilling operations and submit proposed remedial actions to the District Manager. The District Manager must review and approve your proposed remedial actions, which may include limited drilling through a lost circulation zone; or

          (2) Notify the District Manager and take further action in accordance with API Bulletin 92L (as incorporated by reference in § 250.198), if appropriate. You must submit a revised permit documenting any responsive actions taken.

        Diverter System Requirements

          § 250.430   When must I install a diverter system?

#### § § 250.430

          You must install a diverter system before you drill a conductor or surface hole. The diverter system consists of a diverter sealing element, diverter lines, and control systems. You must design, install, use, maintain, and test the diverter system to ensure proper diversion of gases, water, drilling fluid, and other materials away from facilities and personnel.

          § 250.431   What are the diverter design and installation requirements?

#### § § 250.431

          You must design and install your diverter system to:

          (a) Use diverter spool outlets and diverter lines that have a nominal diameter of at least 10 inches for surface wellhead configurations and at least 12 inches for floating drilling operations;

          (b) Use dual diverter lines arranged to provide for downwind diversion capability;

          (c) Use at least two diverter control stations. One station must be on the drilling floor. The other station must be in a readily accessible location away from the drilling floor;

          (d) Use only remote-controlled valves in the diverter lines. All valves in the diverter system must be full-opening. You may not install manual or butterfly valves in any part of the diverter system;

          (e) Minimize the number of turns (only one 90-degree turn allowed for each line for bottom-founded drilling units) in the diverter lines, maximize the radius of curvature of turns, and target all right angles and sharp turns;

          (f) Anchor and support the entire diverter system to prevent whipping and vibration; and

          (g) Protect all diverter-control instruments and lines from possible damage by thrown or falling objects.

          § 250.432   How do I obtain a departure to diverter design and installation requirements?

#### § § 250.432

          The table below describes possible departures from the diverter requirements and the conditions required for each departure. To obtain one of these departures, you must have discussed the departure in your APD and received approval from the District Manager.

          § 250.433   What are the diverter actuation and testing requirements?

#### § § 250.433

          When you install the diverter system, you must actuate the diverter sealing element, diverter valves, and diverter-control systems and control stations. You must also flow-test the vent lines.

          (a) For drilling operations with a surface wellhead configuration, you must actuate the diverter system at least once every 24-hour period after the initial test. After you have nippled up on conductor casing, you must pressure-test the diverter-sealing element and diverter valves to a minimum of 200 psi. While the diverter is installed, you must conduct subsequent pressure tests within 7 days after the previous test.

          (b) For floating drilling operations with a subsea BOP stack, you must actuate the diverter system within 7 days after the previous actuation. For subsequent testing, you may partially actuate the diverter element and a flow test is not required.

          (c) You must alternate actuations and tests between control stations.

        Drilling Fluid Requirements

          § 250.455   What are the general requirements for a drilling fluid program?

#### § § 250.455

          You must design and implement your drilling fluid program to prevent the loss of well control. This program must address drilling fluid safe practices, testing and monitoring equipment, drilling fluid quantities, and drilling fluid-handling areas.

          § 250.456   What safe practices must the drilling fluid program follow?

#### § § 250.456

          Your drilling fluid program must include the following safe practices:

          (a) Before starting out of the hole with drill pipe, you must properly condition the drilling fluid. You must circulate a volume of drilling fluid equal to the annular volume with the drill pipe just off-bottom. You may omit this practice if documentation in the driller's report shows:

          (1) No indication of formation fluid influx before starting to pull the drill pipe from the hole;

          (2) The weight of returning drilling fluid is within 0.2 pounds per gallon (1.5 pounds per cubic foot) of the drilling fluid entering the hole; and

          (3) Other drilling fluid properties are within the limits established by the program approved in the APD.

          (b) Record each time you circulate drilling fluid in the hole in the driller's report;

          (c) When coming out of the hole with drill pipe, you must fill the annulus with drilling fluid before the hydrostatic pressure decreases by 75 psi, or every five stands of drill pipe, whichever gives a lower decrease in hydrostatic pressure. You must calculate the number of stands of drill pipe and drill collars that you may pull before you must fill the hole. You must also calculate the equivalent drilling fluid volume needed to fill the hole. Both sets of numbers must be posted near the driller's station. You must use a mechanical, volumetric, or electronic device to measure the drilling fluid required to fill the hole;

          (d) You must run and pull drill pipe and downhole tools at controlled rates so you do not swab or surge the well;

          (e) When there is an indication of swabbing or influx of formation fluids, you must take appropriate measures to control the well. You must circulate and condition the well, on or near-bottom, unless well or drilling-fluid conditions prevent running the drill pipe back to the bottom;

          (f) You must calculate and post near the driller's console the maximum pressures that you may safely contain under a shut-in BOP for each casing string. The pressures posted must consider the surface pressure at which the formation at the shoe would break down, the rated working pressure of the BOP stack, and 70 percent of casing burst (or casing test as approved by the District Manager). As a minimum, you must post the following two pressures:

          (1) The surface pressure at which the shoe would break down. This calculation must consider the current drilling fluid weight in the hole; and

          (2) The lesser of the BOP's rated working pressure or 70 percent of casing-burst pressure (or casing test otherwise approved by the District Manager);

          (g) You must install an operable drilling fluid-gas separator and degasser before you begin drilling operations. You must maintain this equipment throughout the drilling of the well;

          (h) Before pulling drill-stem test tools from the hole, you must circulate or reverse-circulate the test fluids in the hole. If circulating out test fluids is not feasible, you may bullhead test fluids out of the drill-stem test string and tools with an appropriate kill weight fluid;

          (i) When circulating, you must test the drilling fluid at least once each tour, or more frequently if conditions warrant. Your tests must conform to industry-accepted practices and include density, viscosity, and gel strength; hydrogenion concentration; filtration; and any other tests the District Manager requires for monitoring and maintaining drilling fluid quality, prevention of downhole equipment problems and for kick detection. You must record the results of these tests in the drilling fluid report; and

          (j) In areas where permafrost and/or hydrate zones are present or may be present, you must control drilling fluid temperatures to drill safely through those zones.

          § 250.457   What equipment is required to monitor drilling fluids?

#### § § 250.457

          Once you establish drilling fluid returns, you must install and maintain the following drilling fluid-system monitoring equipment throughout subsequent drilling operations. This equipment must have the following indicators on the rig floor:

          (a) Pit level indicator to determine drilling fluid-pit volume gains and losses. This indicator must include both a visual and an audible warning device;

          (b) Volume measuring device to accurately determine drilling fluid volumes required to fill the hole on trips;

          (c) Return indicator devices that indicate the relationship between drilling fluid-return flow rate and pump discharge rate. This indicator must include both a visual and an audible warning device; and

          (d) Gas-detecting equipment to monitor the drilling fluid returns. The indicator may be located in the drilling fluid-logging compartment or on the rig floor. If the indicators are only in the logging compartment, you must continually man the equipment and have a means of immediate communication with the rig floor. If the indicators are on the rig floor only, you must install an audible alarm.

          § 250.458   What quantities of drilling fluids are required?

#### § § 250.458

          (a) You must use, maintain, and replenish quantities of drilling fluid and drilling fluid materials at the drill site as necessary to ensure well control. You must determine those quantities based on known or anticipated drilling conditions, rig storage capacity, weather conditions, and estimated time for delivery.

          (b) You must record the daily inventories of drilling fluid and drilling fluid materials, including weight materials and additives in the drilling fluid report.

          (c) If you do not have sufficient quantities of drilling fluid and drilling fluid material to maintain well control, you must suspend drilling operations.

          § 250.459   What are the safety requirements for drilling fluid-handling areas?

#### § § 250.459

          You must classify drilling fluid-handling areas according to API RP 500, Recommended Practice for Classification of Locations for Electrical Installations at Petroleum Facilities, Classified as Class I, Division 1 and Division 2 (as incorporated by reference in § 250.198); or API RP 505, Recommended Practice for Classification of Locations for Electrical Installations at Petroleum Facilities, Classified as Class 1, Zone 0, Zone 1, and Zone 2 (as incorporated by reference in § 250.198). In areas where dangerous concentrations of combustible gas may accumulate, you must install and maintain a ventilation system and gas monitors. Drilling fluid-handling areas must have the following safety equipment:

          (a) A ventilation system capable of replacing the air once every 5 minutes or 1.0 cubic feet of air-volume flow per minute, per square foot of area, whichever is greater. In addition:

          (1) If natural means provide adequate ventilation, then a mechanical ventilation system is not necessary;

          (2) If a mechanical system does not run continuously, then it must activate when gas detectors indicate the presence of 1 percent or more of combustible gas by volume; and

          (3) If discharges from a mechanical ventilation system may be hazardous, then you must maintain the drilling fluid-handling area at a negative pressure. You must protect the negative pressure area by using at least one of the following: a pressure-sensitive alarm, open-door alarms on each access to the area, automatic door-closing devices, air locks, or other devices approved by the District Manager;

          (b) Gas detectors and alarms except in open areas where adequate ventilation is provided by natural means. You must test and recalibrate gas detectors quarterly. No more than 90 days may elapse between tests;

          (c) Explosion-proof or pressurized electrical equipment to prevent the ignition of explosive gases. Where you use air for pressuring equipment, you must locate the air intake outside of and as far as practicable from hazardous areas; and

          (d) Alarms that activate when the mechanical ventilation system fails.

          (5)  On a platform where gas containing HS of *2*0 ppm or greater is produced, processed, or otherwise handled:

          (i) You must have a sensor in rooms, buildings, deck areas, or low-laying deck areas not otherwise covered by paragraph (j)(*2*) of this section, where atmospheric concentrations of HS could reach 20 ppm or more. You must have at least one sensor per 400 square feet of deck area or fractional part of 400 square feet;

          (ii) You must have a sensor in buildings where personnel have their living quarters;

          (iii) You must have a sensor within 10 feet of each vessel, compressor, wellhead, manifold, or pump, which could release enough HS to result in atmospheric concentrations of *2*0 ppm at a distance of 10 feet from the component;

          (iv) You may use one sensor to detect HS around multiple pieces of equipment, provided the sensor is located no more than 10 feet from each piece, except that you need to use at least two sensors to monitor compressors exceeding 50 horsepower;

          (v) You do not need to have sensors near wells that are shut in at the master valve and sealed closed;

          (vi) When you determine where to place sensors, you must consider:

          (7)  (i) When conducting drilling, drill stem testing, well-completion, or well-workover operations in areas classified as HS present or HS unknown, test all detectors at least once every ***2***4 hours. When drilling, begin functional testing before the bit is 1,500 feet (vertically) above the potential HS zone.

          (ii) When conducting production operations, test all detectors at least every 14 days between tests.

          (iii) If equipment requires calibration as a result of two consecutive functional tests, the District Manager may require that HS-detection and HS-monitoring equipment be functionally tested and calibrated more frequently.

          (8)  (i) You must maintain records of testing and calibrations (in the drilling or production operations report, as applicable) at the facility to show the present status and history of each device, including dates and details concerning:

          (ii) Records must be available for inspection by BSEE personnel.

          (9)  If vessels are stationed overnight alongside facilities in areas of HS present or HS unknown, you must equip vessels with an HS-detection system that activates audible and visual alarms when the concentration of HS in the atmosphere reaches *****2*****0 ppm. This requirement does not apply to vessels positioned upwind and at a safe distance from the facility in accordance with the positioning procedure described in the approved HS Contingency Plan.

          (10)  The District Manager may require you to equip nearby facilities with portable or fixed HS detector(s) and to test and calibrate those detectors. To invoke this requirement, the District Manager will consider dispersion modeling results from a possible release to determine if **2**0 ppm HS concentration levels could be exceeded at nearby facilities.

          (11)   You must:

          (i) Monitor the SOconcentration in the air with portable or strategically placed fixed devices capable of detecting a minimum of **2** ppm of SO;

          (ii) Take readings at least hourly and at any time personnel detect SO odor or nasal irritation;

          (viii) During HS alerts, limit helicopter flights to and from facilities to the conditions specified in the HS Contingency Plan. During authorized flights, the flight crew and passengers must use pressure-demand-type respirators. You must train all members of flight crews in the use of the particular type(s) of respirator equipment made available.

          (ix) As appropriate to the particular operation(s), (production, drilling, well-completion or well-workover operations, or any combination of them), provide a system of breathing-air manifolds, hoses, and masks at the facility and the briefing areas. You must provide a cascade air-bottle system for the breathing-air manifolds to refill individual protective-breathing apparatus bottles. The cascade air-bottle system may be recharged by a high-pressure compressor suitable for providing breathing-quality air, provided the compressor suction is located in an uncontaminated atmosphere.

          (k)  (1) What additional personnel-safety equipment do I need? You must ensure that your facility has:

          (i) Portable HS detectors capable of detecting a 10 ppm concentration of HS in the air available for use by all personnel;

          (ii) Retrieval ropes with safety harnesses to retrieve incapacitated personnel from contaminated areas;

          (iv) Bull horns and flashing lights; and

          (v) At least three resuscitators on manned facilities, and a number equal to the personnel on board, not to exceed three, on normally unmanned facilities, complete with face masks, oxygen bottles, and spare oxygen bottles.

          (2)  You must:

          (i) Use only explosion-proof ventilation devices;

          (ii) Install ventilation devices in areas where HS or SO may accumulate; and

          (iii) Provide movable ventilation devices in work areas. The movable ventilation devices must be multidirectional and capable of dispersing HS or SO vapors away from working personnel.

          (3)  You must have the following equipment readily available on each facility:

          (i) A first-aid kit of appropriate size and content for the number of personnel on the facility; and

          (ii) At least one litter or an equivalent device.

          (l)  You must notify BSEE without delay in the event of a gas release which results in a 15-minute time-weighted average atmospheric concentration of HS of **2**0 ppm or more anywhere on the OCS facility. You must report these gas releases to the District Manager immediately by oral communication, with a written follow-up report within 15 days, pursuant to §§ 250.188 through 250.190.

          (m)  When working in an area classified as HS present or HS unknown:

          (1) You may use either water- or oil-base muds in accordance with § 250.300(b)(1).

          (**2**) If you use water-base well-control fluids, and if ambient air sensors detect HS, you must immediately conduct either the Garrett-Gas-Train test or a comparable test for soluble sulfides to confirm the presence of HS.

          (3) If the concentration detected by air sensors in over 20 ppm, personnel conducting the tests must don protective-breathing equipment conforming to paragraph (j)(13) of this section.

          (4) You must maintain on the facility sufficient quantities of additives for the control of HS, well-control fluid pH, and corrosion equipment.

          (i)  You must have scavengers for control of HS available on the facility. When HS is detected, you must add scavengers as needed. You must suspend drilling until the scavenger is circulated throughout the system.

          (ii)  You must add additives for the control of pH to water-base well-control fluids in sufficient quantities to maintain pH of at least 10.0.

          (iii)  You must add additives to the well-control fluid system as needed for the control of corrosion.

          (5) You must degas well-control fluids containing HS at the optimum location for the particular facility. You must collect the gases removed and burn them in a closed flare system conforming to paragraph (q)(6) of this section.

          (n)  In the event of a kick, you must use one of the following alternatives to dispose of the well-influx fluids giving consideration to personnel safety, possible environmental damage, and possible facility well-equipment damage:

          (1) Contain the well-fluid influx by shutting in the well and pumping the fluids back into the formation.

          (***2***) Control the kick by using appropriate well-control techniques to prevent formation fracturing in an open hole within the pressure limits of the well equipment (drill pipe, work string, casing, wellhead, BOP system, and related equipment). The disposal of HS and other gases must be through pressurized or atmospheric mud-separator equipment depending on volume, pressure and concentration of HS. The equipment must be designed to recover well-control fluids and burn the gases separated from the well-control fluid. The well-control fluid must be treated to neutralize HS and restore and maintain the proper quality.

          (o)  When testing a well in a zone with HS present, you must do all of the following:

          (1) Before starting a well test, conduct safety meetings for all personnel who will be on the facility during the test. At the meetings, emphasize the use of protective-breathing equipment, first-aid procedures, and the Contingency Plan. Only competent personnel who are trained and are knowledgeable of the hazardous effects of HS must be engaged in these tests.

          (*2*) Perform well testing with the minimum number of personnel in the immediate vicinity of the rig floor and with the appropriate test equipment to safely and adequately perform the test. During the test, you must continuously monitor HS levels.

          (3) Not burn produced gases except through a flare which meets the requirements of paragraph (q)(6) of this section. Before flaring gas containing HS, you must activate SO monitoring equipment in accordance with paragraph (j)(11) of this section. If you detect SO in excess of ****2**** ppm, you must implement the personnel protective measures in your HS Contingency Plan, required by paragraph (f) of this section. You must also follow the requirements of § 250.1164. You must pipe gases from stored test fluids into the flare outlet and burn them.

          (4) Use downhole test tools and wellhead equipment suitable for HS service.

          (5) Use tubulars suitable for HS service. You must not use drill pipe for well testing without the prior approval of the District Manager. Water cushions must be thoroughly inhibited in order to prevent HS attack on metals. You must flush the test string fluid treated for this purpose after completion of the test.

          (6) Use surface test units and related equipment that is designed for HS service.

          (p)  When operating in a zone with HS present or when the concentration of HS in the produced fluid may exceed 0.05 psi partial pressure of HS, you must use equipment that is constructed of materials with metallurgical properties that resist or prevent sulfide stress cracking (also known as hydrogen embrittlement, stress corrosion cracking, or HS embrittlement), chloride-stress cracking, hydrogen-induced cracking, and other failure modes. You must do all of the following:

          (1) Use tubulars and other equipment, casing, tubing, drill pipe, couplings, flanges, and related equipment that is designed for HS service.

          (*2*) Use BOP system components, wellhead, pressure-control equipment, and related equipment exposed to HS-bearing fluids in conformance with NACE Standard MR0175-03 (as specified in § 250.198).

          (3) Use temporary downhole well-security devices such as retrievable packers and bridge plugs that are designed for HS service.

          (4) When producing in zones bearing HS, use equipment constructed of materials capable of resisting or preventing sulfide stress cracking.

          (5) Keep the use of welding to a minimum during the installation or modification of a production facility. Welding must be done in a manner that ensures resistance to sulfide stress cracking.

          (q)  (1) Coring operations. When you conduct coring operations in HS-bearing zones, all personnel in the working area must wear protective-breathing equipment at least 10 stands in advance of retrieving the core barrel. Cores to be transported must be sealed and marked for the presence of HS.

          (*2*)  You must treat and condition well-control fluid in use for logging operations to minimize the effects of HS on the logging equipment.

          (3)  Personnel must monitor displaced well-control fluid returns and wear protective-breathing equipment in the working area when the atmospheric concentration of HS reaches *2*0 ppm or if the well is under pressure.

          (4)  If you decide to circulate out a kick, personnel in the working area during bottoms-up and extended-kill operations must wear protective-breathing equipment.

          (5)  Drill- and workover-strings must be designed consistent with the anticipated depth, conditions of the hole, and reservoir environment to be encountered. You must minimize exposure of the drill- or workover-string to high stresses as much as practical and consistent with well conditions. Proper handling techniques must be taken to minimize notching and stress concentrations. Precautions must be taken to minimize stresses caused by doglegs, improper stiffness ratios, improper torque, whip, abrasive wear on tool joints, and joint imbalance.

          (6)  The flare outlet must be of a diameter that allows easy nonrestricted flow of gas. You must locate flare line outlets on the downside of the facility and as far from the facility as is feasible, taking into account the prevailing wind directions, the wake effects caused by the facility and adjacent structure(s), and the height of all such facilities and structures. You must equip the flare outlet with an automatic ignition system including a pilot-light gas source or an equivalent system. You must have alternate methods for igniting the flare. You must pipe to the flare system used for HS all vents from production process equipment, tanks, relief valves, burst plates, and similar devices.

          (7)  You must use effective means of monitoring and controlling corrosion caused by acid gases (HS and CO) in both the downhole and surface portions of a production system. You must take specific corrosion monitoring and mitigating measures in areas of unusually severe corrosion where accumulation of water and/or higher concentration of HS exists.

          (8)  Lubricators which may be exposed to fluids containing HS must be of HS-resistant materials.

          (9)  You must not use gas containing HS for instrument gas. You must not use gas containing HS for fuel gas without the prior approval of the District Manager.

          (10)  Metals used for sensing line and safety-control devices which are necessarily exposed to HS-bearing fluids must be constructed of HS-corrosion resistant materials or coated so as to resist HS corrosion.

          (11)  You must use HS-resistant materials for all seals which may be exposed to fluids containing HS.

          (1***2***)  If you dispose of produced water by means other than subsurface injection, you must submit to the District Manager an analysis of the anticipated HS content of the water at the final treatment vessel and at the discharge point. The District Manager may require that the water be treated for removal of HS. The District Manager may require the submittal of an updated analysis if the water disposal rate or the potential HS content increases.

          (13)  You must equip open deck drains with traps or similar devices to prevent the escape of HS gas into the atmosphere.

          (14)  You must take precautions to eliminate sealed spaces in piping designs (e.g., slip-on flanges, reinforcing pads) which can be invaded by atomic hydrogen when HS is present.

          If you plan to use a MODU for well operations, you must provide:

          (a)  Information and data to demonstrate the MODU's capability to perform at the proposed location. This information must include the maximum environmental and operational conditions that the MODU is designed to withstand, including the minimum air gap necessary for both hurricane and non-hurricane seasons. If sufficient environmental information and data are not available at the time you submit your APD or APM, the District Manager may approve your APD or APM, but require you to collect and report this information during operations. Under this circumstance, the District Manager may revoke the approval of the APD or APM if information collected during operations shows that the MODU is not capable of performing at the proposed location.

          (b)  Information to show that site-specific soil and oceanographic conditions are capable of supporting the proposed bottom-founded MODU. If you provided sufficient site-specific information in your EP, DPP, or DOCD submitted to BOEM for that well location and conditions, you may reference that information. The District Manager may require you to conduct additional surveys and soil borings before approving the APD or APM if additional information is needed to make a determination that the conditions are capable of supporting the MODU, or equipment installed on a subsea wellhead. For a moored rig, you must submit a plat of the rig's anchor pattern approved in your EP, DPP, or DOCD in your APD or APM.

          (c)  (1) If the design of the MODU you plan to use in a frontier area is unique or has not been proven for use in the proposed environment, the District Manager may require you to submit a third-party review of the MODU design. If required, you must obtain a third-party review of your MODU similar to the process outlined in §§ 250.915 through 250.918. You may submit this information before submitting an APD or APM.

          (2) If you plan to conduct operations in a frontier area, you must have a contingency plan that addresses design and operating limitations of the MODU. Your plan must identify the actions necessary to maintain safety and prevent damage to the environment. Actions must include the suspension, curtailment, or modification of operations to remedy various operational or environmental situations (e.g., vessel motion, riser offset, anchor tensions, wind speed, wave height, currents, icing or ice-loading, settling, tilt or lateral movement, resupply capability).

          (d)  You must provide the current Certificate of Inspection (for U.S.-flag vessels) or Certificate of Compliance (for foreign-flag vessels) from the USCG and Certificate of Classification. You must also provide current documentation of any operational limitations imposed by an appropriate classification society.

          (e)  If you use a dynamically positioned MODU, you must include in your APD or APM your contingency plan for moving off location in an emergency situation. At a minimum, your plan must address emergency events caused by storms, currents, station-keeping failures, power failures, and losses of well control. The District Manager may require your plan to include additional events that may require movement of the MODU and other information needed to clarify or further address how the MODU will respond to emergencies or other events.

          (f)  The MODU must be available for inspection by the District Manager before commencing operations and at any time during operations.

          (g)  For water depths greater than 400 meters (1,312 feet), you must include in your APD or APM:

          (1) A description of the specific current speeds that will cause you to implement rig shutdown, move-off procedures, or both; and

          (2) A discussion of the specific measures you will take to curtail rig operations and move off location when such currents are encountered. You may use criteria, such as current velocities, riser angles, watch circles, and remaining rig power to describe when these procedures or measures will be implemented.

#### § § 250.720

          (a) Whenever you interrupt operations, you must notify the District Manager. Before moving off the well, you must have two independent barriers installed, at least one of which must be a mechanical barrier, as approved by the District Manager. You must install the barriers at appropriate depths within a properly cemented casing string or liner. Before removing a subsea BOP stack or surface BOP stack on a mudline suspension well, you must conduct a negative pressure test in accordance with § 250.721.

          (1) The events that would cause you to interrupt operations and notify the District Manager include, but are not limited to, the following:

          (i) Evacuation of the rig crew;

          (ii) Inability to keep the rig on location;

          (iii) Repair to major rig or well-control equipment;

          (iv) Observed flow outside the well's casing (e.g., shallow water flow or bubbling); or

          (v) Impending National Weather Service-named tropical storm or hurricane.

          (2) The District Manager may approve alternate procedures or barriers, in accordance with § 250.141, if you do not have time to install the required barriers or if special circumstances occur.

          (3) If you unlatch the BOP or LMRP:

          (i) Upon relatch of the BOP, you must test according to § 250.734(b)(2), or

          (ii) Upon relatch of the LMRP, you must test according to § 250.734(b)(3); and

          (iii) You must submit a revised permit with a written statement from an independent third party certifying that the previous certification under § 250.731(c) remains valid and receive District Manager approval before resuming operations.

          (b) Before you displace kill-weight fluid from the wellbore and/or riser, thereby creating an underbalanced state, you must obtain approval from the District Manager. To obtain approval, you must submit with your APD or APM your reasons for displacing the kill-weight fluid and provide detailed step-by-step written procedures describing how you will safely displace these fluids. The step-by-step displacement procedures must address the following:

          (1) Number and type of independent barriers, as described in § 250.420(b)(3), that are in place for each flow path that requires such barriers;

          (2) Tests you will conduct to ensure integrity of independent barriers;

          (3) BOP procedures you will use while displacing kill-weight fluids; and

          (4) Procedures you will use to monitor the volumes and rates of fluids entering and leaving the wellbore.

          (c) For Arctic OCS exploratory drilling operations, in addition to the requirements of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section:

          (1) If you move your drilling rig off a well prior to completion or permanent abandonment, you must ensure that any equipment left on, near, or in a wellbore that has penetrated below the surface casing is positioned in a manner to:

          (i) Protect the well head; and

          (ii) Prevent or minimize the likelihood of compromising the down-hole integrity of the well or the effectiveness of the well plugs.

          (2) In areas of ice scour you must use a well mudline cellar or an equivalent means of minimizing the risk of damage to the well head and wellbore. BSEE may approve an equivalent means that will meet or exceed the level of safety and environmental protection provided by a mudline cellar if the operator can show that utilizing a mudline cellar would compromise the stability of the rig, impede access to the well head during a well control event, or otherwise create operational risks.

          (d) You must have the equipment used solely for intervention operations (e.g., tree interface tools) identified, readily available, properly maintained, and available for BSEE inspection upon request. This equipment is required for subsea completed wells with a tree installed, that meet the following conditions:

          (1) Have a shut-in tubing pressure that is greater than the hydrostatic pressure of the water column, or

          (2) Are not capable of having the annulus monitored.

#### § § 250.721

          (a) You must test each casing string that extends to the wellhead according to the following table:

          (b) You must test each drilling liner and liner-top to a pressure at least equal to the anticipated leak-off pressure of the formation below that liner shoe, or subsequent liner shoes if set. You must conduct this test before you continue operations in the well.

          (c) You must test each production liner and liner-top to a minimum of 500 psi above the formation fracture pressure at the casing shoe into which the liner is lapped.

          (d) The District Manager may approve or require other casing test pressures as appropriate under the circumstances to ensure casing integrity.

          (e) If you plan to produce a well, you must:

          (1) For a well that is fully cased and cemented, pressure test the entire well to maximum anticipated shut-in tubing pressure, not to exceed 70% of the burst rating limit of the weakest component before perforating the casing or liner; or

          (2) For an open-hole completion, pressure test the entire well to maximum anticipated shut-in tubing pressure, not to exceed 70% of the burst rating limit of the weakest component before you drill the open-hole section.

          (f) You may not resume operations until you obtain a satisfactory pressure test. If the pressure declines more than 10 percent in a 30-minute test, or if there is another indication of a leak, you must submit to the District Manager for approval your proposed plans to re-cement, repair the casing or liner, or run additional casing/liner to provide a proper seal. Your submittal must include a PE certification of your proposed plans.

          (g) You must perform a negative pressure test on all wells that use a subsea BOP stack or wells with mudline suspension systems.

          (1) You must perform a negative pressure test on your final casing string or liner. This test must be conducted after setting your second barrier just above the shoe track, but prior to conducting any completion operations.

          (2) You must perform a negative pressure test prior to unlatching the BOP at any point in the well. The negative pressure test must be performed on those components, at a minimum, that will be exposed to the negative differential pressure that will occur when the BOP is disconnected.

          (3) The District Manager may require you to perform additional negative pressure tests on other casing strings or liners (e.g., intermediate casing string or liner) or on wells with a surface BOP stack as appropriate to demonstrate casing or liner integrity.

          (4) You must submit for approval with your APD or APM, test procedures and criteria for a successful negative pressure test. If any of your test procedures or criteria for a successful test change, you must submit for approval the changes in a revised APD or APM.

          (5) You must document all your test results and make them available to BSEE upon request.

          (6) If you have any indication of a failed negative pressure test, such as, but not limited to, pressure buildup or observed flow, you must immediately investigate the cause. If your investigation confirms that a failure occurred during the negative pressure test, you must:

          (i) Correct the problem and immediately notify the appropriate District Manager; and

          (ii) Submit a description of the corrective action taken and receive approval from the appropriate District Manager for the retest.

          (7) You must have two barriers in place, as described in § 250.420(b)(3), at any time and for any well, prior to performing the negative pressure test.

          (8) You must include documentation of the successful negative pressure test in the End-of-Operations Report (Form BSEE-0125).

          § 250.722   What are the requirements for prolonged operations in a well?

#### § § 250.722

          If wellbore operations continue within a casing or liner for more than 30 days from the previous pressure test of the well's casing or liner, you must:

          (a) Stop operations as soon as practicable, and evaluate the effects of the prolonged operations on continued operations and the life of the well. At a minimum, you must:

          (1) Evaluate the well casing with a pressure test, caliper tool, or imaging tool. On a case-by-case basis, the District Manager may require a specific method of evaluation of the effects on the well casing of prolonged operations; and

          (2) Report the results of your evaluation to the District Manager and obtain approval of those results before resuming operations. Your report must include calculations that indicate the well's integrity is above the minimum safety factors, if an imaging tool or caliper is used. District Manager approval is not required to resume operations if you conducted a successful pressure test as approved in your permit. You must document the successful pressure test in the WAR.

          (b) If well integrity has deteriorated to a level below minimum safety factors, you must:

          (1) Obtain approval from the District Manager to begin repairs or install additional casing. To obtain approval, you must also provide a PE certification showing that he or she reviewed and approved the proposed changes;

          (2) Repair the casing or run another casing string; and

          (3) Perform a pressure test after the repairs are made or additional casing is installed and report the results to the District Manager as specified in § 250.721.

          (3) You must not bypass for startup any element of the emergency support system or other support system required by API RP 14C, Appendix C (incorporated by reference as specified in § 250.198) without first receiving BSEE approval to depart from this operating procedure. These systems include, but are not limited to:

          (i) The ESD system to provide a method to manually initiate platform shutdown by personnel observing abnormal conditions or undesirable events. You do not have to receive approval from the District Manager for manual reset and/or initial charging of the system;

          (ii) The fire loop system to sense the heat of a fire and initiate platform shutdown, and other fire detection devices (flame, thermal, and smoke) that are used to enhance fire detection capability. You do not have to receive approval from the District Manager for manual reset and/or initial charging of the system;

          (iii) The combustible gas detection system to sense the presence of hydrocarbons and initiate alarms and platform shutdown before gas concentrations reach the lower explosive limit;

          (iv) Adequate ventilation;

          (v) The containment system to collect escaped liquid hydrocarbons and initiate platform shutdown;

          (vi) Subsurface safety valves, including those that are self-actuated (subsurface-controlled SSSVs) or those that are activated by an ESD system and/or a fire loop (surface-controlled SSSV). You do not have to receive approval from the District Manager for routine operations in accordance with § 250.817;

          (vii) The pneumatic supply system; and

          (viii) The system for discharging gas to the atmosphere.

          (4) In instances where components of the ESD, as listed in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, are bypassed for maintenance, precautions must be taken to provide the equivalent level of protection that existed prior to the bypass.

          (b) When wells are disconnected from producing facilities and blind flanged, or equipped with a tubing plug, or the master valves have been locked closed, you are not required to comply with the provisions of API RP 14C (incorporated by reference as specified in § 250.198) or this regulation concerning the following:

          (1) Automatic fail-close SSVs on wellhead assemblies, and

          (2) The PSH and PSL sensors in flowlines from wells.

          (c) When pressure or atmospheric vessels are isolated from production facilities (e.g., inlet valve locked closed or inlet blind-flanged) and are to remain isolated for an extended period of time, safety device testing in accordance with API RP 14C (incorporated by reference as specified in § 250.198), or this subpart is not required, with the exception of the PSV, unless the vessel is open to the atmosphere.

          § 250.870   Time delays on pressure safety low (PSL) sensors.

#### § § 250.870

          (a) You may apply industry standard Class B, Class C, or Class B/C logic to applicable PSL sensors installed on process equipment. If the device may be bypassed for greater than 45 seconds, you must monitor the bypassed devices in accordance with § 250.869(a). You must document on your field test records any use of a PSL sensor with a time delay greater than 45 seconds. For purposes of this section, PSL sensors are categorized as follows:

          (1) Class B safety devices have logic that allows for the PSL sensors to be bypassed for a fixed time period (typically less than 15 seconds, but not more than 45 seconds). Examples include sensors used in conjunction with the design of pump and compressor panels such as PSL sensors, lubricator no-flows, and high-water jacket temperature shutdowns.

          (2) Class C safety devices have logic that allows for the PSL sensors to be bypassed until the component comes into full service ( the time at which the startup pressure equals or exceeds the set pressure of the PSL sensor, the system reaches a stabilized pressure, and the PSL sensor clears). If a Class C safety device is bypassed, you must monitor the device until it is in full service.

          (3) Class B/C safety devices have logic that allows for the PSL sensors to incorporate a combination of Class B and Class C circuitry. These devices are used to ensure that the PSL sensors are not unnecessarily bypassed during startup and idle operations, (e.g., Class B/C bypass circuitry activates when a pump is shut down during normal operations). The PSL sensor remains bypassed until the pump's start circuitry is activated and either:

          (i) The Class B timer expires no later than 45 seconds from start activation, or

          (ii) The Class C bypass is initiated until the pump builds up pressure above the PSL sensor set point and the PSL sensor comes into full service.

          (b) If you do not install time delay circuitry that bypasses activation of PSL sensor shutdown logic for a specified time period on process and product transport equipment during startup and idle operations, you must manually bypass (pin out or disengage) the PSL sensor, with a time delay not to exceed 45 seconds.

        Platform Approval Program

          § 250.904   What is the Platform Approval Program?

#### § § 250.904

          (a) The Platform Approval Program is the BSEE basic approval process for platforms on the OCS. The requirements of the Platform Approval Program are described in §§ 250.904 through 250.908 of this subpart. Completing these requirements will satisfy BSEE criteria for approval of fixed platforms of a proven design that will be placed in the shallow water areas (≤400 ft.) of the Gulf of Mexico OCS.

          (b) The requirements of the Platform Approval Program must be met by all platforms on the OCS. Additionally, if you want approval for a floating platform; a platform of unique design; or a platform being installed in deepwater (> 400 ft.) or a frontier area, you must also meet the requirements of the Platform Verification Program. The requirements of the Platform Verification Program are described in §§ 250.909 through 250.918 of this subpart.

          § 250.905   How do I get approval for the installation, modification, or repair of my platform?

#### § § 250.905

          The Platform Approval Program requires that you submit the information, documents, and fee listed in the following table for your proposed project. In lieu of submitting the paper copies specified in the table, you may submit your application electronically in accordance with 30 CFR 250.186(a)(3).

          § 250.906   What must I do to obtain approval for the proposed site of my platform?

#### § § 250.906

          (a)  You must perform a high-resolution or acoustic-profiling survey to obtain information on the conditions existing at and near the surface of the seafloor. You must collect information through this survey sufficient to determine the presence of the following features and their likely effects on your proposed platform:

          (1) Shallow faults;

          (2) Gas seeps or shallow gas;

          (3) Slump blocks or slump sediments;

          (4) Shallow water flows;

          (5) Hydrates; or

          (6) Ice scour of seafloor sediments.

          (b)  You must perform a geological survey relevant to the design and siting of your platform. Your geological survey must assess:

          (1) Seismic activity at your proposed site;

          (2) Fault zones, the extent and geometry of faulting, and attenuation effects of geologic conditions near your site; and

          (3) For platforms located in producing areas, the possibility and effects of seafloor subsidence.

          (c)  Depending upon the design and location of your proposed platform and the results of the shallow hazard and geologic surveys, the Regional Supervisor may require you to perform a subsurface survey. This survey will include a testing program for investigating the stratigraphic and engineering properties of the soil that may affect the foundations or anchoring systems for your facility. The testing program must include adequate in situ testing, boring, and sampling to examine all important soil and rock strata to determine its strength classification, deformation properties, and dynamic characteristics. If required to perform a subsurface survey, you must prepare and submit to the Regional Supervisor a summary report to briefly describe the results of your soil testing program, the various field and laboratory test methods employed, and the applicability of these methods as they pertain to the quality of the samples, the type of soil, and the anticipated design application. You must explain how the engineering properties of each soil stratum affect the design of your platform. In your explanation you must describe the uncertainties inherent in your overall testing program, and the reliability and applicability of each test method.

          (d)  You must prepare and submit to the Regional Supervisor an overall site investigation report for your platform that integrates the findings of your shallow hazards surveys and geologic surveys, and, if required, your subsurface surveys. Your overall site investigation report must include analyses of the potential for:

          (1) Scouring of the seafloor;

          (2) Hydraulic instability;

          (3) The occurrence of sand waves;

          (4) Instability of slopes at the platform location;

          (5) Liquefaction, or possible reduction of soil strength due to increased pore pressures;

          (6) Degradation of subsea permafrost layers;

          (7) Cyclic loading;

          (8) Lateral loading;

          (9) Dynamic loading;

          (10) Settlements and displacements;

          (11) Plastic deformation and formation collapse mechanisms; and

          (12) Soil reactions on the platform foundations or anchoring systems.

          § 250.907   Where must I locate foundation boreholes?

#### § § 250.907

          (a) For fixed or bottom-founded platforms and tension leg platforms, your maximum distance from any foundation pile to a soil boring must not exceed 500 feet.

          (b) For deepwater floating platforms which utilize catenary or taut-leg moorings, you must take borings at the most heavily loaded anchor location, at the anchor points approximately 120 and 240 degrees around the anchor pattern from that boring, and, as necessary, other points throughout the anchor pattern to establish the soil profile suitable for foundation design purposes.

          § 250.908   What are the minimum structural fatigue design requirements?

#### § § 250.908

          (a) API RP 2A-WSD, Recommended Practice for Planning, Designing and Constructing Fixed Offshore Platforms (as incorporated by reference in § 250.198), requires that the design fatigue life of each joint and member be twice the intended service life of the structure. When designing your platform, the following table provides minimum fatigue life safety factors for critical structural members and joints.

          (b) The documents incorporated by reference in § 250.901 may require larger safety factors than indicated in paragraph (a) of this section for some key components. When the documents incorporated by reference require a larger safety factor than the chart in paragraph (a) of this section, the requirements of the incorporated document will prevail.

          (a) All new fixed or bottom-founded platforms that meet any of the following five conditions are subject to the Platform Verification Program:

          (1) Platforms installed in water depths exceeding 400 feet (122 meters);

          (2) Platforms having natural periods in excess of 3 seconds;

          (3) Platforms installed in areas of unstable bottom conditions;

          (4) Platforms having configurations and designs which have not previously been used or proven for use in the area; or

          (5) Platforms installed in seismically active areas.

          (b) All new floating platforms are subject to the Platform Verification Program to the extent indicated in the following table:

          (c) If a platform is originally subject to the Platform Verification Program, then the conversion of that platform at that same site for a new purpose, or making a major modification of, or major repair to, that platform, is also subject to the Platform Verification Program. A major modification includes any modification that increases loading on a platform by 10 percent or more. A major repair is a corrective operation involving structural members affecting the structural integrity of a portion or all of the platform. Before you make a major modification or repair to a floating platform, you must obtain approval from both the BSEE and the USCG.

          (d) The applicability of Platform Verification Program requirements to other types of facilities will be determined by BSEE on a case-by-case basis.

          § 250.911   If my platform is subject to the Platform Verification Program, what must I do?

        § 250.1000   General requirements.

#### § § 250.1000

        (a) Pipelines and associated valves, flanges, and fittings shall be designed, installed, operated, maintained, and abandoned to provide safe and pollution-free transportation of fluids in a manner which does not unduly interfere with other uses in the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS).

        (b) An application must be accompanied by payment of the service fee listed in § 250.125 and submitted to the Regional Supervisor and approval obtained before:

        (1) Installation, modification, or abandonment of a lease term pipeline;

        (2) Installation or modification of a right-of-way (other than lease term) pipeline; or

        (3) Modification or relinquishment of a pipeline right-of way.

        (c)(1) Department of the Interior (DOI) pipelines, as defined in § 250.1001, must meet the requirements in §§ 250.1000 through 250.1008.

        (2) A pipeline right-of-way grant holder must identify in writing to the Regional Supervisor the operator of any pipeline located on its right-of-way, if the operator is different from the right-of-way grant holder.

        (3) A producing operator must identify for its own records, on all existing pipelines located on its lease or right-of-way, the specific points at which operating responsibility transfers to a transporting operator.

        (i) Each producing operator must, if practical, durably mark all of its above-water transfer points as of the date a pipeline begins service.

        (ii) If it is not practical to durably mark a transfer point, and the transfer point is located above water, then the operator must identify the transfer point on a schematic located on the facility.

        (iii) If a transfer point is located below water, then the operator must identify the transfer point on a schematic and provide the schematic to BSEE upon request.

        (iv) If adjoining producing and transporting operators cannot agree on a transfer point, the BSEE Regional Supervisor and the appropriate Department of Transportation (DOT) pipeline official may jointly determine the transfer point.

        (4) The transfer point serves as a regulatory boundary. An operator may request that the BSEE Regional Supervisor grant an exception to this requirement for an individual facility or area. The Regional Supervisor, in consultation with the appropriate DOT pipeline official and affected parties, may grant the request.

        (5) Pipeline segments designed, constructed, maintained, and operated under DOT regulations but transferring to DOI regulation as of October 16, 1998, may continue to operate under DOT design and construction requirements until significant modifications or repairs are made to those segments. After October 16, 1998, BSEE operational and maintenance requirements will apply to those segments.

        (6) Any producer operating a pipeline that crosses into State waters without first connecting to a transporting operator's facility on the OCS must comply with this subpart.

        § 250.1003   Installation, testing, and repair requirements for DOI pipelines.

#### § § 250.1003

        (a)(1) Pipelines greater than 8  inches in diameter and installed in water depths of less than 200 feet shall be buried to a depth of at least 3 feet unless they are located in pipeline congested areas or seismically active areas as determined by the Regional Supervisor. Nevertheless, the Regional Supervisor may require burial of any pipeline if the Regional Supervisor determines that such burial will reduce the likelihood of environmental degradation or that the pipeline may constitute a hazard to trawling operations or other uses. A trawl test or diver survey may be required to determine whether or not pipeline burial is necessary or to determine whether a pipeline has been properly buried.

        (2) Pipeline valves, taps, tie-ins, capped lines, and repaired sections that could be obstructive shall be provided with at least 3 feet of cover unless the Regional Supervisor determines that such items present no hazard to trawling or other operations. A protective device may be used to cover an obstruction in lieu of burial if it is approved by the Regional Supervisor prior to installation.

        (3) Pipelines shall be installed with a minimum separation of 18 inches at pipeline crossings and from obstructions.

        (4) Pipeline risers installed after April 1, 1988, shall be protected from physical damage that could result from contact with floating vessels. Riser protection on pipelines installed on or before April 1, 1988, may be required when the Regional Supervisor determines that significant damage potential exists.

        (b)(1) Pipelines shall be pressure tested with water at a stabilized pressure of at least 1.25 times the MAOP for at least 8 hours when installed, relocated, uprated, or reactivated after being out-of-service for more than 1 year.

        (2) Prior to returning a pipeline to service after a repair, the pipeline shall be pressure tested with water or processed natural gas at a minimum stabilized pressure of at least 1.25 times the MAOP for at least 2 hours.

        (3) Pipelines shall not be pressure tested at a pressure which produces a stress in the pipeline in excess of 95 percent of the specified minimum-yield strength of the pipeline. A temperature recorder measuring test fluid temperature synchronized with a pressure recorder along with deadweight test readings shall be employed for all pressure testing. When a pipeline is pressure tested, no observable leakage shall be allowed. Pressure gauges and recorders shall be of sufficient accuracy to verify that leakage is not occurring.

        (4) The Regional Supervisor may require pressure testing of pipelines to verify the integrity of the system when the Regional Supervisor determines that there is a reasonable likelihood that the line has been damaged or weakened by external or internal conditions.

        (c) When a pipeline is repaired utilizing a clamp, the clamp shall be a full encirclement clamp able to withstand the anticipated pipeline pressure.

        (ii) For sulphur operations, incoming pipelines delivering gas to the power plant platform may be equipped with high- and low-pressure sensors (PSHL), which activate audible and visual alarms in lieu of requirements in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section. The PSHL shall be set at 15 percent or 5 psi, whichever is greater, above and below the normal operating pressure range.

        (2) Incoming pipelines boarding a production platform shall be equipped with an automatic shutdown valve (SDV) immediately upon boarding the platform. The SDV shall be connected to the automatic- and remote-emergency shut-in systems.

        (3) Departing pipelines receiving production from production facilities shall be protected by high- and low-pressure sensors (PSHL) to directly or indirectly shut in all production facilities. The PSHL shall be set not to exceed 15 percent above and below the normal operating pressure range. However, high pilots shall not be set above the pipeline's MAOP.

        (4) Crossing pipelines on production or manned nonproduction platforms which do not receive production from the platform shall be equipped with an SDV immediately upon boarding the platform. The SDV shall be operated by a PSHL on the departing pipelines and connected to the platform automatic- and remote-emergency shut-in systems.

        (5) The Regional Supervisor may require that oil pipelines be equipped with a metering system to provide a continuous volumetric comparison between the input to the line at the structure(s) and the deliveries onshore. The system shall include an alarm system and shall be of adequate sensitivity to detect variations between input and discharge volumes. In lieu of the foregoing, a system capable of detecting leaks in the pipeline may be substituted with the approval of the Regional Supervisor.

        (6) Pipelines incoming to a subsea tie-in shall be equipped with a block valve and an FSV. Bidirectional pipelines connected to a subsea tie-in shall be equipped with only a block valve.

        (7) Gas-lift or water-injection pipelines on unmanned platforms need only be equipped with an FSV installed immediately upstream of each casing annulus or the first inlet valve on the christmas tree.

        (9) Pipeline pumps must comply with section A7 of API RP 14C (as incorporated by reference in § 250.198). The setting levels for the PSHL devices are specified in paragraph (b)(3) of this section.

        (c) If the required safety equipment is rendered ineffective or removed from service on pipelines which are continued in operation, an equivalent degree of safety shall be provided. The safety equipment shall be identified by the placement of a sign on the equipment stating that the equipment is rendered ineffective or removed from service.

        § 250.1005   Inspection requirements for DOI pipelines.

#### § § 250.1005

        (a) Pipeline routes shall be inspected at time intervals and methods prescribed by the Regional Supervisor for indication of pipeline leakage. The results of these inspections shall be retained for at least 2 years and be made available to the Regional Supervisor upon request.

        (b) When pipelines are protected by rectifiers or anodes for which the initial life expectancy of the cathodic protection system either cannot be calculated or calculations indicate a life expectancy of less than 20 years, such pipelines shall be inspected annually by taking measurements of pipe-to-electrolyte potential.

        (a) You must pay ONRR, under the regulations at 30 CFR part 1218, an annual rental of $15 for each statute mile, or part of a statute mile, of the OCS that your pipeline right-of-way crosses.

        (b) This paragraph applies to you if you obtain a pipeline right-of-way that includes a site for an accessory to the pipeline, including but not limited to a platform. This paragraph also applies if you apply to modify a right-of-way to change the site footprint. In either case, you must pay the amounts shown in the following table.

        (c) If you hold a pipeline right-of-way that includes a site for an accessory to your pipeline and you are not covered by paragraph (b) of this section, then you must pay ONRR, under the regulations at 30 CFR part 1218, an annual rental of $75 for use of the affected area.

        (d) You may make the rental payments required by paragraphs (a), (b)(1), (b)(2), and (c) of this section on an annual basis, for a 5-year period, or for multiples of 5 years. You must make the first payment at the time you submit the pipeline right-of-way application. You must make all subsequent payments before the respective time periods begin.

        (e)  An interest charge will be assessed on unpaid and underpaid amounts from the date the amounts are due, in accordance with the provisions found in 30 CFR 1218.54. If you fail to make a payment that is late after written notice from ONRR, BSEE may initiate cancellation of the right-of-use grant and easement under § 250.1013.

        § 250.1013   Grounds for forfeiture of pipeline right-of-way grants.

#### § § 250.1013

        Failure to comply with the Act, regulations, or any conditions of the right-of-way grant prescribed by the Regional Supervisor shall be grounds for forfeiture of the grant in an appropriate judicial proceeding instituted by the United States in any U.S. District Court having jurisdiction in accordance with the provisions of 43 U.S.C. 1349.

        § 250.1014   When pipeline right-of-way grants expire.

#### § § 250.1014

        Any right-of-way granted under the provisions of this subpart remains in effect as long as the associated pipeline is properly maintained and used for the purpose for which the grant was made, unless otherwise expressly stated in the grant. Temporary cessation or suspension of pipeline operations shall not cause the grant to expire. However, if the purpose of the grant ceases to exist or use of the associated pipeline is permanently discontinued for any reason, the grant shall be deemed to have expired.

        § 250.1015   Applications for pipeline right-of-way grants.

#### § § 250.1015

        (a) You must submit an original and three copies of an application for a new or modified pipeline ROW grant to the Regional Supervisor.

        § 250.1016   Granting pipeline rights-of-way.

#### § § 250.1016

        (a) In considering an application for a right-of-way, the Regional Supervisor shall consider the potential effect of the associated pipeline on the human, marine, and coastal environments, life (including aquatic life), property, and mineral resources in the entire area during construction and operational phases. The Regional Supervisor shall prepare an environmental analysis in accordance with applicable policies and guidelines. To aid in the evaluation and determinations, the Regional Supervisor may request and consider views and recommendations of appropriate Federal Agencies, hold public meetings after appropriate notice, and consult, as appropriate, with State agencies, organizations, industries, and individuals. Before granting a pipeline right-of-way, the Regional Supervisor shall give consideration to any recommendation by the intergovernmental planning program, or similar process, for the assessment and management of OCS oil and gas transportation.

        (b) Should the proposed route of a right-of-way adjoin and subsequently cross any State submerged lands, the applicant shall submit evidence to the Regional Supervisor that the State(s) so affected has reviewed the application. The applicant shall also submit any comment received as a result of that review. In the event of a State recommendation to relocate the proposed route, the Regional Supervisor may consult with the appropriate State officials.

        (c)(1) The applicant shall submit photocopies of return receipts to the Regional Supervisor that indicate the date that each lessee or right-of-way holder referenced in § 250.1015(c) of this part has received a copy of the application. Letters of no objection may be submitted in lieu of the return receipts.

        (2) The Regional Supervisor shall not take final action on a right-of-way application until the Regional Supervisor is satisfied that each such lessee or right-of-way holder has been afforded at least 30 days from the date determined in paragraph (c)(1) of this section in which to submit comments.

        (d) If a proposed right-of-way crosses any lands not subject to disposition by mineral leasing or restricted from oil and gas activities, it shall be rejected by the Regional Supervisor unless the Federal Agency with jurisdiction over such excluded or restricted area gives its consent to the granting of the right-of-way. In such case, the applicant, upon a request filed within 30 days after receipt of the notification of such rejection, shall be allowed an opportunity to eliminate the conflict.

        (e)(1) If the application and other required information are found to be in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, the right-of-way may be granted. The Regional Supervisor may prescribe, as conditions to the right-of-way grant, stipulations necessary to protect human, marine, and coastal environments, life (including aquatic life), property, and mineral resources located on or adjacent to the right-of-way.

        (2) If the Regional Supervisor determines that a change in the application should be made, the Regional Supervisor shall notify the applicant that an amended application shall be filed subject to stipulated changes. The Regional Supervisor shall determine whether the applicant shall deliver copies of the amended application to other parties for comment.

        (3) A decision to reject an application shall be in writing and shall state the reasons for the rejection.

        § 250.1017   Requirements for construction under pipeline right-of-way grants.

#### § § 250.1017

        (a) Failure to construct the associated right-of-way pipeline within 5 years of the date of the granting of a right-of-way shall cause the grant to expire.

        (b)(1) A right-of-way holder shall ensure that the right-of-way pipeline is constructed in a manner that minimizes deviations from the right-of-way as granted.

        (2) If, after constructing the right-of-way pipeline, it is determined that a deviation from the proposed right-of-way as granted has occurred, the right-of-way holder shall—

        (i) Notify the operators of all leases and holders of all right-of-way grants in which a deviation has occurred, and within 60 days of the date of the acceptance by the Regional Supervisor of the completion of pipeline construction report, provide the Regional Supervisor with evidence of such notification; and

        (ii) Relinquish any unused portion of the right-of-way.

        (3) Substantial deviation of a right-of-way pipeline as constructed from the proposed right-of-way as granted may be grounds for forfeiture of the right-of-way.

        (c) If the Regional Supervisor determines that a significant change in conditions has occurred subsequent to the granting of a right-of-way but prior to the commencement of construction of the associated pipeline, the Regional Supervisor may suspend or temporarily prohibit the commencement of construction until the right-of-way grant is modified to the extent necessary to address the changed conditions.

        § 250.1018   Assignment of pipeline right-of-way grants.

#### § § 250.1018

        (a) Assignment may be made of a right-of-way grant, in whole or of any lineal segment thereof, subject to the approval of the Regional Supervisor. An application for approval of an assignment of a right-of-way or of a lineal segment thereof, shall be filed in triplicate with the Regional Supervisor.

        (b) Any application for approval for an assignment, in whole or in part, of any right, title, or interest in a right-of-way grant must be accompanied by the same showing of qualifications of the assignees as is required of an applicant for a ROW in § 250.1015 of this subpart and must be supported by a statement that the assignee agrees to comply with and to be bound by the terms and conditions of the ROW grant. The assignee must satisfy the bonding requirements in 30 CFR 550.1011. No transfer will be recognized unless and until it is first approved, in writing, by the Regional Supervisor.

      Subpart K—Oil and Gas Production Requirements

        General

          § 250.1150   What are the general reservoir production requirements?

#### § § 250.1150

          You must produce wells and reservoirs at rates that provide for economic development while maximizing ultimate recovery and without adversely affecting correlative rights.

        Well Tests and Surveys

          § 250.1151   How often must I conduct well production tests?

#### § § 250.1151

          (a) You must conduct well production tests as shown in the following table:

          (b) You may request an extension from the Regional Supervisor if you cannot submit the results of a semiannual well test within the specified time.

          (c) You must submit to the Regional Supervisor an original and two copies of the appropriate form required by paragraph (a) of this section; one of the copies of the form must be a public information copy in accordance with §§ 250.186 and 250.197, and marked “Public Information.” You must submit two copies of the supporting information as listed in the table in § 250.1167 with form BSEE-0126.

          (a) When you conduct well tests you must:

          (1) Recover fluid from the well completion equivalent to the amount of fluid introduced into the formation during completion, recompletion, reworking, or treatment operations before you start a well test;

          (2) Produce the well completion under stabilized rate conditions for at least 6 consecutive hours before beginning the test period;

          (3) Conduct the test for at least 4 consecutive hours;

          (4) Adjust measured gas volumes to the standard conditions of 14.73 pounds per square inch absolute (psia) and 60 °F for all tests; and

          (5) Use measured specific gravity values to calculate gas volumes.

          (b) You may request approval from the Regional Supervisor to conduct a well test using alternative procedures if you can demonstrate test reliability under those procedures.

          (c) The Regional Supervisor may also require you to conduct the following tests and complete them within a specified time period:

          (1) A retest or a prolonged test of a well completion if it is determined to be necessary for the proper establishment of a Maximum Production Rate (MPR) or a Maximum Efficient Rate (MER); and

          (2) A multipoint back-pressure test to determine the theoretical open-flow potential of a gas well.

          (d) A BSEE representative may witness any well test. Upon request, you must provide advance notice to the Regional Supervisor of the times and dates of well tests.

          §§ 250.1153-250.1155   [Reserved]

#### § §§ 250.1153-250.1155

        Approvals Prior to Production

          § 250.1156   What steps must I take to receive approval to produce within 500 feet of a unit or lease line?

#### § § 250.1156

          (a) You must obtain approval from the Regional Supervisor before you start producing from a reservoir within a well that has any portion of the completed interval less than 500 feet from a unit or lease line. Submit to BSEE the service fee listed in § 250.125, according to the instructions in § 250.126, and the supporting information, as listed in the table in § 250.1167, with your request. The Regional Supervisor will determine whether approval of your request will maximize ultimate recovery, avoid the waste of natural resources, or protect correlative rights. You do not need to obtain approval if the adjacent leases or units have the same unit, lease (record title and operating rights), and royalty interests as the lease or unit you plan to produce. You do not need to obtain approval if the adjacent block is unleased.

          (b) You must notify the operator(s) of adjacent property(ies) that are within 500 feet of the completion, if the adjacent acreage is a leased block in the Federal OCS. You must provide the Regional Supervisor proof of the date of the notification. The operators of the adjacent properties have 30 days after receiving the notification to provide the Regional Supervisor letters of acceptance or objection. If an adjacent operator does not respond within 30 days, the Regional Supervisor will presume there are no objections and proceed with a decision. The notification must include:

          (1) The well name;

          (2) The rectangular coordinates (x, y) of the location of the top and bottom of the completion or target completion referenced to the North American Datum 1983, and the subsea depths of the top and bottom of the completion or target completion;

          (3) The distance from the completion or target completion to the unit or lease line at its nearest point; and

          (4) A statement indicating whether or not it will be a high-capacity completion having a perforated or open hole interval greater than 150 feet measured depth.

          § 250.1157   How do I receive approval to produce gas-cap gas from an oil reservoir with an associated gas cap?

#### § § 250.1157

          (a) You must request and receive approval from the Regional Supervisor:

          (1) Before producing gas-cap gas from each completion in an oil reservoir that is known to have an associated gas cap.

          (2) To continue production from a well if the oil reservoir is not initially known to have an associated gas cap, but the oil well begins to show characteristics of a gas well.

          (b) For either request, you must submit the service fee listed in § 250.125, according to the instructions in § 250.126, and the supporting information, as listed in the table in § 250.1167, with your request.

          (c) The Regional Supervisor will determine whether your request maximizes ultimate recovery.

          § 250.1158   How do I receive approval to downhole commingle hydrocarbons?

#### § § 250.1158

          (a) Before you perforate a well, you must request and receive approval from the Regional Supervisor to commingle hydrocarbons produced from multiple reservoirs within a common wellbore. The Regional Supervisor will determine whether your request maximizes ultimate recovery. You must include the service fee listed in § 250.125, according to the instructions in § 250.126, and the supporting information, as listed in the table in § 250.1167, with your request.

          (b) If one or more of the reservoirs proposed for commingling is a competitive reservoir, you must notify the operators of all leases that contain the reservoir that you intend to downhole commingle the reservoirs. Your request for approval of downhole commingling must include proof of the date of this notification. The notified operators have 30 days after notification to provide the Regional Supervisor with letters of acceptance or objection. If the notified operators do not respond within the specified period, the Regional Supervisor will assume the operators do not object and proceed with a decision.

        Production Rates

          § 250.1159   May the Regional Supervisor limit my well or reservoir production rates?

#### § § 250.1159

          (a) The Regional Supervisor may set a Maximum Production Rate (MPR) for a producing well completion, or set a Maximum Efficient Rate (MER) for a reservoir, or both, if the Regional Supervisor determines that an excessive production rate could harm ultimate recovery. An MPR or MER will be based on well tests and any limitations imposed by well and surface equipment, sand production, reservoir sensitivity, gas-oil and water-oil ratios, location of perforated intervals, and prudent operating practices.

          (b) If the Regional Supervisor sets an MPR for a producing well completion and/or an MER for a reservoir, you may not exceed those rates except due to normal variations and fluctuations in production rates as set by the Regional Supervisor.

        Flaring, Venting, and Burning Hydrocarbons

          § 250.1160   When may I flare or vent gas?

#### § § 250.1160

          (a) You must request and receive approval from the Regional Supervisor to flare or vent natural gas at your facility, except in the following situations:

          (b) Regardless of the requirements in paragraph (a) of this section, you must not flare or vent gas over the volume approved in your Development Operations Coordination Document (DOCD) or your Development and Production Plan (DPP) submitted to BOEM.

          (c) The Regional Supervisor may establish alternative approval procedures to cover situations when you cannot contact the BSEE office, such as during non-office hours.

          (d) The Regional Supervisor may specify a volume limit, or a shorter time limit than specified elsewhere in this part, in order to prevent air quality degradation or loss of reserves.

          (e) If you flare or vent gas without the required approval, or if the Regional Supervisor determines that you were negligent or could have avoided flaring or venting the gas, the hydrocarbons will be considered avoidably lost or wasted. You must pay royalties on the loss or waste, according to 30 CFR part 1202. You must value any gas or liquid hydrocarbons avoidably lost or wasted under the provisions of 30 CFR part 1206.

          (f) Fugitive emissions from valves, fittings, flanges, pressure relief valves or similar components do not require approval under this subpart unless specifically required by the Regional Supervisor.

          § 250.1161   When may I flare or vent gas for extended periods of time?

#### § § 250.1161

          You must request and receive approval from the Regional Supervisor to flare or vent gas for an extended period of time. The Regional Supervisor will specify the approved period of time, which will not exceed 1 year. The Regional Supervisor may deny your request if it does not ensure the conservation of natural resources or is not consistent with National interests relating to development and production of minerals of the OCS. The Regional Supervisor may approve your request for one of the following reasons:

          (a) You initiated an action which, when completed, will eliminate flaring and venting; or

          (b) You submit to the Regional Supervisor an evaluation supported by engineering, geologic, and economic data indicating that the oil and gas produced from the well(s) will not economically support the facilities necessary to sell the gas or to use the gas on or for the benefit of the lease.

          § 250.1162   When may I burn produced liquid hydrocarbons?

#### § § 250.1162

          (a) You must request and receive approval from the Regional Supervisor to burn any produced liquid hydrocarbons. The Regional Supervisor may allow you to burn liquid hydrocarbons if you demonstrate that transporting them to market or re-injecting them is not technically feasible or poses a significant risk of harm to offshore personnel or the environment.

          (b) If you burn liquid hydrocarbons without the required approval, or if the Regional Supervisor determines that you were negligent or could have avoided burning liquid hydrocarbons, the hydrocarbons will be considered avoidably lost or wasted. You must pay royalties on the loss or waste, according to 30 CFR part 1202. You must value any liquid hydrocarbons avoidably lost or wasted under the provisions of 30 CFR part 1206.

          § 250.1163   How must I measure gas flaring or venting volumes and liquid hydrocarbon burning volumes, and what records must I maintain?

#### § § 250.1163

          (a) If your facility processes more than an average of 2,000 bopd during May 2010, you must install flare/vent meters within 180 days after May 2010. If your facility processes more than an average of 2,000 bopd during a calendar month after May 2010, you must install flare/vent meters within 120 days after the end of the month in which the average amount of oil processed exceeds 2,000 bopd.

      Subpart M—Unitization

        § 250.1300   What is the purpose of this subpart?

#### § § 250.1300

        This subpart explains how Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) leases are unitized. If you are an OCS lessee, use the regulations in this subpart for both competitive reservoir and unitization situations. The purpose of joint development and unitization is to:

        (a) Conserve natural resources;

        (b) Prevent waste; and/or

        (c) Protect correlative rights, including Federal royalty interests.

        § 250.1301   What are the requirements for unitization?

#### § § 250.1301

        (a)  You and other OCS lessees may ask the Regional Supervisor to approve a request for voluntary unitization. The Regional Supervisor may approve the request for voluntary unitization if unitized operations:

        (1) Promote and expedite exploration and development; or

        (2) Prevent waste, conserve natural resources, or protect correlative rights, including Federal royalty interests, of a reasonably delineated and productive reservoir.

        (b)  The Regional Supervisor may require you and other lessees to unitize operations of a reasonably delineated and productive reservoir if unitized operations are necessary to:

        (1) Prevent waste;

        (2) Conserve natural resources; or

        (3) Protect correlative rights, including Federal royalty interests.

        (c)  The area that a unit includes is the minimum number of leases that will allow the lessees to minimize the number of platforms, facility installations, and wells necessary for efficient exploration, development, and production of mineral deposits, oil and gas reservoirs, or potential hydrocarbon accumulations common to two or more leases. A unit may include whole leases or portions of leases.

        (d)  You, the other lessees, and the unit operator must enter into a unit agreement. The unit agreement must: allocate benefits to unitized leases, designate a unit operator, and specify the effective date of the unit agreement. The unit agreement must terminate when: the unit no longer produces unitized substances, and the unit operator no longer conducts drilling or well-workover operations (§ 250.180) under the unit agreement, unless the Regional Supervisor orders or approves a suspension of production under § 250.170.

        (e)  The unit operator and the owners of working interests in the unitized leases must enter into a unit operating agreement. The unit operating agreement must describe how all the unit participants will apportion all costs and liabilities incurred maintaining or conducting operations. When a unit involves one or more net-profit-share leases, the unit operating agreement must describe how to attribute costs and credits to the net-profit-share lease(s), and this part of the agreement must be approved by the Regional Supervisor. Otherwise, you must provide a copy of the unit operating agreement to the Regional Supervisor, but the Regional Supervisor does not need to approve the unit operating agreement.

        (f)  If your unit agreement expires or terminates, or the unit area adjusts so that no part of your lease remains within the unit boundaries, your lease expires unless:

        (1) Its initial term has not expired;

        (2) You conduct drilling, production, or well-reworking operations on your lease consistent with applicable regulations; or

        (3) BSEE orders or approves a suspension of production or operations for your lease.

        (g)  If your lease, or any part of your lease, is subject to a unit agreement, the entire lease continues for the term provided in the lease, and as long thereafter as any portion of your lease remains part of the unit area, and as long as operations continue the unit in effect.

        (1) If you drill, produce or perform well-workover operations on a lease within a unit, each lease, or part of a lease, in the unit will remain active in accordance with the unit agreement. Following a discovery, if your unit ceases drilling activities for a reasonable time period between the delineation of one or more reservoirs and the initiation of actual development drilling or production operations and that time period would extend beyond your lease's primary term or any extension under § 250.180, the unit operator must request and obtain BSEE approval of a suspension of production under § 250.170 in order to keep the unit from terminating.

        (2) When a lease in a unit agreement is beyond the primary term and the lease or unit is not producing, the lease will expire unless:

        (i) You conduct a continuous drilling or well reworking program designed to develop or restore the lease or unit production; or

        (ii) BSEE orders or approves a suspension of operations under § 250.170.

        § 250.1302   What if I have a competitive reservoir on a lease?

#### § § 250.1302

        (a) The Regional Supervisor may require you to conduct development and production operations in a competitive reservoir under either a joint Competitive Reservoir Development Program submitted to BSEE or a unitization agreement. A competitive reservoir has one or more producing or producible well completions on each of two or more leases, or portions of leases, with different lease operating interests. For purposes of this paragraph, a producible well completion is a well which is capable of production and which is shut in at the well head or at the surface but not necessarily connected to production facilities and from which the operator plans future production.

        (b) You may request that the Regional Supervisor make a preliminary determination whether a reservoir is competitive. When you receive the preliminary determination, you have 30 days (or longer if the Regional Supervisor allows additional time) to concur or to submit an objection with supporting evidence if you do not concur. The Regional Supervisor will make a final determination and notify you and the other lessees.

        (c) If you conduct drilling or production operations in a reservoir determined competitive by the BSEE Regional Supervisor, you and the other affected lessees must submit for approval a joint Competitive Reservoir Development Program. You must submit the joint Competitive Reservoir Development Program within 90 days after the Regional Supervisor makes a final determination that the reservoir is competitive. The joint Competitive Reservoir Development Program must provide for the development and/or production of the reservoir. You may submit supplemental Competitive Reservoir Development Programs for the Regional Supervisor's approval.

        (d) If you and the other affected lessees cannot reach an agreement on a joint Competitive Reservoir Development Program, submitted to BSEE within the approved period of time, each lessee must submit a separate Competitive Reservoir Development Program to the Regional Supervisor. The Regional Supervisor will hold a hearing to resolve differences in the separate Competitive Reservoir Development Programs. If the differences in the separate programs are not resolved at the hearing and the Regional Supervisor determines that unitization is necessary under § 250.1301(b), BSEE will initiate unitization under § 250.1304.

        § 250.1303   How do I apply for voluntary unitization?

#### § § 250.1303

        (a) You must file a request for a voluntary unit with the Regional Supervisor. Your request must include:

        (1) A draft of the proposed unit agreement;

        (2) A proposed initial plan of operation;

        (3) Supporting geological, geophysical, and engineering data; and

        (4) Other information that may be necessary to show that the unitization proposal meets the criteria of § 250.1300.

        (b) The unit agreement must comply with the requirements of this part. BSEE will maintain and provide a model unit agreement for you to follow. If BSEE revises the model, BSEE will publish the revised model in the  If you vary your unit agreement from the model agreement, you must obtain the approval of the Regional Supervisor.

        (c) After the Regional Supervisor accepts your unitization proposal, you, the other lessees, and the unit operator must sign and file copies of the unit agreement, the unit operating agreement, and the initial plan of operation with the Regional Supervisor for approval.

        (d) You must pay the service fee listed in § 250.125 of this part with your request for a voluntary unitization proposal or the expansion of a previously approved voluntary unit to include additional acreage. Additionally, you must pay the service fee listed in § 250.125 with your request for unitization revision.

        § 250.1304   How will BSEE require unitization?

#### § § 250.1304

        (a) If the Regional Supervisor determines that unitization of operations within a proposed unit area is necessary to prevent waste, conserve natural resources of the OCS, or protect correlative rights, including Federal royalty interests, the Regional Supervisor may require unitization.

        (b) If you ask BSEE to require unitization, you must file a request with the Regional Supervisor. You must include a proposed unit agreement as described in §§ 250.1301(d) and 250.1303(b); a proposed unit operating agreement; a proposed initial plan of operation; supporting geological, geophysical, and engineering data; and any other information that may be necessary to show that unitization meets the criteria of § 250.1300. The proposed unit agreement must include a counterpart executed by each lessee seeking compulsory unitization. Lessees who seek compulsory unitization must simultaneously serve on the nonconsenting lessees copies of:

        (1) The request;

        (2) The proposed unit agreement with executed counterparts;

        (3) The proposed unit operating agreement; and

        (4) The proposed initial plan of operation.

        (c) If the Regional Supervisor initiates compulsory unitization, BSEE will serve all lessees of the proposed unit area with a proposed unitization plan and a statement of reasons for the proposed unitization.

        (d) The Regional Supervisor will not require unitization until BSEE provides all lessees of the proposed unit area written notice and an opportunity for a hearing. If you want BSEE to hold a hearing, you must request it within 30 days after you receive written notice from the Regional Supervisor or after you are served with a request for compulsory unitization from another lessee.

        (e) BSEE will not hold a hearing under this paragraph until at least 30 days after BSEE provides written notice of the hearing date to all parties owning interests that would be made subject to the unit agreement. The Regional Supervisor must give all lessees of the proposed unit area an opportunity to submit views orally and in writing and to question both those seeking and those opposing compulsory unitization. Adjudicatory procedures are not required. The Regional Supervisor will make a decision based upon a record of the hearing, including any written information made a part of the record. The Regional Supervisor will arrange for a court reporter to make a verbatim transcript. The party seeking compulsory unitization must pay for the court reporter and pay for and provide to the Regional Supervisor within 10 days after the hearing three copies of the verbatim transcript.

        (f) The Regional Supervisor will issue an order that requires or rejects compulsory unitization. That order must include a statement of reasons for the action taken and identify those parts of the record which form the basis of the decision. Any adversely affected party may appeal the final order of the Regional Supervisor under 30 CFR part 290.

          (b) In order to file an appeal, you must perform one of the following actions within the 60-day appeal period to have your appeal heard:

          (c) If you choose the alternative in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the BOEM Regional Director may require additional security ( security in excess of your existing bond) to ensure sufficient coverage during an appeal. In that event, the Regional Director will require you to post the supplemental bond with the regional office in the same manner as under 30 CFR 556.53(d) through (f). If the Regional Director determines the appeal should be covered by a lease-specific abandonment account then you must establish an account that meets the requirements of 30 CFR part 556.56.

          (d) Satisfying the bonding requirement in paragraph (b) of this section is a jurisdictional precondition for a civil penalty appeal.

          (1) Collect the amount you were assessed, plus interest, late payment charges, and other fees as provided by law, from the date you received the Reviewing Officer's final decision until the date we receive payment;

          (2) Initiate additional enforcement, including, if appropriate, cancellation of the lease, right-of-way, license, permit, or approval, or the forfeiture of a bond under this part; or

          (3) Bar you from doing further business with the Federal Government according to Executive Orders 12549 and 12689, and section 2455 of the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994, 31 U.S.C. 6101. The Department of the Interior's regulations implementing these authorities are found at 43 CFR part 12, subpart D.

        (2) The lessee shall case and cement all wells with a sufficient number of strings of casing cemented in a manner necessary to prevent release of fluids from any stratum through the wellbore (directly or indirectly) into the sea, protect freshwater aquifers from contamination, support unconsolidated sediments, and otherwise provide a means of control of the formation pressures and fluids. Cement composition, placement techniques, and waiting time shall be designed and conducted so that the cement in place behind the bottom 500 feet of casing or total length of annular cement fill, if less, attains a minimum compressive strength of 160 pounds per square inch (psi).

        (3) The lessee shall install casing designed to withstand the anticipated stresses imposed by tensile, compressive, and buckling loads; burst and collapse pressures; thermal effects; and combinations thereof. Safety factors in the drilling and casing program designs shall be of sufficient magnitude to provide well control during drilling and to assure safe operations for the life of the well.

        (4) In cases where cement has filled the annular space back to the mud line, the cement may be washed out or displaced to a depth not exceeding the depth of the structural casing shoe to facilitate casing removal upon well abandonment if the District Manager determines that subsurface protection against damage to freshwater aquifers and against damage caused by adverse loads, pressures, and fluid flows is not jeopardized.

        (5) If there are indications of inadequate cementing (such as lost returns, cement channeling, or mechanical failure of equipment), the lessee shall evaluate the adequacy of the cementing operations by pressure testing the casing shoe. If the test indicates inadequate cementing, the lessee shall initiate remedial action as approved by the District Manager. For cap rock casing, the test for adequacy of cementing shall be the pressure testing of the annulus between the cap rock and the conductor casings. The pressure shall not exceed 70 percent of the burst pressure of the conductor casing or 70 percent of the collapse pressure of the cap rock casing.

        (b)  This casing shall be set by driving, jetting, or drilling to a minimum depth of 100 feet below the mud line or such other depth, as may be required or approved by the District Manager, in order to support unconsolidated deposits and to provide hole stability for initial drilling operations. If this portion of the hole is drilled, a quantity of cement sufficient to fill the annular space back to the mud line shall be used.

        (c)  (1) Conductor and cap rock casing design and setting depths shall be based upon relevant engineering and geologic factors including the presence or absence of hydrocarbons, potential hazards, and water depths. The proposed casing setting depths may be varied, subject to District Manager approval, to permit the casing to be set in a competent formation or through formations determined desirable to be isolated from the wellbore by casing for safer drilling operations. However, the conductor casing shall be set immediately prior to drilling into formations known to contain oil or gas or, if unknown, upon encountering such formations. Cap rock casing shall be set and cemented through formations known to contain oil or gas or, if unknown, upon encountering such formations. Upon encountering unexpected formation pressures, the lessee shall submit a revised casing program to the District Manager for approval.

        (2) Conductor casing shall be cemented with a quantity of cement that fills the calculated annular space back to the mud line. Cement fill shall be verified by the observation of cement returns. In the event that observation of cement returns is not feasible, additional quantities of cement shall be used to assure fill to the mud line.

        (3) Cap rock casing shall be cemented with a quantity of cement that fills the calculated annular space to at least 200 feet inside the conductor casing. When geologic conditions such as near surface fractures and faulting exist, cap rock casing shall be cemented with a quantity of cement that fills the calculated annular space to the mud line, unless otherwise approved by the District Manager. In brine wells, the second cap rock casing shall be cemented with a quantity of cement that fills the calculated annular space to at least 200 feet above the setting depth of the first cap rock casing.

        (d)  (1) Bobtail cap rock casing shall be set on or just in cap rock and lapped a minimum of 100 feet into the previous casing string.

        (2) Sufficient cement shall be used to fill the annular space to the top of the bobtail cap rock casing.

        (e)  (1) Production liners for sulphur wells and bleedwells shall be set in cap rock at or above the bottom of the open hole (hole that is open in cap rock, below the bottom of the cap rock casing) and lapped into the previous casing string or to the surface. For brine wells, the liner shall be set in salt and lapped into the previous casing string or to the surface.

        (2) The production liner is not required to be cemented unless the cap rock contains oil or gas. If the cap rock contains oil or gas, sufficient cement shall be used to fill the annular space to the top of the production liner.

        § 250.1609   Pressure testing of casing.

#### § § 250.1609

        (a) Prior to drilling the plug after cementing, all casing strings, except the drive or structural casing, shall be pressure tested. The conductor casing shall be tested to at least 200 psi. All casing strings below the conductor casing shall be tested to 500 psi or 0.22 psi/ft, whichever is greater. (When oil or gas is not present in the cap rock, the production liner need not be cemented in place; thus, it would not be subject to pressure testing.) If the pressure declines more than 10 percent in 30 minutes or if there is another indication of a leak, the casing shall be recemented, repaired, or an additional casing string run and the casing tested again. The above procedures shall be repeated until a satisfactory test is obtained. The time, conditions of testing, and results of all casing pressure tests shall be recorded in the driller's report.

        (b) After cementing any string of casing other than structural, drilling shall not be resumed until there has been a time lapse of at least 8 hours under pressure for the conductor casing string or 12 hours under pressure for all other casing strings. Cement is considered under pressure if one or more float valves are shown to be holding the cement in place or when other means of holding pressure are used.

        You must ensure that a hazards analysis (facility level) and a JSA (operations/task level) are developed and implemented for all of your facilities and activities identified or discussed in your SEMS. You must document and maintain a current analysis for each operation covered by this section for the life of the operation at the facility. You must update the analysis when an internal audit is conducted to ensure that it is consistent with your facility's current operations.

        (a)  The hazards analysis must be appropriate for the complexity of the operation and must identify, evaluate, and manage the hazards involved in the operation.

        (1) The hazards analysis must address the following:

        (i) Hazards of the operation;

        (ii) Previous incidents related to the operation you are evaluating, including any incident in which you were issued an Incident of Noncompliance or a civil or criminal penalty;

        (iii) Control technology applicable to the operation your hazards analysis is evaluating; and

        (iv) A qualitative evaluation of the possible safety and health effects on employees, and potential impacts to the human and marine environments, which may result if the control technology fails.

        (2) The hazards analysis must be performed by a person(s) with experience in the operations being evaluated. These individuals also need to be experienced in the hazards analysis methodologies being employed.

        (3) You should assure that the recommendations in the hazards analysis are resolved and that the resolution is documented.

        (4) A single hazards analysis can be performed to fulfill the requirements for simple and nearly identical facilities, such as well jackets and single well caissons. You can apply this single hazards analysis to simple and nearly identical facilities after you verify that any site-specific deviations are addressed in each of your SEMS program elements.

        (b)  You must ensure a JSA is prepared, conducted, and approved for OCS activities that are identified or discussed in your SEMS program. The JSA is a technique used to identify risks to personnel associated with their job activities. The JSAs are also used to determine the appropriate mitigation measures needed to reduce job risks to personnel. The JSA must include all personnel involved with the job activity.

        (1) You must ensure that your JSA identifies, analyzes, and records:

        (i) The steps involved in performing a specific job;

        (ii) The existing or potential safety, health, and environmental hazards associated with each step; and

        (iii) The recommended action(s) and/or procedure(s) that will eliminate or reduce these hazards, the risk of a workplace injury or illness, or environmental impacts.

        (2) The immediate supervisor of the crew performing the job onsite must conduct the JSA, sign the JSA, and ensure that all personnel participating in the job understand and sign the JSA.

        (3) The individual you designate as being in charge of the facility must approve and sign all JSAs before personnel start the job.

        (4) If a particular job is conducted on a recurring basis, and if the parameters of these recurring jobs do not change, then the person in charge of the job may decide that a JSA for each individual job is not required. The parameters you must consider in making this determination include, but are not limited to, changes in personnel, procedures, equipment, and environmental conditions associated with the job.

        (c) All personnel, which includes contractors, must be trained in accordance with the requirements of § 250.1915. You must also verify that contractors are trained in accordance with § 250.1915 prior to performing a job.

    PART 254—OIL-SPILL RESPONSE REQUIREMENTS FOR FACILITIES LOCATED SEAWARD OF THE COAST LINE

### Part 254

**Authority:** Authority: 33 U.S.C. 1321.

**Source:** Source: 76 FR 64462, Oct. 18, 2011, unless otherwise noted.

      Subpart A—General

        § 254.1   Who must submit an oil spill response plan (OSRP)?

#### § § 254.1

        (a) If you are the owner or operator of an oil handling, storage, or transportation facility, and it is located seaward of the _coast line_, you must submit an oil spill response plan (OSRP) to BSEE for approval. Your OSRP must demonstrate that you can respond quickly and effectively whenever oil is discharged from your facility. Refer to § 254.6 for the definitions of  and  if you have any doubts about whether to submit a plan.

        (b) You must maintain a current OSRP for an abandoned facility until you physically remove or dismantle the facility or until the Chief, Oil Spill Preparedness Division (OSPD) notifies you in writing that a plan is no longer required.

        (c) Owners or operators of offshore pipelines carrying essentially dry gas do not need to submit a plan. You must, however, submit a plan for a pipeline that carries:

        (1) Oil;

        (2) Condensate that has been injected into the pipeline; or

        (3) Gas and naturally occurring condensate.

        (d) If you are in doubt as to whether you must submit a plan for an offshore facility or pipeline, you should check with the Chief, OSPD.

        (e) If your facility is located landward of the coast line, but you believe your facility is sufficiently similar to OCS facilities that it should be regulated by BSEE, you may contact the Chief, OSPD, offer to accept BSEE jurisdiction over your facility, and request that BSEE seek from the agency with jurisdiction over your facility a relinquishment of that jurisdiction.

> [76 FR 64462, Oct. 18, 2011, as amended at 81 FR 36151, June 6, 2016]

        § 254.2   When must I submit an OSRP?

#### § § 254.2

        (a) You must submit, and BSEE must approve, an OSRP that covers each facility located seaward of the coast line before you may use that facility. To continue operations, you must operate the facility in compliance with the OSRP.

        (b) Despite the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section, you may operate your facility after you submit your OSRP while BSEE reviews it for approval. To operate a facility without an approved OSRP, you must certify in writing to the Chief, OSPD that you have the capability to respond, to the maximum extent practicable, to a worst case discharge or a substantial threat of such a discharge. The certification must show that you have ensured by contract, or other means approved by the Chief, OSPD, the availability of private personnel and equipment necessary to respond to the discharge. Verification from the organization(s) providing the personnel and equipment must accompany the certification. BSEE will not allow you to operate a facility for more than 2 years without an approved OSRP.

> [81 FR 36151, June 6, 2016]

        § 254.3   May I cover more than one facility in my OSRP?

#### § § 254.3

        (a) Your OSRP may be for a single lease or facility or a group of leases or facilities. All the leases or facilities in your plan must have the same owner or operator (including affiliates) and must be located in the same BSEE Region (see definition of Regional OSRP in § 254.6).

        (b) Regional OSRPs must address all the elements required for an OSRP in subpart B, or subpart D of this part, as appropriate.

        (c) When developing a Regional OSRP, you may group leases or facilities subject to the approval of the Chief, OSPD, for the purposes of:

        (1) Calculating response times;

        (2) Determining quantities of response equipment;

        (3) Conducting oil-spill trajectory analyses;

        (4) Determining worst case discharge scenarios; and

        (5) Identifying areas of special economic and environmental importance that may be impacted and the strategies for their protection.

        (d) The Chief, OSPD, may specify how to address the elements of a Regional OSRP. The Chief, OSPD, also may require that Regional OSRPs contain additional information if necessary for compliance with appropriate laws and regulations.

> [81 FR 36151, June 6, 2016]

        § 254.4   May I reference other documents in my OSRP?

#### § § 254.4

        You may reference information contained in other readily accessible documents in your OSRP. Examples of documents that you may reference are the National Contingency Plan (NCP), Area Contingency Plan (ACP), BSEE or BOEM environmental documents, and Oil Spill Removal Organization (OSRO) documents that are readily accessible to the Chief, OSPD. You must ensure that the Chief, OSPD, possesses or is provided with copies of all OSRO documents you reference. You should contact the Chief, OSPD, if you want to know whether a reference is acceptable.

        § 254.5   General response plan requirements.

#### § § 254.5

        (a) The OSRP must provide for response to an oil spill from the facility. You must immediately carry out the provisions of the OSRP whenever there is a release of oil from the facility. You must also carry out the training, equipment testing, and periodic drills described in the OSRP, and these measures must be sufficient to ensure the safety of the facility and to mitigate or prevent a discharge or a substantial threat of a discharge.

        (b) The OSRP must be consistent with the National Contingency Plan and the appropriate Area Contingency Plan(s).

        (c) Nothing in this part relieves you from taking all appropriate actions necessary to immediately abate the source of a spill and remove any spills of oil.

        (d) In addition to the requirements listed in this part, you must provide any other information the Chief, OSPD, requires for compliance with appropriate laws and regulations.

        § 254.44   Calculating response equipment effective daily recovery capacities.

#### § § 254.44

        (a) You are required by § 254.26(d)(1) to calculate the effective daily recovery capacity of the response equipment identified in your OSRP that you would use to contain and recover your worst case discharge. You must calculate the effective daily recovery capacity of the equipment by multiplying the manufacturer's rated throughput capacity over a 24-hour period by 20 percent. This 20 percent efficiency factor takes into account the limitations of the recovery operations due to available daylight, sea state, temperature, viscosity, and emulsification of the oil being recovered. You must use this calculated rate to determine if you have sufficient recovery capacity to respond to your worst case discharge scenario.

        (b) If you want to use a different efficiency factor for specific oil recovery devices, you must submit evidence to substantiate that efficiency factor. Adequate evidence includes verified performance data measured during actual spills or test data gathered according to the provisions of § 254.45(b) and (c).

        § 254.47   Determining the volume of oil of your worst case discharge scenario.

#### § § 254.47

        You must calculate the volume of oil of your worst case discharge scenario as follows:

        (a) For an oil production platform facility, the size of your worst case discharge scenario is the sum of the following:

        (1) The maximum capacity of all oil storage tanks and flow lines on the facility. Flow line volume may be estimated; and

        (2) The volume of oil calculated to leak from a break in any pipelines connected to the facility considering shutdown time, the effect of hydrostatic pressure, gravity, frictional wall forces and other factors; and

        (3) The daily production volume from an uncontrolled blowout of the highest capacity well associated with the facility. In determining the daily discharge rate, you must consider reservoir characteristics, casing/production tubing sizes, and historical production and reservoir pressure data. Your scenario must discuss how to respond to this well flowing for 30 days as required by § 254.26(d)(1).

        (b) For exploratory or development drilling operations, the size of your worst case discharge scenario is the daily volume possible from an uncontrolled blowout. In determining the daily discharge rate, you must consider any known reservoir characteristics. If reservoir characteristics are unknown, you must consider the characteristics of any analog reservoirs from the area and give an explanation for the selection of the reservoir(s) used. Your scenario must discuss how to respond to this well flowing for 30 days as required by § 254.26(d)(1).

        (c) For a pipeline facility, the size of your worst case discharge scenario is the volume possible from a pipeline break. You must calculate this volume as follows:

        (1) Add the pipeline system leak detection time to the shutdown response time.

        (2) Multiply the time calculated in paragraph (c)(1) of this section by the highest measured oil flow rate over the preceding 12-month period. For new pipelines, you should use the predicted oil flow rate in the calculation.

        (3) Add to the volume calculated in paragraph (c)(2) of this section the total volume of oil that would leak from the pipeline after it is shut in. Calculate this volume by taking into account the effects of hydrostatic pressure, gravity, frictional wall forces, length of pipeline segment, tie-ins with other pipelines, and other factors.

        (d) If your facility which stores, handles, transfers, processes, or transports oil does not fall into the categories listed in paragraph (a), (b), or (c) of this section, contact the Chief, OSPD for instructions on the calculation of the volume of your worst case discharge scenario.

        Subject to the authority of the Secretary, the following activities are subject to the regulations in this part and are under the jurisdiction of the Director: Exploration, testing, and mining operations together with the associated environmental protection measures needed to permit those activities to be conducted in an environmentally responsible manner; handling, measurement, and transportation of OCS minerals; and other operations and activities conducted pursuant to a lease issued under 30 CFR part 581, or pursuant to a right of use and easement granted under 30 CFR 582.30, by or on behalf of a lessee or the holder of a right of use and easement.

        § 282.11   Director's authority.

#### § § 282.11

        (a)-(c) [Reserved]

        (d)(1) The Director may approve the consolidation of two or more OCS mineral leases or portions of two or more OCS mineral leases into a single mining unit requested by lessees, or the Director may require such consolidation when the operation of those leases or portions of leases as a single mining unit is in the interest of conservation of the natural resources of the OCS or the prevention of waste. A mining unit may also include all or portions of one or more OCS mineral leases with all or portions of one or more adjacent State leases for minerals in a common orebody. A single unit operator shall be responsible for submission of required Delineation, Testing, and Mining Plans covering OCS mineral operations for an approved mining unit.

        (2) Operations such as exploration, testing, and mining activities conducted in accordance with an approved plan on any lease or portion of a lease which is subject to an approved mining unit shall be considered operations on each of the leases that is made subject to the approved mining unit.

        (3) Minimum royalty paid pursuant to a Federal lease, which is subject to an approved mining unit, is creditable against the production royalties allocated to that Federal lease during the lease year for which the minimum royalty is paid.

        (4) Any OCS minerals produced from State and Federal leases which are subject to an approved mining unit shall be accounted for separately unless a method of allocating production between State and Federal leases has been approved by the Director and the appropriate State official.

        § 282.12   Director's responsibilities.

#### § § 282.12

        (a) The Director is responsible for the regulation of activities to assure that all operations conducted under a lease or right of use and easement are conducted in a manner that protects the environment and promotes orderly development of OCS mineral resources. Those activities are to be designed to prevent serious harm or damage to, or waste of, any natural resource (including OCS mineral deposits and oil, gas, and sulphur resources in areas leased or not leased), any life (including fish and other aquatic life), property, or the marine, coastal, or human environment.

        (b)-(d) [Reserved]

        (e) The Director shall assure that a scheduled onsite compliance inspection of each facility which is subject to regulations in this part is conducted at least once a year. The inspection shall be to determine that the lessee is in compliance with the requirements of the law; provisions of the lease; the approved Delineation, Testing, or Mining Plan; and the regulations in this part. Additional unscheduled onsite inspections shall be conducted without advance notice to the lessee to assure compliance with the provisions of applicable law; the lease; the approved Delineation, Testing, or Mining Plan; and the regulations in this part.

        (f)(1) The Director shall, after completion of the technical and environmental evaluations, approve, disapprove, or require modification of the lessee's requests, applications, plans, and notices submitted pursuant to the provisions of this part; issue orders to govern lease operations; and require compliance with applicable provisions of the law, the regulations, the lease, and the approved Delineation, Testing, or Mining Plans.

        (2) The Director shall, after completion of the technical and environmental evaluations, approve, disapprove, or require modification, as appropriate, of the design plan, fabrication plan, and installation plan for platforms, artificial islands, and other installations and devices permanently or temporarily attached to the seabed. The approval, disapproval, or requirement to modify such plans may take the form of a condition of granting a right of use and easement under paragraph (a) of this section or as authorized under any lease issued or maintained under the Act.

        (g) [Reserved]

        (h) The Director may prescribe or approve, in writing or orally, departures from the operating requirements of the regulations of this part when such departures are necessary to facilitate the proper development of a lease; to conserve natural resources; or to protect life (including fish and other aquatic life), property, or the marine, coastal, or human environment.

        § 282.13   Suspension of production or other operations.

#### § § 282.13

        (a) The Director may direct the suspension or temporary prohibition of production or any other operation or activity on all or any part of a lease when it has been determined that such suspension or temporary prohibition is in the National interest to:

        (1) Facilitate proper development of a lease including a reasonable time to develop a mine and construct necessary support facilities, or

        (2) Allow for the construction or negotiation for use of transportation facilities.

        (b) The Director may also direct or, at the request of the lessee, approve a suspension or temporary prohibition of production or any other operation or activity, if:

        (1) The lessee failed to comply with a provision of applicable law, regulation, order, or the lease;

        (2) There is a threat of serious, irreparable, or immediate harm or damage to life (including fish and other aquatic life), property, any mineral deposit, or the marine, coastal, or human environment;

        (3) The suspension or temporary prohibition is in the interest of National security or defense;

        (4) The suspension or temporary prohibition is necessary for the initiation and conduct of an environmental evaluation to define mitigation measures to avoid or minimize adverse environmental impacts.

        (5) The suspension or temporary prohibition is necessary to facilitate the installation of equipment necessary for safety of operations and protection of the environment;

        (6) The suspension or temporary prohibition is necessary to allow for undue delays encountered by the lessee in obtaining required permits or consents, including administrative or judicial challenges or appeals;

        (7) The Director determines that continued operations would result in premature abandonment of a producing mine, resulting in the loss of otherwise recoverable OCS minerals;

        (8) The Director determines that the lessee cannot successfully operate a producing mine due to market conditions that are either temporary in nature or require temporary shutdown and reinvestment in order for the lessee to adapt to the conditions; or

        (9) The suspension or temporary prohibition is necessary to comply with judicial decrees prohibiting production or any other operation or activity, or the permitting of those activities, effective the date set by the court for that prohibition.

        (c) When the Director orders or approves a suspension or a temporary prohibition of operation or activity including production on all of a lease pursuant to paragraph (a) or (b) of this section, the term of the lease shall be extended for a period of time equal to the period of time that the suspension or temporary prohibition is in effect, except that no lease shall be so extended when the suspension or temporary prohibition is the result of the lessee's gross negligence or willful violation of a provision of the lease or governing regulations.

        (d) The Director may, at any time within the period prescribed for a suspension or temporary prohibition issued pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this section, require the lessee to submit a Delineation, Testing, or Mining Plan to the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management for approval in accordance with the requirements for the approval of such plans in part 582 of this title.

        (e)(1) When the Director orders or issues a suspension or a temporary prohibition pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the Director may require the lessee to conduct site-specific studies to identify and evaluate the cause(s) of the hazard(s) generating the suspension or temporary prohibition, the potential for damage from the hazard(s), and the measures available for mitigating the hazard(s). The nature, scope, and content of any study shall be subject to approval by the Director. The lessee shall furnish copies and all results of any such study to the Director. The cost of the study shall be borne by the lessee unless the Director arranges for the cost of the study to be borne by a party other than the lessee. The Director shall make results of any such study available to interested parties and to the public as soon as practicable after the completion of the study and submission of the results thereof.

        (2) When the Director determines that measures are necessary, on the basis of the results of the studies conducted in accordance with paragraph (e)(1) of this section and other information available to and identified by the Director, the lessee will be required to take appropriate measures to mitigate, avoid, or minimize the damage or potential damage on which the suspension or temporary prohibition is based. In choosing between alternative mitigation measures, the Director will balance the cost of the required measures against the reduction or potential reduction in damage or threat of damage or harm to life (including fish and other aquatic life), to property, to any mineral deposits (in areas leased or not leased), to the National security or defense, or to the marine, coastal, or human environment. When deemed appropriate by the Director, the lessee must submit to the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management a revised Delineation, Testing, or Mining Plan that incorporates the mitigation measures required by the Director.

        (f)(1) If under the provisions of paragraphs (b)(2), (3), and (4) of this section, the Director, with respect to any lease, directs the suspension of production or other operations on the entire leasehold, no payment of rental or minimum royalty shall be due for or during the period of the directed suspension and the time for the lessee specify royalty free period of a period of reduced royalty pursuant to 30 CFR 581.28(b) will be extended for the period of directed suspension. If under the provisions of paragraphs (b)(2), (3), and (4) of this section the Director, with respect to a lease on which there has been no production, directs the suspension of operations on the entire leasehold, no payment of rental shall be due during the period of the directed suspension.

        (2) If under the provisions of this section, the Director grants the request of a lessee for a suspension of production or other operations, the lessee's obligations to pay rental, minimum royalty, or royalty shall continue to apply during the period of the approved suspension, unless the Director's approval of the lessee's request for suspension authorizes the payment of a lesser amount during the period of approved suspension. If under the provision of this section, the Director grants a lessee's request for a suspension of production or other operations for a lease which includes provisions for a time period which the lessee may specify during which production from the leasehold would be royalty free or subject to a reduced royalty obligation pursuant to 30 CFR 581.28(b), the time during which production from a leasehold may be royalty free or subject to a reduced royalty obligation shall not be extended unless the Director's approval of the suspension specifies otherwise.

        (3) If the lease anniversary date falls within a period of suspension for which no rental or minimum royalty payments are required under paragraph (a) of this section, the prorated rentals or minimum royalties are due and payable as of the date the suspension period terminates. These amounts shall be computed and notice thereof given the lessee. The lessee shall pay the amount due within 30 days after receipt of such notice. The anniversary date of a lease shall not change by reason of any period of lease suspension or rental or royalty relief resulting therefrom.

        (1) Processing costs will include contract oversight and efforts to review and approve documents prepared by contractors, whether the contractor is paid directly by the applicant or through BSEE.

        (2) We may apply a standard overhead rate to direct processing costs.

        (b) We will assess the ongoing processing fee for each individual application or request according to the following procedures:

        (1) Before we process your application or request, we will give you a written estimate of the proposed fee based on reasonable processing costs.

        (2) You may comment on the proposed fee.

        (3) You may:

        (i) Ask for our approval to perform, or to directly pay a contractor to perform, all or part of any document, study, or other activity according to standards we specify, thereby reducing our costs for processing your application or request; or

        (ii) Ask to pay us to perform, or contract for, all or part of any document, study, or other activity.

        (4) We will then give you the final estimate of the processing fee amount with payment terms and instructions after considering your comments and any BSEE-approved work you will do.

        (i) If we encounter higher or lower processing costs than anticipated, we will re-estimate our reasonable processing costs following the procedures in paragraphs (b)(1) through (4) of this section, but we will not stop ongoing processing unless you do not pay in accordance with paragraph (b)(5) of this section.

        (ii) Once processing is complete, we will refund to you the amount of money that we did not spend on processing costs.

        (5)(i) Consistent with the payment and billing terms provided in the final estimate, we will periodically estimate what our reasonable processing costs will be for a specific period and will bill you for that period. Payment is due to us 30 days after you receive your bill. We will stop processing your document if you do not pay the bill by the date payment is due.

        (ii) If a periodic payment turns out to be more or less than our reasonable processing costs for the period, we will adjust the next billing accordingly or make a refund. Do not deduct any amount from a payment without our prior written approval.

        (6) You must pay the entire fee before we will issue the final document or take final action on your application or request.

        (7) You may appeal our estimated processing costs in accordance with the regulations in 43 CFR part 4. We will not process the document further until the appeal is resolved, unless you pay the fee under protest while the appeal is pending. If the appeal results in a decision changing the proposed fee, we will adjust the fee in accordance with paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section. If we adjust the fee downward, we will not pay interest.

If you claim confidential treatment, then when you provide the document to BSEE you must:

      (1) Provide a complete unredacted copy of the document and indicate on that copy that you are making a request for confidential treatment for some or all of the information in the document.

      (2) Provide a statement specifying the specific statutory justification for nondisclosure of the information for which you claim confidential treatment. General claims of confidentiality are not sufficient. You must furnish sufficient information for BSEE to make an informed decision on the request for confidential treatment.

      (3) Provide a second copy of the document from which you have redacted the information for which you wish to claim confidential treatment. If you do not submit a second copy of the document with the confidential information redacted, BSEE may assume that there is no objection to public disclosure of the document in its entirety.

      (b) In making data and information you submit available to the public, BSEE will not disclose documents exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) and will follow the procedures set forth in the implementing regulations at 43 CFR part 2 to give submitters an opportunity to object to disclosure.

#### § § 291.112

      BSEE will begin processing a complaint upon receipt of a processing fee or granting a waiver of the fee. The BSEE Director will review the complaint, answer, and other information, and will serve all parties with a written decision that:

      (a) Makes findings of fact and conclusions of law; and

      (b) Renders a decision determining whether the complainant has been denied open and nondiscriminatory access.

      § 291.113   What actions may BSEE take to remedy denial of open and nondiscriminatory access?

#### § § 291.113

      If the BSEE Director's decision under § 291.112 determines that the grantee or transporter has not provided open access or nondiscriminatory access, then the decision will describe the actions BSEE will take to require the grantee or transporter to remedy the denial of open access or nondiscriminatory access. The remedies BSEE would require must be consistent with BSEE's statutory authority, regulations, and any limits thereon due to Congressional delegations to other agencies. Actions BSEE may take include, but are not limited to:

      (a) Ordering grantees and transporters to provide open and nondiscriminatory access to the complainant;

      (b) Assessing civil penalties of up to $10,000 per day under 30 CFR part 250, subpart N, for failure to comply with a BSEE order to provide open access or nondiscriminatory access. Penalties will begin to accrue 60 days after the grantee or transporter receives the order to provide open and nondiscriminatory access if it has not provided such access by that time. However, if BSEE determines that requiring the construction of facilities would be an appropriate remedy under the OCSLA, penalties will begin to accrue 10 days after conclusion of diligent construction of needed facilities or 60 days after the grantee or transporter receives the order to provide open and nondiscriminatory access, whichever is later, if it has not provided such access by that time;

      (c) Requesting the Attorney General to institute a civil action in the appropriate United States District Court under 43 U.S.C. 1350(a) for a temporary restraining order, injunction, or other appropriate remedy to enforce the open and nondiscriminatory access requirements of 43 U.S.C. 1334(e) and (f)(1)(A); or

      (d) Initiating a proceeding to forfeit the right-of-way grant under 43 U.S.C. 1334(e).

      § 291.114   How do I appeal to the IBLA?

#### § § 291.114

      Any party, except as provided in § 291.115(b), adversely affected by a decision of the BSEE Director under this part may appeal to the Interior Board of Land Appeals (IBLA) under the procedures in 43 CFR part 4, subpart E.

      § 291.115   How do I exhaust administrative remedies?

#### § § 291.115

      (a) If the BSEE Director issues a decision under this part but does not expressly make the decision effective upon issuance, you must appeal the decision to the IBLA under 43 CFR part 4 to exhaust administrative remedies. Such decision will not be effective during the time in which a person adversely affected by the BSEE Director's decision may file a notice of appeal with the IBLA, and the timely filing of a notice of appeal will suspend the effect of the decision pending the decision on appeal.

      (b) This section does not apply if a decision was made effective by:

      (1) The BSEE Director; or

      (2) The Assistant Secretary for Land and Minerals Management.
