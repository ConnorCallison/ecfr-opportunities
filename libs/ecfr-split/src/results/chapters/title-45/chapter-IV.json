Upon such request, ORR shall afford the unaccompanied child a hearing before the Placement Review Panel (PRP) at which the unaccompanied child may, with the assistance of counsel at no cost to the Federal Government, present evidence on their own behalf. An unaccompanied child may present witnesses and cross-examine ORR's witnesses, if such child and ORR witnesses are willing to voluntarily testify. An unaccompanied child shall be provided access at the PRP hearing to interpretation services in their native or preferred language, depending on the unaccompanied child's preference, and in a way they effectively understand. An unaccompanied child that does not wish to request a hearing may also have their placement reconsidered by submitting a written request for a reconsideration along with any supporting documents as evidence.

                  "(d) The PRP shall issue a written decision in the child's native or preferred language within 7 days of a hearing and submission of evidence or, if no hearing or review of additional evidence is requested, within 7 days following receipt of an unaccompanied child's written statement.

Unaccompanied children placed in restrictive placements shall receive a written notice of the procedures under this section and may use a form provided to them to decline a hearing under this section. Unaccompanied children in restrictive placements may decline the hearing at any time, including after consultation with counsel.\n",

Requests under this section must be made in writing by the unaccompanied child, their attorney of record, or their parent or legal guardian by submitting a form provided by ORR to the care provider facility or by making a separate written request that contains the information requested in ORR's form.\n",

ORR may also present evidence at the hearing, whether in writing, or by appearing in person or by video or teleconference.\n",

                  "(3) If the hearing officer's decision found that the unaccompanied child would not pose a danger to self or to the community if released from ORR custody, and such decision would result in ORR releasing the unaccompanied child from its custody (e.g., because the only factor preventing release was ORR's determination that the unaccompanied child posed a danger to self or to the community), an appeal to the Assistant Secretary shall not effect a stay of the hearing officer's decision, unless the Assistant Secretary issues a decision in writing within five business days of such hearing officer decision that release of the unaccompanied child would result in a danger to self or to the community. Such a stay decision must include a description of behaviors of the unaccompanied child while in ORR custody and/or documented criminal or juvenile behavior records from the unaccompanied child demonstrating that the unaccompanied child would present a danger to self or to the community if released.\n",
                  "(h) Decisions under this section are final and binding on the Department, and an unaccompanied child who was determined to pose a danger to self or to the community if released may only seek another hearing under this section if the unaccompanied child can demonstrate a material change in circumstances. Similarly, ORR may request the hearing officer to make a new determination under this section only if ORR can show that a material change in circumstances means the unaccompanied child should no longer be released due to presenting a danger to self or to the community.\n",
                  "(i) This section cannot be used to determine whether an unaccompanied child has a suitable sponsor.\n",

Regardless of the outcome of a risk determination hearing or appeal, an unaccompanied child may not be released unless ORR identifies a safe and appropriate placement pursuant to subpart C of this part; and regardless of the outcome of a risk determination hearing or appeal, an unaccompanied child may only be transferred to another placement by ORR pursuant to requirements set forth at subparts B and G of this part.\n\n\n\n\n"
