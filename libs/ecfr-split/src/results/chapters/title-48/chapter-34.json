If the Contractor estimates that the funds available will allow it to continue to discharge its obligations beyond that date, it may specify a later date in its request to terminate the applicable CLIN(s), and the Contracting Officer may terminate such CLIN(s) on that later date.

The provisions of this clause will apply in like manner to the additional allotted funds and agreed substitute date, and the contract will be modified accordingly.\n",

The provisions of this clause are limited to the work and allotment of funds for the CLIN(s) set forth in paragraph (l) of this clause.
