      (a) If the release of a record covered by this subpart would be of concern to both the Corporation and another Federal agency, the record will be made available only after consultation with the other agency concerned. Records of another agency in the Corporation's possession will not be disclosed without the approval of the other agency.

      (b) If the release of a record covered by this subpart would be of concern to both the Corporation and to a foreign, state or local government, the record will be made available by the Corporation only after consultation with the other interested foreign state or local government. Records of a foreign, state or local government will not be disclosed without the approval of the government concerned.

    Subpart F—Exemptions From Public Access to Corporation Records

      § 902.50   Applicability.

#### § § 902.50

      (a) This subpart implements section 552(b) of title 5 U.S.C., which exempts certain records from public inspection under section 552(a). This subpart applies to records requested under subparts D and E of this part. The Corporation may, however, release a record authorized to be withheld under §§ 902.52 through 902.59 unless it determines that the release of that record would be inconsistent with a purpose of the aforementioned sections. Examples given in §§ 902.52 through 902.59 of records included within a particular statutory exemption are not necessarily illustrative of all types of records covered by the exemption. Any reasonably segregable portion of a record withheld under this subpart shall be provided to a requester, after deletion of the portions which are exempt under this subpart.

      (b) This subpart does not authorize withholding of information or limit the availability of records to the public, except as specifically stated. This subpart is not authority to withhold information from Congress.

      § 902.51   Records relating to matters that are required by Executive order to be kept secret.

#### § § 902.51

      Records relating to matters that are specifically authorized under criteria established by an Executive order to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or foreign policy, include those within the scope of the following, and any further amendment of any of them, but only to the extent that the records are in fact properly classified pursuant to such Executive order:

      (a) Executive Order 11652 of March 8, 1972 (3 CFR 1974 Comp. p. 339);

      (b) Executive Order 10865 of February 20, 1960 (3 CFR 1959-1963 Comp. p. 398); and

      (c) Executive Order 10104 of February 1, 1950 (3 CFR 1949-1953 Comp., p. 298).

      § 902.52   Records related solely to internal personnel rules and practices.

#### § § 902.52

      (a) Records related solely to internal personnel rules and practices that are within the statutory exemption include memoranda pertaining to personnel matters such as staffing policies, and policies and procedures for the hiring, training, promotion, demotion, and discharge of employees, and management plans, records, or proposals related to labor-management relationships.

      (b) The purpose of this section is to authorize the protection of any record related to internal personnel rules and practices dealing with the relations between the Corporation and its employees.

      § 902.53   Records exempted from disclosure by statute.

#### § § 902.53

      (a) Records relating to matters that are specifically exempted by statute from disclosure may not be made available for public inspection. For example: section 1905 of title 18 U.S.C., protecting trade secrets, processes, and certain economic and other data obtained by examination or investigation, or from reports.

      (b) The purpose of this section is to preserve the effectiveness of statutes of the kind cited as an example, in accordance with their terms.

      § 902.54   Trade secrets and commercial or financial information that is privileged or confidential.

#### § § 902.54

      (a) Trade secrets and commercial or financial information that are privileged and for which confidentiality is requested by the person possessing such privilege are within the statutory exemption. This includes the following:

      (1) Commercial or financial information not customarily released to the public, furnished and accepted in confidence or disclosure of which could reasonably be expected to cause substantial competitive harm, or both;

      (2) Statements of financial interest furnished by officers and employees of the Corporation;

      (3) Commercial, technical, and financial information furnished by any person in connection with an application for a loan or a loan guarantee;

      (4) Commercial or financial information customarily subjected to an attorney-client or similar evidentiary privilege; or,

      (5) Materials in which the Corporation has a property right such as designs, drawings, and other data and reports acquired in connection with any research project, inside or outside of the Corporation, or any grant or contract.

      (b) The purpose of this section is to authorize the protection of trade secrets and commercial or financial records that are customarily privileged or are appropriately given to the Corporation in confidence. It assures the confidentiality of trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained by the Corporation through questionnaires and required reports to the extent that the information would not customarily be made public by the person from whom it was obtained. In any case in which the Corporation has obligated itself not to disclose trade secrets and commercial or financial information it receives, this section indicates the Corporation's intention to honor that obligation to the extent permitted by law. In addition, this section recognizes that certain materials, such as research data and materials, formulae, designs, and architectural drawings, have significance not as records but as items of property acquired, in many cases at public expense. In any case in which similar proprietary material in private hands would be held in confidence, material covered in this section may be held in confidence.

      (c)(1)  For commercial or financial information furnished to the Corporation on or after March 30, 1988, the Corporation shall require the submitter to designate, at the time the information is furnished or within a reasonable time thereafter, any information the submitter considers confidential or privileged. Commercial or financial information provided to the Corporation shall not be disclosed pursuant to a Freedom of Information Act request except in accordance with this paragraph.

      (2)  The Corporation shall provide a submitter with prompt written notice of a request encompassing its commercial or financial information whenever required under paragraph (c)(3) of this section, and except as is provided in paragraph (c)(7) of this section. Such written notice shall either describe the exact nature of the information requested or provide copies of the records or portions thereof containing the information. Concurrently with its notice to a submitter, the Corporation shall inform a requestor in writing that the submitter is afforded a reasonable period within which to object to disclosure and that the 10 workday initial determination period provided for in 36 CFR 902.60 may therefore be extended.

      (3)  (i) For information submitted to the Corporation prior to March 30, 1988, the Corporation shall provide a submitter with notice of a request whenever:

      (A) The information is less than ten years old;

      (B) The information is subject to prior express commitment of confidentiality given by the Corporation to the submitter; or

      (C) The Corporation has reason to believe that disclosure of the information may result in substantial competitive harm to the submitter.

      (ii) For information submitted to the Corporation on or after March 30, 1988, the Corporation shall provide a submitter with notice of a request whenever:

      (A) The submitter has in good faith designated the information as confidential, or

      (B) The Corporation has reason to believe that disclosure of the information may result in substantial competitive harm to the submitter.

      (4)  Through the notice described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the Corporation shall afford a submitter a reasonable period within which to provide the Corporation with a detailed statement of any objection to disclosure. Such statement shall specify all grounds for withholding any of the information under any exemption of the Freedom of Information Act and, in the case of Exemption 4, shall demonstrate why the information is contended to be privileged or confidential. Information provided by a submitter pursuant to this paragraph may itself be subject to disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act.

      (5)  The Corporation shall consider carefully a submitter's objections and specific grounds for nondisclosure prior to determining whether to disclose information. Whenever the Corporation decides to disclose information over the objection of a submitter, the Corporation shall forward to the submitter a written notice which shall include:

      (i) A statement of the reasons for which the submitter's disclosure objections were not sustained;

      (ii) A description of the information to be disclosed; and

      (iii) A specified disclosure date.

      (6)  Whenever a requester brings suit seeking to compel disclosure of information covered by paragraph (c) of this section, the Corporation shall promptly notify the submitter.

      (7)  The notice requirements of this section shall not apply if:

      (i) The Corporation determines that the information should not be disclosed;

      (ii) The information lawfully has been published or otherwise made available to the public;

      (iii) Disclosure of the information is required by law (other than 5 U.S.C. 552); or

      (iv) The designation made by the submitter in accordance with paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(3)(ii) of this section appears obviously frivolous; except that, in such case, the Corporation shall provide the submitter with written notice of any final decision to disclose information within a reasonable number of days prior to a specified disclosure date.

      § 902.55   Intragovernmental exchanges.

#### § § 902.55

      (a) Any record prepared by a Government officer or employee (including those prepared by a consultant or advisory body) for internal Government use is within the statutory exemption to the extent that it contains—

      (1) Opinions, advice, deliberations, or recommendations made in the course of developing official action by the Government, but not actually made a part of that official action, or

      (2) Information concerning any pending proceeding or similar matter including any claim or other dispute to be resolved before a court of law, administrative board, hearing officer, or contracting officer.

      (b) This section has two distinct purposes. One is to protect the full and frank exchange of ideas, views, and opinions necessary for the effective functioning of the Government and to afford this protection both before and after any action is taken. This judicially recognized privilege of protection against disclosure in litigation or elsewhere is intended to assure that these resources will be fully and readily available to those officials upon whom the responsibility rests to take official and final Corporation action. However, the action itself, any memoranda made part of that action, and the facts on which it is based are not within this protection. The other purpose is to protect against the premature disclosure of material that is in the development stage if premature disclosure would be detrimental to the authorized and appropriate purposes for which the material is being used, or if, because of its tentative nature, the material is likely to be revised or modified before it is officially presented to the public.

      (c) Examples of records covered by this section include minutes to the extent they contain matter described in paragraph (a) of this section; staff papers containing advice, opinions, suggestions, or exchanges of views, preliminary to final agency decision or action; budgetary planning and programming information; advance information on such things as proposed plans to procure, lease, or otherwise hire and dispose of materials, real estate, or facilities, documents exchanged preparatory to anticipated legal proceedings; material intended for public release at a specified future time, if premature disclosure would be detrimental to orderly processes of the Corporation; records of inspection, investigations, and surveys pertaining to internal management of the Department; and matters that would not be routinely disclosed under disclosure procedures in litigation and which are likely to be the subject of litigation. However, if such a record also contains factual information, that information must be made available under subpart E of this part unless the facts are so inextricably intertwined with deliverative or policymaking processes, that they cannot be separated without disclosing those processes.

      § 902.56   Protection of personal privacy.

#### § § 902.56

      (a) Any of the following personnel, medical, or similar records is within the statutory exemption if its disclosure would harm the individual concerned or be a clearly unwarranted invasion of his personal privacy:

      (1) Personnel and background records personal to any officer or employee of the Corporation, or other person, including his home address;

      (2) Medical histories and medical records concerning individuals, including applicants for licenses; or

      (3) Any other detailed record containing personal information identifiable with a particular person.

      (b) The purpose of this section is to provide a proper balance between the protection of personal privacy and the preservation of the public's rights to Corporation information by authorizing the protection of information that, if released, might unjustifiably invade an individual's personal privacy.

      § 902.57   Investigatory files compiled for law enforcement purposes.

#### § § 902.57

      (a) Files compiled by the Corporation for law enforcement purposes, including the enforcement of the regulations of the Corporation, are within the statutory exemption to the extent that production of such records would:

      (1) Interfere with enforcement proceedings;

      (2) Deprive a person of a right to a fair trial or an impartial adjudication;

      (3) Constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy;

      (4) Disclose the identity of a confidential source and in the case of a record compiled by a criminal law enforcement authority in the courts of a criminal investigation, or by an agency conducting a lawful national security intelligence investigation, confidential information furnished only by the confidential source;

      (5) Disclose investigative techniques and procedures; or,

      (6) Endanger the life or physical safety of law enforcement personnel.

      (b) The purpose of this section is to protect from disclosure the law enforcement files of the Corporation including files prepared in connection with related litigation and adjudicative proceedings. It includes the enforcement not only of criminal statutes but all kinds of laws.

      § 902.58   Reports of financial institutions.

#### § § 902.58

      Any material contained in or related to any examination, operating, or condition report prepared by, on behalf of, or for the use of, any agency responsible for the regulation or supervision of financial institutions is within the statutory exemption.

      § 902.59   Geological and geophysical information.

#### § § 902.59

      Any geological or geophysical information and data (including maps) concerning wells is within the statutory exemption.

    Subpart G—Time Limitations

      § 902.60   Initial determination.

#### § § 902.60

      (a) An initial determination whether or not to release a record requested under subparts D and E of this part shall be made by the Public Information Offices within 10 workdays after the receipt of a request which complies with § 902.21. Failure of the requester to comply with those provisions may toll the running of the 10 day period until the request is identified as one being made under the Act. This time limit may be extended by up to 10 workdays in accordance with § 902.62.

      (b) Upon making initial determination, the Administrative Officer shall immediately notify the person making the request as to its disposition. If the determination is made to release the requested record, the Administrative Officer shall make the record promptly available. If the determination is to deny the release of the requested record, the Public Information Officer shall immediately notify the requester of the denial and shall provide the following information.

      (1) The reason for the determination, including a reference to the appropriate exemption provided in subpart F of this part;

      (2) The right of the request or to appeal the determination as provided in subpart H of this part; and

      (3) The name and position of each person responsible for the denial of the request.

      § 902.61   Final determination.

#### § § 902.61

      A determination with respect to any appeal made pursuant to subpart H of this part will be made within twenty work days after the date of receipt of the appeal. The time limit provided may be extended by up to 10 workdays in accordance with § 902.62.

      § 902.62   Extension of time limits.

#### § § 902.62

      (a) In unusual circumstances, the time limits prescribed in §§ 902.60 and 902.61 may be extended by written notice to the person making the request. The notice shall set forth the reasons for the extension and the date on which a determination is expected to be dispatched. Under no circumstances shall the notice specify a date that would result in an extension for more than 10 workdays.

      (b) As used in this section,  means (but only to the extent reasonably necessary to the proper processing of the particular request):

      (1) The need to search for, collect and appropriately examine a voluminous amount of separate and distinct records which are demanded in a single request;

      (2) The need to search for and collect the requested records from field facilities or other establishments that are separate from the office processing the request; or

      (3) The need for consultation, which shall be conducted with all practicable speed, with another agency having a substantial interest in the determination of the request or among two or more components of the agency having substantial subject matter interest therein.

      (c) Any person having made a request for records under this part shall have exhausted his administrative remedies with respect to such request, if the Corporation fails to comply with the applicable time limitations set forth in this subject.

    Subpart H—Procedures for Administrative Appeal of Decisions Not To Disclose Records

      § 902.70   General.

#### § § 902.70

      Within the time limitations of subpart G of this part, if the Administrative Officer makes a determination not to disclose a record requested under subparts D and E of this part, he shall furnish a written statement of the reasons for that determination to the person making the request. The statement shall indicate the name(s) and title(s) of each person responsible for the denial of the request, and the availability of an appeal with the Corporation. Any person whose request for a record has been denied may submit a written appeal to the Corporation requesting reconsideration of the decision.

      § 902.71   Forms for appeal.

#### § § 902.71

      Although no particular written form is prescribed for on appeal, the letter or similar written statement appealing a denial of a record shall contain a description of the record requested, the name and position of the official who denied the request, the reason(s) given for the denial, and other pertinent facts and statements deemed appropriate by the appellant. The Corporation may request additional details if the information submitted is insufficient to support an appeal.

      § 902.72   Time limitations on filing an appeal.

#### § § 902.72

      An appeal must be submitted in writing within thirty days from the date of receipt of the initial written denial and must contain the information requested in § 902.71.

He shall review each appeal and provide the appellant and other interested parties with a written notice of his decision. The decision of the Chairman as to the availability of the record is administratively final.

      (b) If the decision of the Chairman sustains the refusal to disclose, the notice of decision shall set forth the reasons for the refusal, including the specific exemptions from disclosure under the Act that are the bases of the decision not to disclose. The notice shall further advise the appellant that judicial review is available on complaint to the appropriate District Court of the United States, as provided in section 552(a)(4)(B) of title 5 U.S.C.

      (c) As set out in § 902.61, the final decision on appeal shall be made within 20 workdays after the receipt of the appeal. An extension of this limitation is authorized as prescribed under § 902.62.

> [52 FR 26677, July 16, 1987]

      § 902.82   Fee schedule.

#### § § 902.82

      (a)  For purposes of this section—

      (1) A  is a request from or on behalf of one who seeks information for a use or purpose that furthers the commercial, trade, or profit interests of the requester or the person on whose behalf the request is made. In determining whether a requester properly belongs in this category, the Corporation will determine the use to which the requester will put the records sought. Where the Corporation has reasonable cause to doubt the use to which a requester will put the records sought, or where that use is not clear from the request itself, the Corporation will seek additional clarification before assigning the request to a specific category.

      (2)  means those expenditures the Corporation actually incurs in searching for and duplicating (and in the case of commercial requesters, reviewing) records to respond to an FOIA request. _Direct costs_ include, for example, the salary of the employee performing work (the basic rate of pay for the employee plus 16 percent of that rate to cover benefits) and the cost of operating duplicating machinery. Not included in direct costs are overhead expenses such as costs of space, and heating or lighting the facility in which the records are stored.

      (3)  means the process of making a copy of a record necessary to respond to an FOIA request. Such copies can take the form of paper copy, microform, audio-visual materials, or machine-readable documentation (e.g., magnetic tape or disk), among others. The copy provided must be in a form that is reasonably usable by requesters.

      (4)  means a preschool, a public or private elementary or secondary school, an institution of graduate higher education, an institution of undergraduate higher education, an institution of professional education, and an institution of vocational education, which operates a program or programs of scholarly research.

      (5)  means an institution that is not operated on a  basis, within the meaning of paragraph (a)(1) of this section and that is operated solely for the purpose of conducting scientific research, the results of which are not intended to promote any particular product or industry.

      (6)  means any person actively gathering __news__ for an entity that is organized and operated to publish or broadcast news to the public. The term  means information that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the public. Examples of new media entities include television or radio stations broadcasting to the public at large, and publishers of periodicals (but only in those instances when they can qualify as disseminators of ) who make their products available for purchase or subscription by the general public. These examples are not intended to be all-inclusive. Moreover, as traditional methods of news delivery evolve (e.g., electronic dissemination of newspapers through telecommunications services), such alternative media would be included in this category.  journalists may be regarded as working for a news organization if they can demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication through that organization, even though not actually employed by it. A publication contract would be the clearest proof, but the Corporation may also look to the past publication record of a requester in making this determination.

      (7)  means the process of examining records located in response to a request that is for a commercial use (see paragraph (a)(1) of this section) to determine whether any portion of any record located is permitted to be withheld. It also includes processing any records for disclosure, e.g., doing all that is necessary to excise them and otherwise prepare them for release. _Review_ does not include time spent resolving general legal or policy issues regarding the application of exemptions.

      (8)  includes all time spent looking for material that is responsive to a request, including page-by-page or line-by-line identification of material within records. A line-by-line search will not be conducted when merely duplicating an entire record would be the less expensive and quicker method of complying with the request.  does not include  of material to determine whether the material is exempt from disclosure (see paragraph (a)(7) of this section). __Search__es may be done manually or by computer using existing programming.

      (b) The following provisions shall apply with respect to services rendered to the public in processing requests for disclosure of the Corporation's records under this part:

      (1)  $0.25 per page. When the Corporation estimates that duplication charges are likely to exceed $25.00, it will notify the requester of the estimated amount of fees, unless the requester has indicated in advance his willingness to pay fees as high as those anticipated. The Corporation will offer the requester the opportunity to confer with the Corporation's staff in order to reformulate the request to meet the requester's needs at a lower cost.

      (2)  (i) Searches for records by clerical personnel: $7.00 per hour, including the time spent searching for and copying any records.

      (ii) Search for and review of records by professional and supervisory personnel: $11.50 per hour spent searching for any record or reviewing any record to determine whether it may be disclosed, including time spent in copying any record.

      (iii) Except for requests seeking records for a commercial use, the Corporation will provide the first 100 _pages_ of duplication and the first two hours of search time without charge. The word  means paper copies of a standard size, either 8 ″ by 11″ or 14″ by 14″.

      (3)  (per copy) $10.00.

      (4)  (per copy) $1.00.

      (5)  (per copy) $10.00.

      (6)  (per copy) $17.00.

      (7)  $1.75 for each certification or validation of a copy of any record.

      (8) —(i)  When the Corporation receives a request for records for commercial use, it will assess charges to recover the full direct costs of searching for, reviewing for release, and duplicating the records sought. Requesters must reasonably describe the records sought.

      (ii)  The Corporation shall provide copies of records to requesters in this category for the cost of reproduction alone, excluding charges for the first 100 pages. To be eligible for inclusion in this category, requesters must show that the request is being made as authorized by and under the auspices of a qualifying institution and that the records are not sought for a commercial use but are sought in furtherance of scholarly (if the request is from an educational institution) or scientific (if the request is from a non-commercial scientific institution) research. Requesters must reasonably describe the records sought.

      (iii)  The Corporation shall provide documents to requesters in this category for the cost of reproduction alone, excluding charges for the first 100 pages. To be eligible for inclusion in this category, a requester must meet the criteria in the definition of  in paragraph (a)(6) of this section, and his or her request must not be made for a commercial use. In reference to this class of requester, a request for records supporting the news dissemination function of the requester shall not be considered to be a request that is for a commercial use. Requestors must reasonably describe the records sought.

      (iv)  The Corporation will charge requesters who do not fit into any of the categories above fees which recover the full reasonable direct cost of searching for and reproducing records that are responsive to the request, except that the first 100 pages of reproduction and the first two hours of search time shall be furnished without charge. Requests from record subjects for records about themselves filed in the Corporation's systems of records will be treated under the fee provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974 which permit fees only for reproduction. Requesters must reasonably describe the records sought.

      (9)  In the event a requester fails to remit payment of fees charged for processing a request under this part within 30 days from the date such fees were billed, interest on such fees may be assessed beginning on the 31st day after the billing date at the rate prescribed in section 3717 of title 31 U.S.C., and will accrue from the date of the billing.

      (10)  Except as provided in paragraph (b)(8)(iv) of this section, the cost of searching for a requested record shall be charged even if the search fails to locate such record or it is determined that the record is exempt from disclosure.

      (11)  A requester must not file multiple requests at the same time, each seeking portions of a record or records, solely in order to avoid payment of fees. When the Corporation reasonably believes that a requester, or a group of requesters acting in concert, is attempting to break a request down into a series of requests for the purpose of evading the assessment of fees, the Corporation may aggregate any such requests and charge accordingly.

      (12)  The Corporation will not require a requester to make an advance payment, i.e., payment before work is commenced or continued on a request unless:

      (i) The Corporation estimates or determines that allowable charges that a requester may be required to pay are likely to exceed $250; or

      (ii) If a requester has previously failed to make timely payments (i.e., within 30 days of billing date) of fees charged under this part, the requester may be required to pay the full amount owed plus any applicable interest accrued thereon or demonstrate that he has, in fact, paid the fee, and to make an advance payment of the full amount of the estimated fee before the Corporation begins to process a new request or a pending request from this requester.

#### § § 903.5

    (b) Notices granting access shall inform the individual when and where the requested record may be seen, how copies may be obtained, and of any anticipated fees or charges which may be incurred under § 903.11. Access shall be provided within 30 days of receipt of the request unless the Corporation, for good cause shown, is unable to provide prompt access, in which case the individual shall be informed in writing within the 30 days as to the cause for delay and when it is anticipated that access will be granted.

    (c) Notices denying access shall state the reasons for the denial, and advise the individual that the decision may be appealed in accordance with the procedures set forth in § 903.6.

    (1) Determine that the appeal should be granted, and notify the individual in writing to that effect; or,

    (2) Determine that the appeal should be denied because the information requested is exempt from disclosure. If the reviewing official denies the appeal, he or she shall advise the individual in writing of the decision and the reasons for reaching it, and that the denial of the appeal is a final agency action entitling the individual to seek judicial review in the appropriate district court of the United States as provided in 5 U.S.C. 552a(g).

    (1) Amend any portion thereof which the individual believes is not accurate, relevant, timely, or complete; or

    (2) Inform the individual of refusal to amend the record in accordance with the request. In reviewing a record pursuant to a request to amend it, the Corporation will assess the accuracy, relevance, timeliness and completeness of the record in terms of the criteria established in 5 U.S.C. 522a(e)(5). In reviewing a record in response to a request to amend it by deleting information, the Corporation will ascertain whether or not the information is relevant and necessary to accomplish a purpose of the Corporation required to be accomplished by statute or by executive order of the President, as prescribed by 5 U.S.C. 522a(e)(1).

    (b) The Corporation shall take the action specified in paragraph (a) of this section within 30 days of receipt of a request for amendment of a record, unless unusual circumstances preclude completion of the action within that time. If the expected completion date for the action, as indicated in the acknowledgement provided pursuant to § 903.5 cannot be met, the individual shall be advised of the delay and of a revised date when action is expected to be completed. If necessary for an accurate review of the record, the Corporation will seek, and the individual will supply, additional information in support of his or her request for amending the record.

    (c) If the Corporation agrees with all or any portion of an individual's request to amend a record, the Corporation will so advise the individual in writing, and amend the record to the extent agreed to by the Corporation. Where an accounting of disclosures has been kept, the Corporation will advise all previous recipients of the record of the fact that the amendment was made and the substance of the amendment.

    (d) If the Corporation disagrees with all or any portion of an individual's request to amend a record, the Corporation shall:

    (1) Advise the individual of its adverse determination and the reasons therefor, including the criteria used by the Corporation in conducting the review;

    (2) Inform the individual that he or she may request a review of the adverse determination by the Executive Director of the Corporation, or by an officer of the Corporation designated by the Executive Director; and,

    (e) If the Corporation is apprised by another agency of any corrections or other amendments made to a record contained in the Corporation's system of records, the Corporation will promptly amend its record and advise in writing all previous recipients of the record of the fact that the amendment was made and the substance of the amendment.

The appeal shall be in writing, mailed or delivered to the Executive Director, Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corporation, 1331 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, Suite 1220 North, Washington, DC 20004. The appeal shall identify the record in the same manner as it was identified in the original request, shall indicate the dates of the original request and of the adverse determination and shall indicate the expressed basis for that determination. In addition, the appeal shall state briefly the reasons why the adverse determination should be reversed.

    (b) Not later than 30 days after receipt of an appeal, the Executive Director, or an officer of the Corporation designated by him, will complete a review of the appeal and the initial determination, and either: (1) Determine that the appeal should be granted, take the appropriate action with respect to the record in question, and notify the individual accordingly; or, (2) determine that the appeal should be denied.

    (c) The reviewing official may, at his or her option, request from the individual such additional information as is deemed necessary to properly conduct the review. If additional time is required, the Executive Director may, for good cause shown, extend the period for action beyond the 30 days specified above. The individual will then be informed in writing of the delay and the reasons therefor, and of the approximate date on which action is expected to be completed.

    (d) If the reviewing official denies the appeal, he or she shall advise the individual in writing:

    (1) Of the decision and the reasons for reaching it;

    (2) That the denial of the appeal is a final agency action entitling the individual to seek judicial review in the appropriate district court of the United States, as provided in 5 U.S.C. 552a(g); and,

    (3) That the individual may file with the Corporation a concise statement setting forth the reasons for his or her disagreement with the refusal of the Corporation to amend the record in question.

    (e) Any individual having received notices of a denial of an appeal to amend a record may file a statement of disagreement with the Executive Director not later than 60 working days from the date of receipt of the notice. Such statements shall ordinarily not exceed one page in length, and the Corporation reserves the right to reject statements of excessive length. Upon receipt of a proper and timely statement of disagrement, the Corporation will clearly annotate the record in question to indicate the portion of the record which is in dispute. In any subsequent disclosure containing information about which the individual has filed a statement of disagreement, the Corporation will provide a copy of the statement together with the record to which it pertains. In addition, prior recipients of the disputed record will be provided with a copy of statements of disagreement to the extent that an accounting of disclosures was maintained. If the Corporation deems it apropriate, it may also include in any disclosure its own concise statement of the reasons for not making the amendments requested.

      § 906.4   Formulation of affirmative action plan.

#### § § 906.4

      (a) The developer, in formulating the Affirmative Action Plan, should consider all phases of development from establishment of the development team to operation and management of the development project including each component of the project (e.g., hotel, retail, office, residential). The developer should also consider the personnel profile of project contractors, subcontractors.

      (b) For each phase and each component, the developer should give consideration to creating business and employment opportunities and committed opportunities in the following:

      (1) Equity participation;

      (2) Professional and technical services such as legal, architectural, engineering, and financial;

      (3) Purchasing materials and supplies in connection with construction and operation;

#### § § 906.7

      (a) At the request of the developer, the Corporation may agree to deferral of a portion of rental, not to exceed 50 percent, during construction and during the first year of operation following construction of any phase of the development project. Allowable rent deferral during the construction phase will be two percent of the total base rent for each one percent of the value of all construction contracts which have been awarded to Minority Owned Businesses, not to exceed 50 percent. Rent deferral during the first year of operation following construction of any phase of the development project will be four percent for each one percent of total equity owned by minority group members, minority owned businesses, and women.

      (b) Following review of Affirmative Action reports submitted to the Corporation pursuant to § 906.5(b), the Corporation will determine the developer's compliance with the goals set forth in the approved Affirmative Action Plan. Compliance with the goals established in the Plan will be measured by adding the percentages reported including overages in each category and dividing that by the number of categories covered in the Plan.

      (c) If 75 percent compliance is not achieved during any rent deferral period, the Corporation will afford the developer 120 days to achieve at least that level of compliance. If, at the end of that 120 day period, 75 percent compliance is not achieved, all rental deferral, together with interest, will be due and payable to the Corporation on the 10th day following receipt of written notice that payment of the deferred rent has been accelerated.

    § 907.6   Major decision points.

#### § § 907.6

    (a) The possible environmental effects of a proposed action or project must be considered along with technical, economic, and other factors throughout the decisionmaking process. For most Corporation projects there are three distinct stages in the decision making process:

    (1) Conceptual or preliminary stage;

    (2) Detailed planning or final approval stage;

    (3) Implementation stage.

    (b) Environmental review will be integrated into the decision making process of the Corporation as follows:

    (1) During the conceptual or preliminary approval study stage, the responsible Corporation official shall determine whether the proposed action or project is one which is categorically excluded, requires an environmental assessment or an EIS.

    (2) Prior to proceeding from the conceptual or preliminary approval stage to the detailed planning or final approval stage, an environmental assessment and the determination as to whether an EIS is required must be completed.

    (3) An EIS, if determined necessary, must be completed and circulated prior to the decision to proceed from the detailed planning stage to implementation.

    § 907.7   Determination of requirement for EIS.

#### § § 907.7

    Determining whether to prepare an environmental impact statement is the first step in applying the NEPA process. In deciding whether to prepare an environmental impact statement, the responsible Corporation official will determine whether the proposal is one that:

    (a) Normally requires an environmental impact statement.

    (b) Normally does not require either an environmental impact statement or an environmental assessment (categorical exclusion).

    (c) Normally requires an environmental assessment, but not necessarily an environmental impact statement.

    § 907.8   Actions that normally require an EIS.

#### § § 907.8

    PADC shall perform or have performed an environmental assessment to determine if a proposal requires an environmental impact statement. However, it may be readily apparent that a proposed action will have a significant impact on the environment; in such cases, an environmental assessment is not required and PADC will immediately begin to prepare or have prepared the environmental impact statement. To assist in determining if a proposal or action normally requires the preparation of an environmental impact statement, the following criteria and categories of action are provided.

    (a)  Criteria used to determine whether or not actions or proposals may significantly affect the environment and therefore require an environmental impact statement are described in 40 CFR 1508.27 of the CEQ Regulations and as follows:

    (1) Buildings or facades designated for retention in the Plan will be adversely affected by the proposal or action.

    (2) Traffic generated by the proposal or action would represent a substantial increase over the traffic projections assessed in the Final EIS in the average daily traffic volume on avenues and streets within the Development Area or its environs;

    (3) Air quality in the Development Area and its environs would be substantially affected by the proposal or action based upon the District of Columbia's adopted standard for hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide;

    (4) Solid waste disposal generated by a project of the Corporation or of a developer who is constructing, reconstructing, or rehabilitating that project, would have an adverse effect on the capacity of the relevant solid waste disposal facility and compliance with “Solid Waste Management Guidelines” of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and related local and regional controls;

    (5) Public utilities have insufficient capacity to provide reliable service to a project within the Development Area; and

    (6) A project will be inconsistent with major elements of the Zoning Regulations of the District of Columbia as they are applicable to the Development Area.

    (b)  The following categories of action normally require an environmental impact statement:

    (1) Amendments or supplements to the Plan that constitute a “substantial change” to the Plan as defined in 40 U.S.C. 874(c) of the Act.

    (2) Acquisition or disposal of real property by the Corporation  related to any specific decision, plan, or program adopted by the Board of Directors of the Corporation for which an environmental assessment or an assessment and an EIS has been prepared.

    (3) Legislative proposals made to Congress.

    (4) Funding and/or construction by the Corporation or its agents or representatives of any building, if that activity is not consistent with the Plan and the Final EIS.

    § 907.9   Preparation of an EIS.

#### § § 907.9

    (a)  When PADC decides to prepare an environmental impact statement, it shall publish a notice of intent in the  in accordance with 40 CFR 1501.7 and 1508.22 of the CEQ Regulations.

    (b)  After determining that an environmental impact statement will be prepared and publishing the notice of intent, PADC will begin to prepare or have prepared the environmental impact statement. Procedures for preparing the environmental impact statement are set forth in 40 CFR part 1502, CEQ Regulations.

    (c)  PADC may supplement a draft or final environmental impact statement at any time. PADC shall prepare a supplement to either the draft or final environmental impact statement when (1) substantial changes are proposed to an action contained in the draft or final EIS that are relevant to environmental concerns or there are significant new circumstances or information relevant to environmental concerns and bearing on the proposed action or its impacts; or (2) actions are proposed which relate or are similar to other action(s) taken or proposed and that together will have a cumulatively significantly impact on the environment.

    § 907.10   Categorical exclusion.

#### § § 907.10

    The CEQ Regulations provide for the categorical exclusion (40 CFR 1508.4) of actions that do not individually or cumulatively have a significant effect on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental impact statement is required for such actions.

    (a)  Criteria used to determine those categories of action that normally do not require either an environmental impact statement or an environmental assessment include:

    (1) The action or proposal is consistent with the Plan or the Act, and the environmental effects have been previously analyzed in the Final EIS, a supplement thereto, or in an environmental assessment or an EIS previously prepared; or

    (2) The total estimated cost directly attributable to the action or proposal does not exceed $500,000; or

    (3) The action or proposal is related solely to internal administrative operations of the Corporation.

    (b)  Categories of action, identified in appendix A (attached) have been determined by PADC to have no significant effect on the human environment and are therefore categorically excluded from the preparation of environmental impact statements and environmental assessments.

    (c)  (1) The PADC List of Categorical Exclusion will be continually reviewed and refined as additional categories are identified and as experience is gained in the categorical exclusion process.

    (2) Additional categories of exclusion identified will be submitted to the Chairman of the Board of Directors for review and approval, and for amendments to this part, following public comment and review by the Council on Environmental Quality.

    § 907.11   Actions that normally require an environmental assessment.

#### § § 907.11

    If a proposal or action is not one that normally requires an environmental impact statement, and does not qualify for categorical exclusion, PADC will prepare or have prepared an environmental assessment.

    (a)  Criteria used to determine those categories of action that normally require an environmental assessment, but not necessarily an environmental impact statement, include:

    (1) Potential for minor degradation of environmental quality;

    (2) Potential for cumulative impact on environmental quality; and

    (3) Potential for impact on protected resources.

    (b)  The following categories of action normally require the preparation of an environmental assessment.

    (1) Amendments to the Plan that do not constitute a “substantial change” to the Plan.

    (2) Regulations promulgated by the Corporation that have significant environmental impact on the public or persons residing in the development area including businesses.

    (3) Development proposals submitted to the Corporation by private developers that are consistent with the Plan and General Guidelines prepared by the Corporation.

    (4) Activities related to the Public Improvements Program of the Corporation for which no previous environmental assessment or EIS has been prepared.

    (5) Contracts, work authorizations, and master agreements related to and implementing programs, policies, and proposals not categorically excluded and for which no environmental assessments or for which no environmental assessment and EIS have been previously prepared.

    (6) Street closures and other rearrangements of public space which were not covered in the Plan or the Final EIS.

    (7) Acquisition/disposal of personal property by the Corporation not related to any specific decision, plan, or program adopted by the Board of Directors of the Corporation for which an environmental assessment or an environmental assessment and an EIS is required to be prepared.

    (8) Proposed construction of any public building within the development area by any executive agency of the United States Government, any agency or department of the District of Columbia Government, or any other public or quasi-public entity.

    § 907.12   Preparation of an environmental assessment.

#### § § 907.12

    (a)  PADC will begin the preparation of an environmental assessment as early as possible after it is determined by the responsible corporation official to be required. PADC may prepare an environmental assessment at any time to assist planning and decision-making.

    (b)  An environmental assessment is a concise public document used to determine whether to prepare an environmental impact statement. An environmental assessment aids in complying with the Act when no environmental impact statement is necessary, and it facilitates the preparation of an environmental impact statement, if one is necessary. The environmental assessment shall contain brief discussions of the following topics:

    (1) Purpose and need for the proposed action.

    (2) Description of the proposed action.

    (3) Alternatives considered, including the No Action alternative.

    (4) Environmental effects of the proposed action and alternative actions.

    (5) Listing of agencies, organizations or persons consulted.

    (6) In preparation of the environmental assessment, the most important or significant environmental consequences and effects on the areas listed below should be addressed. Only those areas which are specifically relevant to the particular proposal should be addressed. Those areas should be addressed in as much detail as is necessary to allow an analysis of the alternatives and the proposal. The areas to be considered are the following:

    (i) Natural/ecological features (such as floodplain, wetlands, coastal zones, wildlife refuges, and endangered species);

    (ii) Air quality;

    (iii) Sound levels;

    (iv) Water supply, wastewater treatment and water runoff;

    (v) Energy requirements and conservation;

    (vi) Solid waste;

    (vii) Transportation;

    (viii) Community facilities and services;

    (ix) Social and economic;

    (x) Historic and aesthetic; and

    (xi) Other relevant factors.

    (c)  If PADC completes an environmental assessment and determines that an environmental impact statement is not required, then PADC shall prepare a finding of no significant impact. The finding of no significant impact shall be made available to the public by PADC as specified in 40 CFR 1506.6 of the CEQ Regulations.

    § 907.13   Public involvement.

    § 907.14   Corporation decision making procedures.

#### § § 907.14

    To ensure that at major decision making points all relevant environmental concerns are considered by the Decision Maker, the following procedures are established.

    (a) An environmental document, i.e., the EIS, Environmental Assessment, Finding of No Signficant Impact, or Notice of Intent, in addition to being prepared at the earliest point in the decision making process, shall accompany the relevant proposal or action through the Corporation's decision making process to ensure adequate consideration of environmental factors.

    (b) The decision maker shall consider in its decision making process only those decision alternatives discussed in the relevant environmental documents. Also, where an EIS has been prepared, the decision maker shall consider all alternatives described in the EIS. A written record of the consideration of alternatives during the decision making process shall be maintained.

    (c) Any environmental document prepared for a proposal or action shall be made part of the record of any formal rulemaking by the Corporation.

    § 907.15   Approval of private development proposals.

#### § § 907.15

    (a) Each development proposal submitted by a private developer to the Corporation for its approval, unless categorically excluded, shall require, at a minimum, an environmental assessment.

    (b) The Board of Directors may not take any approval action on a submitted development proposal of a private developer until such time as the appropriate environmental review has been prepared and submitted to the Board of Directors.

    (c) At a minimum, and as part of any submission made by a private developer to the Board of Directors for its approval, a private developer shall make available data and materials concerning the development proposal sufficient to permit the Corporation to carry out its responsibilities on environmental review. When requested, the developer shall provide additional information that the Corporation believes is necessary to permit it to satisfy its environmental review functions.

    (d) As part of a development proposal submission, a private developer may submit an environmental assessment on its development proposal.

    (e) Where the responsible Corporation official determines that the preparation of an EIS is required, the EIS shall be prepared in accordance with part 1502 of the CEQ Regulations. The responsible Corporation official may set time limits for environmental review appropriate to each development proposal, consistent with CEQ Regulations 40 CFR 1601.8 and 1506.10.

    (f) The responsible Corporation official shall at the earliest possible time ensure that the Corporation commences its environmental review on a proposed development project and shall provide to a private developer any policies or information deemed appropriate in order to permit effective and timely review by the Corporation of a development proposal once it is submitted to the Board of Directors for approval. The official shall designate, for the benefit of the developer, staff members of the Corporation to advise the developer with regard to information that may be required in order to accomplish the Corporation's environmental review.

    § 907.16   Actions where lead Agency designation is necessary.

#### § § 907.16

    (a) Consistent with CEQ Regulations, § 1501.5, where a proposed action by the Corporation involves one or more other Federal agencies, or where a group of actions by the Corporation and one or more other Federal agencies are directly related to each other because of their functional interdependence or geographical proximity, the Corporation will seek designation as lead agency for those actions that directly relate to implementation of the Plan and those actions that relate solely to the Development Area.

    (b) For an action that qualifies as one for which the Corporation will seek designation as lead agency, the Corporation will promptly consult with the appropriate Federal agencies such as the National Capital Planning Commission, the Department of the Interior, and the General Services Administration to establish lead agency and cooperating agency designations.

It is the policy of _the Corporation_ to provide displaced businesses and residents with a preferential opportunity to relocate within the development area so that they may share in the benefits brought to the area by the implementation of The Plan. This rule shall not be construed to affect the eligibility, rights or responsibilities of persons who may be entitled to benefits provided under the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970 as implemented by the Corporation (36 CFR part 904).

      (a) Provide a meaningful opportunity to businesses displaced by the Corporation's program to return to, or remain in, the Development Area;

      (b) Establish procedures and requirements for displaced occupants by which they may establish and later exercise their preferential right to return to the Development Area;

      (c) Establish procedures which the Corporation and private Developers must follow in providing Qualified Persons with the opportunity to obtain their preferential right to return to the Development Area.

#### § §§ 909.141-909.148

    § 909.149   Program accessibility: Discrimination prohibited.

#### § § 909.149

    Except as otherwise provided in § 909.150, no qualified handicapped person shall, because the agency's facilities are inaccessible to or unusable by handicapped persons, be denied the benefits of, be excluded from participation in, or otherwise be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity conducted by the agency.

    § 909.150   Program accessibility: Existing facilities.

#### § § 909.150

    (a)  The agency shall operate each program or activity so that the program or activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. This paragraph does not—

    (1) Necessarily require the agency to make each of its existing facilities accessible to and usable by handicapped persons;

    (2) In the case of historic preservation programs, require the agency to take any action that would result in a substantial impairment of significant historic features of an historic property; or

    (3) Require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with § 909.150(a) would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that handicapped persons receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.

    (b) —(1)  The agency may comply with the requirements of this section through such means as redesign of equipment, reassignment of services to accessible buildings, assignment of aides to beneficiaries, home visits, delivery of services at alternate accessible sites, alteration of existing facilities and construction of new facilities, use of accessible rolling stock, or any other methods that result in making its programs or activities readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. The agency is not required to make structural changes in existing facilities where other methods are effective in achieving compliance with this section. The agency, in making alterations to existing buildings, shall meet accessibility requirements to the extent compelled by the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), and any regulations implementing it. In choosing among available methods for meeting the requirements of this section, the agency shall give priority to those methods that offer programs and activities to qualified handicapped persons in the most integrated setting appropriate.

    (2)  In meeting the requirements of § 909.150(a) in historic preservation programs, the agency shall give priority to methods that provide physical access to handicapped persons. In cases where a physical alteration to an historic property is not required because of § 909.150(a)(2) or (a)(3), alternative methods of achieving program accessibility include—

    (i) Using audio-visual materials and devices to depict those portions of an historic property that cannot otherwise be made accessible;

      § 910.1   Policy.

#### § § 910.1

      (a) The Pennsylvania Avenue Development _Corporation_ _Act_ of 1972, Pub. L. 92-578, October 27, 1972, (the ), (40 U.S.C. 871 ) established the Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corporation (the ) with jurisdiction over the Pennsylvania Avenue _Development Area_ (). The Development Area is generally described as an area in Washington DC, bounded by Pennsylvania Avenue, NW., on the south, East Executive Drive on the west, 3rd Street, NW., on the east, and E and F Streets, NW., on the north.

      (b) Prior to creation of the Corporation, the deterioration of the Development Area had an adverse impact upon the physical, economic, and social life of Washington, DC. The Corporation was created as the vehicle to develop, maintain, and use the Development Area in a manner suitable to its ceremonial, physical, and historic relationship to the legislative and executive branches of the Federal government, to the governmental buildings, monuments, memorials, and parks in and adjacent to that area, and to the downtown commercial core of Washington, DC. The Corporation was directed to prepare a development plan for the Development Area and to submit that plan to the United States Congress. Congress accepted that plan and directed its implementation by the Corporation. The Corporation through a broad range of statutory powers has begun this implementation process.

      (c) The Pennsylvania Avenue Plan—1974, as amended () is a blueprint for social, economic, and architectural rejuvenation of the Development Area. Its goal is to make the Development Area once again a relevant and contributing element of Washington, DC. With the implementation of  the Development Area will become a showpiece of the Nation's Capital, proudly displaying the successful joint efforts of the Corporation, other Federal and District of Columbia government agencies, and private entrepreneurs.

      § 910.2   Purpose.

#### § § 910.2

      (a) Implementation of  occurs through two component actions: public improvements construction and square __development__. Public improvements construction consists of implementation by the Corporation of the Public Improvements Program which is a comprehensive plan for the design and construction of public amenities in public spaces and selected thoroughfares within the Development Area. This program outlines the details of roadway and sidewalk improvements, public space configuration, and pedestrian amenities. Square development consists of design and construction of  projects primarily on city blocks, known as squares, within the Development Area. These  projects are generally pursued by private entrepreneurs with varying degrees of participation and involvement by the Corporation, through such means as land assemblage and leasing.
