      Although the OMB guidance at 2 CFR 180.220(c) allows a Federal agency to do so (also see optional lower tier coverage in the figure in the appendix to 2 CFR part 180), NEH does not extend coverage of nonprocurement suspension and debarment requirements beyond first-tier procurement contracts under a covered nonprocurement transaction.

    Subparts E-I [Reserved]

    § 3369.10   What does this part do?

#### § § 3369.10

    This part adopts the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance in subparts A through I of 2 CFR part 180, as supplemented by this part, as the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) policies and procedures for nonprocurement debarment and suspension. It thereby gives regulatory effect for the NEH to the OMB guidance as supplemented by this part. This part satisfies the requirements in section 3 of Executive Order 12549, “Debarment and Suspension” (3 CFR 1986 Comp., p. 189), Executive Order 12689, “Debarment and Suspension” (3 CFR 1989 Comp., p. 235) and 31 U.S.C. 6101 note (Section 2455, Public Law 103-355, 108 Stat. 3327).

#### § § 3369.20

    This part and, through this part, pertinent portions of the OMB guidance in subparts A through I of 2 CFR part 180 (see table at 2 CFR 180.100(b)) apply to you if you are a—

    (a) Participant or principal in a “covered transaction” (see subpart B of 2 CFR part 180 and the definition of “nonprocurement transaction” at 2 CFR 180.970).

    (d) NEH grants officer, agreements officer, or other official authorized to enter into any type of nonprocurement transaction that is a covered transaction;

    § 3369.30   What policies and procedures must I follow?

#### § § 3369.30

    The NEH policies and procedures that you must follow are the policies and procedures specified in each applicable section of the OMB guidance in subparts A through I of 2 CFR part 180, as that section is supplemented by the section in this part with the same section number. The contracts that are covered transactions, for example, are specified by section 220 of the OMB guidance (, 2 CFR 180.220) as supplemented by section 220 in this part (, § 3369.220). For any section of OMB guidance in subparts A through I of 2 CFR 180 that has no corresponding section in this part, NEH policies and procedures are those in the OMB guidance.
