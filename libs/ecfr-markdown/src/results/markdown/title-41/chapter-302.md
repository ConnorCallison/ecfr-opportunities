For example, if the old official station is 3 miles from the current residence, then the new official station must be at least 53 miles from that same residence in order to receive relocation expenses for residence transactions. The distance between the official station and residence is the shortest of the commonly traveled routes between them. The distance test does not take into consideration the location of a new residence. This follows the distance guidelines found in

        (b) The head of your agency or designee may authorize an exception to the 50-mile threshold on a case-by-case basis when the authorized official determines that it is in the best interest of the Government. The determination must take into consideration such factors as commuting time and distance between the employee's residence at the time of notification of transfer and the new official station.

        (c) Any relocation must be incidental to the transfer and not for the convenience of the employee.

        § 302-3.502   What factors should we consider in determining whether to authorize a TCS for a long-term assignment?

#### § § 302-3.502

        You should consider the following factors in determining whether to authorize a TCS:

        (a)  You should consider the cost of each alternative. A long-term temporary duty travel assignment requires the payment of either per diem or actual subsistence expenses for the entire period of the assignment. This could be very costly to the agency over an extended period. A TCS will require fairly substantial relocation allowance payments at the beginning and end of the assignment, and less substantial payments for extended storage and property management services, when authorized, during the period of the assignment. Agencies should estimate the total cost of each alternative and authorize the one that is most advantageous for the agency, cost and other factors considered;

        (b)  An employee who performs a temporary duty travel assignment exceeding one year at a single location is subject to income taxation of the employee's travel expense reimbursements. The Withholding Tax Allowance and the Extended TDY Tax Reimbursement Allowance allow for the reimbursement of Federal, state, and local income taxes incurred as a result of taxable extended temporary duty assignments (see §§ 301-11.601—301-11.605 of this Subtitle). An employee who is authorized and performs a TCS also will be subject to income taxation of some, but not all, of their TCS expenses. You will pay an offsetting Relocation Income Tax (RIT) allowance on an employee's TCS expense reimbursements; and

        (c)  The long-term assignment of an employee away from the employee's official station and immediate family may negatively affect the employee's morale and job performance. Such negative effects may be alleviated by authorizing a TCS so the employee can transport their immediate family and/or household goods at Government expense to the location where the employee will perform the long-term assignment. You should consider the effects of a long-term temporary duty travel assignment on an employee when deciding whether to authorize a TCS.

      Subpart A—Employee's Allowance For Househunting Trip Expenses

        § 302-5.1   What is a “househunting trip”?

#### § § 302-5.1

        The term “househunting trip” refers to a trip made by the employee and/or spouse to your new official station locality to find permanent living quarters to rent or purchase. The term “living quarters” in this part includes apartments, condominiums, and cooperatives in addition to townhouses and single family homes.

        § 302-5.2   What is the purpose of the househunting trip expenses allowance?

#### § § 302-5.2

        The allowance for househunting trip expenses is intended to facilitate and expedite the employee's move from your old official station to your new official station and to lower the Government's overall cost for the employee's relocation by reducing the amount of time an employee must occupy temporary quarters. The allowance for househunting trip expenses provides the employee and/or spouse a period of time to concentrate on finding a suitable permanent residence at the new official station and thereby expedites the employee's relocation.

        § 302-5.3   Am I eligible for a househunting trip expenses allowance?

#### § § 302-5.3

        You are eligible for a househunting trip expenses allowance if you are an employee who is authorized to transfer, and in addition:

        (a) Both your old and new official stations are located within the United States;

        (b) You are not assigned to Government or other prearranged housing at your new official station; and

        (c) Your old and new official stations are 75 or more miles apart (as measured by map distance) via a usually traveled surface route.

        § 302-5.4   Who is not eligible for a househunting trip expenses allowance?

#### § § 302-5.4

        New appointees and employees assigned under the Government Employees Training Act (5 U.S.C. 4109) are not eligible for a househunting trip expenses allowance.

        § 302-5.5   Must my agency authorize payment of a househunting trip expenses allowance?

#### § § 302-5.5

        No, your agency determines when it is in the Government's interest to authorize you a househunting trip and the procedures you must follow if it is authorized.

        § 302-5.6   Under what circumstances will I receive a househunting trip expenses allowance?

#### § § 302-5.6

        You will receive a househunting trip expenses allowance if:

        (a) Your agency authorized you to perform a househunting trip in advance of the travel (the agency authorization must specify the mode of transportation and the period of time allowed for the trip);

        (b) You have signed a service agreement;

        (c) Your agency has established, and informed you of, the date you are to report to your new official station; and

        (d) You meet any additional conditions your agency has established.

        § 302-5.7   Who may travel on a househunting trip at Government expense?

        Your agency may authorize only one round trip for you and/or your spouse in connection with a particular transfer.

        § 302-5.9   May my spouse and I perform separate househunting trips at Government expense?

#### § § 302-5.9

        Yes, however, your reimbursement will be limited to the cost that would have been incurred if you and your spouse had traveled together on one round trip.

        § 302-5.10   How soon may I and/or my spouse begin a househunting trip?

#### § § 302-5.10

        You may begin your househunting trip as soon as your agency has notified you of your transfer and issued a travel authorization for a househunting trip. To take maximum advantage of your trip, however, it is very important that you become familiar as quickly as you can with your new official station area (e.g., housing market conditions, school locations, etc.). If you are selling your residence at your old official station, you should not begin your househunting trip until you have a current appraisal of the value of the residence so that you can more accurately determine the appropriate price range of residences to consider during your househunting trip.

        § 302-5.11   Is there a time limit on the duration of a househunting trip?

#### § § 302-5.11

        A househunting trip should be for a reasonable period, not to exceed 10 calendar days, as authorized by your agency under § 302-5.101(d).

        § 302-5.12   When must my househunting trip be completed?

        § 302-5.14   What transportation expenses will my agency pay?

#### § § 302-5.14

        (a) Your agency will authorize you to travel by any transportation mode(s) (e.g., common carrier or POV) that it determines to be advantageous to the Government. Your agency will pay for your transportation expenses by the authorized mode(s). If you travel by one or more mode(s) other than the one(s) authorized by your agency, your agency will pay your transportation expenses up to the constructive cost of transportation by the authorized mode(s). For trips of less than 250 miles, your agency will authorize travel by POV, unless there are reasons for not using a POV that are acceptable to the agency (e.g., traveler is physically impaired, does not own or lease a POV, has only one POV that is used for family transportation, or the POV is not roadworthy for such a trip). POV mileage reimbursement will be in accordance with § 302-4.300 of this chapter.

        (b) Unless the agency performs a written cost comparison that demonstrates cost savings, only common carrier may be authorized for trips with a distance of 250 miles or more.

For lump sum househunting trip subsistence reimbursement, you do not need to document your subsistence expenses. For per diem househunting trip subsistence expense reimbursement, you must itemize your lodging expenses and you must provide receipts as required by §§ 301-7.9(b), 301-11.25, 301-11.306 and 301-52.4(b) of chapter 301.

#### § § 302-5.18

        Yes, if your lump sum househunting amount is more than adequate to cover your househunting expenses any balance belongs to you.

        (a) When you will authorize a househunting trip for an employee;

        (b) Who will determine if a househunting trip is appropriate in each situation;

        (c) If and when you will authorize the lump sum option for househunting trip subsistence expenses reimbursement;

        (d) Who will determine the appropriate duration of a househunting trip for an employee who selects a per diem allowance under part 302-4 of this chapter to reimburse househunting trip subsistence expenses; and

        § 302-5.102   Under what circumstances may we authorize a househunting trip?

#### § § 302-5.102

        You may authorize a househunting trip on an individual-case basis when the employee has accepted the transfer and the employee's circumstances indicate that a househunting trip actually is needed. You may not authorize a househunting trip when the purpose of the trip is to assist the employee in deciding whether the employee will accept the transfer.

        § 302-5.103   What modes of transportation may we authorize for a househunting trip?

#### § § 302-5.103

        (a) When the new official station is less than 250 miles from the old official station, the required mode of transportation is POV, unless there are reasons for not using a POV that are acceptable to the you (e.g., traveler is physically impaired, does not own or lease a POV, has only one POV which is used for family transportation, or the POV is not roadworthy for such a trip). Reimbursement for POV mileage is at the rate prescribed in § 302-4.300 of this subchapter.

        (b) When the new official station is 250 miles or more from the old official station, the preferred mode of transportation is common carrier. However, you may authorize the use of POV for a househunting trip longer than 250 miles, provided you complete a written cost comparison in accordance with § 302-5.14(b).

        § 302-5.104   What factors must we consider in determining whether to offer an employee the fixed amount househunting trip subsistence expense reimbursement option?

#### § § 302-5.104

        You must consider the following factors:

        (a)  Payment of a per diem allowance under part 302-4 of this chapter requires you to review claims for the validity, accuracy, and reasonableness of each expense amount, except for meals and incidental expenses. Lump sum househunting trip subsistence expenses reimbursement is easier to administer because you do not have to review expense amounts.

        (b)  You must weigh the cost of each reimbursement option on a case-by-case basis.

        (c)  The employee is allowed to choose between a per diem allowance under part 302-4 of this chapter and lump sum househunting trip subsistence expenses reimbursement when you offer the lump sum reimbursement method. You therefore should weigh employee morale and productivity considerations against actual cost considerations in determining which method to offer.

        § 302-6.14   When does my authorized period for TQSE reimbursement end?

#### § § 302-6.14

        The period for TQSE reimbursement ends at midnight on either the day before you and/or any member of your immediate family occupies permanent residence quarters (even if some, but not all household goods have been delivered such that the residence is suitable for permanent occupancy), or the day your authorized period for TQSE reimbursement expires, whichever occurs first. (See § 302-6.207 for details.)

        § 302-6.15   May I and/or my immediate family occupy temporary quarters longer than the period for which I am authorized to claim TQSE reimbursement?

#### § § 302-6.15

        Yes, but you will not be reimbursed for any of the expenses you incur during the unauthorized period.

        § 302-6.16   May the period for which I am authorized to claim TQSE reimbursement for myself be different from that of my immediate family?

        § 302-6.17   What effect do partial days of temporary quarters occupancy have on my authorized period for claiming TQSE reimbursement?

#### § § 302-6.17

        Occupancy of temporary quarters is based on calendar days and partial days are counted as full days of TQSE. You may not receive reimbursement under both TQSE allowance and another subsistence expenses allowance within the same day, with one exception.

        § 302-6.18   How is my TQSE allowance affected if my temporary quarters become my permanent residence quarters?

#### § § 302-6.18

        If your temporary quarters become your permanent residence quarters, you may receive a TQSE allowance only if you show in a manner satisfactory to your agency that you initially intended to occupy the quarters temporarily. You will not be entitled to TQSE once your agency determines that your temporary quarters are your permanent residence. (See § 302-6.207 for details.)

        § 302-6.19   May I receive a TQSE allowance if I am receiving another subsistence expenses allowance?

#### § § 302-6.19

        No, unless your immediate family is claiming TQSE and you are performing separate official TDY travel, or you receive a cost-of-living allowance payable under 5 U.S.C. 5941 in addition to a TQSE allowance. (See § 302-6.17 for partial days for en route travel days.)

        § 302-6.20   May I be reimbursed for transportation expenses incurred while I am occupying temporary quarters?

#### § § 302-6.20

        Transportation expenses incurred in the vicinity of the temporary quarters, such as rental car or mileage for commuting to/from work, parking, and bus or mass transit, etc., are not TQSE expenses, and therefore, there is no authority to pay such expenses under TQSE.

        § 302-6.21   May I be reimbursed for TQSE while occupying my permanent residence quarters at my old official station?

#### § § 302-6.21

        Your agency may authorize TQSE for a reasonable time when your residence at your old official station becomes temporary and no longer suitable for permanent residence ( household goods have been shipped and are unavailable to you and your immediate family).

        § 302-6.22   What methods may my agency use to reimburse me for TQSE?

#### § § 302-6.22

        (a) Your agency may use one of the following TQSE methods:

        (1) TQSE—Lodgings-Plus (TQSE-LP);

        (2) TQSE—Actual Expense (TQSE-AE); or

        (3) TQSE—Lump Sum (TQSE-LS).

        (b) Your agency will reimburse you for TQSE under the “lodgings-plus” method unless it offers you one or more of the alternate methods. If your agency makes multiple methods available to you, you may select the one you prefer; however, once your travel has begun, the authorized TQSE method may not be changed.

        § 302-6.23   What is the “applicable per diem rate” under the TQSE reimbursement methods?

#### § § 302-6.23

        The “applicable per diem rate” is the rate in effect for the locality at the old or new official station or combination thereof, wherever temporary quarters will be occupied. The applicable per diem rate could be the standard CONUS, CONUS non-standard area (NSA), or OCONUS non-foreign locality per diem rate as determined by GSA or the Department of Defense.

        § 302-6.24   How may my TQSE reimbursement be affected if I relocate to, or currently occupy, temporary quarters in a Presidentially-Declared Disaster area?

#### § § 302-6.24

        Your agency should consider delaying all non-essential relocations to Presidentially-Declared Disaster areas because the ability to secure temporary quarters lodgings in those areas may be compromised. If relocation cannot be delayed, or if you are already occupying temporary quarters that have been affected by the disaster in a Presidentially-Declared Disaster area, for temporary quarters located within CONUS your agency may:

        (a) Authorize you to occupy temporary quarters outside of the proximity requirements at § 302-6.10; and

        (b) Authorize TQSE at the applicable locality per diem allowance under FTR §§ 301-11.100 through 301-11.102 of this subtitle or authorize actual expenses on an individual basis under FTR §§ 301-11.300 through 301-11.306 of this subtitle not to exceed 300 percent of the applicable per diem in accordance with § 301-11.303 of this subtitle; or

        (c) Issue a blanket actual expense authorization for official relocation travel performed on or after the date of the Presidentially-Declared Disaster.

        (d) The authorizations in paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section must apply to a specific Presidential Disaster Declaration, and must end on the expiration date of the Declaration, or one year from the date the Declaration is issued, whichever is sooner. The maximum limit of 120 consecutive days that TQSE may be authorized is statutorily based and remains in effect in accordance with FTR § 302-6.29(a). A blanket authorization issued under this section shall not apply to any travel performed pursuant to chapter 301 of this subtitle and does not permit an agency to change the TQSE method authorized once the travel has begun. See § 302-6.22(b).

        § 302-6.25   Must I document my TQSE to receive reimbursement?

#### § § 302-6.25

        (a)  You must file a voucher and provide documentation for your temporary quarters lodging expenses, lodging taxes, and other subsistence expenses over $75. There is no requirement to document meals and incidental expenses.

        (b)  You must file a voucher and document all temporary quarters lodging, lodging taxes, meals, and other subsistence expenses over $75.

        (c)  You are not required to document your subsistence expenses or file a voucher. However, your agency will require you to sign a statement or other document, and provide proof that you actually occupied temporary quarters, even if not for the full length of time on which the lump sum calculation was based. In the absence of sufficient proof of temporary quarters occupancy, your agency may demand repayment of the TQSE-LS payment in accordance with § 302-6.205.

        § 302-6.26   May I receive an advance of funds for TQSE?

#### § § 302-6.26

        (a)  You may receive an advance of funds if authorized in accordance with your agency policy and § 302-2.24 of this chapter. Your agency may advance the amount of funds necessary to cover your estimated TQSE expenses for up to 30 days. Your agency may subsequently advance additional funds for periods up to 30 days.

        (b)  You will not receive an advance of funds as your agency will offer a one-time lump sum payment as close as is reasonably possible to the time you will begin occupancy of temporary quarters; no additional payments will be authorized. If your TQSE-LS payment is more than adequate to cover your actual TQSE expenses, any balance belongs to you ( your agency authorizes and you accept a lump sum payment for 15 days of TQSE and you vacate temporary quarters after 10 days, you would retain the remaining balance for the 5 days of TQSE not incurred).

        § 302-6.27   Must I use a Government contractor-issued travel charge card for TQSE?

#### § § 302-6.27

        Yes, you must use the Government contractor-issued travel charge card as the method of payment for all official relocation expenses, including TQSE, unless exempted under part 301-51 of this subtitle.

        § 302-6.28   Are temporary quarters lodging taxes and laundry/dry cleaning expenses included in the TQSE amount?

#### § § 302-6.28

        Temporary quarters lodging taxes are not included in your daily temporary quarters lodging rate and may be documented as a separate TQSE-LP or TQSE-AE miscellaneous expense. Lodging taxes for TQSE-LS are included in your overall lump sum amount. Laundry/dry cleaning expenses are included in your incidental portion of the daily M&IE allowance and are not separately reimbursed.

        § 302-6.29   How long may I be authorized to claim TQSE reimbursement?

#### § § 302-6.29

        (a)  Your agency may initially authorize you to claim expenses in increments of 30 days or less, not to exceed 60 consecutive days. Your agency may authorize an extension of up to 60 additional consecutive days, for a maximum total of 120 consecutive days, if your agency determines that there is a compelling reason for you to continue occupying temporary quarters.

        (b)  If your agency offers, and you select TQSE-LS, your agency may authorize a lump sum for each day authorized up to a maximum of 30 consecutive days of TQSE; no extensions are allowed under the lump sum payment method. You will not receive additional TQSE reimbursement if the lump sum payment is not adequate to cover your actual TQSE.

        § 302-6.30   May my agency reduce my authorized number of TQSE days if I am authorized a househunting trip?

#### § § 302-6.30

        Your agency may reduce the total number of days you are authorized for TQSE by the number of househunting days ( instead of authorizing 60 days of TQSE your agency can authorize 50 days to account for your 10-day househunting trip); however, the percentage multiplier used for calculating TQSE may not be reduced based on the number of days used for a househunting trip.

        § 302-6.31   What is a “compelling reason” warranting extension of my authorized period for claiming TQSE-LP or TQSE-AE reimbursement?

#### § § 302-6.31

        A “compelling reason” is an event that is beyond your control and is acceptable to your agency. Examples include, but are not limited to:

        (a) Delivery of your household goods to your new residence is delayed due to availability of service providers, pandemics, strikes, customs clearance, hazardous weather, fires, floods or other acts of God, or similar events.

        (b) You cannot occupy your new permanent residence because of unanticipated problems ( delay in settlement on the new residence, or short-term delay in construction of the residence).

        (c) You are unable to locate a permanent residence that is adequate for your family's needs because of housing conditions at your new official station.

        (d) Sudden illness, injury, your death or the death of your immediate family member.

        § 302-6.32   May I interrupt occupancy of temporary quarters?

#### § § 302-6.32

        Yes, your authorized period for claiming TQSE-LP and TQSE-AE reimbursement is measured on consecutive days, and once begun, normally continues to run whether or not you continue to occupy temporary quarters. However, you may interrupt your authorized period for claiming reimbursement in the following instances:

        (a) For the time allowed for official travel en route between the old and new official stations;

        (b) For circumstances attributable to official necessity such as an intervening temporary duty assignment or military duty; or

        (c) For a non-official necessary interruption such as hospitalization, approved sick leave, or other reasons beyond your control and acceptable to your agency.

      Subpart B—TQSE Methods of Reimbursement

        § 302-6.100   What am I paid under the TQSE-LP reimbursement method?

#### § § 302-6.100

        Your agency will pay your actual daily temporary quarters lodging cost and a daily M&IE allowance not to exceed the single maximum lodging amount and the single maximum M&IE amount for the applicable per diem rate (see § 302-6.23) for the locality at the old or new official station or combination thereof, wherever temporary quarters will be occupied. Your TQSE expenses must be reasonable and if expenses exceed the maximum allowable amount, you will not be reimbursed for more than the maximum allowable amount. The “maximum allowable amount” is the “maximum daily amount” multiplied by the number of days you actually incur TQSE not to exceed the number of days authorized, taking into account that the rates change after 30 days in temporary quarters. The “maximum daily amount” (see Note 1 to § 302-6.100) is determined by adding the rates for you and each member of your immediate family authorized to occupy temporary quarters:

        (a) For the first 30 days of temporary quarters:

        (1) You and/or your unaccompanied spouse or domestic partner (see Note 2 to § 302-6.100) may receive 100 percent of the temporary quarters lodging portion of the applicable per diem rate and 100 percent of the M&IE portion of the applicable per diem rate.

        (2) Your accompanied spouse, domestic partner, or a member of your immediate family who is age 12 or older may receive 50 percent of the temporary quarters lodging portion of the applicable per diem rate and 50 percent of the M&IE portion of the applicable per diem rate.

        (3) A member of your immediate family who is under age 12 may receive 40 percent of the temporary quarters lodging portion of the applicable per diem rate and 40 percent of the M&IE portion of the applicable per diem rate.

        (b) For the second 30 days of temporary quarters:

        (1) You and/or your unaccompanied spouse or domestic partner (see Note 2 to § 302-6.100) may receive 75 percent of the temporary quarters lodging portion of the applicable per diem rate and 75 percent of the M&IE portion of the applicable per diem rate.

        (2) Your accompanied spouse, domestic partner, or a member of your immediate family who is age 12 or older may receive 45 percent of the temporary quarters lodging portion of the applicable per diem rate and 45 percent of the M&IE portion of the applicable per diem rate.

        (3) A member of your immediate family who is under age 12 may receive 35 percent of the temporary quarters lodging portion of the applicable per diem rate and 35 percent of the M&IE portion of the applicable per diem rate.

        (c) For any additional authorized days of temporary quarters:

        (1) You and/or your unaccompanied spouse or domestic partner (see Note 2 to § 302-6.100) may receive 55 percent of the temporary quarters lodging portion of the applicable per diem rate and 55 percent of the M&IE portion of the applicable per diem rate.

        (2) Your accompanied spouse, domestic partner, or a member of your immediate family who is age 12 or older may receive 40 percent of the temporary quarters lodging portion of the applicable per diem rate and 40 percent of the M&IE portion of the applicable per diem rate.

        (3) A member of your immediate family who is under age 12 may receive 30 percent of the temporary quarters lodging portion of the applicable per diem rate and 30 percent of the M&IE portion of the applicable per diem rate.

        § 302-6.101   What am I paid under the TQSE-AE reimbursement method?

#### § § 302-6.101

        Your agency will pay your actual TQSE incurred, provided the expenses are reasonable and if expenses exceed the maximum allowable amount, you will not be reimbursed for more than the maximum allowable amount. The “maximum allowable amount” is the “maximum daily amount” multiplied by the number of days you actually incur TQSE not to exceed the number of days authorized, taking into account that the rates change after 30 days in temporary quarters. The “maximum daily amount” (see Note  to § 302-6.101) is determined by using the applicable per diem rate (see § 302-6.23) for the locality at the old or new official station or combination thereof, wherever temporary quarters will be occupied, and adding the rates for you and each member of your immediate family authorized to occupy temporary quarters:

        (a) For the first 30 days of temporary quarters:

        (1) You and/or your unaccompanied spouse or domestic partner (see Note 2 to § 302-6.101) may receive 100 percent of the applicable per diem rate.

        (2) Your accompanied spouse, domestic partner, or a member of your immediate family who is age 12 or older may receive 50 percent of the applicable per diem rate.

        (3) A member of your immediate family who is under age 12 may receive 40 percent of the applicable per diem rate.

        (b) For the second 30 days of temporary quarters:

        (1) You and/or your unaccompanied spouse or domestic partner (see Note 2 to § 302-6.101) may receive 75 percent of the applicable per diem rate.

        (2) Your accompanied spouse, domestic partner, or a member of your immediate family who is age 12 or older may receive 45 percent of the applicable per diem rate.

        (3) A member of your immediate family who is under age 12 may receive 35 percent of the applicable per diem rate.

        (c) For any additional days of temporary quarters:

        (1) You and/or your unaccompanied spouse or domestic partner (see Note 2 to § 302-6.101) may receive 55 percent of the applicable per diem rate.

        (2) Your accompanied spouse, domestic partner, or a member of your immediate family who is age 12 or older may receive 40 percent of the applicable per diem rate.

        (3) A member of your immediate family who is under age 12 may receive 30 percent of the applicable per diem rate.

        § 302-6.102   What am I paid under the TQSE-LS reimbursement method?

#### § § 302-6.102

        (a) For you or your unaccompanied spouse or domestic partner (see Note 1 to § 302-6.102), if you are receiving a lump sum for TQSE, multiply the number of days (up to 30 days) your agency authorizes TQSE-LS by 75 percent of the applicable per diem rate (see § 302-6.23) for the locality at the old or new official station or combination thereof, wherever temporary quarters will be occupied.

        (b) For each member of your immediate family (excluding your unaccompanied spouse or domestic partner), multiply the same number of days by 25 percent of the same per diem rate, as referenced in paragraph (a) of this section.

        (c) Your lump sum payment will be the sum of the calculations in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.

        § 302-6.103   May my agency reduce my TQSE allowance below the “maximum allowable amount”?

#### § § 302-6.103

        Yes, if the estimated daily amount of your TQSE is determined in advance to be lower than the maximum daily amount, your agency may reduce the maximum allowable amount to your expected expenses provided the new applicable amount is annotated on the relocation authorization before you occupy temporary quarters. However, see § 302-6.30 regarding househunting trips.

      Subpart C—Agency Responsibilities

        § 302-6.200   How should we administer the TQSE allowance?

#### § § 302-6.200

        Temporary quarters should be authorized only if, and only for as long as necessary until the employee and the employee's immediate family can move into permanent residence quarters. You must administer the TQSE allowance to minimize or avoid other relocation expenses.

        § 302-6.201   What governing policies must we establish for the TQSE allowance?

#### § § 302-6.201

        You must establish policies and procedures governing:

        (a) When you will authorize temporary quarters for employees;

        (b) Who will determine if temporary quarters is appropriate in each situation;

        (c) What method of TQSE will be authorized;

        (d) Who will determine the appropriate period of time for which TQSE reimbursement will be authorized, including approval of extensions and interruptions of temporary quarters occupancy;

        (e) Who will determine whether quarters were indeed temporary; and

        (f) Who will determine, and in what instances, to issue the authorizations at § 302-6.24, including a blanket authorization for actual expenses.

        § 302-6.202   Under what circumstances may we authorize the TQSE allowance?

#### § § 302-6.202

        You may authorize a TQSE allowance on an individual-case basis when use of temporary quarters is justified in connection with an employee's transfer to a new official station, including upon assignment to a temporary official station and permanent assignment to a temporary official station. You may not authorize a TQSE allowance for vacation purposes or other reasons unrelated to the transfer.

        § 302-6.203   What factors should we consider in determining whether the TQSE allowance is actually necessary?

#### § § 302-6.203

        The factors you should consider include:

        (a) The length of time the employee should reasonably be expected to occupy their residence at the old official station before reporting for duty at the new official station. An employee and the employee's immediate family should continue to occupy the residence at the old official station for as long as practicable to avoid the necessity for temporary quarters.

        (b) The existence of less expensive alternatives. If a less expensive alternative to the TQSE allowance exists that will enable the employee to find permanent quarters at the new official station, you should consider such an alternative. For example, authorize a househunting trip instead of temporary quarters if it would cost less overall.

        (c) The existence of other opportunities to arrange for permanent quarters. Consider whether the employee had adequate opportunity to arrange for permanent quarters. For example, you should not authorize temporary quarters if the employee had adequate opportunity during an extended temporary duty assignment or long-term temporary change of station that became permanent, to arrange for permanent quarters.

        § 302-6.204   What factors should we consider in determining what TQSE method(s) to offer an employee?

#### § § 302-6.204

        When determining what TQSE method(s) to offer an employee the following factors should be considered:

        (a)  You should consider the administrative requirements for each method of TQSE. Factors such as obtaining and reviewing receipts to verify validity, accuracy, and reasonableness of each expense carry an administrative burden to the employee, their immediate family, and you.

        (b)  You should weigh the cost of each alternative. TQSE-LP and TQSE-AE reimbursement may extend up to 120 days, while the TQSE-LS payment is limited to a maximum of 30 days.

        (c)  The employee will be reimbursed for TQSE under the “lodgings-plus” method unless you offer one or more of the alternate methods. If you make all methods available to the employee, the employee is allowed to select any one of the methods. You should therefore consider employee morale and productivity against actual cost in determining which method(s) to offer.

        § 302-6.205   Must we require transferees to sign a statement that TQSE will be incurred?

#### § § 302-6.205

        (a) Transferees authorized TQSE-LP or TQSE-AE are not required to sign a statement asserting that they will occupy temporary quarters since they must document temporary quarters lodging expenses.

        (b) Transferees electing the TQSE-LS payment option if offered by you, must sign a statement, which should be included as part of the service agreement, asserting that they will occupy temporary quarters and will incur TQSE. If a lump sum amount was paid, and if no TQSE are incurred, the transferee must return all monies received for the TQSE-LS payment to the agency.

        § 302-6.206   When must we make the TQSE-LS payment to the transferee?

#### § § 302-6.206

        You must pay the transferee the TQSE-LS payment before the occupancy of temporary quarters begins. You should make the TQSE-LS payment as close as is reasonably possible to the time that the transferee will begin occupancy of temporary quarters.

        § 302-6.207   What factors should we consider in determining whether quarters are temporary?

#### § § 302-6.207

        In determining whether quarters are “temporary”, you should consider factors such as reasonable time when the employee's residence at the old official station becomes temporary and no longer suitable for permanent residence ( household goods have been shipped and are unavailable to the employee and their immediate family), the duration of the lease, movement of household goods into the quarters, the type of quarters, the employee's expressions of intent, attempts to secure a permanent dwelling, and the length of time the employee occupies the quarters.

        § 302-7.2   What is the maximum weight of HHG that may be transported or stored at Government expense?

#### § § 302-7.2

        (a) The maximum weight allowance of HHG that may be shipped or stored at Government expense is 18,000 pounds net weight. For uncrated or van line shipments, a 2,000 pound allowance is added to the 18,000 pounds net weight allowance to cover packing materials for the shipment. In no case may a shipment weigh over 20,000 gross pounds (the 18,000 pounds net weight of the uncrated HHG plus the 2,000 pound allowance for packing materials). The relocating employee is responsible for reimbursing the Government for all costs incurred if the shipment is overweight. For determining the weight of crated shipments, containerized shipments, and constructive weight for other types of household good shipments, please  the chart in § 302-7.13.

        (b) An agency may establish a lower net weight allowance and a lower allowance for packing materials in special circumstances, such as transferring an employee into government-furnished quarters.

> [FTR Amdt. 2011-01, 76 FR 18339, Apr. 1, 2011]

        § 302-7.3   May HHG be transported or stored in more than one lot?

#### § § 302-7.3

        Household goods may be transported and stored in multiple lots, however, your maximum HHG weight allowance is based upon shipping and storing all HHG as one lot.

        § 302-7.4   Who pays for shipping professional books, papers, and equipment (PBP&E)?

#### § § 302-7.4

        The agency may pay for shipping PBP&E as a discretionary item. When authorized, shipping PBP&E is considered an administrative cost to the agency. However, for ease of administration in calculating this allowance, PBP&E should be included as part of the HHG shipment, if possible. That is, if the net weight of the HHG plus the PBP&E is less than 18,000 pounds, the agency should ship the items together and pay for the HHG shipment in one payment.

> [FTR Amdt. 2011-01, 76 FR 18339, Apr. 1, 2011]

        § 302-7.5   What happens if the HHG shipment includes PBP&E, and it might exceed, or did exceed, the 18,000 pounds net weight allowance?

#### § § 302-7.5

        (a) Separate the PBP&E and have the HHG carrier estimate the weight of the PBP&E before the HHG shipment is picked up. Subtract 110 percent of the estimated PBP&E weight (to adjust for packing materials) from the estimated gross weight as shown on the shipping documents ( net weight minus the PBP&E minus 10 percent of the PBP&E). If the result is more than the 18,000 pounds net weight allowance, then the shipment exceeds the net weight allowance.

        (b) If you did not discover that the HHG shipment exceeded the net weight allowance in advance, and if you did not weigh or estimate the PBP&E before shipping it, then weigh the PBP&E before it is delivered. Determine if the shipment exceeds the net weight allowance by applying the formula in paragraph (a) of this section.

        (c) If the calculation in paragraph (a) of this section shows that the shipment does not exceed the net weight allowance, then the agency may transport and pay for shipping the PBP&E plus packing materials with the household goods.

        (d) However, if the calculation in paragraph (a) of this section shows that the shipment may exceed the net weight allowance, and if the employee was authorized PBP&E, then the employee must pay for shipping all weight that exceeds the net weight allowance for their HHG, minus the PBP&E and packing materials for both. The agency may then pay for shipping the PBP&E as an administrative expense.

        (e) The agency may require reasonable documentation of the items requesting to be shipped as PBP&E and the weight of the PBP&E.

        § 302-7.6   What are the authorized origin and destination points for the transportation of HHG and PBP&E?

#### § § 302-7.6

        The authorized origin and destination points for the transportation of HHG and PBP&E vary by category of employee and are listed in the following table:

> [FTR Amdt. 2011-01, 76 FR 18339, Apr. 1, 2011]

        § 302-7.7   May the origin and destination points be other than that prescribed in § 302-7.6?

#### § § 302-7.7

        Yes, shipments may originate or terminate at any location; however, your reimbursement is limited to the cost of transporting the property in one lot from the authorized origin to the authorized destination.

        § 302-7.8   At what location can CONUS-to-CONUS or OCONUS-to-CONUS HHG shipments be temporarily stored?

#### § § 302-7.8

        Your HHG may be placed in temporary storage at origin, in transit, at destination, or any combination thereof upon agency approval.

> [FTR Amdt. 2011-01, 76 FR 18340, Apr. 1, 2011]

        § 302-7.9   What are the time limits for the temporary storage of authorized HHG shipments?

#### § § 302-7.9

        (a)  The initial period of temporary storage at Government expense may not exceed 60 days. You may request additional time, up to a maximum of 90 days, and you must make such a request prior to the expiration of the original 60 days. This extension must be approved by the agency official designated for such requests. Under no circumstances may temporary storage at Government expense for CONUS to CONUS shipments exceed a total of 150 days.

        (b)  The initial period of temporary storage at Government expense may not exceed 90 days. You may request additional time, up to a maximum of 90 days, and you must make such a request prior to the expiration of the original 90 days. This extension must be approved by the agency official designated for such requests. Under no circumstances may temporary storage for shipments at Government expense that include an OCONUS origin or destination exceed a total of 180 days.

        § 302-7.14   What methods of transporting and paying for the movement of HHG, PBP&E and temporary storage are authorized?

#### § § 302-7.14

        There are two authorized methods of transporting and paying for the movement of HHG, PBP&E and temporary storage. Your agency will determine which of the following methods will be authorized.

        (a)  Under the commuted rate system you assume total responsibility for arranging and paying for, at least the following services: packing/unpacking, crating/uncrating, pickup/deliver, weighing, line-haul, drayage, and temporary storage of your HHG and PBP&E with a commercial HHG carrier or by renting self drive equipment for a do-it-yourself move. When any PBP&E is transported as an administrative expense of your agency, all arrangements (e.g., packing/unpacking, pickup/delivery, weighing, temporary storage, etc.) will be handled and paid for by your agency.

        (b)  Under the actual expense method, your agency assumes the responsibility for arranging and paying for all aspects (e.g., packing/unpacking, pickup/delivery, weighing, line-haul, drayage, temporary storage, etc.), of transporting your HHG and PBP&E with a commercial HHG carrier.

        § 302-7.15   Are there any disadvantages to using the commuted rate method for transporting HHG, PBP&E and temporary storage?

#### § § 302-7.15

        Yes. The disadvantages to using the commuted rate method for transporting HHG, PBP&E and temporary storage are that the:

        (a) Government cannot take advantage of any special rates that may be offered only to Government shipments;

        (b) Commuted rate method does not apply to intrastate moves; and

        (c) Commuted rate method may not fully reimburse your out-of-pocket expenses.

        § 302-7.17   Is the maximum weight allowance for HHG and temporary storage limited when quarters are furnished or partly furnished by the Government OCONUS or upon return to CONUS?

#### § § 302-7.17

        When quarters are furnished or partly furnished by the Government OCONUS, your agency may limit the weight of HHG and temporary storage that can be transported to that location. Only the authorized weight allowance that was shipped to the OCONUS location may be returned to CONUS upon completion of the tour of duty, unless the agency makes an exception under conditions specified in agency internal regulations.

        § 302-7.20   Should I include items that are irreplaceable or of extremely high monetary or sentimental value in my HHG shipment?

#### § § 302-7.20

        Generally no; items that are irreplaceable or of extremely high monetary or sentimental value should not be included in your HHG shipment. Additional insurance may be purchased, at your expense, to cover any loss or damage, however, such items are not necessarily provided special security. Accordingly, it is advisable that you or an immediate family member(s) transport such items personally.

        § 302-7.21   If my HHG shipment includes an item for which a weight additive is assessed by the HHG carrier (e.g., boat, trailer, ultralight vehicle), am I responsible for payment?

#### § § 302-7.21

        (a) No, you will not be responsible for the shipping charges that result from a weight additive so long as the actual weight of your HHG without the additive does not exceed the 18,000 pound net weight allowance for relocation. However you are responsible for any amount your HHG exceeds the 18,000 pound net weight allowance prior to the addition of the weight additive (e.g., when a weight additive of 700 pounds is imposed by a HHG carrier for a 65-pound canoe and the total net weight of the HHG, including the weight additive, is 18,765 pounds, you are only responsible for the 65 pounds actually added by the canoe).

        (b) You are also responsible for the cost of special packing, crating, and handling of the weight additive items, if any.  § 302-7.200 on how charges are paid and who makes the shipping arrangements.

      Subpart B—Commuted Rate

        § 302-7.100   How are the charges of transporting HHG, and temporary storage calculated?

#### § § 302-7.100

        The charges for transporting HHG, and temporary storage are computed by multiplying the number of pounds shipped divided by 100 (within the 18,000 maximum limitation) by the applicable rate per one-hundred pounds for the distance transported. This includes, but is not limited to packing/unpacking, crating/uncrating, drayage, weighing, pickup/delivery, line-haul, accessorial charges, and temporary storage charges, including but not limited to handling in/out, etc. However, your reimbursement may not fully cover your total out-of-pocket expenses. In determining the distance shipped you may use the tariffs filed with GSA travel management centers or any other mileage guide authorized by your agency. If the exact mileage is not shown, the next higher mileage distance applies. If there is a minimum weight charge above the actual weight under applicable tariffs, reimbursement will be based on the minimum weight charge instead of the actual weight.

        (a) A receipted copy of the bill of lading (reproduced copies are acceptable) including any attached weight certificate copies if issued; or

        (b) Other evidence showing points of origin and destination and the weight of your HHG, if no bill of lading was issued, or

        (c) If a commercial HHG carrier is not used, you are responsible for establishing the weight of the HHG, and temporary storage by obtaining proper certified weight certificates. Certified weight certificates include the gross and tare weights. This is required because payment at commuted rates on the basis of constructive weight usually is not possible.

        § 302-7.105   May an advance of funds be authorized for transporting HHG and temporary storage?

#### § § 302-7.105

        An advance of funds may be authorized when the transportation of HHG and temporary storage is authorized under the commuted rate method.

#### § § 302-7.400

        You must establish policies and procedures as required for this subpart, including who will:

        (a) Administer your household goods program;

        (b) Authorize commuted rate or actual expense for transportation and payment for HHG, PBP&E, and temporary storage;

        (c) Authorize PBP&E to be transported as an agency administrative expense in accordance with FTR guidelines (usually the authorizing official for PBP&E will be at the employee's new official station);

        (d) Authorize an employee to ship UAB;

        (e) Collect any excess costs or charges;

        (f) Advise the employee on the Government's liability for any personal property damage or loss claims ( 31 U.S.C. 3721, );

        (g) Ensure that international HHG shipments by water are made on ships registered under the laws of the United States whenever such ships are available ( The Cargo Preference Act of 1904 (10 U.S.C. 2631) and The Cargo Preference Act of 1954 (46 U.S.C. 55302));

        (h) Authorize temporary storage in excess of the initial 60-day limit for CONUS shipments or 90-day limit for OCONUS shipments; and

        (i) Ensure pre-payment audits are completed.

        § 302-7.401   What method of transportation and payment should we authorize for shipment and temporary storage of HHG?

#### § § 302-7.401

        There are two methods of arranging and paying for shipment of HHG and providing for temporary storage: actual expense and commuted rate. You must authorize actual expense or commuted rate, depending on which is less costly to the Government. You must then specify the selected method on the relocation travel authorization.

        (a)  Under the actual expense method, the Government assumes the responsibility for arranging and paying for the actual expenses of all aspects of shipping the employee's HHG, including PBP&E, if any. These expenses may include but are not limited to: Packing/unpacking, crating/uncrating, pickup/delivery, weighing, line-haul, drayage, and temporary storage. This method is used for all shipments to/from/between OCONUS, and within CONUS where deemed economical to the Government.

        (b)

        (1) Under the commuted rate system, the employee assumes total responsibility for arranging and paying for the expenses of all aspects of shipping the employee's HHG, including PBP&E, if any. These expenses may include but are not limited to: Packing/unpacking, crating/uncrating, pickup/delivery, weighing, line-haul, drayage, and temporary storage. This method is used only for shipments within CONUS, and only where it is less costly to the Government than actual expense. The employee may arrange for shipment with a commercial HHG carrier or may rent self-drive equipment for a do-it-yourself move.

        (2) The commuted rate is calculated based on published HHG tariffs applied to the actual weight of the goods being shipped (subject also to the weight limitation in §§ 302-7.2 through 302-7.5).

        (3) If a PBP&E shipment causes the weight of a shipment under the commuted rate method to exceed the 18,000 pounds net weight allowance for HHG, then the actual cost of shipping that excess weight attributed to the PBP&E may be paid as an administrative expense of the agency. In this case, all related transportation arrangements (e.g., packing/unpacking, crating/uncrating, pickup/delivery, weighing, temporary storage, etc.) associated with shipping this excess weight will be handled and paid for by the agency ( § 302-7.5 for the process of determining what will paid for by the agency).

        § 302-7.402   What method of transportation and payment should we authorize for shipment of PBP&E and UAB?

#### § § 302-7.402

        (a) You should authorize the actual expense method for shipping an employee's PBP&E only when the weight of the PBP&E causes the employee's shipment to exceed the maximum 18,000 pounds net HHG weight limitation and in accordance with § 302-7.403. Preferably, PBP&E should be identified and weighed prior to shipment, so the weight can easily be deducted from the 18,000 pounds net weight allowance. In cases where the weight of the PBP&E causes the shipment to exceed the 18,000 pounds net weight allowance for HHG, the PBP&E shipment may be paid for as an administrative expense by you, provided you authorized PBP&E.

        (b) You should authorize the actual expense method for shipping an employee's UAB. UAB should be identified, weighed, and shipped prior to shipment of HHG. In cases where the weight of the UAB causes the shipment to exceed the 18,000 pounds net weight allowance for HHG, the cost of the excess weight is the responsibility of the employee. Under the actual expense method of shipment, you are responsible for paying the bill of lading in full and then collecting any excess cost from the employee.

        § 302-7.403   What guidelines must we follow when authorizing transportation of PBP&E as an administrative expense?

#### § § 302-7.403

        You have the sole discretion to authorize transportation of PBP&E as an administrative expense and may do so provided that:

        (a) The authorizing official has certified that the PBP&E is necessary for performance of the employee's duties at the new duty station;

        (b) The authorizing official has certified that, if these items were not transported, the same or similar items would have to be obtained at Government expense for the employee's use at the new official station;

        (c) You have acquired evidence that transporting the PBP&E would cause the employees' HHG to exceed the 18,000 pounds net weight allowance; and

        (d) If you have requested it, the employee has provided reasonable documentation of the items requesting to be shipped as PBP&E and the weight of the PBP&E for review by the authorizing official (who is usually an official at the employee's new official station).

        § 302-7.404   Are separate weight certificates required when HHG are shipped under the actual expense method and PBP&E are shipped as an administrative expense in the same lot?

#### § § 302-7.404

        Yes, separate weight certificates are required when the PBP&E and its packing allowance pushes the shipment over the net weight allowance. Otherwise, for administrative efficiency, the HHG shipment should be billed and paid for as a single shipment. If separate weight certificates are required, then the weight of PBP&E and the administrative appropriation chargeable must be listed as separate items on the bill of lading or other shipping document.

        § 302-7.405   How must we arrange and pay for transportation of HHG and UAB, if we have authorized actual expense for transportation?

#### § § 302-7.405

        When arranging transportation of HHG and UAB under the actual expense method, you should:

        (a) Determine the constructive cost of transporting the HHG plus the UAB, as follows:

        (1) Compute the cost of transporting the HHG (not including the UAB) in one lot, by the most economical means; be sure to include the cost of packing and unpacking.

        (2) Compute the cost of transporting the UAB.

        (3) If the HHG, including the UAB, exceeds the 18,000 pounds net weight allowance, then compute the cost of transporting only the net weight allowance as one shipment; again, be sure to include the cost of packing and unpacking.

        (4) The constructive cost is either that described in paragraph (a)(3) of this section or the sum of paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section, depending on whether the weight of the HHG, including the UAB, exceeds the net weight allowance.

        (b) Limit the employee's HHG plus UAB transportation payment to the constructive cost as described in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, so long as it is equal to or less than the 18,000 pound net limit of this Chapter;

        (c) Make arrangements for transporting the employee's HHG and UAB under two separate bills of lading, with direct payment by the agency for both; and

        (d) Advise employees of this relocation entitlement limitation and its potential to result in out-of-pocket expenses to the employee. That is, advise employees that they will have to use their personal funds to pay for transporting HHG (including UAB) in excess of 18,000 pounds net weight allowance.

#### § § 302-8.100

        Extended storage of HHG belonging to an employee transferred or a new appointee assigned to an official station at an isolated location in CONUS may be allowed only when it is clearly justified under the conditions in this part and is not primarily for the convenience, or at the request of, the employee or the new appointee.

#### § § 302-8.101

        (a) As determined by your agency, an official station at an isolated location is a place of permanent duty assignment in CONUS at which you have no alternative except to live where you are unable to use your HHG because:

        (1) The type of quarters you are required to occupy at the isolated official station will not accommodate your HHG; or

        (2) Residence quarters which would accommodate your HHG are not available within reasonable daily commuting distance of the official station.

        (b) The designation of an official station as isolated in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section shall not preclude a determination in individual instances that adequate housing is available for some employees stationed there based on housing which may be available within daily commuting distance and the size and other characteristics of each employee's immediate family. In such instances the station shall not be considered isolated with regard to you if your agency determines adequate family housing is available for you.

        § 302-8.102   Am I eligible for extended storage of HHG and personal effects?

#### § § 302-8.102

        Yes, you are eligible for extended storage of HHG and personal effects if:

        § 302-8.103   Where may my HHG be stored?

#### § § 302-8.103

        Your HHG may be stored either in:

        (a) Available Government-owned storage space; or

        (b) Suitable commercial storage space obtained by the Government if:

        (1) Government-owned space is not available, or

        (2) Commercial storage space is more economical or suitable because of location, transportation costs, or for other reasons.

        § 302-8.104   What are the allowable costs for storage?

#### § § 302-8.104

      Subpart B—Agency's Use of a Relocation Services Company

        § 302-12.100   What are “relocation services”?

#### § § 302-12.100

        “Relocation services” are services provided by a private company under a contract with an agency to assist an employee who relocates. Examples include homesale programs, home marketing assistance, home finding assistance, and property management services.

> [FTR Amdt. 98, 66 FR 58196, Nov. 20, 2001, as amended at 86 FR 73684, Dec. 28, 2021]

        § 302-12.101   May we enter into a contract with a relocation services company for the company to provide relocation services?

#### § § 302-12.101

        Yes, you may enter into a contract with a relocation services company for the company to provide relocation services.

        § 302-12.102   What contracted relocation services may we provide at Government expense?

#### § § 302-12.102

        You may pay for contracted relocation services that are substitutes for reimbursable relocation allowances authorized throughout this chapter. For example, you may pay for homesale services as a substitute for residence sale expenses, or household goods management services as a substitute for transportation of household goods.

        § 302-12.103   May we separately contract for each type of relocation service?

#### § § 302-12.103

        Yes, you may separately contract for each type of relocation service or you may combine several types of relocation services in a single contract.

        § 302-12.104   What is the purpose of contracting for relocation services?

#### § § 302-12.104

        The purpose of contracting for relocation services is to improve the treatment of employees who are directed to relocate to facilitate the retention of a well-qualified workforce.

        § 302-12.105   Must we have a contract with a RSC that includes a comprehensive homesale program?

#### § § 302-12.105

        No, you are not required to have a contract that includes a comprehensive homesale program (which, for this purpose, is defined as a relocation program that includes a contract with a RSC that provides for buyer value option sales, amended sales, and appraised value purchases by the RSC). However, if you do not have such a program, you must examine and evaluate the objectives and relative costs of your relocation benefits and management processes at least once every two years to determine whether a comprehensive homesale program should be part of your relocation program.

> [FTR Amdt. 2011-01, 76 FR 18343, Apr. 1, 2011]

        § 302-12.106   What rules must we follow when contracting for a comprehensive homesale program?

#### § § 302-12.106

        You must follow the rules contained in the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) (48 CFR) and/or all other acquisition regulations applicable to your agency.

> [FTR Amdt. 2011-01, 76 FR 18343, Apr. 1, 2011]

        §§ 302-12.107--302-12.108   [Reserved]

#### § §§ 302-12.107—302-12.108

        § 302-12.109   May we require employees to participate in counseling before listing their homes?

#### § § 302-12.109

        Yes, you may require that employees participate in counseling before listing their homes, provided this is written into your agency's relocation policy. This is a common practice in the private sector. Please note, however, that this may exclude from your homesale program any employee who lists their home before the relocation travel authorization is approved. If you choose to make this part of your agency policy, you should make a major, ongoing effort to inform as many of your potential transferees as possible of this policy.

> [FTR Amdt. 2011-01, 76 FR 18344, Apr. 1, 2011, as amended by FTR Case 2022-05, 89 FR 12256, Feb. 16, 2024]

        § 302-12.110   [Reserved]

#### § § 302-12.110

        § 302-12.111   May we require an employee to use a real estate broker specified by the RSC?

#### § § 302-12.111

        Yes, you may require, through your contract with the RSC, that every employee enrolled in the homesale program use a real estate broker specified by the RSC. This provision is not part of the standard terms for a homesale program, but it may provide a pricing advantage in negotiations with potential RSC, as well as an opportunity for better management of the homesale process.

> [FTR Amdt. 2011-01, 76 FR 18344, Apr. 1, 2011]

        § 302-12.112   May we require an employee to use a mortgage service provider specified by the RSC?

#### § § 302-12.112

        No. Under the Real Estate Procedures Settlement Act (RESPA), you may not require that the employee obtain any mortgage from a lender specified by the RSC. The RSC may provide the employee access to multiple mortgage service providers as long as there is no use requirement, and the employee is provided a choice. Allowing the RSC to provide access to multiple providers is not part of the standard terms for a homesale program, but it may provide a pricing advantage in negotiations with potential RSCs, as well as an opportunity for better management of the homesale process.

> [FTR Amdt. 2011-01, 76 FR 18344, Apr. 1, 2011]

        § 302-12.113   What must we do when planning, establishing, and administering a RSC contract?

#### § § 302-12.113

        (a) When planning and establishing a RSC contract, you must structure the contract so that it provides the best possible value to the Government, considering costs, tax implications, morale, mobility, employee choice, productivity, and any other relevant considerations. For most agencies and most relocations, this structure will include the possibility of a BVO sale or an amended value sale.

        (b) Once you have a RSC contract, you must monitor costs and tax consequences and make adjustments as necessary, to ensure that your homesale program continues to provide the same best value to the Government.

> [FTR Amdt. 2011-01, 76 FR 18344, Apr. 1, 2011]

        § 302-12.114   What policies must we establish when offering our employees the services of a RSC?

#### § § 302-12.114

        If you choose to offer the services of a RSC to your employees, you must establish policies governing:

        (a) The conditions under which you will authorize an employee to use the contract with the RSC;

        (b) Which employees you will allow to use the contract with the RSC;

        (c) Which services the RSC will provide to the employee;

        (d) Who will determine in each case if an employee may use the contract with the RSC and which services the RSC will provide;

        (e) How you will monitor and evaluate the counseling provided by you and/or the RSC to your employees; and

        (f) How you will monitor and maintain an appropriate balance between the three types of homesale transactions in your homesale programs (appraised value, buyer value option, and amended value).

> [FTR Amdt. 2011-01, 76 FR 18344, Apr. 1, 2011]

        § 302-12.115   What are the income tax consequences that we must consider when offering relocation services?

#### § § 302-12.115

        Amounts you pay to a relocation services company on behalf of an employee may be taxable to the employee. In some cases, such as certain homesale programs, the amounts may not be taxable. You must determine the taxability of such payments, and pay a relocation income tax (RIT) allowance in accordance with part 302-17 of this chapter on payments you determine to be taxable to the employee. You may contact the: Assistant Chief Counsel (Income Tax & Accounting), Internal Revenue Service, 1111 Constitution Avenue, NW., Room 5501, Washington, DC 20224, for information on the income tax consequences of payments you make to a relocation services company.

        § 302-12.116   What must we consider in deciding whether to use the fixed-fee or cost-reimbursable contracting method?

#### § § 302-12.116

        You must consider the following factors in deciding whether to use the fixed-fee or cost-reimbursable contracting method:

        (a)  Under a fixed fee contract, the relocation services company bears all risks not expressly contained in the contract. Under a cost-reimbursable contract, you must assume some or all risks and, therefore, must assume some management responsibilities under the contract as well. For example, under a fixed fee homesale program you are not directly liable for losses incurred if a residence does not sell immediately, while under a cost-reimbursable homesale program you assume some or all risks of selling the residence.

        (b)  Under the fixed fee method of contracting, the fee includes a cost component for risks assumed by the relocation services company. Under the cost-reimbursable method of contracting, you are directly responsible for some or all of the costs associated with management of the contract. In deciding whether to use cost-reimbursable contracting you, therefore, must consider the cost of resources you would require (including personnel costs) to manage a cost-reimbursable relocation services contract.

        (c)  You must obligate funds for a relocation in the fiscal year in which the purchase order is awarded under the contract. Under the fixed fee contracting method, the amount of the relocation services fee is fixed and you have a basis for determining the amount of funds to obligate. Under the cost-reimbursable contracting method, you must obligate funds based on an estimate of the costs that will be incurred. When opting for cost-reimbursable contracting you, therefore, should establish a reliable method of computing fund obligation estimates.

        § 302-12.117   May we take title to an employee's residence?

#### § § 302-12.117

        No, you may not take title to an employee's residence except as specifically provided by statute. The statutes which form the basis for the provisions of this part do not provide such authority.

> [FTR Amdt. 98, 66 FR 58196, Nov. 20, 2001. Redesignated by FTR Amdt. 2011-01, 76 FR 18344, Apr. 1, 2011]

        § 302-12.118   Under a homesale program, may we establish a maximum home value above which we will not pay for homesale services?

#### § § 302-12.118

        Yes, if a home exceeding the maximum value above which you will not pay is sold under your homesale program, the employee will be responsible for any additional costs. You must establish a maximum amount commensurate with your agency's experience. You may consider, among other factors, budgetary constraints, the value range of homes in areas where you have offices, and the value range of homes previously entered in your program.

> [FTR Amdt. 98, 66 FR 58196, Nov. 20, 2001. Redesignated by FTR Amdt. 2011-01, 76 FR 18344, Apr. 1, 2011]

        § 302-12.119   Under a home sale program, may we pay an employee for losses the employee incurs on the sale of a residence?

#### § § 302-12.119

        No, under a home sale program, you may not pay an employee for losses the employee incurs on the sale of a residence, but this does not preclude you reimbursing a relocation services company for losses incurred while the contractor holds the property.

        § 302-12.120   Under a home sale program, may we direct the relocation services company to pay an employee more than the fair market value of the employee's residence?

#### § § 302-12.120

        No, under a home sale program, you may not direct the relocation services company to pay an employee more than the fair market value (as determined by the residence appraisal process) of the employee's home.

> [FTR Case 2022-05, 89 FR 12256, Feb. 16, 2024]

        § 302-12.121   May we use a relocation services contract for services which we are contractually bound to obtain under another travel services contract?

#### § § 302-12.121

        No, you may not use a relocation services contract to which you are contractually bound to obtain the services of another relocation service provider or to circumvent the travel and transportation expense payment system contract if you are a user of that contract.

    PART 302-14—HOME MARKETING INCENTIVE PAYMENTS

### Part 302

**Authority:** Authority: 5 U.S.C. 5756.

**Source:** Source: FTR Amdt. 98, 66 FR 58196, Nov. 20, 2001, unless otherwise noted.

      Subpart A—Payment of Incentive to the Employee

        § 302-14.1   What is a “homesale program'?

#### § § 302-14.1

        A “homesale program” is a program offered by an agency through a contractual arrangement with a relocation services company. The relocation services company purchases a transferred employee's residence at fair market (appraised) value and then independently markets and sells the residence.

        § 302-14.2   What is the purpose of a home marketing incentive payment?

#### § § 302-14.2

        The purpose of a home marketing incentive payment is to reduce the Government's relocation costs by encouraging transferred employees to participate in their employing agency's homesale program to independently and aggressively market, and find a bona fide buyer for their residence. This significantly reduces the fees/expenses their agencies must pay to relocation services companies and effectively lowers the cost of such programs.

        § 302-14.3   Am I eligible to receive a home marketing incentive payment?

#### § § 302-14.3

        Yes, you are eligible to receive a home marketing incentive payment if you are an employee who is authorized to transfer and you otherwise meet requirements for sale of your residence at Government expense.

        § 302-14.4   Must my agency pay me a home marketing incentive?

#### § § 302-14.4

        No, your agency determines when it is in the Government's interest to offer you a home marketing incentive.

        § 302-14.5   Under what circumstances will I receive a home marketing incentive payment?

#### § § 302-14.5

        You will receive a home marketing incentive payment when:

        (a) You enter your residence in your agency's homesale program;

        (b) You independently and aggressively market your residence;

        (c) You find a bona fide buyer for your residence as a result of your independent marketing efforts;

        (d) You transfer the residence to the relocation services company;

        (e) Your agency pays a reduced fee/expenses to the relocation services company as a result of your independent marketing efforts;

        (f) You meet any additional conditions your agency has established, including but not limited to, mandatory marketing periods, list price guidelines, closing requirements, and residence value caps; and

        (g) Your agency has established a home marketing incentive program.

        § 302-14.6   How much may my agency pay me for a home marketing incentive?

#### § § 302-14.6

        Your agency will determine the amount of your home marketing incentive payment. The incentive payment, however, may not exceed the lesser of:

        (a) Five percent of the price the relocation services company paid when it purchased the residence from you; or

        (b) The savings your agency realized from the reduced fee/expenses it paid as a result of you finding a bona fide buyer.

        § 302-14.7   Are there tax consequences when I receive a home marketing incentive payment?

#### § § 302-14.7

        Yes, the home marketing incentive payment is considered income. Consequently, you will be taxed, and your agency will withhold income and employment taxes, on the home marketing incentive payment. You will not, however, receive a withholding tax allowance (WTA) to offset the withholding on your home marketing incentive payment, nor will you receive a relocation income tax (RIT) allowance payment for substantially all of your Federal, state and local income taxes on the incentive payment.

      Subpart B—Agency Responsibilities

        § 302-14.100   How should we administer our home marketing incentive payment program?

#### § § 302-14.100

        Your goal in using an incentive payment program is to reduce your overall relocation costs. You must not make a home marketing incentive payment that exceeds the savings you realize from the reduced fees/expenses you pay the relocation services company.

        § 302-14.101   What policies must we establish to govern our home marketing incentive payment program?

#### § § 302-14.101

        You must establish policies to govern:

        (a) The conditions under which you will authorize a home marketing incentive payment for an employee;

        (b) The amount of the home marketing incentive payment(s) you will offer (or) the method you will use to compute your home marketing incentive payments); and

        (c) Who will determine in each case whether a home marketing incentive payment is authorized.

        § 302-14.102   What factors should we consider in determining whether to establish a home marketing incentive payment program?

#### § § 302-14.102

        In determining whether to establish a home marketing incentive payment program, you should consider:

        (a) Whether the program will increase the percentage of residences sold for which employees find a bona fide buyer. You should establish a benchmark for the percentage of residences for which you expect employees to find a bona fide buyer resulting in lower homesale costs to you. If your historical percentage of employee-generated sales is below your benchmark, a home marketing incentive payment program may benefit you; and

        (b) The expected net savings from a home marketing incentive payment program.

        § 302-14.103   What factors should we consider in determining the amount of a home marketing incentive payment?

#### § § 302-14.103

        In determining the amount of a home marketing incentive payment, you should consider the:

        (a) Amount of savings from reduced fee/expenses paid to the relocation services company. The home marketing incentive payment program is intended to reduce your relocation costs. The amount of each home marketing incentive payment you make, therefore, must not exceed the savings you realize from the reduced fee you pay to the relocation services company; and

        (b) Employee's efforts in marketing the residence. The purpose of a home marketing incentive payment program is to encourage a transferred employee who participates in a homesale program to independently and aggressively market the employee's residence and find a bona fide buyer.

      Subpart A—General Rules for the Employee

        § 302-15.1   What are property management services?

#### § § 302-15.1

        “Property management services” are programs provided by private companies for a fee, which help an employee to manage the employee's residence at the old official station as a rental property. These services typically include, but are not limited to, obtaining a tenant, negotiating the lease, inspecting the property regularly, managing repairs and maintenance, enforcing lease terms, collecting the rent, paying the mortgage and other carrying expenses from rental proceeds and/or funds of the employee, and accounting for the transactions and providing periodic reports to the employee.

        § 302-15.2   What are the purposes of the property management services allowance?

#### § § 302-15.2

        The purposes of the property management services allowance are to:

        (a) Reduce overall Government relocation costs by using the property management services allowance in place of allowances for the sale of the employee's residence; and

        (b) Relieve employees transferred to OCONUS duty stations from the costs of maintaining a home in CONUS during their tour of duty.

#### § § 302-15.3

        Yes, you are eligible for payment for property management services when:

        (a) You transfer in the interest of the Government; and

        (b) You and/or a member(s) of your immediate family hold(s) title to a residence which you are eligible to sell at Government expense under part 302-11 or part 302-12 of this chapter.

        § 302-15.4   Who is not eligible for payment for property management services?

#### § § 302-15.4

        New appointees, employees assigned under the Government Employees Training Act (5 U.S.C. 4109), and employees transferring wholly outside the United States are not eligible for payment for property management services. However, relocations wholly outside the United States do not affect previously authorized property management services as long as the employee continues to meet the requirements of § 302-15.6 and any other conditions established by the agency.

        § 302-15.5   Is my agency required to authorize payment for property management services?

#### § § 302-15.5

        No, your agency is not required to authorize payment for property management services. However, your agency determines:

        (a) When you meet the conditions set forth in § 302-15.3;

        (b) When to authorize payment for these services; and

        (c) What procedures you must follow when it authorizes such payment.

        § 302-15.6   Under what circumstances may my agency authorize payment under this part?

#### § § 302-15.6

        (a) For a relocation to an official station in the United States, your agency may authorize payment under this part when:

        (1) You are being returned from a foreign area post of duty to a different official station than the one from which you were transferred for your foreign tour of duty;

        (2) Your agency has determined that property management services is more advantageous and cost effective for the Government than having to sell your residence;

        (3) You have signed a service agreements; and

        (4) You meet any additional conditions that your agency has established.

        (b) For relocations to official stations outside the United States, your agency will authorize payment under this part when you meet conditions set forth in paragraphs (a)(3) and (4) of this section.

        § 302-15.7   For what property may my agency authorize payment under this part?

#### § § 302-15.7

        Under this part, payment may be authorized only for your residence at the last official station in the United States from which you transferred.

        § 302-15.8   When my agency authorizes payment for me under this part, am I obligated to use such services, or may I elect instead to sell my residence at Government expense?

#### § § 302-15.8

        You are not obligated to use your authorized property management services allowance. You have the option of choosing to sell your residence at Government expense or to use the property management services allowance.

        § 302-15.9   Must I repay property management expenses my agency paid under this part if I elect to sell my former residence in the United States at Government expense when I am transferred from my current foreign post of duty to an official station in the United States other than the one I left?

#### § § 302-15.9

        No, you are not required to repay any property management expenses paid by your agency if you elect to sell your former residence in the United States when transferred from your post of duty to an official station in the United States. The authority for your agency to pay for property management services under this part when you are transferred to a foreign post of duty arises from your transfer to the foreign post of duty. It is separate from, and in addition to, the authority to sell your residence at Government expense when you are transferred to an official station in the United States other than the official station from which you were transferred to the foreign post of duty.

        § 302-15.10   How long may my agency pay for property management services under this part?

#### § § 302-15.10

        The length of time your agency may pay for property management services under this part depends on the type of transfer.

        (a) If you transfer within the United States, your agency may pay for a period not to exceed one year from your effective date of transfer, with up to a 1-year extension, under the same conditions required in § 302-11.21 of this chapter.

        (b) If you transfer to a foreign area post of duty, including successive foreign area tours of duty for which you signed a new service agreement (see § 302-15.4), your agency may pay from your effective date of transfer until you return to the last official station in the United States from which you transferred.

        (c) If you transfer from a foreign area post of duty, including successive foreign area tours of duty for which you signed a new service agreement (see § 302-15.4), to a different official station in the United States than the one from which you were transferred from for your foreign area tour of duty (see § 302-15.6), your agency may pay for a period not to exceed one year from your effective date of transfer to the US, with up to a 1-year extension, under the same conditions required in § 302-11.21 of this chapter.

        (d) If you transfer to a foreign area post of duty, complete your service agreement, and remain there without signing a new service agreement, your agency may pay from the effective date of your transfer to when your service agreement is completed.

        (e) If you transfer to a foreign area post of duty and separate from Government service before completing your service agreement, your agency may pay from the effective date of your transfer to the date of your separation.

        (f) If you transfer within the United States or from a foreign area post of duty to a different official station in the United States than the one from which you were transferred for your foreign area tour of duty, and you separate from Government service before the time periods stated in paragraphs (a) and (c) of this section, your agency may pay from the effective date of your transfer to the date of your separation.

#### § § 302-16.101

        You should limit payment of miscellaneous expenses to only those expenses that are necessary.

        § 302-16.102   Are there any restrictions to the types of costs we may cover?

        § 302-17.2   Why does relocation affect personal income taxes?

#### § § 302-17.2

        When you are relocated from one permanent duty station to another, you are reimbursed by your employing agency for certain expenses. The IRC requires that you report many of these relocation benefits, including some that your agency pays on your behalf, as taxable income. When you receive taxable benefits, you must pay income tax on the amount or value of those benefits. However, 5 U.S.C. 5724b also requires that your agency reimburse you for substantially all of the additional Federal, state, and local income taxes you incur as a result of any taxable relocation benefits. A reimbursement for taxes is also a taxable benefit on which you must pay additional taxes.

        § 302-17.3   What is the Government's objective in reimbursing the additional income taxes incurred as a result of a relocation?

#### § § 302-17.3

        The Government's objective is to reimburse employees or individuals eligible for relocation expense allowances under § 302-1.1 of this chapter for substantially all (not exactly all—see § 302-17.4) of the additional Federal, state, and local income taxes incurred as a result of a relocation, including the taxes on the taxable relocation benefits and the taxes on the reimbursement for taxes.

> [FTR Amdt. 2014-01, 79 FR 49645, Aug. 21, 2014, as amended at 86 FR 73684, Dec. 28, 2021]

        § 302-17.4   Why is the reimbursement for substantially all, and not exactly all, of the additional income taxes incurred as a result of a relocation?

#### § § 302-17.4

        Because of the complexity of the calculations, which involve not only Federal income tax but also the income tax rates of many states and localities, it is not reasonable for the Government to compute the exact impact of relocation on an affected employee's taxes. Making a good faith effort to reimburse substantially all additional income taxes is sufficient. The statute where this appears, at 5 U.S.C. 5724b does not define substantially all. This Part provides the description through its provisions.

        § 302-17.5   Who is eligible for the WTA and the RITA?

#### § § 302-17.5

        The withholding tax allowance (WTA) and the relocation income tax allowance (RITA) are the two allowances through which the Government reimburses you for substantially all of the income taxes that you incur as a result of your relocation. You are eligible for the WTA and the RITA if you are relocating in the interest of the Government, and your agency's reimbursements to you for relocation expenses result in you being liable for additional income taxes. Eligibility for WTA and RITA includes, among others, transferred employees, appointments (new or political), assignments under the Government Employees Training Act, and those returning from an overseas assignment for the purpose of separation from Government service.

> [FTR Amdt. 2014-01, 79 FR 49645, Aug. 21, 2014, as amended by FTR Amdt. 2020-02, 84 FR 64782, Nov. 25, 2019; 86 FR 73684, Dec. 28, 2021]

        § 302-17.6   Is there any circumstance under which the WTA and the RITA are not paid even though I would otherwise be eligible?

#### § § 302-17.6

        If you violate the 12-month service agreement under which you are relocated, your agency will not pay the WTA or the RITA to you, and you must repay any relocation benefits paid prior to the violation.

        § 302-17.7   What limitations and Federal income tax treatments apply to various relocation reimbursements?

#### § § 302-17.7

        (a) Some relocation expenses reimbursed to you or paid directly by the Government on or after January 1, 2018, and on or before December 31, 2025, must be reported as income and you cannot claim them as deductible expenses on your Federal tax return.

        (b) A table summarizing the FTR allowances, limitations, and tax treatment of each reimbursement, allowance, or direct payment to a service provider or vendor is published at  The table also cites relevant FTR paragraphs for details. GSA will revise the table to reflect any changes as quickly as possible; however, users of this part may wish to consult with a tax advisor to determine what limitations and Federal income tax treatments apply to your relocation reimbursement(s).

        § 302-17.8   Who is responsible for knowing which relocation expenses are taxable and which expenses are nontaxable?

#### § § 302-17.8

        Both you and your agency must know which reimbursements and direct payments to vendors are taxable and which are nontaxable in your specific circumstances. When you submit a voucher for reimbursement, your agency must determine whether the reimbursement is taxable income at the Federal, state, and/or local level. Then, when you file your income tax returns, you must report the taxable allowances, reimbursements, and direct payments to vendors as income. Your agency is ultimately responsible for calculating and reporting withholding accurately and you are ultimately responsible for filing your taxes correctly.

        § 302-17.9   Which expenses should I report on my state tax returns if I am required to file returns in two different states?

#### § § 302-17.9

        In most cases, your state tax return for the state you are leaving should reflect your reimbursement or allowance, if any, for househunting expenses and your reimbursement or direct payments to vendors for real estate expenses at the home you are leaving. All other taxable expenses should be shown as income on the tax return you file in the state into which you have moved. However, you and your agency must carefully study the rules in both states and include everything that each state considers to be income on each of your state tax returns.

        § 302-17.12   How are taxes on extended TDY benefits and taxes on relocation allowances related?

#### § § 302-17.12

        (a) Taxes on extended TDY benefits are computed using exactly the same processes described in this Part for the WTA and RITA except that:

        (1) The tax process for extended TDY benefits uses the term “withholding tax allowance” (WTA) in exactly the same fashion as the process for taxes on relocation allowances; however, in place of the term “relocation income tax allowance,” the tax process for extended TDY benefits uses the term “extended TDY tax reimbursement allowance” (ETTRA); and

        (2) All benefits are taxable under extended TDY, so the sections of this Part that discuss which benefits are taxable and which are not have no relevance to ETTRA.

        (b) See part 301-11, subpart F of this title for additional information about taxes on extended TDY benefits.

      Subpart B—The Withholding Tax Allowance (WTA)

        § 302-17.20   What is the purpose of the WTA?

#### § § 302-17.20

        The purpose of the WTA is to protect you from having to use part of your relocation expense reimbursements to pay Federal income tax withholding; it does not cover state taxes, local taxes, Medicare taxes, or Social Security taxes (see § 302-17.22(c) and (d)).

        § 302-17.21   What relocation expenses does the WTA cover?

#### § § 302-17.21

        The WTA covers certain allowances, reimbursements, and/or direct payments to vendors, to the extent that each of them is taxable income. In particular, the WTA covers:

        (a) En route lodging, meals and incidental expenses—Reimbursements for lodging, meals and incidental expenses while en route to the new official station for you and your immediate family member(s). (See part 302-4 of this chapter).

        (b) Transportation—Transportation expenses, to include commercial air or privately owned vehicle, for you and your immediate family member(s) transferred between official stations. (See part 302-4 of this chapter).

        (c) Househunting trip—Travel (including per diem and transportation) expenses for you and/or your spouse for a round trip to the new official station to seek permanent residence quarters. Househunting is covered regardless of whether reimbursed under the per diem allowance or lump sum method. (See part 302-5 of this chapter).

        (d) Temporary quarters—Subsistence expenses for you and your immediate family during occupancy of temporary quarters at the old or new official station. Temporary quarters are covered regardless of whether reimbursed under the lodgings-plus, actual expense, or lump sum method. (See part 302-6 of this chapter).

        (e) Transportation and temporary storage of personal property—Transportation and temporary storage of household goods (HHG) and at Government expense for employees who transferred between official stations. (See part 302-7 of this chapter).

        (f) Extended storage—Extended storage of household goods for a temporary change of station in CONUS or assignment to an isolated duty station in CONUS. (See part 302-8 of this chapter).

        (g) Transportation of privately owned vehicle—Transportation of a privately owned vehicle at Government expense for employees who transferred between official stations in CONUS. (See part 302-9 of this chapter).

        (h) Transportation of mobile homes and boats used as a primary residence—Expenses for transportation of a mobile home or boat in lieu of transportation of household goods to the new official station. (See part 302-10 of this chapter).

        (i) Real estate—Expenses for the sale of the residence at your old official station and/or purchase of a home at your new official station, when reimbursement is made directly to you. This can also include expenses for settling an unexpired lease (“breaking” a lease) at your old official station. (See part 302-11 of this chapter. If you or a member of your immediate family do not hold full title to the home you are selling or buying, see § 302-11.103 of this chapter).

        (j) Relocation services company—Expenses paid by a relocation services company to the extent such payments constitute taxable income to the employee. The extent to which such payments constitute taxable income varies according to the individual circumstances of your relocation, and by the state and locality in which you reside. (See appropriate state and local tax authorities for additional information). (See also part 302-12 of this chapter).

        (k) Property Management Services—Payment for the services of a property manager for renting rather than selling a residence at your old official station. (See part 302-15 of this chapter).

        (l) Miscellaneous expense allowance—Miscellaneous expenses for defraying certain relocation expenses not covered by other relocation benefits. (See part 302-16 of this chapter).

        § 302-17.22   What relocation expenses does the WTA not cover?

#### § § 302-17.22

        The WTA does not cover the following relocation expenses:

        (a) Any reimbursement, allowance, or direct payment to a vendor that should not be reported as taxable income when you file your Federal tax return; this includes but is not limited to expenses for transportation of POVs for OCONUS assignments.

        (b) Reimbursed expenses for extended storage of household goods during an OCONUS assignment, if reimbursement is permitted under your agency's policy.

        (c) State and local withholding tax obligations. To the extent that your state or local tax authority requires periodic (such as quarterly) tax payments, you are responsible to pay these from your own funds. Your agency reimburses you for substantially all of these payments through the RITA process, but your agency does not provide a WTA for them. If required to by state or local law, your agency may withhold these from your reimbursement.

        (d) Additional taxes due under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act including Social Security tax, if applicable, and Medicare tax. Current law does not allow Federal agencies to reimburse transferees for these employment taxes on relocation benefits. However, your agency will deduct for these taxes from your reimbursements for taxable items.

        (e) Home marketing incentive payment. In accordance with FTR part 302-14, your agency may not provide you either a WTA or RITA for this incentive.

        (f) Any recruitment, relocation, or retention incentive payment that you receive. Any withholding of taxes for such payments is outside the scope of this regulation. Rather, it is covered by regulations issued by the Office of Personnel Management, Treasury's Financial Management Service, and the IRS.

        (g) Any allowances, reimbursements, and/or direct payments to vendors not related to your relocation; for example, a reimbursement for office supplies would not be covered by the WTA, even if it occurred during your relocation.

> [FTR Amdt. 2014-01, 79 FR 49645, Aug. 21, 2014, as amended by FTR Amdt. 2020-02, 84 FR 64782, Nov. 25, 2019]

        § 302-17.23   What are the procedures for my WTA?

#### § § 302-17.23

        (a) Your agency prepares a relocation travel authorization, which includes an estimate of the WTA and RITA, to obligate funds for your relocation.

        (b) Your agency pays certain allowances to you. Your agency also pays vendors directly for other relocation expenses.

        (c) Your agency instructs you as to whether to submit one voucher after you have completed your relocation or to submit vouchers at various points as your relocation progresses plus another when your relocation is completed.

        (d) You submit your voucher(s) for reimbursement of certain relocation expenses.

        (e) Your agency determines the extent to which each allowance, each item on your voucher(s), and each direct payment to a vendor is nontaxable or is taxable income to you under the IRC.

        (f) For the taxable items, your agency calculates your WTA and any reimbursement(s) due to you in accordance with § 302-17.24. Your agency sets aside the amount of your WTA and pays the IRS as a withholding tax in accordance with IRS requirements.

        § 302-17.24   How does my agency compute my WTA?

#### § § 302-17.24

        Each time your agency pays a covered, taxable relocation expense, regardless of whether it is a reimbursement, allowance, or direct payment to a vendor, it is considered “supplemental wages” as defined in 26 CFR 31.3402(g)-1(a) (see also IRS Publication 15, Employer's Tax Guide). You owe taxes on the WTA itself because, like most other relocation allowances, it is taxable income. To reimburse you for the taxes on the WTA itself, your agency computes the WTA by using the grossed-up withholding formula below and the appropriate supplemental wage rate, as specified in IRS Publication 15. This rate, along with examples of how to calculate the WTA, is published in an FTR bulletin available at . The formula for calculating the WTA is:

        Where R is the withholding rate for supplemental wages.

> [FTR Amdt. 2020-02, 84 FR 64782, Nov. 25, 2019]

      Subpart C—The Relocation Income Tax Allowance (RITA)

        § 302-17.30   What is the purpose of the RITA?

#### § § 302-17.30

        (a) The purpose of the RITA is to reimburse you for any taxes that you owe that were not adequately reimbursed by the WTA. As discussed in § 302-17.24, the WTA calculation is based on the income tax withholding rate applicable to supplemental wages. This may be higher or lower than your actual tax rate. The RITA, on the other hand, is based on your marginal tax rate, determined by your actual taxable income and filing status, which allows your agency to reimburse you for  of your Federal income taxes. The RITA also reimburses you for any additional state and local taxes that you incur as a result of your relocation, because they are not reimbursed in the WTA process.

        (b) The WTA may be optional to you. See § 302-17.61 for a discussion of criteria for choosing whether or not to accept the WTA. See §§ 302-17.62 through 302-17.69 for procedures if you choose not to accept the WTA.

> [FTR Amdt. 2014-01, 79 FR 49645, Aug. 21, 2014, as amended by FTR Amdt. 2020-02, 84 FR 64783, Nov. 25, 2019]

        § 302-17.31   What are the procedures for calculation and payment of my RITA?

#### § § 302-17.31

        The procedures for the calculation and payment of your RITA depend on whether your agency has chosen to use a one-year or two-year RITA process. See Subpart F for the one-year process and Subpart G for the two-year process.

        § 302-17.32   Who chooses the one-year or two-year process?

#### § § 302-17.32

        Your agency or a major component of your agency determines whether it will adopt a one-year or two-year RITA process. Your agency may use the one-year RITA process for one or more specific categories of employees and the two-year process for one or more other categories.

        § 302-17.33   May I ask my agency to recalculate my RITA?

#### § § 302-17.33

        (a) Yes, you may ask your agency to recalculate your RITA provided you filed your “Statement of Income and Tax Filing Status,” and amended it, if necessary, in a timely manner. If, once you have completed all Federal, state, and local tax returns, you believe that your RITA should have been significantly different from the RITA that your agency calculated, you may ask your agency to recalculate your RITA. This is true for either the one-year or two-year process. With any request for recalculation, you must submit a statement explaining why you believe your RITA was incorrect.

        (b) Please note that your agency may require that you also submit an amended “Statement of Income and Tax Filing Status” (if, for example, you inadvertently did not report some of your income in your original Statement), your actual tax returns, or both, as attachments to your request for recalculation.

      Subpart D—The Combined Marginal Tax Rate (CMTR)

        § 302-17.40   How does my agency calculate my CMTR?

#### § § 302-17.40

        (a) The CMTR is a key element that greatly enhances the accuracy of the calculation of your RITA. Your agency uses the information on your “Statement of Income and Tax Filing Status,” as amended, to determine your CMTR, as follows (see subparts F and G of this part for information about the “Statement of Income and Tax Filing Status”).

        (b) The CMTR is, in essence, a combination of your Federal, state, and local tax rates. However, the CMTR cannot be calculated by merely adding the Federal, state, and local marginal tax rates together because of the deductibility of state and local income taxes from income on your Federal income tax return. The formula prescribed below for calculating the CMTR, therefore, is designed to adjust the state and local tax rates to compensate for their deductibility from income for Federal tax purposes. Examples of how to calculate the CMTR are published in an FTR bulletin available at .

        (c) The formula for calculating the CMTR is:

        (d) Your agency finds the Federal marginal tax rate by comparing your taxable income, as shown in your “Statement of Income and Filing Status,” to the Federal tax tables in the current year's Form 1040-ES instructions (see §§ 302-17.50—302-17.53 and §§ 302-17.63—302-17.65 for additional information on the “Statement of Income and Tax Filing Status”).

        (e) Your agency finds the state and local marginal tax rates that apply to you (if any) by comparing your taxable income to the most current state and/or local tax tables provided by the states and localities. Every Federal payroll office and every provider of tax calculation software has these tables readily available, and the tables are also available on the Web sites of the various state and local taxing authorities.

> [FTR Amdt. 2014-01, 79 FR 49645, Aug. 21, 2014, as amended by FTR Amdt. 2020-02, 84 FR 64783, Nov. 25, 2019]

        § 302-17.41   Is there any difference in the procedures for calculating the CMTR, depending on whether my agency chooses the one-year or two-year RITA process?

#### § § 302-17.41

        No. The procedures for calculating the CMTR are the same for the one-year and two-year RITA processes.

        § 302-17.42   Which state marginal tax rate(s) does my agency use to calculate the CMTR if I incur tax liability in more than one state, and how does this affect my RITA and my state tax return(s)?

#### § § 302-17.42

        If two or more states that are involved in your relocation impose an income tax on relocation benefits, then your relocation benefits may be taxed by both states. Most commonly, your old and new duty stations are in the two states involved. The following table lays out the possibilities:

        § 302-17.43   What local marginal tax rate(s) does my agency use?

#### § § 302-17.43

        (a) If you incur local tax liability, you provide the applicable marginal tax rate(s) on your “Statement of Income and Tax Filing Status”. Your agency validates the applicable local marginal tax rate(s) and uses it (them) in the CMTR formula.

        (b) If you incur local income tax liability in more than one locality, then your agency should follow the rules described for state income taxes in § 302-17.42 to calculate the local marginal tax rate that will be used in the CMTR formula and to compute your RITA, and you should follow the rules in § 302-17.42 to determine your actions.

        (c) If a locality in which you incur income tax liability publishes its tax rates in terms of a percentage of your Federal or state taxes, then your agency must convert that tax rate to a percentage of your income to use it in computing your CMTR. This is accomplished by multiplying the applicable Federal or state tax rate by the applicable local tax rate. For example, if the state marginal tax rate is 6 percent and the local tax rate is 50 percent of state income tax liability, the local marginal tax rate stated as a percentage of taxable income would be 3 percent.

        § 302-17.44   What if I incur income tax liability to the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico?

#### § § 302-17.44

        A Federal employee who is relocated to or from a point, or between points, in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico may be subject to income tax by both the Federal Government and the government of Puerto Rico. However, under current Puerto Rico law, an employee receives a credit on their Puerto Rico income tax for the amount of taxes paid to the Federal Government. Therefore:

        (a) If the applicable Puerto Rico marginal tax rate, as shown in the tables provided by the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, is  than the applicable Federal marginal tax rate, then your agency uses the Federal marginal tax rates and the formula in § 302-17.40(c) in calculating your CMTR.

        (b) If the applicable Puerto Rico marginal tax rate, as shown in the tables provided by the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, is  than the applicable Federal marginal tax rate, and if all of the states involved either have no income tax or  an adjustment or credit for income taxes paid to the other state(s) and Puerto Rico, then your agency uses the rate for Puerto Rico in place of the Federal marginal tax rate in the formula in § 302-17.40(c).

        (c) If the applicable Puerto Rico marginal tax rate, as shown in the tables provided by the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, is  than the applicable Federal marginal tax rate and one or more of the state(s) involved  an adjustment or credit for income taxes paid to the other state(s) and/or Puerto Rico, then your agency uses the formula below:

> [FTR Amdt. 2014-01, 79 FR 49645, Aug. 21, 2014, as amended by FTR Case 2022-05, 89 FR 12256, Feb. 16, 2024]

        § 302-17.45   What if I incur income tax liability to the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands or any other territory or possession of the United States?

#### § § 302-17.45

        If you are relocated to, from, or within the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands or any territory or possession of the United States that is covered by the definition in § 302-17.1, your agency will have to determine the tax rules of that locality and then include those taxes in your RITA calculation, as applicable.

      Subpart E—Special Procedure If a State Treats an Expense as Taxable Even Though It Is Nontaxable Under the Federal IRC

        § 302-17.46   What does my agency do if a state treats an expense as taxable even though it is nontaxable under the Federal IRC?

#### § § 302-17.46

        If one or more of the states where you have incurred tax liability for relocation expenses treats one or more relocation expenses as taxable, even though it (they) are nontaxable under Federal tax rules, you may be required to pay additional state income tax when you file tax returns with those states. In this case, your agency calculates a state gross-up to cover the additional tax liability resulting from the covered relocation expense reimbursement(s) that are nontaxable under Federal, but not state tax rules. Your agency calculates the state gross-up and then adds that amount to your RITA. Your agency will use this formula to calculate the state gross-up:

        “N” is determined as follows:

        1. Take the dollar amount of reimbursements, allowances, and direct payments to vendors treated as nontaxable under Federal tax rules.

        2. Subtract the dollar amount of reimbursements, allowances, and direct payments to vendors treated as nontaxable by the state.

        3. The difference represents “N.”

      Subpart F—The One-Year RITA Process

        § 302-17.50   What information should I provide to my agency to make the RITA calculation possible under the one-year process?

#### § § 302-17.50

        You should provide the information required in the “Statement of Income and Tax Filing Status” as follows:

        § 302-17.51   When should I file my “Statement of Income and Tax Filing Status” under the one-year process?

#### § § 302-17.51

        For the one-year process, you should file this form as soon as you receive your relocation orders, or as soon as you file your tax returns for the most recent tax year, whichever occurs later.

        § 302-17.52   When should I file an amended “Statement of Income and Tax Filing Status” under the one-year process?

#### § § 302-17.52

        You should submit an amended “Statement of Income and Tax Filing Status” to your agency under the one-year process whenever the information on it changes, and you should continue to amend it until you have received the last W-2 from your agency in connection with a specific relocation. In particular, you should file an amended version of this statement whenever:

        (a) Your filing status changes;

        (b) Your income changes enough that your income, including WTA and RITA, might put you into a different tax bracket; or

        (c) You have taxable relocation expenses in a second or third calendar year.

        § 302-17.53   What happens if I do not file and amend the “Statement of Income and Tax Filing Status” in a timely manner?

#### § § 302-17.53

        If you don't file the “Statement of Income and Tax Filing Status” and/or amend it when necessary, your agency will switch to the 2-year process, and because the WTA is an advance of your income tax expenses, you will be liable to repay the full amount of the WTA that your agency has paid to the IRS. See subpart G of this part.

        § 302-17.54   How does my agency calculate my RITA under the one-year process?

#### § § 302-17.54

        (a) Your agency provides allowances to you, reimburses you for vouchers that you submit, and pays certain relocation vendors directly, all during the calendar year as described in subpart B of this part. Some of these reimbursements, allowances, and direct payments to vendors are taxable income to you, the employee, as described in subpart A of this part. Your agency computes a WTA and reports the WTA to the IRS as taxes withheld for you for each of these taxable reimbursements, allowances, and direct payments to vendors. The WTA may be optional to you. However, if your agency is using a one-year RITA process, there is no advantage to you in choosing not to receive the WTA, because your agency will adjust the WTA payment to the IRS. See § 302-17.55(a)(1).

        (b) Your agency establishes a cutoff date (for example, December 1), after which it will not issue reimbursements or allowances to you or make direct payments to relocation vendors for the rest of the calendar year.

        (c) If the information on your “Statement of Income and Tax Filing Status” changes after you have submitted the initial version, you must submit an amended “Statement of Income and Tax Filing Status” no later than your agency's cutoff date.

        (d) During the period between the cutoff date and the end of the calendar year, your agency calculates your RITA.

        (e) Your RITA is itself taxable income to you. To account for taxes on the RITA, your agency will gross-up your RITA by using a gross-up formula that multiplies the grossed-up CMTR by the total of all covered taxable relocation benefits, and then subtracts your grossed-up WTA from that total. That is:

        § 302-17.55   What does my agency do once it has calculated my RITA under the one-year process?

#### § § 302-17.55

        (a) Your RITA is likely to be different from the sum of the WTA computed and reported during the year, because the WTA is calculated using a flat rate, established by the IRC, while the RITA is calculated using the CMTR. Therefore:

        (1) If the calculation above results in a negative value (that is, if your agency's calculation shows that it withheld and reported too much money as WTA), then your agency will send an adjustment to the IRS using Form 941. In this case, your agency does not make a RITA payment to you because you do not need additional funds to pay your taxes. That is, everything you need to pay substantially all of your taxes was included in the adjusted WTA, and that is the amount that will appear on your Form W-2.

        (2) If the calculation above results in a positive value (that is if your agency's calculation shows that it did not withhold enough money for your income taxes), then your agency will pay your RITA to you before the end of the calendar year and report it to the IRS as part of your income for that year.

        (b) Shortly after the end of the calendar year, your agency will provide one or two W-2 Forms to you. At your agency's discretion, you may receive one W-2 that includes all of your taxable relocation expenses, WTA, and RITA (if any), along with your payroll wages, or you may receive one W-2 for your payroll wages and a separate one for your taxable relocation expenses, WTA, and RITA.

        § 302-17.56   What do I do, under the one-year process, once my agency has provided my W-2(s)?

#### § § 302-17.56

        (a) You must use all W-2(s) that you have received to file your tax returns. On those returns, you must include all taxable relocation expenses shown on your W-2(s) as income, including your WTA and RITA (if any). Please note that you must also include all WTA as withholding, in addition to the standard withholding from your payroll wages.

        (b) If you finished your relocation within one calendar year, and your agency paid all of your relocation reimbursements, allowances, and direct payments to vendors in the same calendar year, before the cutoff date, then your tax returns for that calendar year are the end of your relocation tax process. If, on the other hand, your agency reimburses you for relocation expenses, or pays allowances or relocation vendors on your behalf, during a second (and possibly a third) calendar year, then you and your agency repeat the process above for each of those years.

      Subpart G—The Two-Year RITA Process

        § 302-17.60   How are the terms “Year 1” and “Year 2” used in the two-year RITA process?

#### § § 302-17.60

        (a) Year 1 is the calendar year in which the agency reimburses you for a specific expense, provides an allowance, or pays a vendor directly. If your reimbursements, allowances, and/or direct payments to vendors occur in more than one calendar year, you will have more than one Year 1.

        (b) Year 2 is the calendar year in which you submit your RITA claim and your agency pays your RITA to you.

        (c) In most cases:

        (1) For every Year 1 you will have a corresponding Year 2;

        (2) Every Year 2 immediately follows a Year 1; and

        (3) Year 2 is the year in which you file a tax return reflecting your remaining tax liability for taxable reimbursement(s), allowance(s), and/or direct payments to vendors in each Year 1.

        (a) Yes. If your agency makes the WTA optional to you, you may choose to not receive the WTA.

        (b) When deciding whether or not to receive the WTA, you should consider the following:

        (1) If you expect that your marginal Federal tax rate will be equal to or higher than the supplemental wage rate for the calendar year in which you received the majority of your relocation reimbursements, you may want to elect to receive the WTA.

        (2) If you expect that your marginal Federal tax rate will be less than the supplemental wage rate for the calendar year in which you received the majority of your relocation reimbursements, you may want to decline receiving the WTA to avoid or limit possible overpayment of the WTA, the so-called “negative RITA” situation. In a “negative RITA” situation, you must repay some of the WTA in Year 2. However, even if your marginal Federal tax rate will be less than the supplemental wage rate, you may want to accept the WTA so that your initial reimbursement is larger.

        (3) Examples showing relocation allowances paid by accepting or declining the WTA are published in an FTR bulletin available at .

        § 302-17.62   What information do I put on my tax returns for Year 1 under the two-year process?

#### § § 302-17.62

        (a) Your agency provides allowances to you, reimburses you for vouchers that you submit, and pays certain relocation vendors directly, all during the same calendar year, as described in subpart B of this part. Some of these reimbursements, allowances, and direct payments to vendors are taxable income to you, the employee. Your agency computes a WTA and reports that withholding to the IRS for each of these that is taxable. This is Year 1 of the two-year process.

        (b) If your agency makes the WTA optional to you and you have chosen not to receive the WTA, then your agency computes withholding tax for each taxable reimbursement, allowance, and direct payment, and reports that withholding to the IRS.

        (c) Shortly after the end of the calendar year, your agency provides one or more W-2 forms to you. At its discretion, your agency may include all of your taxable relocation expenses and WTA (if any) in one W-2, along with your regular payroll wages, or it may provide you one W-2 for your regular payroll wages and a separate W-2 for your taxable relocation expenses and WTA (if any).

        (d) At approximately the same time as your agency provides your W-2(s), it also may provide you an itemized list of all relocation benefits and the WTA (if any) for each benefit. You should use this statement to verify that your agency has included all covered taxable items in its calculations and to check your agency's calculations.

        (e) You must submit all W-2s that you have received with your Year 1 tax returns. On those returns, you must include all taxable relocation expenses during the previous year as income. Furthermore, you must include the WTA (if any) as tax payments that your agency made for you during the previous year, in addition to the regular withholding of payroll taxes from your salary.

        § 302-17.63   What information should I provide to my agency to make the RITA calculation possible under the two-year process?

#### § § 302-17.63

        You should provide the information required in the “Statement of Income and Tax Filing Status” shown below. This information should be taken from the income tax returns you filed for Year 1.

        § 302-17.64   When should I file my “Statement of Income and Tax Filing Status” and RITA claim under the two-year process?

#### § § 302-17.64

        For the two-year process, you should file the “Statement of Income and Tax Filing Status” in Year 2, along with your RITA claim, after you file your income tax return. If your agency pays any taxable expenses covered by the WTA (if any) in more than one year, then you will have to file a new “Statement of Income and Tax Filing Status” each year. Your agency establishes the deadline each year for filing of your Statement.

        § 302-17.65   What happens if I do not file the “Statement of Income and Tax Filing Status” in a timely manner?

#### § § 302-17.65

        The WTA is an advance on your income tax expenses, thus if you don't file the “Statement of Income and Tax Filing Status” in a timely manner, your agency will require you to repay the entire amount of the withholding and WTA (if any) that the agency has paid on your behalf.

        § 302-17.66   How do I claim my RITA under the two-year process?

#### § § 302-17.66

        (a) To claim your RITA under the two-year process, you must submit a voucher and attach the “Statement of Income and Tax Filing Status,” as discussed in §§ 302-17.63-302-17.65.

        (b) Your voucher must claim a specific amount. However, your agency will calculate your actual RITA after you submit your RITA voucher and your “Statement of Income and Tax Filing Status;” the amount you claim on your voucher does not enter into that calculation. You should perform the RITA calculation for yourself, as a check on your agency's calculation, but you are not required to put the “right answer” on the voucher you submit to claim your RITA.

        § 302-17.67   How does my agency calculate my RITA under the two-year process?

#### § § 302-17.67

        (a) Your agency calculates your RITA after receipt of your RITA voucher.

        (b) Your RITA is itself taxable income to you. To account for taxes on the RITA, your agency will gross-up your RITA by applying the CMTR to the final amount rather than the reimbursed amount.

        (c) Thus, your agency calculates your RITA by multiplying the Combined Marginal Tax Rate (CMTR) (using the state and local tax tables most current at the time of the RITA calculation) by the total of all covered taxable relocation benefits during the applicable Year 1, and then subtracting your WTA(s), if any, from the same Year 1 from that total. That is:

        § 302-17.68   What does my agency do once it has calculated my RITA under the two-year process?

#### § § 302-17.68

        (a) Your RITA is likely to be different from the sum of the WTA(s) paid during Year 1, if any, because the WTA is calculated using a flat rate, established by the IRC, while the RITA is calculated using the CMTR. Therefore:

        (1) If the RITA calculation in § 302-17.67 results in a negative value (that is, if your agency's calculation shows that it withheld and reported too much money as income taxes), then your agency will report this result to you and will send you a bill for the difference, to repay the excess amount that it sent to the IRS on your behalf as withheld income taxes. The IRS will credit you for the full amount of withheld taxes, including the excess amount, when you file your income tax return for Year 1; therefore, you must repay the excess amount to your agency within 90 days, or within a time period set by your agency. If you are required to repay an amount in Year 2 that was included as wages on your W-2 in Year 1, you may be entitled to a miscellaneous itemized deduction on your Federal income tax return in Year 2. For more information, see IRS Publication 535, “Business Expenses.” If your agency chooses to offer you the choice, then you may want to decline the WTA to avoid this so-called “negative RITA” situation.

        (2) If the RITA calculation in § 302-17.67 results in a positive value (that is, if your agency's calculation shows that it did not withhold enough money as income taxes), then your agency will pay your RITA to you before the end of Year 2 and will report it to the IRS as part of your income for that year. Also, after your agency has paid your RITA to you, it will provide a W-2 that shows your RITA as taxable income to you.

        (b) At your agency's discretion, you may receive one W-2 that includes all of your taxable relocation expenses, WTA (if any), and RITA (if any), along with your regular payroll wages, or you may receive one W-2 for your regular payroll wages and a separate one for your taxable relocation expenses, WTA, and RITA.

        § 302-17.69   How do I pay taxes on my RITA under the two-year process?

#### § § 302-17.69

        When income taxes are due for Year 2, you must report your RITA, if any, as taxable income on your Federal, state, and local tax returns.

        (a) If your relocation process results in only one Year 2, or if the previous year was your last Year 1, your RITA is the only amount that you report as income resulting from your relocation for that Year 2.

        (b) If, on the other hand, your relocation process results in more than one Year 2 (if, for example, you incurred relocation expenses during more than one calendar year), then, except for your last Year 2, you will need to report reimbursements, allowances, direct payments to vendors, and WTA(s), if any, for succeeding Year 1's at the same time that you report each Year 2's RITA.

        (c) See the table in § 302-17.60 for a graphic explanation of Year 1 and Year 2.

      Subpart H—Agency Responsibilities

        § 302-17.100   May we use a relocation services provider to comply with the requirements of this part?

#### § § 302-17.100

        Yes. You may use the services of relocation companies to manage all aspects of relocation, including the RITA computation. Agencies that relocate few employees or do not have the resources to manage the complexity of relocation may find that the use of relocation companies is a practical alternative. As another alternative, agencies with infrequent requirements for relocation or with inadequate internal resources may establish an interagency agreement with one or more other agencies to pool resources to provide this service.

        § 302-17.101   What are our responsibilities with regard to taxes on relocation expenses?

#### § § 302-17.101

        To ensure that all provisions of this Part are fulfilled, you must:

        (a) Prepare a relocation travel authorization that includes an estimate of the WTA and RITA, to obligate the funds that will be needed.

        (b) Determine, in light of the specific circumstances of each employee relocation, which reimbursements, allowances, and direct payments to vendors are taxable, and which are nontaxable.

        (c) Decide whether or not you will allow individual employees and/or categories of employees to choose not to receive the WTA.

        (d) Calculate the WTA, and credit the amount of the WTA to the employee at the time of reimbursement.

        (e) Prepare the employee's W-2 Form(s) and ensure that it (they) reflect(s) the WTA.

        (f) Provide each employee an itemized list of relocation expenses after the end of each calendar year in which you provided an allowance, reimbursement, or direct payment to a vendor.

        (g) Establish processes for identifying the relevant Federal, state, and local marginal tax rates and for keeping that information current.

        (h) Establish processes for identifying states that treat a reimbursement or direct payment to a vendor as taxable even though it is nontaxable under the Federal IRC, and for keeping that information current.

        (i) Calculate the employee's CMTR(s).

        (j) Decide whether you will use the one-year or two-year RITA process and whether you will use different processes (that is, one-year or two-year) for different groups of employees within your agency.

        (k) Make sure the RITA calculation is done correctly and in a timely manner, whether your policies call for the calculation to be done by you or by a third party.

        (l) Make sure that payment of the RITA occurs in a timely manner (this is especially critical for the one-year process).

        (m) Develop criteria for accepting and rejecting requests for recalculation of RITA.

        (n) Establish a process for recalculating the RITA when the employee's request for recalculation is accepted.

        (o) Consult with IRS for clarification of any confusion stemming from taxes on relocation expenses.

        § 302-17.102   What happens if an employee fails to file and/or amend a “Statement of Income and Tax Filing Status” prior to the required date?

#### § § 302-17.102

        (a) If a relocating employee does not file and/or amend a “Statement of Income and Tax Filing Status” prior to the required date, and you are using a one-year RITA process, you are to switch to a two-year RITA process and send a written warning to the employee reminding them of the requirement and informing them that if they do not submit the “Statement of Income and Tax Filing Status,” you may declare the entire amount of the WTA forfeited.

        (b) If the relocating employee does not file and/or amend a Statement of Income and Tax Filing Status prior to the required date, and you are using a two-year RITA process, you are to send the employee a written warning informing them they have 60 days to file or amend their “Statement of Income and Tax Filing Status,” or you will declare the WTA that you have already paid on the employee's behalf forfeited and due as a debt to the Government.

        (c) If the relocating employee chose not to receive the WTA and fails to file a Statement of Income and Tax Filing Status prior to your required date, you are to send the employee a written warning that they have 60 days to file. If the employee still fails to file, you may close your case file and refuse any later claims for RITA related to this specific relocation.

        § 302-17.103   What are the advantages of choosing a 1-year or a 2-year RITA process?

#### § § 302-17.103

        (a) The one-year process is simpler. It reimburses the employee more quickly, and it eases the administrative burden required to calculate the RITA. Most importantly, the one-year process eliminates the possibility of charging employees for excess payments to the IRS, the so-called “negative RITA.”

        (b) The two-year process provides a somewhat more accurate calculation of the additional taxes the employee incurs because it is based on the employee's actual Year One taxable income and filing status rather than the taxable income and filing status from the year before.

      § 302-17.0   General.

#### § § 302-17.0

      Use of the pronouns “I,” “you,” and their variants throughout this part refer to the employee, unless otherwise noted.
