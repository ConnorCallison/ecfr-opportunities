A Federal agency may not conduct or sponsor, and you are not required to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number.

      § 1000.15   What is the congressional policy statement of this part?

#### § § 1000.15

      (a)  In the Act, the Congress found that:

      (1) The Tribal right of self-governance flows from the inherent sovereignty of Indian Tribes and nations;

      (2) The United States recognizes a special government-to-government relationship with Indian Tribes, including the right of the Tribes to self-governance, as reflected in the Constitution, treaties, Federal statutes, and the course of dealings of the United States with Indian Tribes;

      (3) Although progress had been made, the Federal bureaucracy has discouraged, to some degree, the further compacting of Indian programs or hindered negotiations between the Department and Tribes for renewing self-governance compacts and funding agreements;

      (4) Tribal Self-Governance was designed to improve and perpetuate the government-to-government relationship between Indian Tribes and the United States and to strengthen Tribal control over Federal funding and program management; and

      (5) Congress further finds that:

      (i) Transferring control over funding and decision making to Tribal governments, upon Tribal request, for Federal programs is an effective way to implement the Federal policy of government-to-government relations with Indian Tribes; and

      (ii) Transferring control over funding and decision making to Tribal governments, upon request, for Federal programs strengthens the Federal policy of Indian self-determination.

      (b)  It is the policy of the Act to permanently establish and implement self-governance:

      (1) To enable the United States to maintain and improve its unique and continuing relationship with, and responsibility to, Indian Tribes;

      (2) To permit each Tribe to choose the extent of its participation in self-governance;

      (3) To coexist with the provisions of the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act relating to the provision of Indian services by designated Federal agencies;

      (4) To ensure the continuation of the trust responsibility of the United States to Indian Tribes and Indian individuals;

      (5) To permit an orderly transition from Federal domination of programs and services to provide Indian Tribes with meaningful authority to plan, conduct, redesign, and administer PSFAs that meet the needs of the individual Tribal communities; and

      (6) To provide for an orderly transition through a planned and measurable parallel reduction in the Federal bureaucracy.

      (c)  As reflected in H. Rept. 116-422 and S. Rept. 116-34, it is the policy of the PROGRESS for Indian Tribes Act, Public Law 116-180:

      (1) To clarify and streamline the Department's process for approving self-governance compacts and funding agreements;

      (2) To create similarities and administrative efficiencies between title IV and title V of Public Law 93-638, as amended; and

      (3) To minimize delays to self-governance compacting or funding.

      § 1000.20   What is the Secretarial policy of this part?

#### § § 1000.20

      In carrying out Tribal self-governance under title IV, it is the policy of the Secretary:

      (a) To fully support and implement the foregoing policies to the full extent of the Secretary's authority.

      (b) To recognize and respect the unique government-to-government relationship between Tribes, as sovereign governments, and the United States.

      (c) To have all bureaus of the Department work to further and protect the trust responsibility of the United States with respect to Tribes and individual Indians that exists under treaties, Executive orders, other laws, or court decisions.

      (d) To have all bureaus of the Department work cooperatively and pro-actively with Tribes/Consortia on a government-to-government basis within the framework of the Act and any other applicable provision of law, so as to make the ideals of self-determination and self-governance a reality.

      (e) To have all bureaus of the Department work to streamline the process for Tribes/Consortia participating in or applying to participate in self-governance to establish administrative efficiencies and consistency with the processes under title IV and title V of Public Law 93-638, as amended.

      (f) To have all bureaus of the Department actively share information with Tribes and Tribal Consortia to encourage Tribes and Tribal Consortia to become knowledgeable about the Department's programs and the opportunities to include them in a funding agreement.

      (g) To interpret each Federal law and regulation, including this part, in a manner that facilitates the inclusion of programs in funding agreements and the implementation of funding agreements.

      (h) That all bureaus of the Department will negotiate in good faith, to maximize implementation of the Self-Governance policy and carry out title IV and this part in a manner that maximizes the policy of Tribal self-governance.

      (i) That, subject to Public Law 116-180, title I, § 101(a), Oct. 21, 2020, 134 Stat. 857, (25 U.S.C. 5361 Note), each provision of title IV and each provision of a compact or funding agreement shall be liberally construed for the benefit of the Tribe or Consortium participating in self-governance, and that any ambiguity be resolved in favor of the Tribe or Consortium to facilitate the inclusion of programs in each funding agreement authorized.

      (j) To timely enter into funding agreements under title IV, whenever possible.

      (k) To afford Tribes and Tribal Consortia the maximum flexibility and discretion necessary to meet the needs of their communities consistent with their diverse demographic, geographic, economic, cultural, health, social, religious, and institutional needs. This includes recognition of and support for Indigenous Knowledge, and the Tribes' and Tribal Consortia's authority to apply such knowledge when performing PSFAs under this part. These policies are designed to facilitate and encourage Tribes and Tribal Consortia to participate in the planning, conduct, and administration of those Federal programs, included, or eligible for inclusion in a funding agreement.

      (l) To the extent of the Secretary's authority, to maintain active communication with Tribal governments regarding budgetary matters applicable to programs subject to the Act, and that are included in an individual funding agreement.

      (m) To implement policies, procedures, and practices at the Department to ensure that the letter, spirit, and goals of the Act are fully and successfully implemented to the maximum extent allowed by law.

      (n) To ensure that Executive Order 13175 on Consultation and Coordination with Indian Tribal Governments and any subsequent Executive Orders regarding consultation will apply to the implementation of these regulations.

      § 1000.25   What is the effect on existing Tribal rights?

#### § § 1000.25

      § 1000.35   What happens if a court holds any provisions of these regulations in this part invalid?

    Subpart B—Selection of Additional Tribes for Participation in Tribal Self-Governance

      Purpose and Definitions

        § 1000.101   What is the purpose of this subpart?

#### § § 1000.101

        This subpart describes the selection process and eligibility criteria that the Secretary uses to decide that Indian Tribes may participate in Tribal self-governance as authorized by 25 U.S.C. 5362.

        § 1000.105   What is a “signatory”?

#### § § 1000.105

        A signatory is a Tribe or Consortium that meets the eligibility criteria in §§ 1000.115 and 1000.125 and directly signs the agreements. A signatory may exercise all of the rights and responsibilities outlined in the compact and funding agreement and is legally responsible for all financial and administrative decisions made by the signatory.

        § 1000.110   What is a “nonsignatory Tribe”?

#### § § 1000.110

        (a) A nonsignatory Tribe is a Tribe that either:

        (1) Does not meet the eligibility criteria in §§ 1000.115 and 1000.125 and, by resolution of its governing body, authorizes a Consortium to participate in self-governance on its behalf; or

        (2) Meets the eligibility criteria in §§ 1000.115 and 1000.125 but chooses to be a member of a Consortium and have a representative of the Consortium sign the compact and funding agreement on its behalf.

        (b) A non-signatory Tribe under paragraph (a)(1) of this section:

        (1) May not sign the compact and funding agreement. A representative of the Consortium must sign both documents on behalf of the Tribe.

        (2) May only become a “signatory Tribe” if it independently meets the eligibility criteria in §§ 1000.115 and 1000.125.

      Eligibility

        § 1000.115   Who may participate in Tribal self-governance?

#### § § 1000.115

        There are two types of entities who may participate in Tribal self-governance:

        (a) Indian Tribes; and

        (b) Consortia of Indian Tribes.

        § 1000.120   How many additional Tribes/Consortia may participate in self-governance per year?

#### § § 1000.120

        (a) The Secretary, acting through the Director of the OSG, may select not more than 50 new Indian Tribes per year from those Tribes eligible under 25 U.S.C. 5362(c) to participate in self-governance. A Consortium of Indian Tribes counts as one Tribe for purposes of calculating the 50 additional Tribes per year.

        (b) The limitation of not more than 50 new Tribes per year does not preclude a signatory Tribe from negotiating a new or amended compact or funding agreement. Such new or amended compacts or funding agreements do not count against the limitation of not more than 50 new Tribes per year.

        § 1000.125   What must a Tribe/Consortium submit to be selected to participate in Self-Governance?

#### § § 1000.125

        The Tribe/Consortium must submit to OSG documentation that demonstrates the following:

        (a) Successful completion of a planning phase as described in § 1000.140. A Consortium's planning activities satisfy this requirement for all its member Tribes for the purpose of the Consortium meeting this requirement.

        (b) A request for participation in self-governance by a Tribal resolution and/or a final official action by the Tribal governing body. For a Consortium, the governing body of each Tribe must authorize its participation by a Tribal resolution and/or a final official action by the Tribal governing body that specifies the scope of the Consortium's authority to act on behalf of the Tribe.

        (c) For a Tribe/Consortium required to perform an annual audit under the Single Audit Act and subpart F of 2 CFR part 200, financial stability and financial management capability as evidenced by the Tribe (or participating Tribes in a Consortium) having no uncorrected significant and material audit exceptions in the required annual audit of its self-determination or self-governance agreements with any Federal agency for the three fiscal years preceding the date on which the Tribe/Consortium requests participation, provided that documentation demonstrating the correction of any significant and material audit exceptions may include, but is not limited to, Agency Management Decision Letters issued in accordance with 2 CFR 200.521, Summary Schedule of Prior Audit Findings included in subsequent audit reports in accordance with 2 CFR 200.511, or any documentation provided by the Tribe/Consortium.

        § 1000.130   What additional information may be submitted to the Secretary to facilitate negotiations?

#### § § 1000.130

        At the option of the Tribe/Consortium, a Tribe/Consortium may identify BIA and non-BIA programs that the Tribe/Consortium may wish to subsequently negotiate for inclusion in a funding agreement. The inclusion of PSFAs in a funding agreement is not limited by the provision of this additional information.

        § 1000.135   May a Consortium member Tribe withdraw from the Consortium and be selected to participate in Self-Governance?

#### § § 1000.135

        In accordance with the expressed terms of the compact or written agreement of the Consortium, a Consortium member Tribe (either a signatory or nonsignatory Tribe) may fully or partially withdraw from a participating Consortium its share of any program included in a compact or funding agreement to directly negotiate a compact and funding agreement. The withdrawing Tribe must do the following:

        (a) Independently meet all of the eligibility criteria in §§ 1000.115 through 1000.140. If a Consortium's planning activities specifically consider self-governance activities for a member Tribe, that planning activity may be used to satisfy the planning requirements for the member Tribe if it applies for self-governance status on its own.

        (b) Submit a notice of withdrawal to OSG and the Consortium as evidenced by a resolution of the Tribal governing body.

        § 1000.140   What is required during the “planning phase”?

#### § § 1000.140

        The planning phase must be conducted to the satisfaction of the Tribe/Consortium and must include:

        (a) Legal and budgetary research; and

        (b) Internal Tribal government, planning, training, and organizational preparation related to the operation of PSFAs contemplated by the Tribe/Consortium.

        § 1000.145   When does a Tribe/Consortium have an uncorrected “significant and material audit exception”?

#### § § 1000.145

        A Tribe/Consortium has an uncorrected significant and material audit exceptions if any of the audits that it submitted under § 1000.125(c) identifies:

        (a) Significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in internal control over major programs and significant instances of abuse relating to major programs which the Tribe/Consortium has not corrected;

        (b) Material noncompliance with the provisions of Federal statutes, regulations, or the terms and conditions of Federal awards related to a major program which the Tribe/Consortium has not corrected; or

        (c) A single finding of known questioned costs subsequently disallowed by a contracting officer or awarding official that exceeds $25,000 (or such higher amount as may be established in 2 CFR 200.516).

        § 1000.150   What are the consequences of having an uncorrected significant and material audit exception?

#### § § 1000.150

        If a Tribe/Consortium has an uncorrected significant and material audit exception, the Tribe/Consortium is ineligible to be selected to participate in self-governance until the Tribe/Consortium meets the documentation requirements in § 1000.125.

        § 1000.155   Is the Secretary required to provide technical assistance to improve a Tribe's/Consortium's internal controls?

#### § § 1000.155

        Yes. In considering proposals by a Tribe/Consortium for participation in Self-Governance, if the Secretary determines that the Tribe/Consortium lacks adequate internal controls necessary to manage PSFAs proposed for inclusion in a compact or funding agreement under this part, the Secretary shall, as soon as practicable, provide the necessary technical assistance to assist the Tribe/Consortium in developing adequate internal controls in accordance with 25 U.S.C. 5324(q)(1).

        § 1000.160   How is a Tribe/Consortium selected to participate in Self-Governance?

#### § § 1000.160

        (a) For a Tribe not presently participating in Self Governance to be selected, the Tribe/Consortium may submit a request to the Director at any time, but no later than 180 days before the proposed effective date of the funding agreement ( October 1, January 1, or such other date as the parties agree). The request must contain the documentation required in § 1000.125.

        (b) OSG shall select a Tribe/Consortium to participate in self-governance upon a determination that the Tribe/Consortium has provided the required documentation in § 1000.125, consistent with 25 U.S.C. 5362(b)(1)(A).

        (c) OSG shall notify the Tribe/Consortium no later than 45-days after receipt of the Tribe's/Consortium's request that the Tribe/Consortium has been selected to participate in self-governance or does not have a complete request under § 1000.185.

        § 1000.170   Are there any time frames to negotiate an initial compact or funding agreement for a Tribe not presently participating in self-governance?

#### § § 1000.170

        Yes.

        (a) Once selected to participate in self-governance, the parties should begin negotiations at least 180 days before the proposed effective date of the initial funding agreement and compact ( October 1, January 1, or such other date as the parties agree in the initial funding agreement or compact).

        (b) A Tribe/Consortium may be selected to participate during one year but negotiate a compact and funding agreement in a subsequent year. In this case, the Tribe/Consortium must, before the applicable period established in § 1000.160, submit to OSG documentation demonstrating continued eligibility under 25 U.S.C. 5362(c).

        § 1000.175   How does a Tribe/Consortium withdraw its request to participate in Self-Governance?

#### § § 1000.175

        A Tribe/Consortium may withdraw its request to participate in Self Governance by submitting a Tribal resolution or official action by the Tribal governing body to the Director of OSG.

        § 1000.180   What if more than 50 Tribes/Consortium apply to participate in Self-Governance?

#### § § 1000.180

        The first 50 Tribes/Consortium who apply and are determined to be eligible under § 1000.160 shall have the option to begin to participate in self-governance.

#### § § 1000.645

        A Tribe/Consortium may include in its funding agreement PSFAs administered by the Secretary for the benefit of Indians because of their status as Indian, including, but not limited to those provided through the BIA, the BIE, the BTFA, the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs, and the Appraisal and Valuation Services Office, without regard to the agency or office of that Bureau or Office, including any PSFA identified in 25 U.S.C. 5363(b)(1).

        § 1000.650   How does the funding agreement specify the services provided, functions performed, and responsibilities assumed by the Tribe/Consortium and those retained by the Secretary?

#### § § 1000.650

        (a) The funding agreement must specify in writing the services, functions, and responsibilities to be assumed by the Tribe/Consortium and the functions, services, and responsibilities to be retained by the Secretary.

        (b) Any division of responsibilities between the Tribe/Consortium and BIA must be clearly stated in writing as part of the funding agreement. Similarly, when there is a relationship between the program and BIA's inherent Federal functions, the relationship must be explained in the funding agreement.

        § 1000.655   May a Tribe/Consortium redesign or consolidate the programs that are included in a funding agreement and reallocate funds for such programs?

#### § § 1000.655

        Except where a statute contains specific limitations on the use of funds, a Tribe/Consortium may redesign or consolidate programs included in a funding agreement and reallocate funds for such programs in any manner which it deems to be in the best interest of the Indian community being served, so long as the redesign or consolidation does not have the effect of denying eligibility for services to population groups otherwise eligible to be served under applicable Federal law; provided however, that a reduction in funds available for a program or service shall not be considered a denial of eligibility for services. However, redesign of construction project(s) included in a funding agreement must be done in accordance with subpart K of this part.

        § 1000.660   Do Tribes/Consortium need Secretarial approval to redesign BIA programs that the Tribe/Consortium administers under a funding agreement?

#### § § 1000.660

        No, the Secretary does not have to approve a redesign of a program under the funding agreement, except when the redesign involves:

        (a) Programs described in 25 U.S.C. 5363(b)(2) or (c); or

        (b) A request to waive a regulation.

        § 1000.665   Can the terms and conditions in a funding agreement be amended during the year it is in effect?

#### § § 1000.665

        Yes, terms and conditions in a funding agreement may be amended during the year it is in effect as agreed to by both the Tribe/Consortium and the Secretary.

      Determining Funding Agreement Amounts

        § 1000.670   What funds must be transferred to a Tribe/Consortium under a funding agreement?

#### § § 1000.670

        (a) Subject to the terms of a funding agreement, the Secretary must transfer to a Tribe/Consortium all funds provided for in the funding agreement, pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 5368. The Secretary shall provide funding for periods covered by joint resolution adopted by Congress making continuing appropriations, to the extent permitted by such resolution.

        (b) At the option of the Tribe/Consortium, the Secretary must provide the following program funds to the Tribe/Consortium through a funding agreement:

        (1) An amount equal to the amount that the Tribe/Consortium would have been eligible to receive under contracts and grants for direct programs and contract support under title I of Public Law 93-638, as amended;

        (2) Any funds that are specifically or functionally related to providing services and benefits to the Tribe/Consortium or its members by the Secretary without regard to the organizational level within BIA where such functions are carried out; and

        (3) Any funds otherwise available to Indian Tribes or Indians for which appropriations are made to other Federal agencies and transferred to the Department as directed by law, an Interagency Agreement, or other means.

        (c) Examples of the funds referred to in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section are:

        (1) A Tribe's/Consortium's Public Law 93-638 contract amounts;

        (2) Negotiated amounts of agency, regional and central office funds, including previously undistributed funds or new programs on the same basis as they are made available to other Tribes;

        (3) Other recurring funding;

        (4) Non-recurring funding;

        (5) Special projects, if applicable;

        (6) Construction;

        (7) Wildland firefighting accounts;

        (8) Competitive grants; and

        (9) Congressional earmarked funding.

        (d) Examples of the funds referred to in paragraph (b)(3) of this section are:

        (1) Federal Highway Administration funds;

        (2) Federal Transit Administration funds; and

        (3) Funding pursuant to an approved plan under Public Law 102-477, as amended.

        § 1000.675   What funds may not be included in a funding agreement?

#### § § 1000.675

        Funds associated with programs prohibited from inclusion under 25 U.S.C. 5363(m)(1) may not be included in a funding agreement.

        § 1000.680   May the Secretary place any requirements on programs and funds that are otherwise available to Tribes/Consortium or Indians for which appropriations are made to agencies other than DOI?

#### § § 1000.680

        No, unless the Secretary is required to develop terms and conditions that are required by law or that are required by the agency to which the appropriation is made.

        § 1000.685   What funds are used to carry out inherent Federal functions?

#### § § 1000.685

        The funds for BIA to carry out inherent Federal functions are the funds to support functions that may not legally be delegated to an Indian Tribe if all Tribes were to assume responsibilities for all BIA programs that the Act permits.

        § 1000.690   How does BIA determine the funding amount to carry out inherent Federal functions?

#### § § 1000.690

        (a) Between October 1st and December 31st of each fiscal year, each regional and central office shall develop a document that contains its inherent Federal function information and cost calculation for that office based either on an enacted budget or Continuing Resolution budgetary guidance, and promptly distribute that document to each Tribe/Consortium served by that office.

        (b) The Secretary shall amend the document throughout the year if programs are added or changed in ways that affect the inherent Federal functions directly associated with a PSFA transferred, or proposed to be transferred, into the funding agreement of the Tribe/Consortium, and distribute that revised document to any Tribe/Consortium served by that office and seeking to transfer a PSFA into a funding agreement under the Act.

        (c) Once final budget amounts are known and suballocated, the Secretary will provide an updated document within 90 days to each Tribe/Consortium.

        (d) Inherent Federal function information must clearly identify the legal authority that specifically precludes delegation to a Tribe/Consortium.

        (e) Cost calculations must be limited to the minimum amount of funds necessary to carry out specific inherent Federal functions necessary for that office to administer PSFAs transferred to the funding agreement.

        (f) The development of the document in paragraph (a) of this section must be based on the following principles:

        (1) Uniformity and consistency in the identification of inherent Federal functions and in the calculation of their associated costs;

        (2) The determination of inherent Federal functions in each office is based only on those inherent Federal functions actually being performed at that office; and

        (3) The Secretary shall consult with Tribes/Consortium on inherent Federal function determinations and associated cost calculations at various forums, including the Tribal Interior Budget Council (TIBC).

        (g) In negotiating the amount of funds due a Tribe/Consortium in a funding agreement, the Secretary may withhold from transfer to the funding agreement only those funds to carry out inherent Federal functions associated with the PSFAs assumed in the funding agreement, unless otherwise expressly agreed to by the Tribe/Consortium in the funding agreement.

        (h) Upon the request of a Tribe/Consortium, the Secretary must promptly provide a specific description of each inherent Federal function directly associated with a PSFA transferred, or proposed to be transferred, into the funding agreement of the Tribe/Consortium, along with the detailed basis for the Secretary's associated cost calculation.

        § 1000.695   Is the amount of funds withheld by the Secretary to cover the cost of inherent Federal functions subject to negotiation?

#### § § 1000.695

        Yes, the Secretary's calculation of such costs is an appropriate subject during the negotiation of a funding agreement because it affects the amount of funds available for transfer to the funding agreement. If the Tribe/Consortium and the Secretary are unable to agree on the amount of funds to be withheld by the Secretary to cover the Secretary's expense of carrying out inherent Federal functions directly associated with the PSFAs assumed in the funding agreement, the Tribe/Consortium may exercise any of its options under 25 U.S.C. 5366(c), including the final offer process in subpart I of this part.

        § 1000.700   May a Tribe/Consortium continue to negotiate a funding agreement pending an appeal of funding amounts associated with inherent Federal functions?

#### § § 1000.700

        Yes, pending appeal of funding amounts associated with inherent Federal functions, any Tribe/Consortium may continue to negotiate a funding agreement using the information under § 1000.690 that is being appealed. This information will be subject to later adjustment based on the final determination of a Tribe's/Consortium's appeal.

        § 1000.705   What is a Tribal share?

#### § § 1000.705

        A Tribal share is the portion of all funds and resources determined for a particular Tribe (or Tribes within a Consortium) that support any program within BIA, BIE, BTFA, or the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs and are not required by the Secretary for the performance of an inherent Federal function as described in §§ 1000.685 through 1000.695.

        § 1000.710   How does BIA determine a Tribe's/Consortium's share of funds to be included in a funding agreement?

#### § § 1000.710

        There are typically two methods for determining the amount of funds to be included in the funding agreement:

        (a)  For formula-driven programs, a Tribe's/Consortium's amount is determined by first identifying the funds for BIA to carry out inherent Federal functions and second, by applying the distribution formula to the remaining eligible funding for each program involved.

        (1) Distribution formulas must be reasonably related to the function or service performed by an office, and must be consistently applied to all Tribes within each regional and agency office.

        (2) The process in paragraph (a) of this section for calculating a Tribe's funding under self-governance must be consistent with the process used for calculating funds available to non-self-governance Tribes.

        (b)  For programs whose funds are not distributed on a formula basis as described in paragraph (a) of this section, a Tribe's funding amount will be determined on a Tribe-by-Tribe basis and may differ between Tribes. Examples of these funds may include special project funding, awarded competitive grants, earmarked funding, and construction or other one-time or non-recurring funding for which a Tribe is eligible.

        § 1000.715   Can a Tribe/Consortium negotiate a Tribal share for programs outside its region/agency?

#### § § 1000.715

        Yes, where BIA services for a particular Tribe/Consortium are provided from a location outside its immediate agency or region, the Tribe may negotiate its share from the BIA location where the service is actually provided.

        § 1000.720   May a Tribe/Consortium obtain discretionary or competitive funding that is distributed on a discretionary or competitive basis?

#### § § 1000.720

        Funds provided for Indian services/programs that have not been mandated by Congress to be distributed on a competitive/discretionary basis may be distributed to a Tribe/Consortium under a formula-driven method. In order to receive such funds, a Tribe/Consortium must be eligible and qualified to receive such funds. A Tribe/Consortium that receives such funds under a formula-driven methodology would no longer be eligible to compete for these funds.

        § 1000.725   Are all funds identified as Tribal shares always paid to the Tribe/Consortium under a funding agreement?

#### § § 1000.725

        No, at the discretion of the Tribe/Consortium, Tribal shares may be left, in whole or in part, with BIA for certain programs. This is referred to as a “retained Tribal share.”

        § 1000.730   How are savings that result from downsizing allocated?

#### § § 1000.730

        Funds that are saved as a result of downsizing in BIA are allocated to Tribes/Consortium in the same manner as Tribal shares as provided for in § 1000.710.

        § 1000.735   Do Tribes/Consortium need Secretarial approval to reallocate funds between programs that the Tribe/Consortium administers under the funding agreement?

#### § § 1000.735

        No, except with respect to programs described in 25 U.S.C. 5363(b)(2) or (c) or as otherwise required by law, the Secretary does not have to approve the reallocation of funds between programs that a Tribe/Consortium administers under a funding agreement. However, reallocation of funds for construction project(s) included in a funding agreement must be done in accordance with subpart K of this part.

        § 1000.740   Can funding amounts negotiated in a funding agreement be adjusted during the year it is in effect?

#### § § 1000.740

        Yes, funding amounts negotiated in a funding agreement may be adjusted under the following circumstances:

        (a)  (1) Increases/decreases as a result of Congressional appropriations and/or a directive in the statement of managers accompanying a conference report on an appropriations bill or continuing resolution.

        (2) General decreases due to Congressional action must be applied consistently to BIA, self-governance Tribes/Consortium, and Tribes/Consortium not participating in self-governance.

        (3) General increases due to Congressional appropriations must be applied consistently, except where used to achieve equitable distribution among regions and Tribes.

        (4) A Tribe/Consortium will be notified of any decrease and be provided an opportunity to reconcile.

        (b)  If the Tribe/Consortium or the Secretary can identify and document substantive errors in calculations, the parties will renegotiate the amounts and make every effort to correct such errors.

        (c)  Both the Tribe/Consortium and the Secretary may agree to renegotiate amounts at any time.

      Establishing Self-Governance Stable Base Budgets

        § 1000.745   What are self-governance stable base budgets?

#### § § 1000.745

        (a) A Tribe/Consortium self-governance stable base budget is the amount of recurring funding to be transferred to the Tribe/Consortium, for a period specified in the funding agreement. This amount must be adjusted to reflect subsequent annual changes in Congressional appropriations. It includes amounts that are eligible to be base transferred or have been base transferred from BIA budget accounts to self-governance budget accounts. As allowed by Congress, self-governance stable base budgets are derived from:

        (1) A Tribe's/Consortium's Public Law 93-638 contract amounts;

        (2) Negotiated agency, regional, and central office amounts;

        (3) Other recurring funding;

        (4) Special Projects, if applicable;

        (5) Programmatic shortfall;

        (6) Tribal priority allocation increases and decreases;

        (7) Pay costs and retirement cost adjustments; and

        (8) Any other inflationary cost adjustments.

        (b) Self-governance stable base budgets must not include any non-recurring program funds, construction and wildland firefighting accounts, Congressional earmarks, or other funds specifically excluded by Congress. These funds are negotiated annually and may be included in the funding agreement but must not be included in the self-governance stable base budget.

        (c) Self-governance stable base budgets may not include other recurring type programs that are currently in Tribal priority allocations (TPA) such as general assistance, housing improvement program (HIP), road maintenance and contract support. Should these later four programs ever become base transferred to Tribes, then they may be included in a self-governance Tribe's stable base budget.

        (d) A funding agreement shall not specify the funding associated with a program described in 25 U.S.C. 5363(b)(2) or (c) without the Secretary's agreement.

        § 1000.750   Once a Tribe/Consortium establishes a stable base budget, are funding amounts renegotiated each year?

#### § § 1000.750

        No, unless otherwise requested by the Tribe/Consortium, these amounts are not renegotiated each year. If a Tribe/Consortium renegotiates funding levels:

        (a) It must negotiate all funding levels in the funding agreement using the process for determining funds for BIA to carry out inherent Federal functions on the same basis as other Tribes; and

        (b) It is eligible for funding amounts of new programs or available programs not previously included in the funding agreement on the same basis as other Tribes.

        § 1000.755   How are self-governance stable base budgets established?

#### § § 1000.755

        At the request of the Tribe/Consortium, a self-governance stable base budget identifying each Tribe's funding amount is included in BIA's budget justification for the following year, subject to Congressional appropriation.

        § 1000.760   How are self-governance stable base budgets adjusted?

#### § § 1000.760

        Self-governance stable base budgets must be adjusted as follows:

        (a)  (1) Increases/decreases as a result of Congressional appropriations and/or a directive in the statement of managers accompanying a conference report on an appropriations bill or continuing resolution.

        (2) General decreases due to Congressional action must be applied consistently to BIA, self-governance Tribes/Consortium, and Tribes/Consortium not participating in self-governance.

        (3) General increases due to Congressional appropriations must be applied consistently, except where used to achieve equitable distribution among regions and Tribes.

        (4) A Tribe/Consortium will be notified of any decrease and be provided an opportunity to reconcile.

        (b)  If the Tribe/Consortium or the Secretary can identify and document substantive errors in calculations, the parties will renegotiate such amounts and make every effort to correct the errors.

        (c)  Both the Tribe/Consortium and the Secretary may agree to renegotiate amounts at any time.

      § 1000.601   What is the purpose of this subpart?

#### § § 1000.601

      This subpart describes the components of funding agreements for BIA programs.

      § 1000.605   What is a funding agreement?

#### § § 1000.605

      Funding agreements are legally binding and mutually enforceable written agreements negotiated and entered into between a self-governance Tribe/Consortium and the Secretary.

    Subpart G—Funding Agreements for Non-BIA Programs

      § 1000.801   What is the purpose of this subpart?

#### § § 1000.801

      This subpart describes program eligibility, funding, terms, and conditions of funding agreements for non-BIA programs.

      § 1000.805   What is a funding agreement for a non-BIA program?

#### § § 1000.805

      Funding agreements for non-BIA programs are legally binding and mutually enforceable agreements between a bureau and a Tribe/Consortium participating in the self-governance program that contain:

      (a) A description of that portion or portions of a bureau program that are to be performed by the Tribe/Consortium; and

      (b) Associated funding, terms and conditions under which the Tribe/Consortium will assume a program, or portion of a program.

      § 1000.810   What non-BIA programs are eligible for inclusion in a funding agreement?

#### § § 1000.810

      Programs authorized by sections 403(b)(2) and 403(c) (25 U.S.C. 5363(b)(2) and 5363(c)), as amended, are eligible for inclusion in a funding agreement. The Secretary will publish annually a list of these programs in accordance with 25 U.S.C. 5372(c)(3) and (4).

      § 1000.815   Are there non-BIA programs for which the Secretary must negotiate for inclusion in a funding agreement subject to such terms as the parties may negotiate?

#### § § 1000.815

      Yes, those programs, or portions thereof, that are eligible for inclusion in funding agreements under section 403(b)(2) (25 U.S.C. 5363(b)(2).

      § 1000.820   What programs are included under section 403(b)(2) (25 U.S.C. 5363(b)(2))?

#### § § 1000.820

      Those non-BIA programs, or portions thereof, that are eligible for inclusion in funding agreements under the Act, as amended.

      § 1000.825   What programs are included under section 403(c) (25 U.S.C. 5363(c))?

#### § § 1000.825

      Non-BIA programs within the Department of special geographic, historical, or cultural significance to participating Tribes, individually or as members of a Consortium, are eligible for inclusion in funding agreements under section 403(c) (25 U.S.C. 5363(c)).

      § 1000.830   What does “special geographic, historical or cultural” mean?

#### § § 1000.830

      (a)  generally refers to all lands presently “on or near” an Indian reservation, and all other lands within “Indian country,” as defined by 18 U.S.C. 1151. In addition, “geographic” includes:

      (1) Lands of former reservations;

      (2) Lands on or near those conveyed or to be conveyed under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA);

      (3) Judicially established aboriginal lands of a Tribe or a Consortium member or as verified by the Secretary; and

      (4) Lands and waters pertaining to Indian rights in natural resources, hunting, fishing, gathering, and subsistence activities, provided or protected by treaty or other applicable law.

      (b)  generally refers to programs or lands having a particular history that is relevant to the Tribe. For example, particular trails, forts, significant sites, or educational activities that relate to the history of a particular Tribe.

      (c)  refers to programs, sites, or activities as defined by individual Tribal traditions and may include, for example:

      (1) Sacred and medicinal sites;

      (2) Gathering of medicines or materials such as grasses for basket weaving; or

      (3) Other traditional activities, including, but not limited to, subsistence hunting, fishing, and gathering.

      (d) In determining whether a Tribe/Consortium has demonstrated a non-BIA program's special geographic, historical or cultural significance to such Tribe/Consortium, the Secretary shall interpret each Federal law and regulation in a manner that will facilitate the inclusion of a program in, and the implementation of, a funding agreement.

      § 1000.835   Under section 403(b)(2) (25 U.S.C. 5363(b)(2)), when must programs be awarded non-competitively?

#### § § 1000.835

      Non-BIA programs eligible for inclusion in funding agreements under the Act, as amended, must be awarded non-competitively.

      § 1000.840   May a non-BIA bureau include in a funding agreement, on a non-competitive basis, programs of special geographic, historical, or cultural significance?

#### § § 1000.840

      Yes, if there is a special geographic, historical, or cultural significance to the program or activity administered by the bureau, the law affords the non-BIA bureau the discretion to include the programs or activities in a funding agreement on a non-competitive basis.

      § 1000.845   Are there any non-BIA programs that may not be included in a funding agreement?

#### § § 1000.845

      (a) Inherently Federal functions in accordance with 25 U.S.C. 5361(6) and 5363(k).

      (b) Programs where the statute establishing the existing program does not authorize the type of participation sought by the Tribe/Consortium. In determining whether a statute “does not authorize the type of participation sought by” the Tribe/Consortium within the meaning of 25 U.S.C. 5363(k), the Department shall take the following factors into consideration:

      (1) Tribes need not be identified in an authorizing statute in order for a program, or element of a program, to be included in a funding agreement;

      (2) The lack of specificity in a statute by itself does not create a blanket exclusion from inclusion of a program, or element of a program, in a funding agreement; and

      (3) It is not an adequate ground to refuse to compact specific functions that are not inherently Federal in character, simply because an organic statute vests an agency with generic management authority over a broad category of land.

      (c) The Secretary shall interpret each Federal law and regulation in a manner that facilitates:

      (1) The inclusion of programs in funding agreements; and

      (2) The implementation of funding agreements.

      § 1000.850   Does a Tribe/Consortium need to be identified in an authorizing statute in order for a program or element of a program to be included in a non-BIA funding agreement?

#### § § 1000.850

      No, the Act, as amended, favors the inclusion of a wide range of programs.

      § 1000.855   Will Tribes/Consortia participate in the Secretary's determination of what is to be included on the annual list of available programs?

#### § § 1000.855

      Yes, the Secretary must consult each year with Tribes/Consortia participating in self-governance programs regarding which bureau programs are eligible for inclusion in funding agreements. If a Tribe/Consortium makes a written request for a program to be included on the annual list for non-BIA reporting found in subpart P of this part (§§ 1000.2010(c) and 1000.2012), the Secretary must provide a written rationale if the Secretary does not include such program.

      § 1000.860   How will the Secretary consult with Tribes/Consortia in developing the list of available programs?

#### § § 1000.860

      (a) The Secretary shall consult with Tribes/Consortia in developing the list of available programs in accordance with subpart T of this part.

      (b) In addition to the requirements in subpart T of this part:

      (1) The Secretary must publish the previous year's list of available programs in accordance with 25 U.S.C. 5372(c)(3) in the  prior to October 1 of each year. The list must include:

      (i) All of the Secretary's proposed additions and revisions for the coming year with an explanation; and

      (ii) Programmatic targets detailed in § 1000.2010(e) and an initial point of contact for each bureau.

      (2) If the Secretary does not plan to include a Tribal suggestion or revision in the final published list, the Secretary must provide to such Tribe/Consortium a written explanation of reasons consistent with § 1000.855.

      § 1000.865   What else is on the list in addition to eligible programs?

#### § § 1000.865

      The list will also include programmatic targets and an initial point of contact for each bureau. Programmatic targets will be established as part of the consultation process described in § 1000.860.

      § 1000.870   May a bureau negotiate with a Tribe/Consortium for programs not specifically included on the annual list pursuant to 25 U.S.C. 5372(c)?

#### § § 1000.870

      Yes, the annual list will specify that bureaus will negotiate for other programs eligible under 25 U.S.C. 5363(b)(2) when requested by a Tribe/Consortium. Bureaus may negotiate for 25 U.S.C. 5363(c) programs whether or not they are on the list.

      § 1000.875   How will a bureau negotiate a funding agreement for a program of special geographic, historical, or cultural significance to more than one Tribe/Consortium?

#### § § 1000.875

      (a) If a program is of special geographic, historical, or cultural significance to more than one Tribe/Consortium, the bureau may allocate the program among the several Tribes/Consortia through separate funding agreements or select one Tribe/Consortium with whom to negotiate a funding agreement.

      (b) In making a determination under paragraph (a) of this section, the bureau will, in consultation with the affected Tribes/Consortia, consider:

      (1) The special significance of each Tribe's or Consortium member's interest; and

      (c) The bureau's decision will be final for the Department.

      § 1000.880   When will this determination be made?

#### § § 1000.880

      It will occur during the pre-negotiation process, subject to the timeframes in subpart H of this part ( §§ 1000.1035 and 1000.1050).

      § 1000.885   What funds are included in a non-BIA funding agreement?

#### § § 1000.885

      Non-BIA bureaus determine the amount of funding to be included in the funding agreement using the following principles:

      (a)  In general, funds are provided in a funding agreement to the Tribe/Consortium in an amount equal to the amount that it is eligible to receive under section 106 of the Act, as amended.

      (b)  (1) The funding agreement will include:

      (i) Amounts equal to the direct program or project costs the bureau would have incurred were it to operate that program at the level of work mutually agreed to in the funding agreement; and:

      (ii) Allowable indirect costs; and

      (iii) Such amounts as the Tribe/Consortium and the Secretary may negotiate for pre-award, start-up and direct contract support costs.

      (2) A bureau is not required to include management and support funds from the regional or central office level in a funding agreement, unless:

      (i) The Tribe/Consortium will perform work previously performed at the regional or central office level;

      (ii) The work is not compensated in the indirect cost rate; and

      (iii) Including management and support costs in the funding agreement does not result in the Tribe/Consortium being paid twice for the same work when negotiated indirect cost rate is applied.

      § 1000.890   How are indirect cost rates determined?

#### § § 1000.890

      The Department's Interior Business Center (IBC) or other cognizant Federal agency and the Tribe/Consortium negotiate indirect cost rates. These rates are based on the applicable provisions of subpart E of 2 CFR part 200, or other applicable OMB cost circular and the provisions of title I of the Act, as amended. These rates are used generally by all Federal agencies for contracts and grants with the Tribe/Consortium, including self-governance agreements.

      § 1000.895   How does the Secretary determine the amount of indirect costs for a non-BIA funding agreement?

#### § § 1000.895

      The Secretary determines the amount of indirect costs for a non-BIA funding agreement by:

      (a) Applying the negotiated indirect cost rate to the appropriate direct cost base; or

      (b) At the Tribe's/Consortium's option, negotiating a lump sum amount for indirect costs.

      § 1000.900   May the bureaus negotiate terms to be included in a funding agreement for non-BIA programs?

#### § § 1000.900

      Yes, as provided for by 25 U.S.C. 5363(b)(2) and 5363(c) and as necessary to meet program mandates while consistent with this subpart, provided, however, that a bureau may not require in a funding agreement that a Tribe/Consortium retain, hire or assign a Federal employee in a contracted program, nor may a bureau condition its approval of a funding agreement upon a requirement that a Tribe/Consortium retain, hire or assign a Federal employee in a contracted program.

      § 1000.905   Can a Tribe/Consortium reallocate, consolidate, and redesign funds for a non-BIA program?

#### § § 1000.905

      Yes, 25 U.S.C. 5365(d)(2) permits such reallocation, consolidation, and redesign upon joint agreement of the Secretary and the Tribe/Consortium.

      § 1000.910   Do Tribes/Consortia need Secretarial approval to reallocate funds between title I eligible programs that the Tribe/Consortium administers under a non-BIA funding agreement?

#### § § 1000.910

      No, unless otherwise required by law, the Secretary does not have to approve the reallocation of funds with the exception of construction projects.

      § 1000.915   Can a Tribe/Consortium negotiate a funding agreement with a non-BIA bureau for which the performance period exceeds one year?

#### § § 1000.915

      Yes, subject to the terms of the funding agreement, a Tribe/Consortium and a non-BIA bureau may agree to provide for the performance under the funding agreement to extend beyond the fiscal year. However, the Secretary may not obligate funds in excess and advance of available appropriations.

      § 1000.920   Can the terms and conditions in a non-BIA funding agreement be amended during the year it is in effect?

#### § § 1000.920

      Yes, terms and conditions in a non-BIA funding agreement may be amended during the year it is in effect as agreed to by both the Tribe/Consortium and the Secretary.

      § 1000.925   What happens if a funding agreement expires before the effective date of the successor Funding Agreement?

#### § § 1000.925

      If the effective date of a successor funding agreement is not on or before the expiration of the current funding agreement, subject to terms mutually agreed upon by the Tribe/Consortium and the Secretary at the time the current funding agreement was negotiated or in a subsequent amendment, the Tribe/Consortium may continue to carry out the program authorized under the funding agreement to the extent resources permit. During this extension period, the current funding agreement shall remain in effect, including coverage of the Tribe/Consortium under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) 28 U.S.C. 2671-2680 (1994); and the Tribe/Consortium may use any funds remaining under the funding agreement, savings from other programs or Tribal funds to carry out the program. Nothing in this section authorizes a funding agreement to be continued beyond the completion of the program authorized under the funding agreement or the amended funding agreement. This section also does not entitle a Tribe/Consortium to receive, nor does it prevent a Tribe/Consortium from receiving, additional funding under any successor funding agreement. The successor funding agreement must provide funding to the Tribe/Consortium at a level necessary for the Tribe/Consortium to perform the PSFA, or portions thereof, for the full period they were or will be performed.

        § 1000.1385   What is the typical environmental review process for construction projects?

#### § § 1000.1385

        (a) During the environmental review process, the following activities may occur:

        (1) Consult with appropriate Tribal, Federal, state, local officials, and interested parties on potential environmental effects;

        (2) Document assessment of reasonably foreseeable environmental effects;

        (3) Perform necessary environmental surveys and inventories;

        (4) Consult with the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation, acting through the SHPO or THPO, to ensure compliance with the NHPA;

        (5) In applying a categorical exclusion under NEPA, evaluate whether extraordinary circumstances exist in which a normally excluded project may have a significant effect, and therefore require preparation of an environmental assessment or environmental impact statement;

        (6) Identify methods to avoid or mitigate potential adverse effects; and

        (7) Obtain environmental permits and approvals as required.

        (b) This section is for informational purposes only and does not create any legal rights or remedies, or imply private rights of action.

        § 1000.1390   Is the Secretary required to take into account the Indigenous Knowledge of Tribes/Consortia when preparing environmental studies under NEPA, NHPA, and related provisions of other law and regulations?

#### § § 1000.1390

        Yes, Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) regulations direct agencies to make use of high-quality information including reliable data and resources, models, and Indigenous Knowledge, in carrying out their responsibilities under NEPA. The Secretary recognizes that Tribes/Consortia hold relevant information and perspectives regarding the environment, and Indigenous Knowledge can inform the Secretary's environmental analysis. Similarly, section 106 of NHPA (54 U.S.C. 306108) establishes a process to ensure that the Secretary take into account the effects of a project the Department carries out, licenses, or assists on historic properties.

        § 1000.1395   May a Tribe/Consortium act as a cooperating agency or joint lead agency for environmental review purposes regardless of whether it exercises its option under § 1000.1370(a)(1)?

#### § § 1000.1395

        Yes, consistent with 40 CFR 1501.7(b) and 1501.8, a Tribe/Consortium may act as a cooperating agency or joint lead agency for environmental review purposes under this part. For informational purposes only, the term “cooperating agency” is defined at 40 CFR 1508.1(g) and the criteria for a Tribe/Consortium to act as a “cooperating agency” are set out in 40 CFR 1501.8 and Department regulations at 43 CFR 46.225, respectively.

        § 1000.1400   How does a Tribe/Consortium comply with NEPA and NHPA?

#### § § 1000.1400

        (a) A Tribe/Consortium complies with NEPA and NHPA by:

        (1) Developing and adopting their own environmental review procedures that meet or exceed applicable Federal requirements;

        (2) Adopting the procedures of the Secretary; or

        (3) Adopting the procedures of another Federal agency.

        (b) The Tribe/Consortium shall reference such procedures in the funding agreement or construction project agreement and use such procedures in undertaking the project.

        § 1000.1405   If a Tribe/Consortium adopts the environmental review procedures of a Federal agency, is the Tribe/Consortium responsible for ensuring the agency's policies and procedures meet the requirements of NEPA, NHPA, and related environmental laws?

#### § § 1000.1405

        No, the Federal agency is responsible for ensuring its own policies and procedures meet the requirements of NEPA, NHPA, and related environmental laws, not the Tribe/Consortium.

        § 1000.1410   Are Federal funds available to cover the cost of Tribes/Consortia carrying out environmental responsibilities?

#### § § 1000.1410

        Yes, funds are available:

        (a) For project-specific environmental costs through the construction project agreement or funding agreement that includes the construction project; and

        (b) For environmental review program costs through a funding agreement and/or a construction project agreement.

        § 1000.1415   How are project and program environmental review costs identified?

#### § § 1000.1415

        (a) The Tribe/Consortium and the Secretary shall work together during the initial stages of project development to identify program and project related costs associated with carrying out environmental responsibilities for proposed projects. The goal in this process is to identify the costs associated with all foreseeable environmental review activities.

        (b) If unforeseen environmental review and compliance costs are identified during the performance of the construction project, the Tribe/Consortium or, at the request of the Tribe/Consortium, the Tribe/Consortium and Secretary may do one or more of the following:

        (1) Mitigate adverse environmental effects;

        (2) Alter the project scope of work; and/or

        (3) Add additional program and/or project funding, including seeking supplemental appropriations.

        § 1000.1420   What costs may be included in the budget for a construction project or program?

#### § § 1000.1420

        (a) A Tribe/Consortium may include costs allowed by applicable provisions of subpart E of 2 CFR part 200, and costs allowed under 25 U.S.C. 5367, 25 U.S.C. 5325 and 25 U.S.C. 5324(m). The cost incurred will vary depending on which phase of the construction process the Tribe/Consortium is conducting and type of construction project agreement that will be used.

        (b) Regardless of whether a construction project agreement or funding agreement that includes a construction project is fixed priced or cost-reimbursement, budgets may include costs or fees associated with the following:

        (1) Construction project proposal preparation;

        (2) Conducting community meetings to develop project documents;

        (3) Architects, engineers, and other consultants to prepare project planning documents, to develop project plans and specifications, and to assist in oversight of the design during construction;

        (4) Real property lease or acquisition;

        (6) Project management, superintendence, safety, and inspection;

        (7) Travel, including local travel incurred as a direct result of conducting the construction project agreement and remote travel in conjunction with the project;

        (8) Consultants, such as demographic consultants, planning consultants, attorneys, accountants, and personnel who provide services, to include construction management services;

        (9) Project site development;

        (10) Project construction cost;

        (11) General, administrative overhead, and indirect costs;

        (12) Securing and installing moveable equipment, telecommunications and data processing equipment, furnishings, including works of art, and special purpose equipment when part of a construction contract;

        (12) Other costs directly related to performing the construction project;

        (13) Project Contingency;

        (i) A cost-reimbursement project agreement budgets contingency as a broad category. Project contingency remaining at the end of the project is considered savings.

        (ii) Fixed-price agreements budget project contingency in the lump sum price or unit price.

        (c) In the case of a fixed-price project agreement, a reasonable profit determined by taking into consideration the relevant risks and local market conditions.

    Subpart O—Trust Evaluation

      Annual Trust Evaluation

        § 1000.1925   What is a trust evaluation?

#### § § 1000.1925

        A trust evaluation is an annual review and evaluation of trust functions performed by a Tribe/Consortium to ensure that the functions are performed in accordance with trust standards as defined by Federal law. Trust evaluations address trust functions performed by the Tribe/Consortium on its own behalf as well as trust functions performed by the Tribe/Consortium for the benefit of individual Indians or Alaska Natives.

        § 1000.1930   How are trust evaluations conducted?

#### § § 1000.1930

        (a) Each year the Secretary's designated representative(s) will conduct an evaluation of trust PSFAs for each funding agreement. The Secretary's designated representative(s) will coordinate in writing with the leadership of the Tribe/Consortium, with a copy to the designated Tribe's/Consortium's representative(s), to arrange the evaluation of trust PSFAs and throughout the trust evaluation, including the written report required by § 1000.1940.

        (b) This section describes the general framework for trust evaluations. However, each Tribe/Consortium may develop, with the appropriate bureau, an individualized trust evaluation method to allow for the Tribe's/Consortium's unique history, circumstances, trust resources and assets, and the terms and conditions of its funding agreement. An individualized trust evaluation must, at a minimum, contain the measures in paragraph (d) of this section.

        (c) To facilitate the trust evaluation so as to mitigate costs and maximize efficiency, each Tribe/Consortium must provide access to all records, plans, and other pertinent documents relevant to the trust PSFAs under review not otherwise available to the Department.

        (d) The Secretary's designated representative(s) will:

        (1) Review trust transactions;

        (2) Conduct on-site inspections of trust resources and assets, as appropriate, at a time to be coordinated between the parties;

        (3) Review compliance with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements;

        (4) Review compliance with the trust provisions and standards as may be negotiated and included in the funding agreement;

        (5) Ensure that the same level of trust services is provided to individual Indians as would have been provided by the Secretary;

        (6) Document deficiencies in the performance of trust PSFAs discovered during the trust evaluation in the final report which the Department will submit to the Tribe/Consortium pursuant to § 1000.1940; and

        (7) Ensure the fulfillment of the Secretary's trust responsibility to Tribes and individual Indians by documenting the existence of:

        (i) Systems of internal controls;

        (ii) Trust standards; and

        (iii) Safeguards against conflicts of interest in the performance of trust PSFAs.

        § 1000.1935   May the trust evaluation process be used for additional reviews?

#### § § 1000.1935

        Yes, if the parties agree in writing to such additional reviews.

        § 1000.1936   May the parties negotiate review methods for purposes of the trust evaluation?

#### § § 1000.1936

        Yes, unless review methods are otherwise provided by Federal law, the Secretary's designated representative will negotiate review methods at the request of the Tribe/Consortium for inclusion in a funding agreement as provided in § 1000.1930(b).

        § 1000.1940   What are the responsibilities of the Secretary's designated representative(s) after the annual trust evaluation?

#### § § 1000.1940

        The Secretary's representative(s) must prepare a written report documenting the results of the trust evaluation within 60 days of the Department's completion of an on-site and/or desk review.

        (a) The Secretary's representative(s) will provide the Tribe/Consortium representative(s) with a copy of the report for review and comment before finalization.

        (b) The Secretary's representative(s) will attach to the report any Tribal/Consortium comments that the representative receives.

        (c) The Secretary's representative(s) must respond to the Tribe's/Consortium's comments as part of the final trust evaluation report.

        § 1000.1945   Is the trust evaluation standard or process different when the trust resource or asset is held in trust for an individual Indian or Indian allottee?

#### § § 1000.1945

        No, Tribes/Consortia are under the same obligation as the Secretary to perform trust PSFAs and related activities in accordance with trust protection standards and principles whether managing Tribally or individually owned trust resources and assets. The Department's process for conducting the annual evaluation of Tribal/Consortium performance of trust PSFAs on behalf of individual Indians is the same as that used in evaluating performance of Tribal trust PSFAs.

        § 1000.1950   Does the annual trust review evaluation include a review of the Secretary's inherent Federal and retained operation trust PSFAs?

#### § § 1000.1950

        (a) When the annual trust evaluation by the Secretary reveals a deficient performance of trust PSFAs by a Tribe/Consortium due in part to the action or inaction of a bureau, it will trigger an evaluation by the Department of the Secretary's inherent Federal functions and any retained trust PSFAs pertaining to the bureau's action or inaction.

        (b) The appropriate Department officials will be notified in writing by the Secretary's representative of the need for corrective action. A copy of such written notice shall be sent by the Secretary's representative to the Tribe/Consortium. The review of the Secretary's trust PSFAs shall be based on the standards in Federal law.

        § 1000.1955   What are the consequences of a finding of imminent jeopardy in the Secretary's annual trust evaluation?

#### § § 1000.1955

        (a) A finding of imminent jeopardy to a trust asset, natural resource, or public health and safety that is caused by an act or omission of the Tribe/Consortium and that arises out of a failure by the Tribe/Consortium to carry out the compact or funding agreement, triggers the Federal reassumption process ( subpart M of this part), unless the conditions in paragraph (b) of this section are met.

        (b) The reassumption process will not be triggered if the Secretary's designated representative determines that the Tribe/Consortium:

        (1) Can cure the conditions causing jeopardy within 60 days; and

        (2) Will not cause significant loss, harm, or devaluation of a trust asset, natural resources, or the public health and safety.

        § 1000.1960   What if the Secretary's trust evaluation reveals problems that do not rise to the level of imminent jeopardy?

#### § § 1000.1960

        Where problems not rising to the level of imminent jeopardy are caused by Tribal/Consortium action or inaction, the conditions must be:

        (a) Documented in the Department's annual trust evaluation report;

        (b) Reported to the Secretary; and

        (c) Reported in writing to:

        (1) The governing body of the Tribe; and

        (2) In the case of a Consortium, to the governing body of each Tribe on whose behalf the Consortium is performing the trust PSFAs.

        § 1000.1965   Who is responsible for taking corrective action?

#### § § 1000.1965

        The Tribe/Consortium is primarily responsible for identifying and implementing corrective actions for matters contained in the funding agreement, but the Department may also suggest possible corrective measures for Tribal/Consortium consideration.

        § 1000.1970   What are the requirements of the Department's review team report?

#### § § 1000.1970

        A report summarizing the results of the trust evaluation will be prepared by the Secretary's designated representative(s) and copies provided to the Tribe/Consortium within the time frame specified in § 1000.1940. The annual trust evaluation report must:

        (a) If a Tribe/Consortium wishes to exercise its appeal rights to the bureau head/Assistant Secretary under § 1000.2351, it must make a written request for review to the appropriate bureau head within 30 days of receiving the initial adverse decision or the conclusion of any non-binding informal alternative dispute resolution process. In addition, the Tribe/Consortium may request the opportunity to have a meeting with appropriate bureau personnel in an effort to clarify the matter under dispute before a formal decision by the bureau head.

        (b) The written request for review should include a statement describing its reasons for a review, with any supporting documentation, or indicate that such a statement or documentation will be submitted within 30 days. A copy of the request must also be sent to the Director of the OSG.

        (c) If the initial decision was made by the bureau head, any appeal shall be directed to the appropriate Assistant Secretary. If a Tribe does not request a review within 30 days of receipt of the decision, the initial decision will be final for the Department.

The Assistant Secretary must either concur with the bureau head's decision or issue a separate decision within 60 days of receipt by the bureau of the Tribe's/Consortium's initial request for review and any accompanying statement and documentation. The decision of the Assistant Secretary is final for the Department.

        (b) If the IBIA cannot make that decision based on the information included in the notice of appeal, the IBIA may ask for additional statements from the Tribe/Consortium, or from the appropriate Federal agency. If the IBIA asks for more statements, it will make its decision within 5 days of receiving those statements.

        (c) If the IBIA decides that the Tribe/Consortium is not entitled to a hearing or if the Tribe/Consortium has waived its right to a hearing on the record, the IBIA will dismiss the appeal and inform the Tribe/Consortium that it is not entitled to a hearing or has waived its right to a hearing.

        § 1000.2385   What procedures apply to Interior Board of Indian Appeals (IBIA) proceedings?

#### § § 1001.3

    In addition to the eligibility criteria identified above, a tribe or consortium of tribes seeking priority ranking for negotiations must submit a description of the efforts of the tribe or consortium to seek to enter negotiations and/or prepare for operations under the self-governance option. This narrative should identify any activities that the tribe has pursued, carefully identifying and documenting the dates involved, including, but not limited to, the following:

Revised applications may be resubmitted for consideration at any time.

    § 1001.5   Application review and selection process for negotiations for funding agreements.

#### § § 1001.5

    Upon acceptance into the applicant pool, the OSG will assign to each tribe or consortium a ranking relative to other applicants based upon the date the OSG receives the complete application package. This ranking will constitute a master list that will be maintained and updated on a continuous basis from year to year. When receipt dates are the same for two or more applications, several other factors will be considered in determining the placement of the tribe or consortium on the list. These factors are identified in priority order as follows:

    (a) Designation by the Congress through report language that a tribe should be considered for participation. These designations will be considered based upon the actual language of the report.

    (b) Documentation of OSG sanctioning of the tribe's self-governance planning and subsequent evidence of actual planning by the tribe.

    (c) Submission of a completed planning or negotiation grant application in the previous year.

    § 1001.7   Availability, amount, and number of planning and negotiation grants.

#### § § 1001.7

    (a) What is the purpose of this section? This section describes how to apply for planning and negotiation grants authorized by section 402(d) of the Act to help meet tribal costs incurred:

    (1) In meeting the planning phase requirement of Pub. L. 103-413, including planning to negotiate non-BIA programs, services, functions and activities; and

    (2) In conducting negotiations.

    (b) What types of grants are available? Three categories of grants may be available:

    (1) Negotiation grants for tribes/consortia selected from the applicant pool as described in § 1001.5 of these regulations;

    (2) Planning grants for tribes/consortia requiring advance funding to meet the planning phase requirement of Pub. L. 103-413; and

    (3) Financial assistance for tribes/consortia to plan for negotiating for non-BIA programs, services, functions and activities, as described in § 1001.10.

    (c) Will grants always be made available to meet the planning phase requirement as described in section 402(d) of Pub. L. 103-413? No. Grants to cover some or all of the planning costs that a tribe/consortium may incur may be made available depending upon the availability of funds appropriated by Congress. We will publish notice of availability of grants in the  as described in this section.

    (d) May a tribe use its own resources to meet its planning and negotiation expenses in preparation for entering into self-governance? Yes. A tribe/consortium may use its own resources to meet these costs. Receiving a grant is not necessary to meet the planning phase requirement of the Act or to negotiate a compact and annual funding agreement.

    (e) What happens if there are insufficient funds to meet the anticipated tribal requests for planning and negotiation grants in any given year? If appropriated funds are available but insufficient to meet the total requests from tribes/consortia, we will give first priority to those that have been selected from the applicant pool to negotiate an annual funding agreement. We will give second priority to tribes/consortia that require advance funds to meet the planning requirement for entry into the self-governance program. We will give third priority to tribes/consortia that require negotiation/planning funds to negotiate for DOI non-BIA programs.

    (f) How many grants will the Department make each year and what funding will be available? The number and size of grants awarded each year will depend on Congressional appropriations and tribal interest. Each year, we will publish a notice in the  which provides relevant details about the application process, including: The funds available, timeframes, and requirements for negotiation and advance planning specified in this part.
