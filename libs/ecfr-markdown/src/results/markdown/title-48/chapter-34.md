**Authority:** Authority: 5 U.S.C. 301 and 20 U.S.C. 1018a.

#### § 3401.104

        (a) The FAR and the EDAR apply to all Department contracts, as defined in FAR part 2, except where expressly excluded. The EDAR implements or supplements the FAR and incorporates, together with the FAR, Department policies, procedures, contract clauses, solicitation provisions, and forms that govern the contracting process or otherwise control the relationship between the Agency, including its sub-organizations, and contractors or prospective contractors.

        (b) The statue at 20 U.S.C. 1018a provides the Performance-Based Organization (PBO) with procurement authority and flexibility associated with sections (a) through (l) of the statute.

      Subpart 3401.3—Agency Acquisition Regulations

        3401.303   Publication and codification.

#### § 3401.303

        (a) The EDAR is issued as chapter 34 of title 48 of the CFR.

        (1) The FAR numbering illustrations at FAR 1.105-2 apply to the EDAR.

        (2) The EDAR numbering system corresponds with the FAR numbering system. An EDAR citation will include the prefix “34” prior to its corresponding FAR part citation;  FAR 25.108-2 would have corresponding EDAR text numbered as EDAR 3425.108-2.

        (3) Supplementary material for which there is no counterpart in the FAR will be codified with a suffix beginning with “70” or, in cases of successive sections and subsections, will be numbered in the 70 series ( 71-79). These supplementing sections and subsections will appear to the closest corresponding FAR citation;  FAR subpart 16.4 may be augmented in the EDAR by citing EDAR 3416.470 and FAR 16.403 may be augmented in the EDAR by citing EDAR 3416.403-70. ( These citations are for illustrative purposes only and may not actually appear in the published EDAR). For example:

        (c) Guidance that is unique to an organization with Head of the Contracting Activity (HCA) authority contains that activity's acronym directly preceding the cite. The following activity acronyms apply: FSA—Federal Student Aid.

      Subpart 3401.4—Deviations

        3401.403   Individual deviations.

#### § 3401.403

        An individual deviation from the FAR or the EDAR must be approved by the Senior Procurement Executive (SPE).

        3401.404   Class deviations.

      Subpart 3401.6—Career Development, Contracting Authority, and Responsibilities

        3401.601   General.

#### § 3401.601

        (a) Contracting authority is vested in the Secretary. The Secretary has delegated this authority to the CAO. The Secretary has also delegated contracting authority to the SPE, giving the SPE broad authority to perform functions dealing with the management direction of the entire Department's procurement system, including implementation of its unique procurement policies, regulations, and standards. Limitations to the extent of this authority and successive delegations are set forth in the respective memorandums of delegations.

        3401.602-3   Ratification of unauthorized commitments.

#### § 3401.602-3

        (a)  As used in this subpart,  includes issuance of letters of intent and arrangements for free vendor services or use of equipment with the promise or the appearance of _commitment_ that a contract, modification, or order will, or may, be awarded.

        (b)  (1) The Government is not bound by agreements with, or contractual commitments made to, prospective contractors by individuals who do not have delegated contracting authority or by contracting officers acting in excess of the limits of their delegated authority. Unauthorized commitments do not follow the appropriate process for the expenditure of Government funds. Consequently, the Government may not be able to ratify certain actions, putting a contractor at risk for taking direction from a Federal official other than the contracting officer. See FAR 1.602-1. Government employees responsible for unauthorized commitments are subject to disciplinary action.

        (2) The HCA must review and sign or reject all ratification requests, with the exception that the Chief of the Contracting Office is authorized to review and sign or reject ratification requests for unauthorized commitments up to $25,000.

        3401.604-70   Contract clause.

#### § 3401.604-70

        Contracting officers must insert a clause substantially the same as the clause at 3452.201-70 (Contracting Officer's Representative (COR)), in all solicitations and contracts for which a COR will be (or is) appointed.

      This part establishes a system of Department of Education (Department) acquisition regulations, referred to as the Education Acquisition Regulation (EDAR), for the codification and publication of policies and procedures of the Department that implement and supplement the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).

        3416.470   Award-term contracting.

#### § 3416.470

        (a)  Award-term contracting is a method, based upon a pre-determined plan in the contract, to extend the contract term for superior performance and to reduce the contract term for substandard or poor performance.

        (b)  A Contracting Officer may authorize use of an award-term incentive contract for acquisitions where the quality of contractor performance is of a critical or highly important nature. The basic contract term may be extended on the basis of the Federal Government's determination of the excellence of the contractor's performance. Additional periods of performance, which are referred to in this section as “award terms,” are available for possible award to the contractor. As award term(s) are awarded, each additional period of performance will immediately follow the period of performance for which the award term was granted. The contract may end at the base period of performance if the Federal Government determines that the contractor's performance does not reflect a level of performance as described in the award-term plan. Award-term periods may only be earned based on the evaluated quality of the performance of the contractor. Meeting the terms of the contract is not justification to award an award-term period. The use of an award-term plan does not exempt the contract from the requirements of FAR 17.207, with respect to performing due diligence prior to extending a contract term.

        (c)  The Contracting Officer must justify the use of an award-term incentive contract in writing. The award-term plan approving official will be appointed by the HCA.

        (d)  The Federal Government unilaterally makes all decisions regarding award-term evaluations, points, methodology used to calculate points, and the degree of the contractor's success.

        (e)  (1) Award periods may be earned during the base period of performance and each option period, except the last option period. Award-term periods may not be earned during the final option year of any contract.

        (2) Award-term periods may not exceed twelve months.

        (3) The potential award-term periods will be priced, evaluated, and considered in the initial contract selection process.

        (f)  (1) An award term is contingent upon a continuing need for the supplies or services and the availability of funds. Award terms may be cancelled prior to the start of the period of performance at no cost to the Federal Government if there is not a continued need or available funding.

        (2) The extension or reduction of the contract term is affected by a bilateral contract modification.

        (3) Award-term periods occur after the period for which the award term was granted. Award-term periods effectively move option periods to later contract performance periods.

        (4) Contractors have the right to decline the award of an award-term period. A contractor loses its ability to earn additional award terms if an earned Award-Term Period is declined.

        (5) Changes to the contract award-term plan must be mutually agreed upon.

        (g)  Insert a clause substantially the same as the clause at 3452.216-71 (Award-term) in all solicitations and resulting contracts where an award-term incentive contract is anticipated.
