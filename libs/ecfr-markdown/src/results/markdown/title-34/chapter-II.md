    Subpart A—Improving Basic Programs Operated by Local Educational Agencies

      Standards and Assessments

        § 200.1   State responsibilities for developing challenging academic standards.

#### § § 200.1

        (a)  A State must adopt challenging academic content standards and aligned academic achievement standards that will be used by the State, its local educational agencies (LEAs), and its schools to carry out this subpart. These academic standards must—

        (1) Be the same academic content standards and aligned academic achievement standards that the State applies to all public schools and public school students in the State, including the public schools and public school students served under this subpart, except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, which applies only to the State's academic achievement standards;

        (2) With respect to the academic achievement standards, include the same knowledge, skills, and levels of achievement expected of all public school students in the State, except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section; and

        (3) Include at least mathematics, reading/language arts, and science, and may include other subjects determined by the State.

        (b)  (1) The challenging academic content standards required under paragraph (a) of this section must—

        (i) Specify what all students are expected to know and be able to do;

        (ii) Contain coherent and rigorous content; and

        (iii) Encourage the teaching of advanced skills.

        (2) A State's academic content standards may—

        (i) Be grade specific; or,

        (ii) Cover more than one grade if grade-level content expectations are provided for each of grades 3 through 8.

        (3) At the high school level, the academic content standards must define the knowledge and skills that all high school students are expected to know and be able to do in at least reading/language arts, mathematics, and science, irrespective of course titles or years completed.

        (c)  (1) The challenging academic achievement standards required under paragraph (a) of this section must—

        (i) Be aligned with the State's challenging academic content standards and with entrance requirements for credit-bearing coursework in the system of public higher education in the State and relevant State career and technical education standards; and

        (ii) Include the following components for each content area:

        (A) Not less than three achievement levels that describe at least—

        () Two levels of high achievement—proficient and advanced—that determine how well students are mastering the material in the State's academic content standards; and

        () A third level of achievement—basic—to provide complete information about the progress of lower-achieving students toward mastering the proficient and advanced levels of achievement.

        (B) Descriptions of the competencies associated with each achievement level.

        (C) Assessment scores (“cut scores”) that differentiate among the achievement levels as specified in paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(A) of this section, and a description of the rationale and procedures used to determine each achievement level.

        (2) A State must develop academic achievement standards for every grade and subject assessed, even if the State's academic content standards cover more than one grade.

        (d)  For students under section 602(3) of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) with the most significant cognitive disabilities who take an alternate assessment, a State may, through a documented and validated standards-setting process, define alternate academic achievement standards, provided those standards—

        (1) Are aligned with the State's challenging academic content standards;

        (2) Promote access to the general curriculum, consistent with the IDEA;

        (3) Reflect professional judgment as to the highest possible standards achievable by such students;

        (4) Are designated in the individualized education program developed under section 614(d)(3) of the IDEA for each such student as the academic achievement standards that will be used for the student; and

        (5) Are aligned to ensure that a student who meets the alternate academic achievement standards is on track to pursue postsecondary education or employment, consistent with the purposes of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended by the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act, as in effect on July _2_2, 2014, and § 200.2(b)(3)(ii)(B)().

        (e)  A State may not define or implement for use under this subpart any alternate or modified academic achievement standards for children with disabilities under section 602(3) of the IDEA that are not alternate academic achievement standards that meet the requirements of paragraph (d) of this section.

        (f)  A State must adopt English language proficiency standards that—

        (1) Are derived from the four recognized domains of speaking, listening, reading, and writing;

        (2) Address the different proficiency levels of English learners; and

        (3) Are aligned with the State's challenging academic content standards and aligned academic achievement standards.

        (g)  If an LEA serves students under subpart A of this part in subjects for which a State has not developed academic standards, the State must describe in its State plan a strategy for ensuring that those students are taught the same knowledge and skills and held to the same expectations in those subjects as are all other students.

        (h)  If a State has developed standards in other subjects for all students, the State must apply those standards to students participating under subpart A of this part.

        (i) Constructed-response, short answer, or essay questions; or

        (ii) Items that require a student to analyze a passage of text or to express opinions;

        (9) Provide for participation in the assessments of all students in the grades assessed consistent with §§ 200.5(a) and 200.6;

        (10) At the State's discretion, be administered through—

        (i) A single summative assessment; or

        (ii) Multiple statewide interim assessments during the course of the academic year that result in a single summative score that provides valid, reliable, and transparent information on student achievement and, at the State's discretion, student growth, consistent with paragraph (b)(4) of this section;

        (11)(i) Consistent with sections 1111(b)(2)(B)(xi) and 1111(h)(1)(C)(ii) of the Act, enable results to be disaggregated within each State, LEA, and school by—

        (A) Gender;

        (H) Status as a child in foster care. “Foster care” means 24-hour substitute care for children placed away from their parents and for whom the agency under title IV-E of the Social Security Act has placement and care responsibility. This includes, but is not limited to, placements in foster family homes, foster homes of relatives, group homes, emergency shelters, residential facilities, child care institutions, and preadoptive homes. A child is in foster care in accordance with this definition regardless of whether the foster care facility is licensed and payments are made by the State, tribal, or local agency for the care of the child, whether adoption subsidy payments are being made prior to the finalization of an adoption, or whether there is Federal matching of any payments that are made; and

        (I) Status as a student with a parent who is a member of the armed forces on active duty or serves on full-time National Guard duty, where “armed forces,” “active duty,” and “full-time National Guard duty” have the same meanings given them in 10 U.S.C. 101(a)(4), 101(d)(1), and 101(d)(5).

        (ii) Disaggregation is not required in the case of a State, LEA, or school in which the number of students in a subgroup is insufficient to yield statistically reliable information or the results would reveal personally identifiable information about an individual student.

        (12) Produce individual student reports consistent with § 200.8(a); and

        (13) Enable itemized score analyses to be produced and reported to LEAs and schools consistent with § 200.8(b).

        (c)(1) At its discretion, a State may administer the assessments required under this section in the form of computer-adaptive assessments if such assessments meet the requirements of section 1111(b)(2)(J) of the Act and this section. A computer-adaptive assessment—

        (i) Must, except as provided in § 200.6(c)(7)(iii), measure a student's academic proficiency based on the challenging State academic standards for the grade in which the student is enrolled and growth toward those standards; and

        (ii) May measure a student's academic proficiency and growth using items above or below the student's grade level.

        (2) If a State administers a computer-adaptive assessment, the determination under paragraph (b)(3)(i)(B) of this section of a student's academic proficiency for the grade in which the student is enrolled must be reported on all reports required by § 200.8 and section 1111(h) of the Act.

        (d) A State must submit evidence for peer review under section 1111(a)(4) of the Act that its assessments under this section and §§ 200.3, 200.4, 200.5(b), 200.6(c), 200.6(f), 200.6(h), and 200.6(j) meet all applicable requirements.

        (e) Information provided to parents under section 1111(b)(2) of the Act must—

        (1) Be in an understandable and uniform format;

        (2) Be, to the extent practicable, written in a language that parents can understand or, if it is not practicable to provide written translations to a parent with limited English proficiency, be orally translated for such parent; and

        (3) Be, upon request by a parent who is an individual with a disability as defined by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), as amended, provided in an alternative format accessible to that parent.

        (7) For students with the most significant cognitive disabilities, a computer-adaptive alternate assessment aligned with alternate academic achievement standards must—

        (i) Assess a student's academic achievement based on the challenging State academic content standards for the grade in which the student is enrolled;

        (ii) Meet the requirements for alternate assessments aligned with alternate academic achievement standards under paragraph (c) of this section; and

        (iii) Meet the requirements in § 200.2, except that the alternate assessment need not measure a student's academic proficiency based on the challenging State academic achievement standards for the grade in which the student is enrolled and growth toward those standards.

        (d)  If a State adopts alternate academic achievement standards for students with the most significant cognitive disabilities and administers an alternate assessment aligned with those standards, the State must—

        (1) Establish, consistent with section 612(a)(16)(C) of the IDEA, and monitor implementation of clear and appropriate guidelines for IEP teams to apply in determining, on a case-by-case basis, which students with the most significant cognitive disabilities will be assessed based on alternate academic achievement standards. Such guidelines must include a State definition of “students with the most significant cognitive disabilities” that addresses factors related to cognitive functioning and adaptive behavior, such that—

        (i) The identification of a student as having a particular disability as defined in the IDEA or as an English learner does not determine whether a student is a student with the most significant cognitive disabilities;

        (ii) A student with the most significant cognitive disabilities is not identified solely on the basis of the student's previous low academic achievement, or the student's previous need for accommodations to participate in general State or districtwide assessments; and

        (iii) A student is identified as having the most significant cognitive disabilities because the student requires extensive, direct individualized instruction and substantial supports to achieve measurable gains on the challenging State academic content standards for the grade in which the student is enrolled;

        (2) Provide to IEP teams a clear explanation of the differences between assessments based on grade-level academic achievement standards and those based on alternate academic achievement standards, including any effects of State and local policies on a student's education resulting from taking an alternate assessment aligned with alternate academic achievement standards, such as how participation in such assessments may delay or otherwise affect the student from completing the requirements for a regular high school diploma;

        (3) Ensure that parents of students selected to be assessed using an alternate assessment aligned with alternate academic achievement standards under the State's guidelines in paragraph (d) of this section are informed, consistent with § 200.2(e), that their child's achievement will be measured based on alternate academic achievement standards, and how participation in such assessments may delay or otherwise affect the student from completing the requirements for a regular high school diploma;

        (4) Not preclude a student with the most significant cognitive disabilities who takes an alternate assessment aligned with alternate academic achievement standards from attempting to complete the requirements for a regular high school diploma;

        (5) Promote, consistent with requirements under the IDEA, the involvement and progress of students with the most significant cognitive disabilities in the general education curriculum that is based on the State's academic content standards for the grade in which the student is enrolled;

        (6) Incorporate the principles of universal design for learning, to the extent feasible, in any alternate assessments aligned with alternate academic achievement standards that the State administers consistent with § 200.2(b)(2)(ii); and

        (7) Develop, disseminate information on, and promote the use of appropriate accommodations consistent with paragraph (b) of this section to ensure that a student with significant cognitive disabilities who does not meet the criteria in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section—

        (i) Participates in academic instruction and assessments for the grade in which the student is enrolled; and

        (ii) Is assessed based on challenging State academic standards for the grade in which the student is enrolled.

        (e)  Consistent with 34 CFR 300.5, “assistive technology device” means any item, piece of equipment, or product system, whether acquired commercially off the shelf, modified, or customized, that is used to increase, maintain, or improve the functional capabilities of a child with a disability. The term does not include a medical device that is surgically implanted, or the replacement of such device.

        (f)  (1) Consistent with § 200.2 and paragraphs (g) and (i) of this section, a State must assess English learners in its academic assessments required under § 200.2 in a valid and reliable manner that includes—

        (i) Appropriate accommodations with respect to a student's status as an English learner and, if applicable, the student's status under paragraph (a) of this section. A State must—

        (A) Develop appropriate accommodations for English learners;

        (B) Disseminate information and resources to, at a minimum, LEAs, schools, and parents; and

        (C) Promote the use of such accommodations to ensure that all English learners are able to participate in academic instruction and assessments; and

        (ii) To the extent practicable, assessments in the language and form most likely to yield accurate and reliable information on what those students know and can do to determine the students' mastery of skills in academic content areas until the students have achieved English language proficiency consistent with the standardized, statewide exit procedures in section 3113(b)(2) of the Act.

        (2) To meet the requirements under paragraph (f)(1) of this section, the State must—

        (i) Ensure that the use of appropriate accommodations under paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section and, if applicable, under paragraph (b) of this section does not deny an English learner—

        (A) The opportunity to participate in the assessment; and

        (B) Any of the benefits from participation in the assessment that are afforded to students who are not English learners; and

        (ii) In its State plan, consistent with section 1111(a) of the Act—

        (A) Provide its definition for “languages other than English that are present to a significant extent in the participating student population,” consistent with paragraph (f)(4) of this section, and identify the specific languages that meet that definition;

        (B) Identify any existing assessments in languages other than English, and specify for which grades and content areas those assessments are available;

        (C) Indicate the languages identified under paragraph (f)(2)(ii)(A) of this section for which yearly student academic assessments are not available and are needed; and

        (D) Describe how it will make every effort to develop assessments, at a minimum, in languages other than English that are present to a significant extent in the participating student population including by providing—

        () The State's plan and timeline for developing such assessments, including a description of how it met the requirements of paragraph (f)(4) of this section;

        () A description of the process the State used to gather meaningful input on the need for assessments in languages other than English, collect and respond to public comment, and consult with educators; parents and families of English learners; students, as appropriate; and other stakeholders; and

        () As applicable, an explanation of the reasons the State has not been able to complete the development of such assessments despite making every effort.

        (3) A State may request assistance from the Secretary in identifying linguistically accessible academic assessments that are needed.

        (4) In determining which languages other than English are present to a significant extent in a State's participating student population, a State must, at a minimum—

        (i) Ensure that its definition of “languages other than English that are present to a significant extent in the participating student population” encompasses at least the most populous language other than English spoken by the State's participating student population;

        (ii) Consider languages other than English that are spoken by distinct populations of English learners, including English learners who are migratory, English learners who were not born in the United States, and English learners who are Native Americans; and

        (iii) Consider languages other than English that are spoken by a significant portion of the participating student population in one or more of a State's LEAs as well as languages spoken by a significant portion of the participating student population across grade levels.

        (g)  (1) A State must assess, using assessments written in English, the achievement of an English learner in meeting the State's reading/language arts academic standards if the student has attended schools in the United States, excluding Puerto Rico and, if applicable, students in Native American language schools or programs consistent with paragraph (j) of this section, for three or more consecutive years.

        (2) An LEA may continue, for no more than two additional consecutive years, to assess an English learner under paragraph (g)(1) of this section if the LEA determines, on a case-by-case individual basis, that the student has not reached a level of English language proficiency sufficient to yield valid and reliable information on what the student knows and can do on reading/language arts assessments written in English.

        (3) The requirements in paragraph (g)(1)-(2) of this section do not permit a State or LEA to exempt English learners from participating in the State assessment system.

        (h)  (1) Each State must—

        (i) Develop a uniform, valid, and reliable statewide assessment of English language proficiency, including reading, writing, speaking, and listening skills; and

        (ii) Require each LEA to use such assessment to assess annually the English language proficiency, including reading, writing, speaking, and listening skills, of all English learners in kindergarten through grade 12 in schools served by the LEA.

        (2) The assessment under paragraph (h)(1) of this section must—

        (i) Be aligned with the State's English language proficiency standards under section 1111(b)(1)(F) of the Act;

        (ii) Be developed and used consistent with the requirements of § 200.2(b)(2), (4), and (5); and

        (3) If a State develops a computer-adaptive assessment to measure English language proficiency, the State must ensure that the computer-adaptive assessment—

        (i) Assesses a student's language proficiency, which may include growth toward proficiency, in order to measure the student's acquisition of English; and

        (ii) Meets the requirements for English language proficiency assessments in paragraph (h) of this section.

        (4)(i) A State must provide appropriate accommodations that are necessary to measure a student's English language proficiency relative to the State's English language proficiency standards under section 1111(b)(1)(F) of the Act for each English learner covered under paragraph (a)(1)(i) or (iii) of this section.

        (ii) If an English learner has a disability that precludes assessment of the student in one or more domains of the English language proficiency assessment required under section 1111(b)(2)(G) of the Act such that there are no appropriate accommodations for the affected domain(s) (e.g., a non-verbal English learner who because of an identified disability cannot take the speaking portion of the assessment), as determined, on an individualized basis, by the student's IEP team, 504 team, or by the individual or team designated by the LEA to make these decisions under title II of the ADA, as specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, a State must assess the student's English language proficiency based on the remaining domains in which it is possible to assess the student.

        (5) A State must provide for an alternate English language proficiency assessment for each English learner covered under paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section who cannot participate in the assessment under paragraph (h)(1) of this section even with appropriate accommodations.

#### § § 200.25

        (a)  (1) The purpose of a schoolwide program is to improve academic achievement throughout a school so that all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students, demonstrate proficiency related to the challenging State academic standards under § 200.1.

        (2) The improved achievement is to result from improving the entire educational program of the school.

        (b)  (1) A school may operate a schoolwide program if—

        (i) The school's LEA determines that the school serves an eligible attendance area or is a participating school under section 1113 of the ESEA; and

        (ii) Except as provided under paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section, for the initial year of the schoolwide program—

        (A) The school serves a school attendance area in which not less than 40 percent of the children are from low-income families; or

        (B) Not less than 40 percent of the children enrolled in the school are from low-income families.

        (iii) A school that does not meet the poverty percentage in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section may operate a schoolwide program if the school receives a waiver from the State to do so, after taking into account how a schoolwide program will best serve the needs of the students in the school in improving academic achievement and other factors.

        (2) In determining the percentage of children from low-income families under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the LEA may use a measure of poverty that is different from the measure or measures of poverty used by the LEA to identify and rank school attendance areas for eligibility and participation under this subpart.

        (c)  A school operating a schoolwide program is not required to identify—

        (1) Particular children as eligible to participate; or

#### § § 200.78

        (a)(1) After reserving funds, as applicable, under § 200.77, including funds for equitable services for private school students, their teachers, and their families, an LEA must allocate funds under this subpart to school attendance areas and schools, identified as eligible and selected to participate under section 1113(a) or (b) of the ESEA, in rank order on the basis of the total number of public school children from low-income families in each area or school.

        (2) To determine the number of children from low-income families in a secondary school, an LEA must use—

        (i) The same measure of poverty it uses for elementary schools; or

        (ii) An accurate estimate of the number of students from low-income families by applying the average percentage of students from low-income families in the elementary school attendance areas that feed into the secondary school to the number of students enrolled in the secondary school if—

        (B) A majority of the secondary schools approve the use of this measure.

        (3) If an LEA ranks its school attendance areas and schools by grade span groupings, the LEA may determine the percentage of children from low-income families in the LEA as a whole or for each grade span grouping.

        (b)(1) Except as provided in paragraphs (b)(2) and (d) of this section, an LEA must allocate to each participating school attendance area or school an amount for each low-income child that is at least 125 percent of the per-pupil amount of funds the LEA received for that year under part A, subpart 2 of Title I. The LEA must calculate this per-pupil amount before it reserves funds under § 200.77, using the poverty measure selected by the LEA under section 1113(a)(5) of the ESEA.

        (2) If an LEA is serving only school attendance areas or schools in which the percentage of children from low-income families is 35 percent or more, the LEA is not required to allocate a per-pupil amount of at least 125 percent.

        (c) An LEA is not required to allocate the same per-pupil amount to each participating school attendance area or school provided the LEA allocates higher per-pupil amounts to areas or schools with higher concentrations of poverty than to areas or schools with lower concentrations of poverty.

        (d) An LEA may reduce the amount of funds allocated under this section to a school attendance area or school if the area or school is spending supplemental State or local funds for programs that meet the requirements in § 200.79(b).

        (e) If an LEA contains two or more counties in their entirety, the LEA must distribute to schools within each county a share of the LEA's total grant that is no less than the county's share of the child count used to calculate the LEA's grant.

      § 200.85   Responsibilities of SEAs for the electronic exchange through MSIX of specified educational and health information of migratory children.

#### § § 200.85

      (a)  In order to receive a grant of MEP funds, an SEA must collect, maintain, and submit to MSIX MDEs and otherwise exchange and use information on migratory children in accordance with the requirements of this section. Failure of an SEA to do so constitutes a failure under section 454 of the General Education Provisions Act, 20 U.S.C. 1234c, to comply substantially with a requirement of law applicable to the funds made available under the MEP.

      (b) —(1)  (i) In order to satisfy the requirements of paragraphs (b)(2) and (3) of this section, an SEA that receives a grant of MEP funds must submit electronically to MSIX the MDEs applicable to the child's age and grade level. An SEA must collect and submit the MDEs applicable to the child's age and grade level, regardless of the type of school in which the child is enrolled ( public, private, or home school), or whether a child is enrolled in any school.

      (ii) For migratory children who are or were enrolled in private schools, the SEA meets its responsibility under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section for collecting MDEs applicable to the child's age and grade level by advising the parent of the migratory child, or the migratory child if the child is emancipated, of the necessity of requesting the child's records from the private school, and by facilitating the parent or emancipated child's request to the private school that it provide all necessary information from the child's school records—

      (A) Directly to the parent or emancipated child, in which case the SEA must follow up directly with the parent or child; or

      (B) To the SEA, or a specific local operating agency, for forwarding to MSIX, in which case the SEA must follow up with the parent, emancipated child, or the private school to make sure that the records requested by the parent or emancipated child have been forwarded.

      (iii) For migratory children who are or were enrolled in home schools, the SEA meets its responsibility under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section for collecting MDEs applicable to the child's age and grade level by requesting these records, either directly or through a local operating agency, directly from the parent or emancipated child.

      (2)  No later than 90 calendar days after the effective date of these regulations, an SEA must collect and submit to MSIX each of the MDEs described in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section applicable to the child's age and grade level for every migratory child who is eligible to receive MEP services in the State on the effective date of these regulations, other than through continuation of services provided under section 1304(e) of the ESEA.

      (3)  An SEA must comply with the following timelines for subsequent data submissions throughout the entire calendar year whether or not local operating agencies or LEAs in the State are closed for summer or intersession periods.

      (i)  For every migratory child for whom an SEA approves a new Certificate of Eligibility under § 200.89(c) after the effective date of these regulations—

      (A) An SEA must collect and submit to MSIX the MDEs described in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section within 10 working days of approving a new Certificate of Eligibility for the migratory child. The SEA is not required to collect and submit MDEs in existence before its approval of a new Certificate of Eligibility for the child except as provided in paragraph (b)(3)(i)(B) of this section; and

      (B) An SEA that approves a new Certificate of Eligibility for a secondary school-aged migratory child must also—

      () Collect and submit to MSIX within _1_0 working days of approving a new Certificate of Eligibility for the child MDEs from the most recent secondary school in that State attended previously by the migratory child; and

      () Notify MSIX within 30 calendar days if one of its local operating agencies obtains records from a secondary school attended previously in another State by the migratory child.

      (ii)  (A) Within 30 calendar days of the end of an LEA's or local operating agency's fall, spring, summer, or intersession terms, an SEA must collect and submit to MSIX all MDE updates and newly available MDEs for migratory children who were eligible for the MEP during the term and for whom the SEA submitted data previously under paragraph (b)(2) or (b)(3)(i) of this section.

      (B) When a migratory child's MEP eligibility expires before the end of a school year, an SEA must submit all MDE updates and newly available MDEs for the child through the end of the school year.

      (iii)  (A) Within four working days of receiving notification from MSIX that a migratory child in its State has changed residence to a new local operating agency within the State or another SEA has approved a new Certificate of Eligibility for a migratory child, an SEA must collect and submit to MSIX all new MDEs and MDE updates that have become available to the SEA or one of its local operating agencies since the SEA's last submission of MDEs to MSIX for the child.

      (B) An SEA or local operating agency that does not yet have a new MDE or MDE update for a migratory child when it receives a change of residence notification from MSIX must submit the MDE to MSIX within four working days of the date that the SEA or one of its local operating agencies obtains the MDE.

      (c)  In order to facilitate school enrollment, grade and course placement, accrual of high school credits, and participation in the MEP, each SEA that receives a grant of MEP funds must—

      (1) Use, and require each of its local operating agencies to use, the Consolidated Student Record for all migratory children who have changed residence to a new school district within the State or in another State;

      (2) Encourage LEAs that are not local operating agencies receiving MEP funds to use the Consolidated Student Record for all migratory children described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section; and

      (3) Establish procedures, develop and disseminate guidance, and provide training in the use of Consolidated Student Records to SEA, local operating agency, and LEA personnel who have been designated by the SEA as authorized MSIX users under paragraph (f)(2) of this section.

      (d)  Each SEA that receives a grant of MEP funds must—

      (1) Use, and require each of its local operating agencies to use, reasonable and appropriate methods to ensure that all data submitted to MSIX are accurate and complete; and

      (2) Respond promptly, and ensure that each of its local operating agencies responds promptly, to any request by the Department for information needed to meet the Department's responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of data in MSIX in accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(6) and (g)(1)(C) or (D).

      (e)  Each SEA that receives a grant of MEP funds must establish and implement written procedures that allow a parent or guardian of a migratory child, or a migratory child, to ask the SEA to correct or determine the correctness of MSIX data. An SEA's written procedures must meet the following minimum requirements:

      (1)  (i) Within 30 calendar days of receipt of a data correction request from a parent, guardian, or migratory child, an SEA must—

      (A) Send a written or electronic acknowledgement to the requester;

      (B) Investigate the request;

      (C) Decide whether to revise the data as requested; and

      (D) Send the requester a written or electronic notice of the SEA's decision.

      (ii) If an SEA determines that data it submitted previously to MSIX should be corrected, the SEA must submit the revised data to MSIX within four working days of its decision to correct the data. An SEA is not required to notify MSIX if it decides not to revise the data as requested.

      (iii)(A) If a parent, guardian, or migratory child requests that an SEA correct or determine the correctness of data that was submitted to MSIX by another SEA, within four working days of receipt of the request, the SEA must send the data correction request to the SEA that submitted the data to MSIX.

      (B) An SEA that receives an MSIX data correction request from another SEA under this paragraph must respond as if it received the data correction request directly from the parent, guardian, or migratory child.

      (2)  An SEA or local operating agency that receives a request for information from an SEA that is responding to a parent's, guardian's, or migratory child's data correction request under paragraph (e)(1) of this section must respond in writing within ten working days of receipt of the request.

      (3)  An SEA must respond in writing within ten working days to a request from the Department for information needed by the Department to respond to an individual's request to correct or amend a Consolidated Student Record under the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, 5 U.S.C. 552a(d)(2) and 34 CFR 5b.7.

      (f)  Each SEA that receives a grant of MEP funds must—

      (1) Enter into and carry out its responsibilities in accordance with an MSIX MOU, an MSIX Interconnection Security Agreement, and other information technology agreements required by the Secretary in accordance with applicable Federal requirements;

      (2) Establish and implement written procedures to protect the integrity, security, and confidentiality of Consolidated Student Records, whether in electronic or print format, through appropriate administrative, technical, and physical safeguards established in accordance with the MSIX MOU and MSIX Interconnection Security Agreement. An SEA's written procedures must include, at a minimum, reasonable methods to ensure that—

      (3) Require all authorized users to complete the User Application Form approved by the Secretary before providing them access to MSIX. An SEA may also develop its own documentation for approving user access to MSIX provided that it contains the same information as the User Application Form approved by the Secretary; and

      (4) Retain the documentation required for approving user access to MSIX for three years after the date the SEA terminates the user's access.

      § 200.89   Re-interviewing; eligibility documentation; and quality control.

#### § § 200.89

      (a) [Reserved]

      (b) —(1)  (i) As a condition for the continued receipt of MEP funds in FY 2006 and subsequent years, an SEA under a corrective action issued by the Secretary under paragraph (b)(2)(vii) or (d)(7) of this section must, as required by the Secretary—

      (A) Conduct a statewide re-interviewing process consistent with paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section; and

      (B) Consistent with paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section, report to the Secretary on the procedures it has employed, its findings, its defect rate, and corrective actions it has taken or will take to avoid a recurrence of any problems found.

      (ii) At a minimum, the re-interviewing process must include—

      (A) Selection of a sample of identified migratory children (from the child counts of a particular year as directed by the Secretary) randomly selected on a statewide basis to allow the State to estimate the statewide proportion of eligible migratory children at a 95 percent confidence level with a confidence interval of plus or minus 5 percent.

      (B) Use of independent re-interviewers (i.e., interviewers who are neither SEA or local operating agency staff members working to administer or operate the State MEP nor any other persons who worked on the initial eligibility determinations being tested) trained to conduct personal interviews and to understand and apply program eligibility requirements; and

      (C) Calculation of a defect rate based on the number of sampled children determined ineligible as a percentage of those sampled children whose parent/guardian was actually re-interviewed.

      (iii) At a minimum, the report must include—

      (A) An explanation of the sample and procedures used in the SEA's re-interviewing process;

      (B) The findings of the re-interviewing process, including the determined defect rate;

      (C) An acknowledgement that the Secretary may adjust the child counts for 2000-2001 and subsequent years downward based on the defect rate that the Secretary accepts;

      (D) A summary of the types of defective eligibility determinations that the SEA identified through the re-interviewing process;

      (E) A summary of the reasons why each type of defective eligibility determination occurred; and

      (F) A summary of the corrective actions the SEA will take to address the identified problems.

      (2)  As part of the system of quality controls identified in paragraph (d) of this section, an SEA that receives MEP funds must annually validate child eligibility determinations from the current performance reporting period (September 1 to August 31) through re-interviews for a randomly selected sample of children identified as migratory during the same performance reporting period. In conducting these re-interviews, an SEA must—

      (i) Except as specified in paragraphs (b)(2)(i)(A) and (B) of this section, use one or more re-interviewers who may be SEA or local operating agency staff members working to administer or operate the State MEP, or any other person trained to conduct personal interviews and to understand and apply program eligibility requirements, but who did not work on the initial eligibility determinations being tested;

      (A) At least once every three years until September 1, 2020, SEAs must use one or more independent re-interviewers ( interviewers who are neither SEA nor local operating agency staff members working to administer or operate the State MEP nor any other persons who worked on the initial eligibility determinations being tested and who are trained to conduct personal interviews and to understand and apply program eligibility requirements).

      (B) Beginning September 1, 2020, an SEA must use one or more independent re-interviewers to validate child eligibility determinations made during one of the first three full performance reporting periods (September 1 through August 31) following the effective date of a major statutory or regulatory change that directly impacts child eligibility (as determined by the Secretary). Therefore, the entire sample of eligibility determinations to be tested by independent re-interviewers must be drawn from children determined to be eligible in a single performance period, based on eligibility requirements that include the major statutory or regulatory change.

      (ii) Select a random sample of identified migratory children so that a sufficient number of eligibility determinations in the current performance reporting period are tested on a statewide basis or within categories associated with identified risk factors ( experience of recruiters, size or growth in local migratory child population, effectiveness of local quality control procedures) in order to help identify possible problems with the State's child eligibility determinations;

      (iii) Conduct re-interviews with the parents or guardians of the children in the sample. States must use a face-to-face approach to conduct these re-interviews unless circumstances make face-to-face re-interviews impractical and necessitate the use of an alternative method such as telephone re-interviewing;

      (iv) Determine and document in writing whether the child eligibility determination and the information on which the determination was based were true and correct;

      (v) Stop serving any children found not to be eligible and remove them from the data base used to compile counts of eligible children;

      (vi) Certify and report to the Department the results of re-interviewing in the SEA's annual report of the number of migratory children in the State required by the Secretary; and

      (vii) Implement corrective actions or improvements to address the problems identified by the State (including the identification and removal of other ineligible children in the total population), and any corrective actions, including retrospective re-interviewing, required by the Secretary.

      (c)  (1) An SEA and its operating agencies must use the Certificate of Eligibility (COE) form established by the Secretary to document the State's determination of the eligibility of migratory children.

      (2) In addition to the form required under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the SEA and its operating agencies must maintain any additional documentation the SEA requires to confirm that each child found eligible for this program meets all of the eligibility definitions in section 1309 of the ESEA and § 200.81.

      (3) An SEA is responsible for the accuracy of all the determinations of the eligibility of migratory children identified in the State.

      (d)  An SEA must establish and implement a system of quality controls for the proper identification and recruitment of eligible migratory children on a statewide basis. At a minimum, this system of quality controls must include the following components:

      (1) Training to ensure that recruiters and all other staff involved in determining eligibility and in conducting quality control procedures know the requirements for accurately determining and documenting child eligibility under the MEP.

      (2) Supervision and annual review and evaluation of the identification and recruitment practices of individual recruiters.

      (3) A formal process for resolving eligibility questions raised by recruiters and their supervisors and for ensuring that this information is communicated to all local operating agencies.

      (4) An examination by qualified individuals at the SEA or local operating agency level of each COE to verify that the written documentation is sufficient and that, based on the recorded data, the child is eligible for MEP services.

      (5) A process for the SEA to validate that eligibility determinations were properly made, including conducting prospective re-interviewing as described in paragraph (b)(2).

      (6) Documentation that supports the SEA's implementation of this quality-control system and of a record of actions taken to improve the system where periodic reviews and evaluations indicate a need to do so.

      (7) A process for implementing corrective action if the SEA finds COEs that do not sufficiently document a child's eligibility for the MEP, or in response to internal State audit findings and recommendations, or monitoring or audit findings of the Secretary.

        (iii) Provide appropriate accommodations consistent with § 200.6(b) and (f)(1)(i) and section 1111(b)(2)(B)(vii) of the Act;

        (6) For purposes of the State accountability system consistent with section 1111(c)(4)(E) of the Act, annually measure in each participating school progress on the Academic Achievement indicator under section 1111(c)(4)(B) of the Act of at least 95 percent of all students, and 95 percent of students in each subgroup of students described in section 1111(c)(2) of the Act, who are required to take such assessments consistent with paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section;

        (7) Generate an annual summative determination of achievement, using the annual data from the innovative assessment, for each student in a participating school in the demonstration authority that describes—

        (i) The student's mastery of the challenging State academic standards under section 1111(b)(1) of the Act for the grade in which the student is enrolled; or

        (ii) In the case of a student with the most significant cognitive disabilities assessed with an alternate assessment aligned with alternate academic achievement standards under section 1111(b)(1)(E) of the Act, the student's mastery of those standards;

        (8) Provide disaggregated results by each subgroup of students described in § 200.2(b)(11)(i)(A)-(I) and sections 1111(b)(2)(B)(xi) and 1111(h)(1)(C)(ii) of the Act, including timely data for teachers, principals and other school leaders, students, and parents consistent with § 200.8 and section 1111(b)(2)(B)(x) and (xii) and section 1111(h) of the Act, and provide results to parents in a manner consistent with paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section and § 200.2(e); and

        (9) Provide an unbiased, rational, and consistent determination of progress toward the State's long-term goals for academic achievement under section 1111(c)(4)(A) of the Act for all students and each subgroup of students described in section 1111(c)(2) of the Act and a comparable measure of student performance on the Academic Achievement indicator under section 1111(c)(4)(B) of the Act for participating schools relative to non-participating schools so that the SEA may validly and reliably aggregate data from the system for purposes of meeting requirements for—

        (i) Accountability under sections 1003 and 1111(c) and (d) of the Act, including how the SEA will identify participating and non-participating schools in a consistent manner for comprehensive and targeted support and improvement under section 1111(c)(4)(D) of the Act; and

        (ii) Reporting on State and LEA report cards under section 1111(h) of the Act.

#### § § 222.17

      (a) The Secretary determines that repayment of an eligible overpayment will result in undue financial hardship on an LEA and seriously harm its educational program if the LEA meets the requirements in paragraph (a)(1), (2), or (3) of this section.

      (1) An LEA other than an LEA described in paragraphs (a)(2) and (3) of this section meets the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section if—

      (i) The LEA's eligible overpayments on the date of its request total at least $10,000;

      (ii) The LEA's local real property tax rate for current expenditure purposes, for the preceding fiscal year, is equal to or higher than the State average local real property tax rate for that preceding fiscal year; and

      (iii) The LEA's average per pupil expenditure (APPE) (as described in § 222.16(a)(4)) for the preceding fiscal year is lower than the State APPE (as described in § 222.16(a)(5)) for that preceding fiscal year.

      (2) The following LEAs qualify under paragraph (a) of this section if they meet the requirements in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section and their APPE (as described in § 222.16(a)(4)) for the preceding fiscal year does not exceed 125 percent of the State APPE (as described in § 222.16(a)(5)) for that preceding fiscal year:

      (i) An LEA with boundaries that are the same as a Federal military installation.

      (ii) Other LEAs with no local real property tax revenues, or with minimal local real property tax revenues per pupil due to substantial amounts of Federal property in the LEA as compared with the average amount of those revenues per pupil for all LEAs in the State.

      (3) An LEA qualifies under paragraph (a) of this section if neither the successor nor the predecessor LEA has the present or prospective ability to repay the eligible overpayment.

      (b) The Secretary uses the following methods to determine a tax rate for the purposes of paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section:

      (1) If an LEA is fiscally independent, the Secretary uses actual tax rates if all the real property in the taxing jurisdiction of the LEA is assessed at the same percentage of true value. In the alternative, the Secretary computes a tax rate for fiscally independent LEAs by using the methods described in §§ 222.67-222.69.

      (2) If an LEA is fiscally dependent, the Secretary imputes a tax rate using the method described in § 222.70(b).

      (a)  The Secretary forgives the eligible overpayment in whole if the Secretary determines that the LEA meets—

      (1) The requirements of § 222.17 (undue financial hardship), and the LEA's current expenditure closing balance for the LEA's fiscal year immediately preceding the date of its forgiveness request (“preceding fiscal year”) is ten percent or less of its total current expenditures (TCE) for that year; or

      (2) The manifestly unjust repayment exception in § 222.14(c)(2).

      (b)  (1) The Secretary forgives the eligible overpayment in part if the Secretary determines that the LEA meets the requirements of § 222.17 (undue financial hardship), and the LEA's preceding fiscal year's current expenditure closing balance is more than ten percent of its TCE for that year.

      (b) “Federal property” described in section 8002(d) (certain transferred property) is considered to be owned by the United States for the purpose of paragraph (a) of this section.

      (c) If, during any fiscal year, the United States sells, transfers, is otherwise divested of ownership of, or relinquishes an interest in or restriction on, eligible Federal property, the Secretary redetermines the LEA's eligibility for the following fiscal year, based upon the remaining eligible Federal property, in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section.

#### § § 222.22

      (a) An LEA with an otherwise approvable application is eligible to receive assistance under section 8002 for a fiscal year only if the LEA meets the requirements in subpart A of these regulations and § 222.21, and is not substantially compensated, for the loss in revenue resulting from Federal ownership of real property by increases in revenue accruing to the LEA during the previous fiscal year from Federal activities with respect to the eligible Federal property in the LEA.

      (b) The Secretary considers that an LEA is substantially compensated by increases in revenue from Federal activities with respect to the eligible Federal property if—

      (1) The LEA received revenue during the preceding fiscal year that is generated from activities in or on the eligible Federal property; and

      (2) The revenue described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section equals or exceeds the maximum payment amount under section 8002(b) for the fiscal year for which the LEA seeks assistance.

      (c) If an LEA described in paragraph (a) of this section received revenue described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section during the preceding fiscal year that, when added to the LEA's projected total section 8002 payment for the fiscal year for which the LEA seeks assistance, exceeds the maximum payment amount under section 8002(b) for the fiscal year for which the LEA seeks assistance, the Secretary reduces the LEA's projected section 8002 payment by an amount equal to that excess amount.

      (d) For purposes of this section, the amount of revenue that an LEA receives during the previous fiscal year from activities conducted on Federal property includes payments received by any Federal agency due to activities on Federal property, including forestry, mining, and grazing, but does not include revenue from:

      § 222.23   How are consolidated LEAs treated for the purposes of eligibility and payment under section 7002?

#### § § 222.23

      (a)  An LEA formed by the consolidation of one or more LEAs is eligible for section 7002 funds, notwithstanding section 222.21(a)(1), if—

      (1) The consolidation occurred prior to fiscal year 1995 or after fiscal year 2005; and

      (2) At least one of the former LEAs included in the consolidation:

      (i) Was eligible for section 7002 funds in the fiscal year prior to the consolidation; and

      (ii) Currently contains Federal property that meets the requirements of § 222.21(a) within the boundaries of the former LEA or LEAs.

      (b)  In the first year of application following the consolidation, an LEA that meets the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section must submit evidence that it meets the requirements of paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2)(ii) of this section.

      (c)  (1) The foundation payment for a consolidated district is based on the total section 7002 payment for the last fiscal year for which the former LEA received payment. When more than one former LEA qualifies under paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the payments for the last fiscal year for which the former LEAs received payment are added together to calculate the foundation basis.

      (2) Consolidated LEAs receive only a foundation payment and do not receive a payment from any remaining funds.

      § 222.24   How does a local educational agency that has multiple tax rates for real property classifications derive a single real property tax rate?

#### § § 222.24

      An LEA that has multiple tax rates for real property classifications derives a single tax rate for the purposes of determining its Section 7002 maximum payment by dividing the total revenues for current expenditures it received from local real property taxes by the total taxable value of real property located within the boundaries of the LEA. These data are from the fiscal year prior to the fiscal year in which the applicant seeks assistance.

#### § § 222.35

      An applicant counts the membership of its federally connected children using one of the following methods:

      (a) Parent-pupil survey. An applicant may conduct a parent-pupil survey to count the membership of its federally connected children, which must be counted as of the survey date.

      (1) The applicant shall conduct a parent-pupil survey by providing a form to a parent of each pupil enrolled in the LEA to substantiate the pupil's place of residence and the parent's place of employment.

      (2) A parent-pupil survey form must include the following:

      (i) Pupil enrollment information (this information may also be obtained from school records), including—

      (A) Name of pupil;

      (B) Date of birth of the pupil; and

      (C) Name of public school and grade of the pupil.

      (ii) Pupil residence information, including:

      (B) If the pupil's residence is on Federal property, the name of the Federal facility.

      (3) If any of the following circumstances apply, the parent-pupil survey form must also include the following:

      (i) If the parent is employed on Federal property, except for a parent who is a member of the uniformed services on active duty, parent employment information, including—

      (A) Name (as it appears on the employer's payroll record) of the parent (mother, father, legal guardian or other person standing ) who is employed on Federal property and with whom the pupil resides; and

      (B) Name of employer, name and complete address of the Federal property on which the parent is employed (or other acceptable location information, such as a complete legal description or acceptable certification by a Federal agency).

      (ii) If the parent is a member of the uniformed services on active duty, the name, rank, and branch of service of that parent.

      (iii) If the parent is both an official of, and accredited by a foreign government, and a foreign military officer, the name, rank, and country of service.

      (iv) If the parent is a civilian employed on a Federal vessel, the name of the vessel, hull number, homeport, and name of the controlling agency.

      (4)(i) Every parent-pupil survey form must include the signature of the parent supplying the information, except as provided in paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of this section, and the date of such signature, which must be on or after the survey date.

      (ii) An LEA may accept an unsigned parent-pupil survey form, or a parent-pupil survey form that is signed by a person other than a parent, only under unusual circumstances. In those instances, the parent-pupil survey form must show why the parent did not sign the survey form, and when, how, and from whom the residence and employment information was obtained. Unusual circumstances may include, but are not limited to:

      (A) A pupil who, on the survey date, resided with a person without full legal guardianship of the child while the pupil's parent or parents were deployed for military duty. In this case, the person with whom the child is residing may sign the parent-pupil survey form.

      (B) A pupil who, on the survey date, was a ward of the juvenile justice system. In this case, an administrator of the institution where the pupil was held on the survey date may sign the parent-pupil survey form.

      (C) A pupil who, on the survey date, was an emancipated youth may sign his or her own parent-pupil survey form.

      (D) A pupil who, on the survey date, was at least 18 years old but who was not past the 12th grade may sign his or her own parent-pupil survey form.

      (iii) The Department does not accept a parent-pupil survey form signed by an employee of the school district who is not the student's mother, father, legal guardian or other person standing

      (b) Source check. A source check is a type of survey tool that groups children being claimed on the Impact Aid application by Federal property. This form is used in lieu of the parent-pupil survey form to substantiate a pupil's place of residence or parent's place of employment on the survey date.

      (1) The source check must include sufficient information to determine the eligibility of the Federal property and the individual children claimed on the form.

      (2) A source check may also include:

      (3) An LEA's ADA count includes attendance data for children who do not attend the LEA's schools, but for whom it makes tuition arrangements with other educational entities.

      (4) Data are not counted for any child—

      (i) Who is not physically present at school for the daily minimum time period required by the State, unless the child is—

      (A) Participating via telecommunication or correspondence course programs that meet State standards; or

      (B) Being served by a State-approved homebound instruction program for the daily minimum time period appropriate for the child; or

      (ii) Attending the applicant's schools under a tuition arrangement with another LEA.

      (c) An LEA may determine its average daily attendance calculation in one of the following ways:

      (1) If an LEA is in a State that collects actual ADA data for purposes of distributing State aid for education, the Secretary calculates the ADA of that LEA's federally connected children for the current fiscal year payment as follows:

      (i) By dividing the ADA of all the LEA's children for the second preceding fiscal year by the LEA's total membership on its survey date for the second preceding fiscal year (or, in the case of an LEA that conducted two membership counts in the second preceding fiscal year, by the average of the LEA's total membership on the two survey dates); and

      (ii) By multiplying the figure determined in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section by the LEA's total membership of federally connected children in each subcategory described in section 7003 and claimed in the LEA's application for the current fiscal year payment.

      (2) An LEA may submit its total preceding year ADA data. The Secretary uses these data to calculate the ADA of the LEA's federally connected children by—

      (i) Dividing the LEA's preceding year's total ADA data by the preceding year's total membership data; and

      (ii) Multiplying the figure determined in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section by the LEA's total membership of federally connected children as described in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section.

      (3) An LEA may submit attendance data based on sampling conducted during the previous fiscal year.

      (i) The sampling must include attendance data for all children for at least 30 school days.

      (ii) The data must be collected during at least three periods evenly distributed throughout the school year.

      (iii) Each collection period must consist of at least five consecutive school days.

      (iv) The Secretary uses these data to calculate the ADA of the LEA's federally connected children by—

      (A) Determining the ADA of all children in the sample;

      (B) Dividing the figure obtained in paragraph (c)(3)(iv)(A) of this section by the LEA's total membership for the previous fiscal year; and

      (C) Multiplying the figure determined in paragraph (c)(3)(iv)(B) of this section by the LEA's total membership of federally connected children for the current fiscal year, as described in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section.

      (d) An SEA may submit data to calculate the average daily attendance calculation for the LEAs in that State in one of the following ways:

      (1) If the SEA distributes State aid for education based on data similar to attendance data, the SEA may request that the Secretary use those data to calculate the ADA of each LEA's federally connected children. If the Secretary determines that those data are, in effect, equivalent to attendance data, the Secretary allows use of the requested data and determines the method by which the ADA for all of the LEA's federally connected children will be calculated.

      (2) An SEA may submit data necessary for the Secretary to calculate a State average attendance ratio for all LEAs in the State by submitting the total ADA and total membership data for the State for each of the last three most recent fiscal years that ADA data were collected. The Secretary uses these data to calculate the ADA of the federally connected children for each LEA in the State by—

      (i)(A) Dividing the total ADA data by the total membership data for each of the three fiscal years and averaging the results; and

      (B) Multiplying the average determined in paragraph (d)(2)(i)(A) of this section by the LEA's total membership of federally connected children as described in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section.

      (e) The Secretary may calculate a State average attendance ratio in States with LEAs that would benefit from such calculation by using the methodology in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section.

      § 222.38   What is the maximum basic support payment that a local educational agency may receive under section 8003(b)(1)?

#### § § 222.38

      (a) The maximum basic support payment that an LEA may receive under section 8003(b)(1) for any fiscal year is the sum of its total weighted student units under section 8003(a)(2) for the federally connected children eligible to be counted as the basis for payment, multiplied by the greater of the following:

      (1) One-half of the State average per pupil expenditure for the third fiscal year preceding the fiscal year for which the LEA seeks assistance.

      (2) One-half of the national average per pupil expenditure for the third fiscal year preceding the fiscal year for which the LEA seeks assistance.

      (3) The local contribution rate (LCR) based on generally comparable LEAs determined in accordance with §§ 222.39-222.41.

      (4) The State average per pupil expenditure for the third preceding fiscal year multiplied by the local contribution percentage as defined in section 8013(8) of the Act for that same year.

      (b) If satisfactory data from the third preceding fiscal year are not available for the expenditures described in paragraphs (a)(1) or (2), the Secretary uses data from the most recent fiscal year for which data that are satisfactory to the Secretary are available.

      § 222.39   How does a State educational agency identify generally comparable local educational agencies for local contribution rate purposes?

#### § § 222.39

      (a) To identify generally comparable LEAs within its State for LCR purposes, the State educational agency (SEA) for that State, after appropriate consultation with the applicant LEAs in the State, shall use data from the third fiscal year preceding the fiscal year for which the LCR is being computed to group all of its LEAs, including all applicant LEAs, as follows:

      (1)  Divide all LEAs into groups that serve the same grade span and then subdivide the grade span groups by legal classification, if the Secretary considers this classification relevant and sufficiently different from grade span within the State. As an alternative grade-span division, divide all LEAs into elementary, secondary, or unified grade-span groups, as appropriate, within the State.

      (2)  (i) Divide all LEAs into groups by grade span (or the alternative grade-span groups described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section) and legal classification, if relevant and sufficiently different from grade span and size.

      (ii) List all LEAs within each group in descending order by size as measured by ADA, placing the LEA with the  ADA at the top of the list. A State that does not tabulate actual annual ADA shall use the same formula for establishing ADA for the purpose of ranking LEAs by size as the Department has approved for the purpose of calculating payments under section 8003 for applicant LEAs in the State.

      (iii) Divide each group into either two subgroups or three subgroups.

      (iv) To determine the subgroups, divide each list at the point(s) that will result in as nearly equal numbers of LEAs in each subgroup as possible, so that no group is more than one LEA larger than any other group.

      (3)  Divide all LEAs into groups by grade span (or the alternative grade-span groups described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section) and, if relevant and sufficiently different from grade span and location, legal classification; then subdivide these groups by location, as determined by placement inside or outside a metropolitan statistical area (MSA) as defined by the U.S. Bureau of the Census. The Department will supply SEAs with lists of MSA classifications for their LEAs, and only the classifications on those lists will be recognized by the Department for the purposes of these regulations.

      (4)  (i) Divide all LEAs into groups by grade span (or the alternative grade-span groups described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section) and, if relevant and sufficiently different from grade span, size, and location, legal classification; then subdivide these groups by size (into two or three subgroups for each grade span, as described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section); and further subdivide these groups by location (inside or outside an MSA).

      (ii) In using both the size and location factors, the SEA shall subdivide according to the size factor before the location factor.

      (b) After applying the following restrictions, the SEA shall compute an LCR according to the provisions of § 222.41 for each group of generally comparable LEAs identified under paragraph (a) of this section, as follows:

      (1) The SEA shall not, when computing an LCR, include the following “significantly impacted” LEAs in any group of generally comparable LEAs:

      (i) Any LEA having—in the third fiscal year preceding the fiscal year for which the LCR is being computed—20 percent or more of its ADA composed of children identified under section 8003(a)(1)(A)-(C).

      (ii) Any LEA having—in the third fiscal year preceding the fiscal year for which the LCR is being computed—50 percent or more of its ADA composed of children identified under section 8003(a)(1)(A)-(G) who were eligible under § 222.36 to be counted as the basis for payment under section 8003.

      (2) The SEA may not compute an LCR for any group that contains fewer than 10 LEAs.

      (c) The LCR for a “significantly impacted” LEA described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section is the LCR of any group in which that LEA would be included based on grade span/legal classification, size, location, or a combination of these factors, if the LEA were not excluded as significantly impacted.

      (d) This section does not apply to applicant LEAs located in—

      (1) Puerto Rico;

      (2) Wake Island;

      (3) Guam;

      (4) American Samoa;

      (5) Any outlying area; and

      (6) Any State in which there is only one LEA.

      § 222.40   What procedures does a State educational agency use for certain local educational agencies to determine generally comparable local educational agencies using additional factors, for local contribution rate purposes?

#### § § 222.40

      (a) To use the procedures in this section, the applicant LEA, for the year of application, must either—

      (1)(i) Be located entirely on Federal land; and

      (ii) Be raising either no local revenues or an amount of local revenues the Secretary determines to be minimal; or

      (2)(i) Be located in a State where State aid makes up no more than 40 percent of the State average per pupil expenditure in the third fiscal year preceding the fiscal year for which the LCR is being computed;

      (ii) In its application, have federally connected children identified under section 8003(a)(1)(A)-(C) equal to at least 20 percent of its total ADA; and

      (iii) In its application, have federally connected children identified under section 8003(a)(1)(A)-(G) who were eligible to be counted as the basis for payment under section 8003 equal to at least 50 percent of its total ADA.

      (b) If requested by an applicant LEA described in paragraph (a) of this section, the SEA follows the procedures in this section, in consultation with the LEA, to determine generally comparable LEAs using additional factors for the purpose of calculating and certifying an LCR for that LEA.

      (c) The SEA identifies—

      (1) The subgroup of generally comparable LEAs from the group identified under § 222.39(a)(2) (grouping by grade span/legal classification and size) that includes the applicant LEA; or

      (2) For an LEA described in paragraph (a) of this section that serves a different span of grades from all other LEAs in its State (and therefore cannot match any group of generally comparable LEAs under § 222.39(a)(2)), for purposes of this section only, a group using only legal classification and size as measured by ADA.

      (d) From the subgroup described in paragraph (c) of this section, the SEA then identifies 10 or more generally comparable LEAs that share one or more additional common factors of general comparability with the applicant LEA described in paragraph (a) of this section, as follows:

      (1)(i) The SEA must consider one or more generally accepted, objectively defined factors that affect the applicant's cost of educating its children. Examples of such cost-related factors include location inside or outside an MSA, an unusually large geographical area or an economically depressed area, sparsity or density of population, and the percentage of its students who are from low-income families or who are children with disabilities, neglected or delinquent children, low-achieving children, or children with limited English proficiency.

      (ii) The SEA may not consider cost-related factors that can be varied at the discretion of the applicant LEA or its generally comparable LEAs or factors dependent on the wealth of the applicant LEA or its generally comparable LEAs. Examples of factors that may not be considered include special alternative curricular programs, pupil-teacher ratio, and per pupil expenditures.

      (iii) If an SEA proposes to use one or more special additional factors to determine generally comparable LEAs, the SEA must submit, with its annual submission of generally comparable data to the Department, its rationale for selecting the additional factor or factors and describe how they affect the cost of education in the LEA.

      (2) The SEA applies the factor or factors of general comparability identified under paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section in one of the following ways in order to identify 10 or more generally comparable LEAs for the eligible applicant LEA, none of which may be significantly impacted LEAs:

      (i) The SEA identifies all of the LEAs in the group to which the eligible applicant LEA belongs under § 222.39(a)(2) that share the factor or factors. If the subgroup containing the eligible applicant LEA includes at least 10 other LEAs (excluding significantly impacted LEAs), it will be the eligible applicant LEA's new group of generally comparable LEAs. The SEA computes the LCR for the eligible applicant LEA using the data for all of the LEAs in the subgroup except the eligible applicant LEA.

      (ii) After the SEA identifies all of the LEAs in the group to which the eligible applicant LEA belongs under § 222.39(a)(2) that share the factor or factors, the SEA then systematically orders by ADA all of the LEAs in the group that includes the eligible applicant LEA. The SEA may further divide the ordered LEAs into subgroups by using logical division points ( the median, quartiles, or standard deviations) or a continuous interval of the ordered LEAs ( a percentage or a numerical range). If the subgroup containing the eligible applicant LEA includes at least 10 other LEAs (excluding significantly impacted LEAs), it will be the eligible applicant LEA's new group of generally comparable LEAs. The SEA computes the LCR for the eligible applicant LEA using the data for all of the LEAs in the subgroup except the eligible applicant LEA.

      (iii) The SEA may apply more than one factor of general comparability in identifying a new group of 10 or more generally comparable LEAs for the eligible applicant LEA. If the subgroup containing the eligible applicant LEA includes at least 10 other LEAs (excluding significantly impacted LEAs), it will be the eligible applicant LEA's new group of generally comparable LEAs. The SEA computes the LCR for the eligible applicant LEA using the data from all of the LEAs in the subgroup except the eligible applicant LEA.

      (e)(1) Using the new group of generally comparable LEAs selected under paragraph (d) of this section, the SEA computes the LCR for the eligible applicant LEA according to the provisions of § 222.41.

      (2) The SEA certifies the resulting LCR by submitting that LCR to the Secretary and providing the Secretary a description of the additional factor or factors of general comparability and the data used to identify the new group of generally comparable LEAs.

      (3) The Secretary reviews the data submitted by the SEA, and accepts the LCR for the purpose of use under section 8003(b)(1)(C)(iii) in determining the LEA's maximum payment under section 8003 if the Secretary determines that it meets the purposes and requirements of the Act and this part.

      § 222.41   How does a State educational agency compute and certify local contribution rates based upon generally comparable local educational agencies?

#### § § 222.41

      Except as otherwise specified in the Act, the SEA, subject to the Secretary's review and approval, computes and certifies an LCR for each group of generally comparable LEAs within its State that was identified using the factors in § 222.39, and § 222.40 if appropriate, as follows:

      (a)(1) The SEA shall compile the aggregate local current expenditures of the comparable LEAs in each group for the third fiscal year preceding the fiscal year for which the LCR is being computed.

      (2) For purposes of this section, the SEA shall consider only those aggregate current expenditures made by the generally comparable LEAs from revenues derived from local sources. No State or Federal funds may be included.

      (b) The SEA shall compile the aggregate number of children in ADA to whom the generally comparable LEAs in each group provided a free public education during the third fiscal year preceding the fiscal year for which the LCR is being computed.

      (c) The SEA shall divide—

      (1) The aggregate current expenditures determined under paragraph (a) of this section by;

      (2) The aggregate number of children determined under paragraph (b) of this section.

      (d) The SEA certifies the resulting figure for each group as the LCR for that group of generally comparable LEAs to be used by the Secretary under section 8003(b)(1)(C)(iii) in determining the LEA's maximum payment amount under section 8003.

      An LEA is eligible for financial assistance under section 8003(b)(1)(F) if the Secretary determines that the LEA meets all of the following requirements—

      (a)(1) The LEA is eligible for a basic support payment under section 8003(b), including meeting the maintenance of effort requirements in section 8003(g) of the Act;

      (2) The LEA timely applies for assistance under section 8003(b)(1)(F) and meets all other requirements of subparts A and C;

      (3) The LEA is meeting the tax rate requirement in § 222.68(c) and the other applicable requirements of §§ 222.68 through 222.72; and

      (4) The LEA is not in a State that takes the LEA's payment under section 8003(b)(1)(F) into account in an equalization program that qualifies under section 8009 of the Act.

      (b)(1) As part of its section 8003 application, the LEA indicates in writing that it wishes to apply for an “unusual geographic” payment and it will provide the Secretary with documentation upon request that demonstrates that the LEA is unable to provide a level of education equivalent to that provided by its generally comparable LEAs because—

      (i) The applicant's current expenditures are affected by unusual geographic factors; and

      (ii) As a result, those current expenditures are not reasonably comparable to the current expenditures of its generally comparable LEAs.

      (2) The LEA's documentation must include—

      (i) A specific description of the unusual geographic factors on which the applicant is basing its request for compensation under this section and objective data demonstrating that the applicant is more severely affected by the factors than any other LEA in its State;

      (ii) Objective data demonstrating the specific ways in which the unusual geographic factors affect the applicant's current expenditures so that they are not reasonably comparable to the current expenditures of its generally comparable LEAs;

      (iii) Objective data demonstrating the specific ways in which the unusual geographic factors prevent the applicant from providing a level of education equivalent to that provided by its generally comparable LEAs; and

      (iv) Any other information that the Secretary may require to make an eligibility determination under this section.

      § 222.53   What restrictions and requirements apply to the use of funds provided under section 8003(d)?

#### § § 222.53

      (a) An LEA shall use funds provided under section 8003(d) in accordance with the provisions of section 8003(d)(2) and 34 CFR parts 300 and 303.

      (b) Obligations and expenditures of section 8003(d) funds may be incurred in either of the two following ways:

      (1) An LEA may obligate or expend section 8003(d) funds for the fiscal year for which the funds were appropriated.

      (2) An LEA may reimburse itself for obligations or expenditures of local and general State aid funds for the fiscal year for which the section 8003(d) funds were appropriated.

      (c) An LEA shall use its section 8003(d) funds for the following types of expenditures:

      (1) Expenditures that are reasonably related to the conduct of programs or projects for the free appropriate public education of, or early intervention services for, federally connected children with disabilities, which may include—

      (i) Program planning and evaluation; and

      (ii) Construction of or alteration to existing school facilities, but only when in accordance with section 605 of the IDEA and when the Secretary authorizes in writing those uses of funds.

      (2) Acquisition cost (net invoice price) of equipment required for the free appropriate public education of, and early intervention services for, federally connected children with disabilities.

      (i) If section 8003(d) funds are used for the acquisition of any equipment described in this paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the fair market value of any financial advantage realized through rebates, discounts, bonuses, free pieces of equipment used in a program or project for the free appropriate public education of, or early intervention services for, federally connected children with disabilities, or other circumstances, is not an allowable expenditure and may not be credited as an expenditure of those funds.

      (ii) Funds awarded under the provisions of section 8003(d) may be used to acquire equipment for the free appropriate public education of, or early intervention services for, the federally connected children with disabilities only if title to the equipment would be in the applicant agency.

      (d) An LEA shall account for the use of section 8003(d) funds as follows:

      (1) By recording, for each fiscal year, the receipt (or credit) of section 8003(d) funds separately from other funds received under the Act, , on a line item basis in the general fund account or in a separate account; and

      (2) By demonstrating that, for each fiscal year, the amount of expenditures for special education and related services and for early intervention services provided to the federally connected children with disabilities is at least equal to the amount of section 8003(d) funds received or credited for that fiscal year. This is done as follows:

      (i) For each fiscal year determine the amount of an LEA's expenditures for special education and related services and for early intervention services provided to all children with disabilities.

      (ii) The amount determined in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section is divided by the average daily attendance (ADA) of the total number of children with disabilities the LEA served during that fiscal year.

      (iii) The amount determined in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section is then multiplied by the total ADA of the LEA's federally connected children with disabilities claimed by the LEA for that fiscal year.

      (3) If the amount of section 8003(d) funds the LEA received (or was credited) for the fiscal year exceeds the amount obtained in paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this section, an overpayment equal to the excess section 8003(d) funds is established. This overpayment may be reduced or eliminated to the extent that the LEA can demonstrate that the average per pupil expenditure for special education and related services and for early intervention services provided to federally connected children with disabilities exceeded its average per pupil expenditure for serving non-federally connected children with disabilities.

      § 222.54   What supplement-not-supplant requirement applies to this subpart?

#### § § 222.54

      Funds provided under section 8003(d) may not supplant any State funds that were or would have been available to the LEA for the free appropriate public education of children counted under section 8003(d).

      (a) No section 8003(d) funds may be paid to an LEA whose per pupil State aid for federally connected children with disabilities, either general State aid or special education State aid, has been or would be reduced as a result of eligibility for or receipt of section 8003(d) funds, whether or not a State has a program of State aid that meets the requirements of section 8009 of the Act and subpart K of the regulations in this part.

      (1) A reduction in the per pupil amount of State aid for children with disabilities, including children counted under section 8003(d), from that received in a previous year raises a presumption that supplanting has occurred.

      (2) The LEA may rebut this presumption by demonstrating that the reduction was unrelated to the receipt of section 8003(d) funds.

      (b) In any State in which there is only one LEA, all funds for programs, and for early intervention services, for children with disabilities other than funds from Federal sources are considered by the Secretary to be local funds.

**Source:** Source: 80 FR 33166, June 11, 2015, unless otherwise noted.

      § 222.60   What are the scope and purpose of this subpart?

#### § § 222.60

      The regulations in this subpart implement section 8003(b)(2) of the Act, which provides financial assistance to certain heavily impacted local educational agencies (LEAs). The specific eligibility requirements are detailed in §§ 222.62 through 222.66.

      § 222.61   What data are used to determine a local educational agency's eligibility under section 8003(b)(2) of the Act?

#### § § 222.61

      (a) Computations and determinations made with regard to an LEA's eligibility under section 8003(b)(2) in §§ 222.61 through 222.66 of these regulations are based on the LEA's final student, revenue, expenditure, and tax data from the third fiscal year preceding the fiscal year for which it seeks assistance.

      (b) Except for an LEA described in § 222.64(a)(3)(ii), the LEAs used for meeting the applicable tax rate requirement are the comparable LEAs that are identified in § 222.74 or all LEAs in the applicant's State.

      (c) As used in this subpart, the phrase “tax rate for general fund purposes” means “local real property tax rates for current expenditures purposes” as defined in § 222.2. “Current expenditures” is defined in section 8013(4) of the ESEA.

      § 222.62   How are local educational agencies determined eligible under section 8003(b)(2)?

#### § § 222.62

      (a) An applicant that wishes to be considered to receive a heavily impacted payment must submit the required information indicating tax rate eligibility under §§ 222.63 or 222.64 with the annual section 7003 Impact Aid application. Final LEA tax rate eligibility must be verified by the SEA under the process described in § 222.73.

      (b) An LEA that is eligible to apply for a “continuing” heavily impacted payment under section 8003(b)(2)(B) is one that received a heavily impacted LEA payment for fiscal year 2000 and that meets eligibility requirements specified in § 222.63.

      (c) An LEA that is eligible to apply for a “new” heavily impacted payment under section 8003(b)(2)(C) is one that did not receive see above and throughout the section for fiscal year 2000 and that meets eligibility requirements specified in § 222.64 for two consecutive application years.

      § 222.65   What other requirements must a local educational agency meet to be eligible for financial assistance under section 8003(b)(2)?

#### § § 222.65

      Subject to § 222.66, an LEA described in § 222.63 or § 222.64 is eligible for financial assistance under section 8003(b)(2) if the Secretary determines that the LEA meets the following requirements:

      (a) The LEA timely applies for assistance under section 8003(b)(2) and meets all of the other application and eligibility requirements of subparts A and C of these regulations.

      (b) Except for an LEA described in § 222.63(a) or (d), or § 222.64(b) or (c), the LEA meets the applicable tax rate requirement in accordance with the procedures and requirements of §§ 222.68 through 222.74.

      § 222.66   How does a local educational agency lose and resume eligibility under section 8003(b)(2)?

#### § § 222.66

      (a) A continuing heavily impacted LEA that fails to meet the eligibility requirements in § 222.63 in any fiscal year or a new heavily impacted LEA that received a section 8003(b)(2) payment but then fails to meet the eligibility requirements in § 222.64 will still receive a heavily impacted payment in the first year of ineligibility, based on the number of children in ADA that would be counted for that application if the LEA were eligible.

      (b)(1) A continuing heavily impacted LEA may resume eligibility for a heavily impacted payment if it applies in the fiscal year preceding the year for which it seeks eligibility and it meets the eligibility requirements in § 222.63 for both fiscal years.

      (2) In the first fiscal year that a continuing heavily impacted LEA qualifies to resume eligibility, it cannot receive a heavily impacted payment but instead will receive a basic support payment under section 8003(b)(1) for that year.

      (c) A new heavily impacted LEA may resume eligibility for a heavily impacted payment if it meets the eligibility requirements in § 222.64 for the fiscal year for which it seeks a payment.

      § 222.67   How may a State aid program affect a local educational agency's eligibility for assistance under section 8003(b)(2)?

#### § § 222.67

      The Secretary determines that an LEA is not eligible for financial assistance under section 8003(b)(2) if—

      (a) The LEA is in a State that has an equalized program of State aid that meets the requirements of section 8009; and

      (b) The State, in determining the LEA's eligibility for or amount of State aid, takes into consideration the portion of the LEA's payment under section 8003(b)(2) that exceeds what the LEA would receive under section 8003(b)(1).

      § 222.68   How does the Secretary determine whether a fiscally independent local educational agency meets the applicable tax rate requirement?

#### § § 222.68

      (a) To determine whether a fiscally independent LEA, as defined in § 222.2(c), meets the applicable tax rate requirement in §§ 222.63(b)(3), 222.63(c)(2), and 222.64(a)(3), the Secretary compares the LEA's local real property tax rate for current expenditure purposes, as defined in § 222.2(c) (referred to in this part as “tax rate” or “tax rates”), with the tax rates of its generally comparable LEAs.

      (b) For purposes of this section, the Secretary uses—

      (1) The actual tax rate if all the real property in the LEA and its generally comparable LEAs is assessed at the same percentage of true value; or

      (2) Tax rates computed under §§ 222.69-222.71.

      (c) The Secretary determines that an LEA described in §§ 222.63(b), 222.63(c), or 222.64(a) meets the applicable tax rate requirement if—

      (1) The LEA's tax rate is equal to at least 95 percent (or 125 percent under 222.63(c)) of the average tax rate of its generally comparable LEAs;

      (2) Each of the LEA's tax rates for each classification of real property is equal to at least 95 percent (or 125 percent under 222.63(c)) of each of the average tax rates of its generally comparable LEAs for the same classification of property;

      (3) The LEA taxes all of its real property at the maximum rates allowed by the State, if those maximum rates apply uniformly to all LEAs in the State and the State does not permit any rates higher than the maximum; or

      (4) The LEA has no taxable real property.

      § 222.69   What tax rates does the Secretary use if real property is assessed at different percentages of true value?

#### § § 222.69

      If the real property of an LEA and its generally comparable LEAs consists of one classification of property but the property is assessed at different percentages of true value in the different LEAs, the Secretary determines whether the LEA meets the applicable tax rate requirement under § 222.68(c)(1) by using tax rates computed by—

      (a) Multiplying the LEA's actual tax rate for real property by the percentage of true value assigned to that property for tax purposes; and

      (b) Performing the computation in paragraph (a) of this section for each of its generally comparable LEAs and determining the average of those computed tax rates.

      § 222.70   What tax rates does the Secretary use if two or more different classifications of real property are taxed at different rates?

#### § § 222.70

      If the real property of an LEA and its generally comparable LEAs consists of two or more classifications of real property taxed at different rates, the Secretary determines whether the LEA meets the applicable tax rate requirement under § 222.68(c)(1) or (2) by using one of the following:

      (a) Actual tax rates for each of the classifications of real property.

      (b) Tax rates computed in accordance with § 222.69 for each of the classifications of real property.

      (c) Tax rates computed by—

      (1) Determining the total true value of all real property in the LEA by dividing the assessed value of each classification of real property in the LEA by the percentage of true value assigned to that property for tax purposes and aggregating the results;

      (2) Determining the LEA's total revenues derived from local real property taxes for current expenditures (as defined in section 8013);

      (3) Dividing the amount determined in paragraph (c)(2) of this section by the amount determined in paragraph (c)(1) of this section; and

      (4) Performing the computations in paragraphs (c)(1), (2), and (3) of this section for each of the generally comparable LEAs and then determining the average of their computed tax rates.

      § 222.71   What tax rates may the Secretary use if substantial local revenues are derived from local tax sources other than real property taxes?

#### § § 222.71

      (a) In a State in which a substantial portion of revenues for current expenditures for educational purposes is derived from local tax sources other than real property taxes, the State educational agency (SEA) may request that the Secretary take those revenues into account in determining whether an LEA in that State meets the applicable tax rate requirement under § 222.68.

      (b) If, based upon the request of an SEA, the Secretary determines that it is appropriate to take the revenues described in paragraph (a) of this section into account in determining whether an LEA in that State meets the applicable tax rate requirement under § 222.68, the Secretary uses tax rates computed by—

      (1) Dividing the assessed value of each classification of real property in the LEA by the percentage of true value assigned to that property for tax purposes and aggregating the results;

      (2) Determining the LEA's total revenues derived from local tax sources for current expenditures (as defined in section 8013);

      (3) Dividing the amount determined in paragraph (b)(2) of this section by the amount determined in paragraph (b)(1) of this section; and

      (4) Performing the computations in paragraphs (b)(1), (2), and (3) of this section for each of the generally comparable LEAs and then determining the average of those computed tax rates.

      § 222.72   How does the Secretary determine whether a fiscally dependent local educational agency meets the applicable tax rate requirement?

#### § § 222.72

      (a) If an LEA is fiscally dependent, as defined in § 222.2(c), the Secretary compares the LEA's imputed local tax rate, calculated under paragraph (b) of this section, with the average tax rate of its generally comparable LEAs, calculated under paragraph (c) of this section, to determine whether the LEA meets the applicable tax rate requirement.

      (b) The Secretary imputes a local tax rate for a fiscally dependent LEA by—

      (1) Dividing the assessed value of each classification of real property within the boundaries of the general government by the percentage of true value assigned to that property for tax purposes and aggregating the results;

      (2) Determining the amount of locally derived revenues made available by the general government for the LEA's current expenditures (as defined in section 8013); and

      (3) Dividing the amount determined in paragraph (b)(2) of this section by the amount determined in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.

      (c) The Secretary performs the computations in paragraph (b) of this section for each of the fiscally dependent generally comparable LEAs and the computations in §§ 222.68 through 222.71, whichever is applicable, for each of the fiscally independent generally comparable LEAs and determines the average of all those tax rates.

      (d) The Secretary determines that a fiscally dependent LEA described in § 222.63(b) or § 222.64(a) meets the applicable tax rate requirement if its imputed local tax rate is equal to at least 95 percent of the average tax rate of its generally comparable LEAs.

      (e) The Secretary determines that a fiscally dependent LEA described in § 222.63(c) meets the applicable tax rate requirement if its imputed local tax rate is equal to at least 125 percent of the average tax rate of its generally comparable LEAs.

      § 222.73   What information must the State educational agency provide?

#### § § 222.73

      The SEA of any State with an LEA applying for assistance under section 8003(b)(2) shall provide the Secretary with relevant information necessary to determine the PPE for all LEAs in the State and whether the LEA meets the applicable tax rate requirement under this subpart.

      § 222.74   How does the Secretary identify generally comparable local educational agencies for purposes of section 8003(b)(2)?

#### § § 222.74

      (a) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the Secretary identifies generally comparable LEAs for purposes of this subpart in accordance with the local contribution rate procedures described in §§ 222.39 through 222.40.

      (b) For applicant LEAs described in § 222.64(a)(2)(ii) and (a)(3)(ii), to identify the one or three generally comparable LEAs, the Secretary uses the following procedures:

      (1) The Secretary asks the SEA of the applicant LEA to identify generally comparable LEAs in the State by first following the directions in § 222.39(a)(4), using data from the preceding fiscal year. The SEA then removes from the resulting list any LEAs that are significantly impacted, as described in § 222.39(b)(1), except the applicant LEA.

      (2) If the remaining LEAs are not in rank order by total ADA, the SEA lists them in that order.

      (3) The LEA may then select as its generally comparable LEAs, for purposes of section 8003(b)(2) only, one or three LEAs from the list that are closest to it in size as determined by total ADA ( the next one larger or the next one smaller, or the next three larger LEAs, the next three smaller, the next two larger and the next one smaller, or the next one larger and the next two smaller).

      § 222.75   How does the Secretary compute the average per pupil expenditure of generally comparable local educational agencies under this subpart?

#### § § 222.75

      For applicant LEAs described in § 222.64(a)(2)(ii), the Secretary computes average per pupil expenditures (APPE) by dividing the sum of the total current expenditures for the third preceding fiscal year for the identified generally comparable LEAs by the sum of the total ADA of those LEAs for the same fiscal year.

        (b) An LEA is not required to comply with § 222.94 with respect to students from a tribe that has provided the LEA with a waiver that meets the requirements of this paragraph.

        (1) A waiver must contain a voluntary written statement from an appropriate tribal official or tribal governing body that—

        (i) The LEA need not comply with § 222.94 because the tribe is satisfied with the LEA's provision of educational services to the tribe's students; and

        (ii) The tribe was provided a copy of the requirements in § 222.91 and § 222.94, and understands the requirements that are being waived.

        (2) The LEA must submit the waiver at the time of application.

        (3) The LEA must obtain a waiver from each tribe that has Indian children living on Indian lands claimed by the LEA on its application under section 7003 of the Act. If the LEA only obtains waivers from some, but not all, applicable tribes, the LEA must comply with the requirements of § 222.94 with respect to those tribes that did not agree to waive these requirements.

        § 222.114   How does the Assistant Secretary implement the provisions of this subpart?

#### § § 222.114

        The Assistant Secretary implements section 8004 of the Act and this subpart through such actions as the Assistant Secretary determines to be appropriate, including the withholding of funds in accordance with §§ 222.115-222.122, after affording the affected LEA, parents, and Indian tribe or tribes an opportunity to present their views.

        § 222.115   When does the Assistant Secretary withhold payments from a local educational agency under this subpart?

#### § § 222.115

        Except as provided in § 222.120, the Assistant Secretary withholds payments to an LEA if—

        (a) The Assistant Secretary determines it is necessary to enforce the requirements of section 8004 of the Act or this subpart; or

        (b) After a hearing has been conducted under section 8004(e) of the Act and §§ 222.102-222.113 (IPP hearing)—

        (1) The LEA rejects the final determination of the Assistant Secretary; or

        (2) The LEA fails to implement the required remedy within the time established and the Assistant Secretary determines that the required remedy will not be undertaken by the LEA even if the LEA is granted a reasonable extension of time.

        § 222.116   How are withholding procedures initiated under this subpart?

#### § § 222.116

        (a) If the Assistant Secretary decides to withhold an LEA's funds, the Assistant Secretary issues a written notice of intent to withhold the LEA's payments.

        (b) In the written notice, the Assistant Secretary—

        (1) Describes how the LEA failed to comply with the requirements at issue; and

        (2)(i) Advises an LEA that has participated in an IPP hearing that it may request, in accordance with § 222.117(c), that its payments not be withheld; or

        (ii) Advises an LEA that has not participated in an IPP hearing that it may request a withholding hearing in accordance with § 222.117(d).

        (c) The Assistant Secretary sends a copy of the written notice of intent to withhold payments to the LEA and the affected Indian tribe or tribes by certified mail with return receipt requested.

        § 222.117   What procedures are followed after the Assistant Secretary issues a notice of intent to withhold payments?

#### § § 222.117

        (a) The withholding of payments authorized by section 8004 of the Act is conducted in accordance with section 8004 (d)(2) or (e)(8)-(9) of the Act and the regulations in this subpart.

        (b) An LEA that receives a notice of intent to withhold payments from the Assistant Secretary is not entitled to an Impact Aid hearing under the provisions of section 8011 of the Act and subpart J of this part.

        (c)  (1) An LEA that rejects or fails to implement the final determination of the Assistant Secretary after an IPP hearing has 10 days from the date of the LEA's receipt of the written notice of intent to withhold funds to provide the Assistant Secretary with a written explanation and documentation in support of the reasons why its payments should not be withheld. The Assistant Secretary provides the affected Indian tribe or tribes with an opportunity to respond to the LEA's submission.

        (2) If after reviewing an LEA's written explanation and supporting documentation, and any response from the Indian tribe or tribes, the Assistant Secretary determines to withhold an LEA's payments, the Assistant Secretary notifies the LEA and the affected Indian tribe or tribes of the withholding determination in writing by certified mail with return receipt requested prior to withholding the payments.

        (3) In the withholding determination, the Assistant Secretary states the facts supporting the determination that the LEA failed to comply with the legal requirements at issue, and why the provisions of § 222.120 (provisions governing circumstances when an LEA is exempt from the withholding of payments) are inapplicable. This determination is the final decision of the Department.

        (d)  (1) An LEA that has not participated in an IPP hearing has 30 days from the date of its receipt of the Assistant Secretary's notice of intent to withhold funds to file a written request for a withholding hearing with the Assistant Secretary.

        (3) If the LEA's request for a withholding hearing is rejected, the Assistant Secretary notifies the LEA in writing that its request for a hearing has been rejected and provides the LEA with the reasons for the rejection.

        (4) The Assistant Secretary rejects requests for withholding hearings that are not filed in accordance with the time for filing requirements described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section. An LEA that files a timely request for a withholding hearing, but fails to meet the other filing requirements set forth in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, has 30 days from the date of receipt of the Assistant Secretary's notification of rejection to submit an acceptable amended request for a withholding hearing.

        (e) If an LEA fails to file a written explanation in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section, or a request for a withholding hearing or an amended request for a withholding hearing in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section, the Secretary proceeds to take appropriate administrative action to withhold funds without further notification to the LEA.

        (c)  (1) The parties to the withholding hearing are the Assistant Secretary and the affected LEA. An affected Indian tribe is not a party, but, at the discretion of the hearing examiner, may participate in the hearing and present its views on the issues relevant to the withholding determination.

        (2) The parties may introduce all relevant evidence on the issues stated in the LEA's request for withholding hearing or other issues determined by the hearing examiner during the proceeding. The Assistant Secretary's notice of intent to withhold, the LEA's request for a withholding hearing, and all amendments and exhibits to those documents, must be made part of the hearing record.

        (3) Technical rules of evidence, including the Federal Rules of Evidence, do not apply to hearings conducted under this subpart, but the hearing examiner may apply rules designed to assure production of the most credible evidence available, including allowing the cross-examination of witnesses.

        (e)  (1) If the hearing examiner determines that no dispute exists as to a material fact or that the resolution of any disputes as to material facts would not be materially assisted by oral testimony, the hearing examiner shall afford each party an opportunity to present its case—

        (i) In whole or in part in writing; or

        (ii) In an informal conference after affording each party sufficient notice of the issues to be considered.

        (ii) Forwards to the Secretary, and mails to each party and to the affected Indian tribe or tribes, a copy of the written findings and initial withholding decision.

        (2) A hearing examiner's initial withholding decision constitutes the Secretary's final withholding decision without any further proceedings unless—

      (2) A request for reconsideration, or actual reconsideration by the Secretary (or the Secretary's delegatee), does not extend the time within which an applicant must file a request for an administrative hearing under § 222.151, unless the Secretary (or the Secretary's delegatee) extends that time limit in writing.

      (b) The Secretary's (or the Secretary's delegatee's) consideration of a request for reconsideration is not prejudiced by a pending request for an administrative hearing on the same matter, or the fact that a matter has been scheduled for a hearing. The Secretary (or the Secretary's delegatee) may, but is not required to, postpone the administrative hearing due to a request for reconsideration.

      (c) The Secretary (or the Secretary's delegatee) may reconsider any determination under the Act concerning a particular party unless the determination has been the subject of an administrative hearing under this part with respect to that party.

    Subpart K—Determinations Under Section 8009 of the Act

      § 222.160   What are the scope and purpose of this subpart?

#### § § 222.160

      (a)  This subpart applies to determinations made by the Secretary under section 8009 of the Act.

      (b)  The sole purpose of the regulations in this subpart is to implement the provisions of section 8009. The definitions and standards contained in this subpart apply only with respect to section 8009 and do not establish definitions and standards for any other purpose.

      § 222.161   How is State aid treated under section 7009 of the Act?

#### § § 222.161

      (a)  (1) A State may take into consideration payments under sections 8002 and 8003(b) of the Act (including hold harmless payments calculated under section 8003(e)) in allocating State aid if that State has a State aid program that qualifies under § 222.162, except as follows:

      (i) Those payments may be taken into consideration for each affected local educational agency (LEA) only in the proportion described in § 222.163.

      (ii) A State may not take into consideration—

      (A) That portion of an LEA's payment that is generated by the portion of a weight in excess of one under section 8003(a)(2)(B) of the Act (children residing on Indian lands);

      (B) Payments under section 8003(d) of the Act (children with disabilities); or

      (C) The amount that an LEA receives under section 8003(b)(2) that exceeds the amount the LEA would receive if eligible under section 8003(b)(1) and not section 8003(b)(2) (heavily impacted LEAs).

      (2) No State aid program may qualify under this subpart if a court of that State has determined by final order, not under appeal, that the program fails to equalize expenditures for free public education among LEAs within the State or otherwise violates law, and if the court's order provides that the program is no longer in effect.

      (3) No State, whether or not it has an equalization program that qualifies under § 222.162, may, in allocating State aid, take into consideration an LEA's eligibility for payments under the Act if that LEA does not apply for and receive those payments.

      (4) Any State that takes into consideration payments under the Act in accordance with the provisions of section 8009 in allocating State aid to LEAs must reimburse any LEA for any amounts taken into consideration for any fiscal year to the extent that the LEA did not in fact receive payments in those amounts during that fiscal year.

      (5) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(6), a State may not take into consideration payments under the Act in making estimated or final State aid payments before its State aid program has been certified by the Secretary.

      (6)(i) If the Secretary has not made a determination under section 7009 of the Act for a fiscal year, the State may request permission from the Secretary to make estimated or preliminary State aid payments for that fiscal year, that consider a portion of Impact Aid payments as local resources in accordance with this section.

      (ii) The State must include with its request an assurance that if the Secretary determines that the State does not meet the requirements of section 222.162 for that State fiscal year, the State must pay to each affected LEA, within 60 days of the Secretary's determination, the amount by which the State reduced State aid to the LEA.

      (iii) In determining whether to grant permission, the Secretary may consider factors including whether—

      (A) The Secretary certified the State under § 222.162 in the prior State fiscal year; and

      (B) Substantially the same State aid program is in effect since the date of the last certification.

      (b)  (1) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, determinations under this subpart requiring the submission of financial or school population data must be made on the basis of final data for the second fiscal year preceding the fiscal year for which the determination is made if substantially the same program was then in effect.

      (2)(i) If the Secretary determines that the State has substantially revised its State aid program, the Secretary may certify that program for any fiscal year only if—

      (A) The Secretary determines, on the basis of projected data, that the State's program will meet the disparity standard described in § 222.162 for the fiscal year for which the determination is made; and

      (B) The State provides an assurance to the Secretary that, if final data do not demonstrate that the State's program met that standard for the fiscal year for which the determination is made, the State will pay to each affected LEA the amount by which the State reduced State aid to the LEA.

      (ii) Data projections submitted by a State must set forth the assumptions upon which the data projections are founded, be accompanied by an assurance as to their accuracy, and be adjusted by actual data for the fiscal year of determination that must be submitted to the Secretary as soon as these data are available.

      (3) For a State that has not previously been certified by the Secretary under § 222.162, or if the last certification was more than two years prior, the State submits projected data showing whether it meets the disparity standard in § 222.162. The projected data must show the resulting amounts of State aid as if the State were certified to consider Impact Aid in making State aid payments.

      (c)  The following definitions apply to this subpart:

      is defined in section 7013(4) of the Act. Additionally, for the purposes of this section it does not include expenditures of funds received by the agency under sections 7002 and 7003(b) (including hold harmless payments calculated under section 7003(e)) that are not taken into consideration under the State aid program and exceed the proportion of those funds that the State would be allowed to take into consideration under § 222.162.

      means to meet the standard set forth in § 222.162.

      means compulsory charges levied by an LEA or by an intermediate school district or other local governmental entity on behalf of an LEA for current expenditures for educational services. “_Local tax revenues_” include the proceeds of ad valorem taxes, sales and use taxes, income taxes and other taxes. Where a State funding formula requires a local contribution equivalent to a specified mill tax levy on taxable real or personal property or both, “local tax revenues” include any revenues recognized by the State as satisfying that local contribution requirement.

      means “local tax revenues” as defined in paragraph (c) of this section contributed to or taken into consideration in a State aid program subject to a determination under this subpart, but excluding all revenues from State and Federal sources.

      means an addition to assets that does not increase any liability, does not represent the recovery of an expenditure, does not represent the cancellation of certain liabilities without a corresponding increase in other liabilities or a decrease in assets, and does not represent a contribution of fund capital in food service or pupil activity funds. Furthermore, the term “revenue” includes only revenue for current expenditures.

      means any contribution, no repayment for which is expected, made by a State to or on behalf of LEAs within the State for current expenditures for the provision of free public education.

      means all “local tax revenues” as defined in paragraph (c) of this section, including tax revenues for education programs for children needing special services, vocational education, transportation, and the like during the period in question but excluding all revenues from State and Federal sources.

      § 222.162   What disparity standard must a State meet in order to be certified and how are disparities in current expenditures or revenues per pupil measured?

#### § § 222.162

      (a)  The Secretary considers that a State aid program equalizes expenditures if the disparity in the amount of current expenditures or revenues per pupil for free public education among LEAs in the State is no more than 25 percent. In determining the disparity percentage, the Secretary disregards LEAs with per pupil expenditures or revenues above the 95th or below the 5th percentile of those expenditures or revenues in the State. The method for calculating the percentage of disparity in a State is in the appendix to this subpart.

      (b)(1)  If a State requests it, the Secretary will make separate disparity computations for different groups of LEAs in the State that have similar grade levels of instruction.

      (2) In those cases, the weighted average disparity for all groups, based on the proportionate number of pupils in each group, may not be more than the percentage provided in paragraph (a) of this section. The method for calculating the weighted average disparity percentage is set out in the appendix to this subpart.

      (c)  In calculating the current expenditures or revenue disparities under this section, computations of per pupil figures are made on one of the following bases:

      (1) The per pupil amount of current expenditures or revenue for an LEA is computed on the basis of the total number of pupils receiving free public education in the schools of the agency. The total number of pupils is determined in accordance with whatever standard measurement of pupil count is used in the State.

      (2) If a State aid program uses “weighted pupil,” “classroom,” “instructional unit,” or another designated measure of need in determining allocations of State aid to take account of special cost differentials, the computation of per pupil revenue or current expenditures may be made using one of the methods in paragraph (d) of this section. The two allowable categories of special cost differentials are—

      (i) Those associated with pupils having special educational needs, such as children with disabilities, economically disadvantaged children, non-English speaking children, and gifted and talented children; and

      (ii) Those associated with particular types of LEAs such as those affected by geographical isolation, sparsity or density of population, high cost of living, or special socioeconomic characteristics within the area served by an LEA.

      (d)  In computing per-pupil figures under paragraph (c) of this section, the State accounts for special cost differentials that meet the requirements of paragraph (c)(2) of this section in one of four ways:

      (1)  The State divides total revenues by a weighted pupil count that includes only those weights associated with the special cost differentials.

      (2)  The State divides total current expenditures by a weighted pupil count that includes only those weights associated with the special cost differentials.

      (3)  The State subtracts revenues associated with the special cost differentials from total revenues, and divides this net amount by an unweighted pupil count.

      (4)  The State subtracts current expenditures from revenues associated with the special cost differentials from total current expenditures, and divides this net amount by an unweighted pupil count.

      § 222.163   What proportion of Impact Aid funds may a State take into consideration upon certification?

#### § § 222.163

      (a)  Section 8009(d)(1)(B) provides that, upon certification by the Secretary, in allocating State aid a State may consider as local resources funds received under sections 8002 and 8003(b) (including hold harmless payments calculated under section 8003(e)) only in proportion to the share that local tax revenues covered under a State equalization program are of total local tax revenues. Determinations of proportionality must be made on a case-by-case basis for each LEA affected and not on the basis of a general rule to be applied throughout a State.

      (b)  (1) In computing the share that local tax revenues covered under a State equalization program are of total local tax revenues for an LEA with respect to a program qualifying under § 222.162, the proportion is obtained by dividing the amount of local tax revenues covered under the equalization program by the total local tax revenues attributable to current expenditures for free public education within that LEA.

      (2) In cases where there are no local tax revenues for current expenditures and the State provides all of those revenues on behalf of the LEA, the State may consider up to 100 percent of the funds received under the Act by that LEA in allocating State aid.

      (c)  Except as provided in § 222.161(a)(1)(ii) and (iii), the proportion established under this section (or a lesser proportion) for any LEA receiving payments under sections 8002 and 8003(b) (including hold harmless payments calculated under section 8003(e)) may be applied by a State to actual receipts of those payments.

      § 222.164   What procedures does the Secretary follow in making a determination under section 7009?

#### § § 222.164

      (a)  (1) A proceeding under this subpart leading to a determination by the Secretary under section 8009 may be initiated—

      (i) By the State educational agency (SEA) or other appropriate agency of the State;

      (ii) By an LEA; or

      (iii) By the Secretary, if the Secretary has reason to believe that the State's action is in violation of section 8009.

      (2) Whenever a proceeding under this subpart is initiated, the party initiating the proceeding shall provide either the State or all LEAs with a complete copy of the submission required in paragraph (b) of this section. Following receipt of the submission, the Secretary shall notify the State and all LEAs in the State of their right to request from the Secretary, within 30 days of the initiation of a proceeding, the opportunity to present their views to the Secretary before the Secretary makes a determination.

      (b)  (1) A submission by a State or LEA under this section must be made in the manner requested by the Secretary and must contain the information and assurances as may be required by the Secretary in order to reach a determination under section 8009 and this subpart.

      (2)(i) A State in a submission shall—

      (A) Demonstrate how its State aid program comports with § 222.162; and

      (B) Demonstrate for each LEA receiving funds under the Act that the proportion of those funds that will be taken into consideration comports with § 222.163.

      (ii) The submission must be received by the Secretary no later than 120 calendar days before the beginning of the State's fiscal year for the year of the determination, and must include (except as provided in § 222.161(c)(2)) final second preceding fiscal year disparity data enabling the Secretary to determine whether the standard in § 222.162 has been met. The submission is considered timely if received by the Secretary on or before the filing deadline or if it bears a U.S. Postal Service postmark dated on or before the filing deadline.

      (3) An LEA in a submission must demonstrate whether the State aid program comports with section 8009.

      (4) Whenever a proceeding is initiated under this subpart, the Secretary may request from a State the data deemed necessary to make a determination. A failure on the part of a State to comply with that request within a reasonable period of time results in a summary determination by the Secretary that the State aid program of that State does not comport with the regulations in this subpart.

      (5) Before making a determination under section 8009, the Secretary affords the State, and all LEAs in the State, an opportunity to present their views as follows:

      (i) Upon receipt of a timely request for a predetermination hearing, the Secretary notifies all LEAs and the State of the time and place of the predetermination hearing.

      (ii) Predetermination hearings are informal and any LEA and the State may participate whether or not they requested the predetermination hearing.

      (iii) At the conclusion of the predetermination hearing, the Secretary holds the record open for 15 days for the submission of post-hearing comments. The Secretary may extend the period for post-hearing comments for good cause for up to an additional 15 days.

      (iv) Instead of a predetermination hearing, if the party or parties requesting the predetermination hearing agree, they may present their views to the Secretary exclusively in writing. In such a case, the Secretary notifies all LEAs and the State that this alternative procedure is being followed and that they have up to 30 days from the date of the notice in which to submit their views in writing. Any LEA or the State may submit its views in writing within the specified time, regardless of whether it requested the opportunity to present its views.

      (c)  The Secretary reviews the participants' submissions and any views presented at a predetermination hearing under paragraph (b)(5) of this section, including views submitted during the post-hearing comment period. Based upon this review, the Secretary issues a written determination setting forth the reasons for the determination in sufficient detail to enable the State or LEAs to respond. The Secretary affords reasonable notice of a determination under this subpart and the opportunity for a hearing to the State or any LEA adversely affected by the determination.

      (2) The ALJ is bound by all applicable statutes and regulations and may neither waive them nor rule them invalid.

      (f)  (1) Any written submission under this section must be filed by hand-delivery, mail, or facsimile transmission. The Secretary discourages the use of facsimile transmission for documents longer than five pages.

      (2) If agreed upon by the parties, service of a document may be made upon the other party by facsimile transmission.

      (3) The filing date for a written submission under this section is the date the document is—

        (c) After the grantee submits a copy of the emergency or modernization contract approved by the grantee's governing board, the Secretary makes available 80 percent of the total award amount to a grantee.

        (d) The Secretary makes available up to the remaining 10 percent of the total award amount to the grantee after the grantee submits a statement that—

        (1) Details any earnings, savings, or interest;

        (2) Certifies that—

        (i) The project is fully completed; and

      (2) Sign an agreement, at the time of selection for training, that sets forth the payback requirements; and

      (3) Report employment verification in a manner specified by the Department or its designee.

      (b)  (1) Participants qualify for work-related payback if the work they are performing is in their field of study under the Professional Development program and benefits Indian students. Employment in a LEA that serves a high proportion of Indian students qualifies as work that benefits Indian students.

      (2) The period of time required for a work-related payback is equivalent to the total period of time for which pre-service or in-service training was actually received on a month-for-month basis under the Professional Development program.

      (3) Work-related payback is credited for the actual time the participant works, not for how the participant is paid ( for work completed over 9 months but paid over 12 months, the payback credit is 9 months).

      (4) For participants that initiate, but cannot complete, a work-related payback, the payback converts to a cash payback that is prorated based upon the amount of work-related payback completed.

      (c)  (1) Participants who do not submit employment verification within twelve months of program exit or completion, or have not submitted employment verification for a twelve-month period during a work-related payback, will automatically be referred for a cash payback unless the participant qualifies for a deferral as described in § 263.9.

      (2) The cash payback required shall be equivalent to the total amount of funds received and expended for training received under this program and may be prorated based on any approved work-related service the participant performs.

      (3) Participants who are referred to cash payback may incur non-refundable penalty and administrative fees in addition to their total training costs and will incur interest charges starting the day of referral.

      (4) The cash payback obligation may only be discharged through bankruptcy if repaying the loan would cause the participant undue hardship as defined in 11 U.S.C. 523(a)(8).

      (5) Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(1) of this section, participants who exit or complete a grant-funded training program in Federal fiscal year 2020 (October 1, 2019-September 30, 2020) who do not submit employment verification within 24 months of program exit or completion, and participants with qualifying employment during Federal fiscal year 2020 who do not submit employment verification for a 24-month period, will automatically be referred for a cash payback unless the participant qualifies for a deferral as described in § 263.9.

      For grants that provide administrator training, a participant who has received administrator training and subsequently works for a Tribal educational agency that provides administrative control or direction of public schools ( BIE-funded schools or charter schools) satisfies the requirements of paragraph (b)(1) of this section.

      (a)  If a participant completes or exits the Professional Development program, but plans to continue his or her education as a full-time student without interruption, in a program leading to a degree at an accredited institution of higher education, the Secretary may defer the payback requirement until the participant has completed his or her educational program.

      (1) A request for a deferral must be submitted to the Secretary within 30 days of completing or exiting the Professional Development program and must provide the following information—

      (i) The name of the accredited institution the student will be attending;

      (ii) A copy of the letter of admission from the institution;

      (iii) The degree being sought; and

      (iv) The projected date of completion.

      (2) If the Secretary approves the deferral of the payback requirement on the basis that a participant is continuing as a full-time student, the participant must submit to the Secretary a status report from an academic advisor or other authorized representative of the institution of higher education, showing verification of enrollment and status, after every grading period.

      (b)  If a participant exits the Professional Development program because he or she is called or ordered to active duty status in connection with a war, military operation, or national emergency for more than 30 days as a member of a reserve component of the Armed Forces named in 10 U.S.C. 10101, or as a member of the National Guard on full-time National Guard duty, as defined in 10 U.S.C. 101(d)(5), the Secretary may defer the payback requirement until the participant has completed his or her military service, for a period not to exceed 36 months. Requests for deferral must be submitted to the Secretary within 30 days of the earlier of receiving the call to military service or completing or exiting the Professional Development program, and must provide—

      (1) A written statement from the participant's commanding or personnel officer certifying—

      (i) That the participant is on active duty in the Armed Forces of the United States;

      (ii) The date on which the participant's service began; and

      (b)  (1) Starting within six months after exit from or completion of the program, participants must submit to the Secretary employment information, which includes information explaining how the employment is related to the training received and benefits Indian students in an LEA that serves a high proportion of Indian students.

      (2) Participants must submit an employment status report every six months beginning from the date the work-related service is to begin until the payback obligation has been fulfilled.

      (c)  If a cash payback is to be made, the Department contacts the participant to establish an appropriate schedule for payments.
