    For purposes of this part:

    means the supplemental ethics standards set forth in this part.

    means the possession, direct or indirect, of the power or authority to manage, direct, or oversee.

    has the meaning set forth in 12 U.S.C. 5481(7) and as further defined in regulations promulgated by the Bureau to implement that statute. A person may have credit without any outstanding balance owed.

    has the meaning set forth in 5 CFR 2634.105(d). It includes an employee's son, daughter, stepson, or stepdaughter if:

    (1) Unmarried, under the age of 21, and living in the employee's household; or

    (2) Claimed as a “dependent” on the employee's income tax return.

    means the official within the Bureau that the Director has appointed to coordinate and manage the ethics program at the Bureau, under 5 CFR 2638.104(a). For purposes of this part, the term “DAEO” also includes the Alternate DAEO appointed under 5 CFR 2638.104(d), and a designee of the DAEO or Alternate DAEO unless a particular provision says an authority is reserved to the DAEO.

    means the _Director_ of the Bureau.

    (2) Is not related by blood in a manner that would bar marriage under the laws of the jurisdiction in which the employee resides;

    (3) Is in a financially interdependent relationship in which both agree to be responsible for each other's common welfare and share in financial obligations; and

    has the meaning set forth in 5 CFR 2635.102(l).

    means an employee's husband or wife by lawful marriage, but does not include an employee's spouse if:

    (1) The employee and the employee's spouse are separated;

    (2) The employee and the employee's spouse live apart;

    (3) There is an intention to end the marriage or separate permanently; and

    (4) The employee has no control over the separated spouse's securities.

    means a present right or title to property, which carries with it an existing right of alienation, even though the right to possession or enjoyment may be postponed to some uncertain time in the future. This includes a future interest when one has a right, defeasible or indefeasible, to immediate possession or enjoyment of the property, upon the ceasing of another's interest.

#### § § 9401.103

    (a)  Before engaging in outside employment, an employee must obtain written approval from the employee's supervisor and the concurrence of the DAEO, except to the extent that the Bureau has issued an instruction or internal directive pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section exempting an activity or class of activities from this requirement.

    (b)  For purposes of this section, “employment” means any form of non-Federal employment, business relationship, or activity involving the provision of personal services by the employee, regardless of whether the services are compensated. It includes without limitation, personal services as an officer, director, employee, agent, advisor, attorney, consultant, contractor, general partner, trustee, teacher, speaker, or writer.

    (c)  Approval will be granted only upon a determination that the outside employment is not expected to involve conduct prohibited by statute, the OGE Standards, or the CFPB Ethics Regulations in this part.

    (d)  Upon a significant change in either the nature, scope, or duties of the employee's outside employment or in the employee's official Bureau position, the employee shall submit a new request for approval.

    (e)  The DAEO may issue instructions or internal directives governing the submission of requests for approval of outside employment and designating appropriate officials to act on such requests. The instructions or internal directives may exempt categories of employment from the prior approval requirement of this section based on a determination that employment within those categories generally would be approved and is not likely to involve prohibited conduct or create an appearance of lack of impartiality.

    § 9401.104   Additional rules concerning outside employment for covered employees.

#### § § 9401.104

    (a)  A covered employee shall not engage in compensated outside employment for an entity supervised by the Bureau or for an officer, director, or employee of such entity. For purposes of this section, “employment” has the same meaning as set forth in § 9401.103(b).

    (b)  A covered employee who holds a license related to real estate, mortgage brokerage, property appraisals, or real property insurance is prohibited from using such license for the production of income. The DAEO, in consultation with senior management in the Division in which the employee works, may grant a limited waiver to this prohibition based on a written finding that the specific transaction which requires use of the license will not create an appearance of loss of impartiality or use of public office for private gain.

    (c)  For purposes of this section, “covered employee” means:

    (1) An employee in the Division of Supervision, Enforcement, and Fair Lending;

    (2) An employee serving in an attorney position;

    (3) An employee in the Office of Research, serving as a section chief at Bureau pay band 71 or above or as a senior economist in the Compliance Analytics and Policy Section;

    (4) An employee serving in the Office of Consumer Response in an investigations position;

    (6) Any other Bureau employee specified in a Bureau order or directive whose duties and responsibilities, as determined by the DAEO, require application of the prohibition on outside employment contained in this section to ensure public confidence that the Bureau's programs are conducted impartially and objectively.

> [82 FR 35885, Aug. 2, 2017]

    § 9401.105   Additional rules concerning outside employment for Bureau attorneys.

#### § § 9401.105

    (a)  In addition to the prior approval requirements under § 9401.103 and the outside employment restrictions under § 9401.104, an employee serving in an attorney position shall not engage in the practice of law outside the employee's official Bureau duties that might require the attorney to:

    (1) Take a position that is or appears to be in conflict with the interests of the Bureau; or

    (2) Interpret any statute, regulation, or rule administered or issued by the Bureau.

    (b)  Nothing in this section prevents a Bureau attorney from acting as an agent or attorney for or otherwise representing himself or herself in the outside practice of law, except:

    (1) In those matters in which the attorney has participated personally and substantially as a Government employee; or

    (2) In those matters which are the subject of the attorney's official responsibility.

    (i) The fund does not have a stated policy of concentrating its investments in the financial services or banking industry; and

    (ii) Neither the employee nor the employee's spouse or minor child exercises or has the ability to exercise control over or selection of the financial interests held by the fund.

    (2)  A pension or other retirement fund, trust, or plan established or maintained by an employer or an employee organization, or both, to provide its participants with medical, disability, death, unemployment, or vacation benefits, training programs, day care centers, scholarship funds, prepaid legal services, deferred income, or retirement income (employee plan), provided:

    (iv) Neither the employee nor the employee's spouse or minor child participates in the selection of the employee plan's investments or designates specific plan investments (except for directing that contributions be divided among several different categories of investments, such as stocks, bonds, or mutual funds, which are available to plan participants); and

    (c) —(1)  Within 30 calendar days from the start of employment with the Bureau, an employee must notify the DAEO in writing of a financial interest prohibited under paragraph (a) of this section that the employee or the employee's spouse or minor child acquired prior to the start of the employee's employment with the Bureau. The employee or the employee's spouse or minor child shall divest prohibited securities within 90 days after the start of the employee's employment at the Bureau.

    (2)  Within 30 days after the Bureau updates and internally publishes a new list of entities supervised by the Bureau, an employee who owns or controls, or whose spouse or minor child owns or controls, a security in an entity newly added to that list must notify the DAEO in writing. The employee or the employee's spouse or minor child shall divest prohibited securities within 90 days after internal publication of the new list.

    (3)  If an employee or an employee's spouse or minor child acquires a financial interest prohibited under paragraph (a) of this section as a result of marriage, inheritance, or otherwise without specific intent to acquire, the employee must notify the DAEO in writing within 30 days of the acquisition. The employee or the employee's spouse or minor child shall divest prohibited securities within 90 days of the acquisition.

    (d) —(1)  If an employee or an employee's spouse or minor child owns or controls a security in an entity that is prohibited under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the employee shall immediately disqualify himself or herself from participating in all particular matters affecting that entity, unless and until the security is divested or the employee is granted a waiver pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section and the waiver includes an authorization allowing the employee to participate in such matters.

    (2)  If an employee or an employee's spouse or minor child owns or controls a security in a collective investment fund that is prohibited under paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the employee shall immediately disqualify himself or herself from participating in all particular matters affecting one or more holdings of the collective investment fund if the affected holding is invested in the financial services or banking industry, unless and until the collective investment fund is divested or the employee is granted a waiver pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section and the waiver includes an authorization allowing the employee to participate in such matters.

    (e)  Upon request by the employee, the DAEO in the DAEO's sole discretion has the authority to grant an individual waiver under this paragraph. The DAEO's authority to grant an individual waiver under this paragraph may not be delegated to any person except the Alternate DAEO. The DAEO, in consultation with senior management in the Division in which the employee works, may issue a written waiver permitting the employee or the employee's spouse or minor child to own or control a particular security that otherwise would be prohibited by this section, after considering all relevant factors. Relevant factors include, without limitation, whether:

    (1) Mitigating circumstances exist due to the way the employee or the employee's spouse or minor child acquired ownership or control of the security. Mitigating circumstances may include without limitation:

    (i) The employee or the employee's spouse or minor child acquired the security through inheritance, merger, acquisition, or other change in corporate structure, or otherwise without specific intent on the part of the employee or the employee's spouse or minor child; or

    (ii) The employee's spouse received the security as part of a compensation package in connection with employment or prior to marriage to the employee;

    (2) The employee makes a prompt and complete written disclosure of the security to the DAEO;

    (3) The disqualification of the employee from participating in particular matters pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section, as specified in the written waiver, would not unduly interfere with the full performance of the employee's duties; and

    (4) The granting of the waiver would not unduly undermine the public's confidence in the impartiality and objectivity with which:

    (i) The employee performs the employee's official Bureau duties; and

    (ii) The Division in which the employee works executes its programs and functions.

    (f)  Immediately after becoming aware that a covered third party entity owns or controls a security that an employee would be prohibited from owning or controlling under paragraph (a) of this section, the employee shall report the interest in writing to the DAEO. The DAEO may require the employee to terminate the relationship with the covered third party entity, disqualify himself or herself from certain particular matters, or take other action as necessary to avoid a statutory violation, a violation of the OGE Standards, or the CFPB Ethics Regulations, including an appearance of misuse of position or loss of impartiality. For purposes of this paragraph, “covered third party entity” includes:

    (1) A partnership in which the employee or the employee's spouse or minor child is a general partner;

    (2) A partnership or closely held corporation in which the employee or the employee's spouse or minor child individually or jointly holds more than a 10 percent equity interest;

    (2)  The prohibition in paragraph (a)(1) of this section continues for two years after the employee's participation in the particular matter has ended.

    (c)  The prohibitions in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section do not apply when the employee's spouse or minor child is seeking, obtaining, or renegotiating credit or indebtedness and:

    (1) The credit or indebtedness is supported only by the income or independent means of the spouse or minor child;

    (2) The credit or indebtedness is obtained on terms and conditions no more favorable than those offered to the general public; and

    (2) Overdraft protection on checking accounts and similar accounts; and

    (3) The provision of telephone, cable, gas, electricity, water, or other similar utility services provided on credit ( the service is provided before payment is due such that consumers incur debt as they use the service and receive periodic bills for the services used).

    (f)  The DAEO, after consultation with senior management in the Division in which the employee works, may grant a written waiver from the prohibition in paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section or the disqualification requirement in paragraph (d) of this section, based on a determination that participation in matters otherwise prohibited by this section would not be prohibited by law (18 U.S.C. 208) or create an appearance of loss of impartiality or use of public office for private gain, and would not otherwise be inconsistent with the OGE Standards or the CFPB Ethics Regulations.

    § 9401.112   Prohibited purchase of assets.

#### § § 9401.112

    An employee, or an employee's spouse or minor child, shall not purchase, directly or indirectly, any real or personal property from an entity supervised by the Bureau, unless it is sold at public auction or by other means which assures that the selling price reflects the asset's fair market value.

    § 9401.113   Waivers.

#### § § 9401.113

    The DAEO may grant a written waiver from any provision of this part where the DAEO finds good cause to do so; provided, however, that the DAEO will not do so unless the DAEO finds that the waiver is not inconsistent with the OGE Standards or otherwise prohibited by law and that, under the particular circumstances, application of the provision being waived is not necessary in order to avoid a violation of an ethics rule. Each waiver must be in writing and supported by a statement of facts and findings and may impose appropriate conditions, such as requiring the employee to execute a written disqualification statement.
