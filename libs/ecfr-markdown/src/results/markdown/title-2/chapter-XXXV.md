    Subpart A—General

      § 3513.137   Who in Ex-Im Bank may grant an exception to let an excluded person participate in a covered transaction?

#### § § 3513.137

      (a) The Ex-Im Bank agency head or designee may grant an exception permitting an excluded person to participate in a particular covered transacting. If the Ex-Im Bank agency head or designee grants an exception, the exception must be in writing and state the reason(s) for deviating from the government wide policy in Executive Order 12549.

      (b) An exception granted by one agency for an excluded person does not extend to the covered transactions of another agency.

    Subpart B—Covered Transactions

      § 3513.220   What contracts and subcontracts, in addition to those listed in 2 CFR 180.220, are covered transactions?

#### § § 3513.220

      Although the OMB guidance at 2 CFR 180.220(c) allows a Federal agency to do so (also see optional lower tier coverage in the figure in the appendix to 2 CFR part 180), Ex-Im Bank does not extend coverage of nonprocurement suspension and debarment requirements beyond first-tier procurement under a covered nonprocurement transaction.

    Subpart C—Responsibilities of Participants Regarding Transactions

      § 3513.332   What methods must I use to pass requirements down to participants at lower tiers with whom I intend to do business?

#### § § 3513.332

      To communicate the requirements, you must include a term or condition in the transaction requiring the participants' compliance with subpart C of this part and requiring them to include a similar term or condition in lower-tiered covered transactions.

    Subpart D—Responsibilities of Federal Agency Officials Regarding Transactions

      § 3513.437   What method do I use to communicate to a participant the requirements described in the OMB guidance at 2 CFR 180.435?

#### § § 3513.437

      To communicate to a participant the requirements described in 2 CFR 180.435 of the OMB guidance, you must include a term or condition in the transaction that requires the participant's compliance with subpart C of 2 CFR part 180, as supplemented by subpart C of this part, and requires the participant to include a similar term or condition in lower-tier covered transactions.

    Subparts E-J [Reserved]

    § 3513.10   What does this part do?

#### § § 3513.10

    This part adopts the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance in subparts A through I of 2 CFR part 180, as supplemented by this part, as the Export Import Bank of the United States (Ex-Im Bank) policies and procedures for nonprocurement debarment and suspension. It thereby gives regulatory effect for Ex-Im Bank to the OMB guidance as supplemented by this part. This part satisfies the requirements in section 3 of Executive Order 12549, “Debarment and Suspension” (3 CFR 1986 Comp., p. 189), Executive Order 12689, “Debarment and Suspension” (3 CFR 1989 Comp., p. 235) and 31 U.S.C. 6101 note (Section 2455, Pub. L. 103-355, 108 Stat. 3327).

    § 3513.20   Does this part apply to me?

#### § § 3513.20

    This part and, through this part, pertinent portions of the OMB guidance in subparts A through I of 2 CFR part 180 (see table at 2 CFR 180.100(b)) apply to you if you are a—

    (a) Participant or principal in a “covered transaction” (see subpart B of 2 CFR part 180 and the definition of “nonprocurement transaction” at 2 CFR 180.970, as supplemented by subpart B of this part).

    (b) Respondent in an Ex-Im Bank suspension or debarment action.

    (c) Ex-Im Bank debarment or suspension official;

    (d) Ex-Im Bank grants officer, agreements officer, or other official authorized to enter into any type of nonprocurement transaction that is a covered transaction;

    § 3513.30   What policies and procedures must I follow?

#### § § 3513.30

    Ex-Im Bank policies and procedures that you must follow are the policies and procedures specified in each applicable section of the OMB guidance in subparts A through I of 2 CFR part 180, as that section is supplemented by the section in this part with the same section number. The contracts that are covered transactions, for example, are specified by section 220 of the OMB guidance (i.e., 2 CFR 180.220) as supplemented by section 220 in this pat (i.e., § 3513.220). For any section of OMB guidance in subparts A through I of 2 CFR 180 that has no corresponding section in this part, Ex-Im Bank policies and procedures are those in the OMB guidance.
