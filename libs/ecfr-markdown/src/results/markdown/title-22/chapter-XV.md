    (9) Specifically concern the Foundation's issuance of a subpoena; the Foundation's participation in a civil action or proceeding, or an arbitration; or an action in a foreign court or international tribunal; or the initiation, conduct, or disposition by the Foundation of a particular case of formal agency adjudication pursuant to the procedures in section 554 of title 5 of the United States Code, or otherwise involving a determination on the record after an opportunity for a hearing.

    (b)  Fees shall be charged in accordance with the schedules contained in paragraph (c) of this section for services rendered in responding to requests for Foundation records under this subpart. Requestors may seek a waiver of fees by submitting a written application demonstrating how disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requestor. Fees shall also not be charged where they would amount, in the aggregate, for a request or series of related requests, to $25 or less.

#### § § 1502.9

    (a)  A person who has made a written request for records which meets the requirements of § 1502.4 shall be informed by the Chief FOIA Officer within 20 working days after receipt of the request of the Foundation's decision whether to deny or grant access to the records and the right of the requestor to seek assistance from the Foundation's Chief Public Liaison.

    (b)  If the Chief FOIA Officer, with the concurrence of the General Counsel, denies a request for records, the requestor will be informed of the name and title of the official responsible for the denial, the reasons for it, and the right to appeal the decision to the President of the Foundation within 90 calendar days of receipt of the denial. The President shall determine any appeal within 20 days of receipt and notify the requestor within the time period of the decision. If the decision is to uphold the denial, the requestor will be informed of the reasons for the decision, of the right to a judicial review of the decision in the federal courts, and of the dispute resolution services offered by the FOIA Public Liaison of the Foundation or the Office of Government Information Services of the National Archives and Records Administration as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation.

    (c)  In unusual circumstances, as defined by the FOIA, to the extent reasonably necessary to the proper processing of requests, the time required to respond to a FOIA request or an appeal may be extended for an additional 10 working days upon written notification to the requestor providing the reasons for the extension. If the extension goes beyond 10 working days, USADF will notify the requestor of services provided by the FOIA Public Liaison and the Office of Government Information Services.

    (d)  USADF shall process requests and appeals on an expedited basis where the requestor demonstrates a compelling need for the records, as defined in 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(E)(v). USADF shall make a determination of whether to provide expedited processing, and shall notify the requestor of the determination, within 10 calendar days after the receipt of the request. USADF shall provide expeditious consideration of administrative appeals of determinations of whether to provide expedited processing.

    (e)  Whenever records containing confidential commercial information are requested under the FOIA and USADF determines that it may be required to disclose the records, USADF shall promptly provide written notice to the submitter of the confidential commercial information, in conformity with the procedures set forth in Executive Order 12600, Predisclosure Notification Procedures for Confidential Commercial Information, 3 CFR, 1987 Comp., p. 235.

    § 1502.10   Judicial review.

Among the legally required deductions that must be applied first to determine disposable pay are levies pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code (Title 26, United States Code) and deductions described in 5 CFR 581.105(b) through (f). These deductions include, but are not limited to: Social Security withholdings; Federal, State, and local tax withholdings; health insurance premiums; retirement contributions; and life insurance premiums.

      means a current employee of the Federal Government including a current member of the Armed Forces or a Reserve of the Armed Forces.

      means the administrative collection of a debt by deductions at one or more officially established pay intervals from the current pay account of an employee without the employee's consent.

      means an individual, firm, partnership, corporation, association, organization, State or local government, or any other type of entity other than a Federal agency, foreign government, or public international organization.

      means the temporary cessation of an active debt collection pending the occurrence of an anticipated event.

      means the cessation of all active debt collection action for the foreseeable future.

      means the cancellation, remission, forgiveness or non-recovery of a debt or debt-related charge as permitted or required by law.

      means any order for withholding or garnishment of pay issued by USADF or a judicial or administrative body. For the purposes of this Part, wage garnishment order and garnishment order have the same meaning as withholding order.

      § 1506.5   Does the application of remedies prescribed in this part preclude USADF from imposing other sanctions or remedies?

#### § § 1506.5

      (a) The remedies and sanctions available to USADF under this part for collecting debts are not intended to be exhaustive. USADF may impose, where authorized, other appropriate formal and informal sanctions upon a debtor for inexcusable, prolonged or repeated failure to pay a debt.

      (b) Nothing in this part is intended to deter USADF from demanding the return of specific property or the payment of its value.

      (c) This part does not supersede or require omission or duplication of administrative proceedings required by contract, statute, regulation or other USADF procedures,  resolution of audit findings under grants or contracts, informal grant appeals, formal grant appeals, or review under a procurement contract.

      § 1506.6   Will USADF subdivide a claim in excess of $100,000?

#### § § 1506.6

      USADF will not subdivide a claim to avoid the $100,000 limit on the Agency's authority to compromise, suspend, or terminate a debt. A debtor's liability arising from a particular transaction or contract is a single claim.

      § 1506.7   How does USADF process claims involving fraud?

#### § § 1506.7

      (a) The CFO will refer claims involving fraud, the presentation of a false claim, or misrepresentation on the part of the debtor or any party having an interest in the claim to the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) Office of Inspector General (OIG), which has statutory jurisdiction over USADF. The OIG has the responsibility for investigating or referring the matter, where appropriate, to the Department of Justice (DOJ), and/or returning it to USADF for further action.

      (b) The CFO will not administratively compromise, terminate, suspend or otherwise dispose of debts involving fraud, the presentation of a false claim or misrepresentation on the part of the debtor or any party having an interest in the claim without the approval of DOJ.

      § 1506.8   Will an omission by the Agency in complying with this part serve as a debtor's defense against payment?

#### § § 1506.8

      Failure by USADF to comply with any provision of this Part is not available to a debtor as a defense against payment of a debt.

    Subpart B—Collection

      § 1506.9   What does a collection action entail?

#### § § 1506.9

      (a) The Agency will undertake prompt action to collect all debts owed to the United States arising out of USADF activities and to reduce debt delinquencies. A collection action may include sending a written notice in the form of a Bill for Collection or demand letter to the debtor's last known address. When necessary to protect the Government's interest (for example, to prevent the running of a statute of limitations), a written demand may be preceded by other appropriate actions under the Federal Claims Collection Standards, including the immediate referral to DOJ for litigation or collection by salary offset. The CFO may contact the debtor by telephone, in person and/or in writing to demand prompt payment, to discuss the debtor's position regarding the existence, amount or repayment of the debt, to inform the debtor of its rights ( to apply for a waiver of indebtedness or to request an administrative review) and of the basis for the debt and the consequences of nonpayment or delay in payment.

      (b) The CFO will maintain an administrative file for each claim. The administrative file will document the basis for the debt, all administrative collection actions regarding the debt (including communications to and from the debtor) and the final disposition of the debt. Information on an individual debtor may be disclosed only for purposes consistent with this Part, the Privacy Act of 1974, and other applicable law.

      § 1506.10   What information is included in a written demand for payment?

#### § § 1506.10

      (a) The Bill for Collection or demand letter shall inform the debtor of:

      (1) The amount, nature and basis of the debt;

      (2) The right of the debtor to inspect and copy records related to the debt;

      (3) The right of the debtor to discuss and propose a repayment agreement;

      (4) Any rights available to the debtor to dispute the validity of the debt or to have recovery of the debt waived (citing the available review or waiver authority, the conditions for review or waiver, and the effects of the review or waiver request on the collection of the debt);

      (5) The applicable standards for imposition of interest charges and penalty charges and administrative costs that may be assessed against a delinquent debt;

      (6) The date by which payment should be made to avoid late charges ( interest, penalties, and administrative costs), which may be not more than 30 days from the date that the demand letter is mailed or hand-delivered;

      (7) The name, address, and telephone number of a person or office within USADF available to discuss the debt;

      (8) The intention of USADF to enforce collection if the debtor fails to pay or otherwise resolve the debt, by taking one or more of the following actions:

      (i) Offset from Federal payments otherwise due to the debtor, including income tax refunds, salary, certain benefit payments, retirement, vendor payments, travel reimbursement and advances, and other Federal payments;

      (ii) Referral to a private collection agency;

      (iii) Report to credit bureaus;

      (iv) Administrative wage garnishment;

      (v) Referral to the Department of Justice for litigation action if the debt cannot be collected administratively;

      (vi) Transfer of any debt delinquent for more than 180 days to the Department of Treasury for collection; and

      (vii) Other actions authorized by the FCCS and applicable law.

      (9) Any rights available to the debtor to dispute the validity of the debt or to have recovery of the debt waived (citing the available review or waiver authority, the conditions for review or waiver, and the effects of the review or waiver request on the collection of the debt);

      (10) The instructions for making electronic payment; and

      (11) Requirement that the debtor advise USADF of any bankruptcy proceeding.

      (b) USADF may omit from the written demand for payment one or more of the provisions contained in paragraphs (a)(8) through (11) of this section if USADF determines that any provision is not legally required given the collection remedies to be applied to a particular debt, or which have already been provided by prior notice, applicable agreement, or contract.

      (c) USADF will respond promptly to communications from the debtor. Responses will generally be made within 30 days of the receipt of the communication from the debtor.

      § 1506.11   May I request a review of the existence or amount of a claim?

#### § § 1506.11

      (a) USADF shall provide the debtor with a reasonable opportunity for an internal review of the existence or amount of the debt. For offset of current Federal salary under 5 U.S.C. 5514, a debtor may also request a hearing. (See subpart C of this part).

      (b) A request for a review must be submitted in writing to the appropriate contact office by the payment due date indicated in the Bill for Collection or demand letter. The request must state the basis for the debtor's dispute of the claim and include any relevant documentation in support.

      (1) USADF will provide for an internal review of the debt by an appropriate official. The review may include examination of documents, internal discussions with relevant officials and discussions with the debtor, at USADF's discretion.

      (2) An oral hearing is not required when USADF determines that the matter can be decided on the documentary record. When an oral hearing is not required, USADF shall accord the debtor a “paper hearing,” that is, a determination of the request for reconsideration based upon a review of the written record.

      (3) Unless otherwise required by law, an oral hearing under this section is not required to be a formal evidentiary hearing, although USADF will carefully document all significant matters discussed at the hearing.

      § 1506.12   What happens if my debt becomes past due?

#### § § 1506.12

      USADF will transfer to the Department of Treasury's Bureau of Fiscal Services (BFS) any past due, legally enforceable non-tax debt that has been delinquent for 120 days or more for administrative offset, and delinquent for 180 days or more for other collections. BFS may take appropriate action to collect the debt in accordance with applicable law and regulation. USADF may transfer any past due, legally enforceable debt that has been delinquent for fewer than 120 days to BFS for collection in accordance with applicable law and regulation.

      § 1506.13   How are interest, penalty, and administrative costs determined?

#### § § 1506.13

      (a)  USADF will assess interest on all delinquent debts, unless prohibited by statute, regulation, or contract.

      (1) Interest begins to accrue on all debts from the payment due date established in the initial notice to the debtor, or as otherwise provided by law. USADF shall charge an annual rate of interest that is equal to the rate established annually by the Secretary of the Treasury in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3717 unless a different rate is necessary to protect the rights of the United States. USADF will notify the debtor of the basis for its finding that a different rate is necessary to protect the interest of the Government.

      (2) The rate of interest, as initially assessed, shall remain fixed for the duration of the indebtedness. If a debtor defaults on a repayment agreement, interest may be set at the Treasury rate in effect on the date a new agreement is executed.

      (3) Interest will not be assessed on interest charges, administrative costs or late payment penalties. However, where a debtor defaults on a previous repayment agreement and interest, administrative costs and penalty charges that had been waived under the defaulted agreement may be reinstated and added to the debt principal under any new agreement and interest may be charged on the entire amount of the debt.

      (b)  The costs of USADF's administrative processing of overdue debts, including charges assessed by the Department of Treasury in cross-servicing the debts based on either actual or average cost incurred, will be charged on all debts. These costs include both direct and indirect costs.

      (c)  Penalty charges will be assessed at 6 percent a year on any portion of a claim that is delinquent for more than 90 days.

      (d)  A partial payment by a debtor will be applied first towards outstanding administrative costs, penalty assessments, accrued interest and then towards the outstanding debt principal.

      (e)  (1) USADF will waive the collection of interest and administrative charges on any portion of the debt that is paid within 30 days after the date on which late payment charges begin to accrue. This 30 day period may be extended on a case-by-case basis where the Agency determines that such action is in the best interest of the Government.

      (2) USADF may (without regard to the amount of the debt) waive collection of all or part of accrued interest, penalty or administrative costs, where it determines that:

      (i) Waiver is justified under the criteria of subpart D; or

      (ii) Collection of these charges would be against equity and good conscience or not in the best interest of the United States.

      (3) A decision to waive interest, penalty charges or administrative costs may be made at any time.

      § 1506.14   Does interest accrue during the period pending waiver or review?

#### § § 1506.14

      During the period pending waiver or review, USADF may suspend accrual of interest, penalty charges, and administrative costs on any disputed portion of the debt if it is determined that suspension is in the Agency's best interest or would serve equity and good conscience. Interest, penalty, and administrative costs will not be assessed where a statute or regulation specifically prohibits collection of the debt during the period of the administrative appeal or the Agency review.

      § 1506.15   Does USADF contract with other agencies for collection services?

#### § § 1506.15

      (a) USADF has entered into a cross-servicing agreement with the Bureau of Fiscal Services (BFS) of the Department of Treasury. BFS will take appropriate action to collect and/or compromise transferred debts in accordance with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements. BFS may take any of the following collection actions on behalf of USADF:

      (1) Send demand letters on U.S. Treasury letterhead and telephone debtors;

      (2) Refer accounts to credit bureaus;

      (3) Purchase credit reports to assist in the collection effort;

      (4) Refer accounts for offset, including tax refund, Federal employee salary, administrative wage garnishment, and general administrative offset under the Treasury Offset Program;

      (5) Refer accounts to private collection agencies;

      (6) Refer accounts to the Department of Justice for litigation;

      (7) Report written off or discharged debt to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) on the appropriate Form 1099;

      (8) Take any additional steps necessary to enforce recovery; and

      (9) Terminate collection action, as appropriate.

      (b) BFS will maintain records on debt transferred to it, assure that accounts are updated as necessary, and modify its delinquent debt and debtor records with information obtained from its skip tracking and asset-location services as appropriate. In the event that a referred debtor disputes the validity of a debt or any terms and conditions related to any debt not reduced by judgment, BFS may return the disputed debt to USADF for its determination of debt validity.

      § 1506.16   Does USADF report delinquent debts to consumer reporting agencies?

#### § § 1506.16

      USADF may report delinquent debts to appropriate credit reporting bureaus and other automated databases through the cross-servicing agreement with BFS. Any such disclosure will be done in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3711(e) and the Federal Claims Collection Standards, 31 CFR 901.4, and in compliance with the Bankruptcy Code and Privacy Act 5 U.S.C. 552a.

      § 1506.17   For what purposes may USADF use my mailing address?

#### § § 1506.17

      When attempting to locate a debtor in order to collect or compromise a debt, USADF may obtain the debtor's mailing address from the Internal Revenue Service. Addresses obtained from the Internal Revenue Service will be used by USADF, its officers, employees, agents or contractors and other Federal agencies only to collect or dispose of debts, and may be disclosed to other agencies and to collection agencies only for collection purposes.

      § 1506.18   Will USADF suspend or revoke my financial assistance or other privileges if I fail to pay my debt?

#### § § 1506.18

      Unless waived by the Head of the Agency, USADF will not extend financial assistance in the form of a grant, loan, or loan guarantee to any person delinquent on a non-tax debt owed to a Federal agency. The authority to waive the application of this section may be delegated to the Chief Financial Officer and re-delegated. USADF may also suspend or revoke other privileges for any inexcusable, prolonged or repeated failure of a debtor to pay a claim. Additionally, the Agency may suspend or disqualify any contractor, lender, broker, borrower, grantee or other debtor from doing business with USADF or engaging in programs USADF sponsors or funds if a debtor fails to pay its debts to the Government within a reasonable time. Debtors will be notified before such action is taken and applicable debarment procedures will be used.

      § 1506.19   May I pay my debt in installments?

#### § § 1506.19

      (a) Whenever feasible, USADF shall collect the total amount of a debt (including interest, penalty, and administrative cost) in one lump sum. If the debtor is financially unable to pay the debt in one lump sum, USADF may accept payment in regular installments. USADF will obtain financial statements from debtors who represent that they are unable to pay on one lump sum and independently verify such representations whenever possible. In addition, USADF will obtain a legally enforceable written agreement from the debtor that specifies all of the terms of the arrangement and contains a provision accelerating the debt in the event of a default.

      (b) The size and frequency of the installment payments will bear a reasonable relation to the size of the debt and the debtor's ability to pay. To the extent possible, the installment payments will be sufficient in size and frequency to liquidate the debt in three years or less.

      (c) In appropriate cases, the Agency will obtain security for deferred payments. However, USADF may accept installment payments notwithstanding the refusal of the debtor to execute a written agreement or to give security.

    Subpart C—Administrative Offset

      § 1506.20   When and how will USADF collect past due debt through administrative offset?

#### § § 1506.20

      (a) Payments otherwise due the debtor from the United States shall be offset from the debt in accordance with 31 CFR 901.3. These may be funds under the control of USADF or other Federal agencies. Collection may be through centralized offset by the Bureau of Fiscal Service (BFS) of the Department of the Treasury.

      (b) Such payments include but are not limited to vendor payments, salary, retirement, lump sum payments due upon Federal employment separation, travel reimbursements, tax refunds, loans or other assistance. Offset of Federal salary payments will be in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 5514.

      (c) Before administrative offset is instituted by another Federal agency or the BFS, USADF shall certify in writing to that entity that the debt is past due and legally enforceable and that USADF has complied with all applicable due process and other requirements as described in this part and other Federal law and regulations.

      § 1506.21   I am a USADF employee; when will the Agency offset my salary to satisfy a debt against me?

#### § § 1506.21

      Any amount advanced to an employee for allowable travel expenses but not used for such purposes is recoverable from the employee, in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 5705, by salary offset without regard to the due process provisions in § 1506.22. This section does not apply to debts where collection by salary offset is explicitly prohibited by another statute. Collection of debt by salary offset will be in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 5514.

      § 1506.22   Am I entitled to notice and hearing prior to salary offset?

#### § § 1506.22

      (a)  (1) Prior to initiating collection action through salary offset, the Agency will provide all employees that owe a debt to the Government an opportunity to repay in full the amount owed, unless such opportunity will compromise the Government's ultimate ability to collect the debt.

      (2) Except as provided otherwise, each employee from whom the Agency proposes to collect a debt by salary offset will receive a written notice 30 days prior to any deductions from pay. The notification will include the Agency's determination that a debt is owed, the amount of the debt, the Agency's intention to collect the debt by means of deductions from the employee's pay account, and the employee's right to request a hearing on the claim.

      (3) An employee facing collection of debt by salary offset is entitled to request a hearing on the claim. The request must be filed in writing and signed by the employee. It must be received by the Agency within 15 days of the employee's receipt of the notification of proposed deduction. Late request for a hearing may be accepted if the employee can show that the delay in filing the request was due to circumstances beyond the employee's control.

      (4) The Agency will make hearing arrangements that are consistent with law and regulations. Where a hearing is held, the employee is entitled to a written decision on the following:

      (i) A determination of the Agency concerning the existence and amount of the debt; and

      (ii) A repayment schedule.

      (b)  The procedural requirements of paragraph (a) of this section are not applicable to overpayments of salary or allowances in the following situations:

      (1) Adjustments of pay arising out of an employee's election of coverage or a change in coverage under a Federal benefits program requiring periodic deduction from payment, if the amount to be recovered accumulated over four pay periods or less;

      (2) Routine intra-agency adjustments in pay or allowances that are made to correct overpayments of pay attributable to clerical or administrative errors or delays in processing pay documents, if the overpayments accrued over four pay periods or less; and

      (3) Any adjustment to collect a debt amounting to $50 or less.

      (c)  (1) The hearing official will make a decision based upon a review of the claim and any additional material submitted by the debtor. Where the hearing official determines that the validity of the debt turns on an issue of veracity or credibility which cannot be resolved through a review of documentary evidence, the hearing official at his discretion may afford the debtor an opportunity for an oral hearing. An oral hearing will consist of an informal conference before a hearing official in which the employee and the Agency may present evidence, witnesses and arguments. The employee may be represented by an individual of his/her choosing. The Agency shall maintain a summary record of all oral hearings provided under the procedures of this section.

      (2) Written decisions rendered pursuant to a hearing will include the hearing official's analysis, findings and conclusions. The decision will be final and binding on the parties.

      (d)  In certain circumstances, an employee may have a statutory right to request a waiver of overpayment of pay or allowances,  5 U.S.C. 5584 or 5 U.S.C. 5724(i). When an employee requests a waiver consideration under a right authorized by statue, further collection on the debt will be suspended until a final administrative decision is made on the waiver request.

      (e)  An employee's payment of all or any portion of a debt does not waive any rights that the employee may have under either the procedures in this section or any other provision of law.

      § 1506.23   Will the debt be collected in a lump sum or by installment deductions from my pay account?

#### § § 1506.23

      A debt will be collected in a lump sum or by installment deductions at established pay intervals from an employee's current pay account. If the employee is financially unable to pay a debt in a lump sum or the amount of debt exceeds 15 percent of disposable pay, collection will be made in installments, unless the employee and the Agency agree to alternative arrangements for payment. Alternative payment schedules must be in writing, signed by both the employee and the CFO and will be documented in the Agency's files.

      § 1506.24   Are there any limitations on the amount of salary deduction?

#### § § 1506.24

      Installment deduction will be made over the period of active duty or employment. The size and frequency of the installment deductions generally will bear a reasonable relation to the size of the debt and the employee's ability to pay. However, an amount deducted for any period may not exceed 15 percent of the disposable pay from which the deduction is made, unless the employee has agreed in writing to the deduction of a greater amount. If possible, the installment payments should be in amounts sufficient to liquidate the debt within a period of three years or less. Installment payments of less than $50 will be accepted only in the most unusual circumstances.

      § 1506.25   When will deduction from my pay account begin?

#### § § 1506.25

      (a) Deductions to liquidate an employee's debt will begin on the date stated in the Agency's Bill for Collection or demand letter notice of intention to collect from the employee's current pay, unless the debt has been repaid in full or the employee has filed a timely request for hearing.

      (b) If an employee files a timely request for hearing, deductions will begin after the hearing official has provided the employee with a final written decision indicating the amount owed to the Government. Following the decision by the hearing official, the employee will be given 30 days to repay the amount owed prior to collection through salary offset, unless otherwise provided by the hearing official.

      § 1506.26   What happens if my employment with USADF ends prior to repaying the full amount of my debt?

#### § § 1506.26

      If the employee retires, resigns, or the period of employment ends before collection of the debt is completed, the remainder of the debt will be offset from subsequent payments of any nature due the employee ( final salary payment, lump-sum leave, etc.).

      § 1506.27   How are interest, penalty, and administrative costs assessed?

#### § § 1506.27

      USADF will assess interest, penalties and administrative costs on debts collected under the procedures in this section. Interest, penalty and administrative costs will continue to accrue during the period that the debtor is seeking formal or informal review of the debt or requesting a waiver. The following guidelines apply to the assessment of these costs on debts collected by salary offset:

      (a) Interest will be assessed on all debts not collected by the payment due date specified in the Bill for Collection or demand letter. USADF will waive the interest and administrative charges on the portion of the debt that is paid within 30 days after the date on which interest begins to accrue.

      (b) Administrative costs will be assessed if the debt is referred to Treasury for cross-servicing.

      (c) Deductions by administrative offset normally begin prior to the time for assessment of a penalty. Therefore, a penalty charge will not be assessed unless deductions occur more than 90 days from the due date in the Bill for Collection or demand letter.

      § 1506.28   Will I receive a refund if the claim against me is found to be without merit?

#### § § 1506.28

      USADF will promptly refund to the employee any amounts paid or deducted pursuant to this section that are subsequently waived or found not owing to the United States Government. Refunds do not bear interest unless specifically authorized by law.

      § 1506.29   Is there a time limit for initiating collection by salary offset?

#### § § 1506.29

      USADF will not initiate salary offset to collect a debt more than 1 year after the Government's right to collect the debt first accrued, unless facts material to the right to collect the debt were not known and could not have been known through the exercise of reasonable care by the Government official responsible for discovering and collecting such debt.

      § 1506.30   Can USADF use salary offset means to collect a claim against me if USADF is not the creditor agency?

#### § § 1506.30

      (a) USADF will use salary offset means of collecting debt against one of its employees that is indebted to another agency if requested to do so by that agency. The requesting agency must certify that the USADF employee owes a debt and that the procedural requirements of 5 U.S.C. 5514 and 5 CFR part 550, subpart K, have been met. The creditor agency must also advise USADF of the amount of debt, and the number and amount of the installments to be collected.

      (b) Request for salary offset must be submitted to the CFO of USADF.

      (c) Processing of the claim by USADF—

      (1)  A creditor agency will be required to supply USADF with all the required information prior to any salary offset from the employee's current pay account.

      (2)  If the claim procedures in paragraph (a) of this section have been properly completed, deduction will begin on the next established pay period. USADF will not review the merits of the creditor agency's determinations with respect to the amount or validity of the debt as stated in the debt claim form. USADF will not assess a handling or any other related charge to cover the cost of its processing the claim.

      (d) Employees separating from USADF before a debt to another agency is collected—

      (1)  If an employee begins separation action before USADF collects the total debt due the creditor agency, the following actions will be taken:

      (i) To the extent possible, the balance owed the creditor agency will be liquidated from subsequent payments of any nature due the employee from USADF;

      (ii) If the total amount of the debt cannot be recovered, USADF will certify to the creditor agency and the employee the total amount of USADF's collection; and

      (iii) If USADF is aware that the employee is entitled to payments from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund, or other similar payments, it will provide such information to the creditor agency so that it can file a certified claim against the payments.

      (2)  If an USADF employee transfers to another Federal agency before USADF collects the total amount due the creditor agency, USADF will certify the total amount of the collection made on the debt. It is the responsibility of the creditor agency to ensure that the collection is resumed by the new employing agency.

    Subpart D—Compromise of Debts

      § 1506.31   May USADF reduce or negotiate a claim amount?

#### § § 1506.31

      USADF may compromise claims for money or property where the principal balance of a claim, excluding interest, penalty and administrative costs, does not exceed $100,000. Where the claim exceeds $100,000, the authority to accept the compromise rests solely with DOJ. The CFO may reject an offer of compromise in any amount. Where the claim exceeds $100,000, USADF may refer the claim to DOJ for approval with a recommendation to accept an offer of compromise. The referral will be in the form of a Claims Collection Litigation Report (CCLR) and will outline the basis for USADF's recommendation.

      § 1506.32   If I am jointly and severally liable on a claim, will USADF delay collection action against me until the other debtors pay their proportional share?

#### § § 1506.32

      When two or more debtors are jointly and severally liable, collection action will not be withheld against one debtor until the other or others pay their proportionate share. The amount of a compromise with one debtor is not precedent in determining compromises from other debtors who have been determined to be jointly and severally liable on the claim.

      § 1506.33   Under what circumstances will USADF compromise a claim?

#### § § 1506.33

      (a) USADF may compromise a claim pursuant to this section if the debtor does not have the financial ability to pay the full amount of the debt within a reasonable time, or the debtor refuses to pay the claim in full and the Government does not have the ability to enforce collection in full within a reasonable time by collection proceedings. In evaluating the acceptability of a compromise offer, the CFO may consider, among other factors, the following:

      (1) Age and health of the debtor;

      (2) Present and potential income;

      (3) Inheritance prospects;

      (4) The possibility that assets have been concealed or improperly transferred by the debtor;

      (5) The availability of assets or income which may be realized by enforced collection proceedings; or

      (6) The applicable exemptions available to the debtor under State and Federal law in determining the Government's ability to enforce collection.

      (b) USADF may compromise a claim, or recommend acceptance of a compromise offer to DOJ, if:

      (1) There is significant doubt concerning the Government's ability to prove its case in court for the full amount of the claim, either because of the legal issues involved or a bona fide dispute as to the facts; or

      (2) The cost of collection does not justify the enforced collection of the full amount of the debt.

      The amount accepted in compromise in such cases will reflect the costs of collection, the probability of prevailing on the legal issues involved, and the likely amount of court costs and attorney's fees in litigation.

      (c) To assess the merits of a compromise offer, USADF generally will require a current financial statement from the debtor, executed under penalty of perjury, showing the debtor's assets, liabilities, income and expenses.

      (d) Statutory penalties, forfeitures or debt established as an aid to enforcement and compel compliance may be compromised where the CFO determines that the Agency's enforcement policy, in terms of deterrence and securing compliance (both present and future), will be adequately served by accepting the offer.

      § 1506.34   Can I pay a compromised claim in installments?

#### § § 1506.34

      The debtor may not pay a compromised claim in installments unless the CFO determines that payment in installments is necessary to effect collection.

      § 1506.35   Will USADF execute a release after full payment of a compromised amount?

#### § § 1506.35

      Upon receipt of a payment in full or a compromised amount of a claim, USADF will prepare and execute a release.

    Subpart E—Suspension or Termination of Collection Action

      § 1506.36   Under what circumstances may USADF suspend collection actions?

#### § § 1506.36

      USADF may suspend or terminate the Agency's collection actions on a debt where the outstanding debt principal does not exceed $100,000. Unless otherwise provided by DOJ regulations, USADF must refer all requests for suspension of debt exceeding $100,000 to the Commercial Litigation Branch, Civil Division, Department of Justice, for approval. If prior to referral to DOJ, USADF determines that a debt is plainly erroneous or clearly without legal merit, the Agency may terminate collection activity regardless of the amount involved without obtaining DOJ concurrence. USADF may waive the assessment of interest, penalty charges and administrative costs during the period of the suspension. Suspension will be for an estimated time period and generally will be reviewed at least every six months to ensure the continued propriety of the suspension.

      § 1506.37   What are the criteria for suspension?

#### § § 1506.37

      (a) USADF may suspend collection action on a debt when:

      (1) The debtor cannot be located;

      (2) The debtor's financial condition is expected to improve; or

      (3) The debtor has requested a waiver or review of the debt.

      (b) Based on the current financial condition of the debtor, USADF may suspend collection activity on a debt when the debtor's future prospects justify retention of the claim for periodic review, and:

      (1) The applicable statute of limitations has not expired; or

      (2) Future collection can be effected by offset; or

      (3) The debtor agrees to pay interest on the debt and suspension is likely to enhance the debtor's ability to fully pay the principal amount of the debt with interest at a later date.

      (c) USADF will suspend collection activity during the time required for waiver consideration or administrative review prior to agency collection of a debt if the statute under which the request is sought prohibits the Agency from collecting the debt during that time. USADF will ordinarily suspend collection action during the pendency of its consideration of a waiver request or administrative review where statute and regulation preclude refund of amounts collected by the Agency should the debtor prevail.

      (d) USADF may suspend collection activities on debts of $100,000 or less during the pendency of a permissive waiver or administrative review when there is no statutory requirement and where it determines that:

      (1) There is a reasonable possibility that waiver will be granted and the debtor may be found not owing the debt (in whole or in part);

      (2) The Government's interest is protected, if suspension is granted, by the reasonable assurance that the debt can be recovered if the debtor does not prevail; or

      (3) Collection of the debt will cause undue hardship to the debtor.

      (e) USADF will decline to suspend collection where it determines that the request for waiver or administrative review is frivolous or was made primarily to delay collection.

      § 1506.38   Under what circumstances may USADF terminate collection actions?

#### § § 1506.38

      USADF may terminate collection actions including accrued interest, penalty and administrative costs, where the debt principal does not exceed $100,000. If the debt exceeds $100,000, USADF must obtain the approval from DOJ to terminate further collection actions. Unless otherwise provided for by DOJ regulations, requests to terminate collection on debts in excess of $100,000 are referred to the Commercial Litigation Branch, Civil Division, Department of Justice, for approval.

      § 1506.39   What are the criteria for termination?

#### § § 1506.39

      A debt may be terminated where USADF determines that:

      (a) The Government cannot collect or enforce collection of any significant sum from the debtor, having due regard for available judicial remedies, the debtor's ability to pay, and the exemptions available to the debtor under State and Federal law;

      (b) The debtor cannot be located, there is no security remaining to be liquidated, and the prospects of collecting by offset are too remote to justify retention of the claim;

      (c) The cost of further collection action is likely to exceed the amount recoverable;

      (d) The claim is determined to be legally without merit or enforcement of the debt is barred by any applicable statute of limitations;

      (e) The evidence necessary to prove the claim cannot be produced or the necessary witnesses are unavailable and efforts to induce voluntary payment have failed; or

      (f) The debt against the debtor has been discharged in bankruptcy.

      § 1506.40   What actions by the Agency are permitted after termination of collection activity?

#### § § 1506.40

      Termination ceases active collection of a debt. However, termination does not preclude the Agency from retaining a record of the account for purposes of:

      (a) Selling the debt if the CFO determines that such sale is in the best interests of USADF;

      (b) Pursuing collection at a subsequent date in the event there is a change in the debtor's status or a new collection tool becomes available;

      (c) Offsetting against future income or assets not available at the time of termination of collection activity; or

      (d) Screening future applicants for prior indebtedness.

      § 1506.41   Can the Agency collect against a debt that has been discharged in bankruptcy?

#### § § 1506.41

      USADF will generally terminate collection activity on a debt that has been discharged in bankruptcy regardless of the amount. However, USADF may continue collection activity subject to the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code for any payments provided under a plan of reorganization. The CFO will seek legal advice from the General Counsel's office if s/he believes that any claims or offsets may have survived the discharge of a debtor.

    Subpart F—Discharge of Indebtedness and Reporting Requirements

      § 1506.42   Under what circumstances will USADF discharge a delinquent debt?

#### § § 1506.42

      Before discharging a delinquent debt, USADF will make a determination that collection action is no longer warranted and request that litigation counsel release any liens of record securing the debt. Discharge of indebtedness is distinct from termination or suspension of collection activity and is governed by the Internal Revenue Code. When collection action on a debt is suspended or terminated, the debt remains delinquent and further collection action may be pursued at a later date in accordance with the standards set forth in this part. When a debt is discharged in full or in part, further collection action is prohibited and USADF must terminate all debt collection activities.

      § 1506.43   Will USADF report a discharge of debt to the IRS?

#### § § 1506.43

      Upon discharge of a debt, USADF will report the discharge to the IRS in accordance with the requirements of 26 U.S.C. 6050P and 26 CFR 1.6050P-1. USADF may request the Bureau of Fiscal Services of the Department of Treasury to file such a discharge report to the IRS on the agency's behalf.

    Subpart G—Referrals to the Department of Justice

      § 1506.44   When will USADF refer claims to the Department of Justice for litigation?

#### § § 1506.44

      Unless otherwise provided by DOJ regulations or procedures, USADF will refer for litigation debts of more than $2,500 but less than $1,000,000 to the Department of Justice's Nationwide Central Intake Facility as required by the Claims Collection Litigation Report (CCLR) instructions. Debts of over $1,000,000 shall be referred to the Civil Division at the Department of Justice. Any debt involving fraud, false claim, and misrepresentation will be referred to the Department of Justice.

    Subpart H—Mandatory Transfer of Delinquent Debt to the Bureau of Fiscal Services (BFS) of the Department of Treasury

      § 1506.45   When is it mandatory for USADF to transfer debts to BFS?

#### § § 1506.45

      (a) USADF will transfer legally enforceable debt to BFS 90 days after the Bill for Collection or demand letter is issued. A debt is legally enforceable if there has been a final agency determination that the debt is due and there are no legal bars to collection action. A debt is not legally enforceable for purposes of mandatory transfer to BFS if it is the subject of a pending administrative review process required by statute or regulation and collection action during the review process is prohibited.

      (b) Except as set forth in paragraph (a) of this section, USADF will transfer any debt covered by this part that is more than 180 days delinquent to BFS for debt collection services. A debt is 180 days delinquent for purposes of this section if it is 180 days past due and is legally enforceable.

      § 1506.46   When is USADF not required to transfer a debt to BFS?

#### § § 1506.46

      USADF is not required to transfer a debt to BFS pursuant to § 1506.37(b) during the period of time that the debt:

      (a) Is in litigation or foreclosure;

      (b) Is scheduled for sale;

      (c) Is at a private collection contractor;

      (d) Is at a debt collection center if the debt has been referred to a Treasury-designated debt collection center;

      (e) Is being collected by internal offset; or

      (f) Is covered by an exemption granted by Treasury.

It is further the policy of the Foundation to maintain its records in such a fashion that the information contained therein is, and remains, material and relevant to the purposes for which it is collected. Information in such records will be collected, maintained, used or disseminated in a manner that assures that such action is for a necessary and lawful purpose, and that adequate safeguards are provided to prevent misuse of such information. Exemptions from records requirements provided in 5 U.S.C. 552a will be permitted only where an important public policy need for such exemptions has been determined pursuant to specific statutory authority.

    § 1507.3   Definitions.

#### § § 1507.3

    (a)  means any document, collection, or grouping of information about an individual maintained by the Foundation, including but not limited to information regarding education, financial transactions, medical history, criminal or employment history, or any other personal information which contains the name or personal identification number, symbol, photograph, or other identifying particular assigned to such individual, such as a finger or voiceprint.

    (b)  means a group of any records under the control of the Foundation from which information is retrieved by use of the name of an individual or by some identifying particular assigned to the individual.

    § 1507.4   Conditions of disclosure.

#### § § 1507.4

    The Foundation will not disclose any record contained in a system of records by any means of communication to any person or any other agency except by written request or prior written consent of the individual to whom the record pertains or his or her agent or attorney, unless such disclosure is:

    (a) To those officers and employees of the Foundation who have a need for the records in the official performance of their duties;

    (b) Required under the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552);

    (c) For a routine use of the record compatible with the purpose for which it was collected;

    (d) To the Bureau of the Census for purpose of planning or carrying out a census or survey or related activity pursuant to title 13, United States Code;

    (e) To a recipient who has provided the Foundation with advance adequate written assurance that the record will be used solely as a statistical research or reporting record, and the record is to be transferred to a form that is not individually identifiable;

    (f) To the National Archives of the United States as a record which has sufficient historical or other value to warrant its continued preservation by the U.S. Government, or for evaluation by the Administrator of General Services, or designee, to determine whether the record has such value;

    (g) To another agency or to an instrumentality of any governmental jurisdiction within or under the control of the United States for a civil or criminal law enforcement activity if the activity is authorized by law, and if the head of the agency or instrumentality has made a written request to the Foundation specifying the particular portion desired and the law enforcement activity for which the record is sought;

    (h) To a person, pursuant to a showing of compelling circumstances affecting the health or safety of an individual, if, promptly following such disclosure, notification is transmitted to the last known address of the individual to whom the record pertains;

    (i) To either House of Congress, or, to the extent of matters within its jurisdiction, any committee or subcommittee thereof, any joint committee of Congress or subcommittee of any such joint committee;

    (j) To the Comptroller General, or any authorized representative, in the course of the performance of the duties of the General Accounting Office; or

    (k) Pursuant to the order of a court of competent jurisdiction. If any record disclosed under compulsory legal process is subsequently made public by the court which issued it, the Foundation must make a reasonable effort to notify the individual to whom the record pertains of such disclosure.

    (l) To consumer reporting agencies as defined in 31 U.S.C. 370(a)(3) in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3711, and under contracts for collection services as authorized in 31 U.S.C. 3718.

    § 1507.5   Accounting for disclosure of records.

#### § § 1507.5

    (a) With respect to each system of records under ADF control, the Foundation will keep an accurate accounting of routine disclosures, except those made to employees of the Foundation in the normal course of duties or pursuant to the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act. Such accounting shall contain the following:

    (1) The date, nature and purpose of each disclosure, and the name and address of the person or agency to whom the disclosure is made:

    (2) Sufficient information to permit the construction of a listing of all disclosures at appropriate periodic intervals; and

    (3) The justification or basis upon which any release was made including any written documentation required.

    (b) The Foundation will retain the accounting made under this section for at least 5 years or the life of the record, whichever is longer, after the disclosure for which the accounting is made.

    (c) Except for disclosure made under paragraph (g) of § 1503.3, the Foundation will make the accounting under paragraph (a) of this section available to the individual named in the record at his or her request.

    (d) The Foundation will inform any person or other agency about any correction or notation of dispute made by the agency of any record that has been disclosed to the person or agency if an accounting of the disclosure was made.

    § 1507.6   Access to records.

#### § § 1507.6

    (a) Except as otherwise provided by law or regulation, any individual, upon request made either in writing or in person during regular business hours, shall be provided access to his or her record or to any information pertaining to him or her which is contained in a system of records maintained by the Foundation. The individual will be permitted to review the record and have a copy made of all or any portion thereof in a form comprehensible to him or her. Nothing in 5 U.S.C. 552a, however, allows an individual access to any information compiled in reasonable anticipation of a civil action or proceeding.

    (b) An individual will be notified, upon request, if any Foundation system of records contains a record pertaining to him or her. Such request may be made in person during regular business hours, or in writing over the signature of the person making the request. Individuals requesting the information will be required to identify themselves by providing their names, addresses, and a signature. If they are requesting disclosure in person, they are also required to show an identification card, such as a drivers license, containing a photo and a sample signature. If the request is received through the mail, the Foundation may request such information as may be necessary to assure that the requesting individual is properly identified. This may include a requirement that the request be notarized with a notation that the notary received an acknowledgement of identity from the requester.

    (c) A record may be disclosed to a representative of the person to whom a record relates when the representative is authorized in writing by such person to have access.

    (d) Requests for access to or copies of records should contain, at a minimum, identifying information needed to locate any given record, and a brief description of the item or items of information required. If the individual wishes access to specific documents, the request should identify or describe, as nearly as possible, such documents. The request should be made to the Director, Administration and Finance, African Development Foundation, 1625 Massachusetts Avenue NW., Suite 600, Washington, DC 20036. Personal contacts should normally be made during the regular duty hours of the officer concerned, which are 8:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. Monday through Friday.

    (e) A request made in person will be promptly complied with if the records sought are in the immediate custody of the Foundation. Mail or personal requests for documents which are not in the immediate custody of ADF or which are otherwise not immediately available, will be acknowledged within ten working days of receipt, and the records will be provided as promptly thereafter as possible.

    (f) Special procedures may be established by the President of the Foundation governing the disclosure to an individual of his or her medical records, including psychological records.

    (g) Any individual may request the Director, Administration and Finance, to amend any Foundation record pertaining to him or her. Not later than 10 working days after the date of receipt of such request, the Director, Administration and Finance, or his/her designee, will acknowledge such receipt in writing. Promptly after acknowledging receipt of a request, the Director, Administration and Finance or his/her designee will:

    (1) Correct any portion of the record which the individual believes is not accurate, relevant, timely, or complete; or

    (2) Inform the individual of the Foundation's refusal to amend the record in accordance with the request, the reason for the refusal, the procedures by which the individual may request a review of that refusal by the President of the Foundation, or his/her designee, and the name and address of such official; or

    (3) Refer the request to the agency that has control of and maintains the record when the record requested is not the property of the Foundation, but of the controlling agency.

    (h) Any individual who disagrees with the refusal of the Director, Administration and Finance to amend his or her record may request a review of that refusal. Such request for review must be made within 30 days after receipt by the requester of the initial refusal to amend. The President of the Foundation, or designee, will complete such review not later than 30 working days from the date on which the individual requests such review, and make a final determination, unless for good cause shown, the President or designee extends such 30-day period and notifies the requester in writing that additional time is required to complete the review. If, after review, the President or designee refuses to amend the record in accordance with the request, the individual will be advised of the right to file with the Foundation a concise statement setting forth the reasons for his or her disagreement with the refusal, and also advised of the provisions in the Act for judicial review of the President's determination.

    (i) In any disclosure containing information about which the individual has filed a statement under paragraph (g) of this section, the Foundation will clearly note any part of the record which is disputed and provide copies of the statement and, if the Foundation deems it appropriate, copies of a concise statement of the Foundation's reasons for not making the amendment requested, to persons or other agencies to whom the disputed record has been disclosed.

    § 1507.7   Contents of records systems.

    (2) The categories of individuals on whom records are maintained in the system or systems;

    (3) The categories of records maintained in the system or sytems;

    (g) The Foundation will maintain no record describing how any individual exercises rights guaranteed by the First Amendment of the Constitution of the United States unless expressly authorized by statute or by the individual about whom the record is maintained, or unless pertinent to, and within the scope of, an authorized law enforcement activity.

    (h) The Foundation will establish rules of conduct for persons involved in the design, development, operation, or maintenance of any system of records, or in maintaining any record. Each such person will be instructed regarding such rules and the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 552a. The instruction will include any other rules and procedures adopted pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a, and the penalties provided for noncompliance.

    (i) The Foundation will establish appropriate administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to insure the security and confidentiality of records and to protect against any anticipated threats or hazards to their security or integrity which could result in substantial harm, embarrassment, inconvenience, or unfairness to any individual on whom information is maintained.

    (j) At least 30 days prior to the publication of the notice in the  regarding the routine use of the records contained in the Foundation's system or systems of records, including the categories of users and the purpose of such use pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section, the Foundation will also:

    (b) Refuses to comply with an individual's request; or

    (c) Fails to maintain any record concerning an individual with such accuracy, relevance, timeliness, and completeness as is necessary to assure fairness in any determination relating to the qualifications, character, rights or opportunities of, or benefits to the individual that may be made on the basis of such record, and consequently a determination is made which is adverse to the individual; or

    (d) Fails to comply with any other provision of 5 U.S.C. 552a, or any Foundation regulation promulgated thereunder, in any such a way as to have an adverse effect on an individual.

    Subpart A—General

      § 1508.100   What does this part do?

#### § § 1508.100

      This part adopts a governmentwide system of debarment and suspension for ADF nonprocurement activities. It also provides for reciprocal exclusion of persons who have been excluded under the Federal Acquisition Regulation, and provides for the consolidated listing of all persons who are excluded, or disqualified by statute, executive order, or other legal authority. This part satisfies the requirements in section 3 of Executive Order 12549, “Debarment and Suspension” (3 CFR 1986 Comp., p. 189), Executive Order 12689, “Debarment and Suspension” (3 CFR 1989 Comp., p. 235) and 31 U.S.C. 6101 note (Section 2455, Public Law 103-355, 108 Stat. 3327).

      § 1508.105   Does this part apply to me?

#### § § 1508.105

      Portions of this part (see table at § 1508.25(b)) apply to you if you are a(n)—

      (a) Person who has been, is, or may reasonably be expected to be, a participant or principal in a covered transaction;

      (b) Respondent (a person against whom the African Development Foundation has initiated a debarment or suspension action);

      (c) ADF debarring or suspending official; or

      (d) ADF official who is authorized to enter into covered transactions with non-Federal parties.

      § 1508.110   What is the purpose of the nonprocurement debarment and suspension system?

#### § § 1508.110

      (a) To protect the public interest, the Federal Government ensures the integrity of Federal programs by conducting business only with responsible persons.

      (b) A Federal agency uses the nonprocurement debarment and suspension system to exclude from Federal programs persons who are not presently responsible.

      (c) An exclusion is a serious action that a Federal agency may take only to protect the public interest. A Federal agency may not exclude a person or commodity for the purposes of punishment.

      § 1508.115   How does an exclusion restrict a person's involvement in covered transactions?

#### § § 1508.115

      With the exceptions stated in §§ 1508.120, 1508.315, and 1508.420, a person who is excluded by the African Development Foundation or any other Federal agency may not:

      (a) Be a participant in a(n) ADF transaction that is a covered transaction under subpart B of this part;

      (b) Be a participant in a transaction of any other Federal agency that is a covered transaction under that agency's regulation for debarment and suspension; or

      (c) Act as a principal of a person participating in one of those covered transactions.

      § 1508.120   May we grant an exception to let an excluded person participate in a covered transaction?

#### § § 1508.120

      (a) The ADF President may grant an exception permitting an excluded person to participate in a particular covered transaction. If the ADF President grants an exception, the exception must be in writing and state the reason(s) for deviating from the governmentwide policy in Executive Order 12549.

      (b) An exception granted by one agency for an excluded person does not extend to the covered transactions of another agency.

      § 1508.125   Does an exclusion under the nonprocurement system affect a person's eligibility for Federal procurement contracts?

#### § § 1508.125

      If any Federal agency excludes a person under its nonprocurement common rule on or after August 25, 1995, the excluded person is also ineligible to participate in Federal procurement transactions under the FAR. Therefore, an exclusion under this part has reciprocal effect in Federal procurement transactions.

      § 1508.130   Does exclusion under the Federal procurement system affect a person's eligibility to participate in nonprocurement transactions?

#### § § 1508.130

      If any Federal agency excludes a person under the FAR on or after August 25, 1995, the excluded person is also ineligible to participate in nonprocurement covered transactions under this part. Therefore, an exclusion under the FAR has reciprocal effect in Federal nonprocurement transactions.

      § 1508.135   May the African Development Foundation exclude a person who is not currently participating in a nonprocurement transaction?

#### § § 1508.135

      Given a cause that justifies an exclusion under this part, we may exclude any person who has been involved, is currently involved, or may reasonably be expected to be involved in a covered transaction.

      § 1508.140   How do I know if a person is excluded?

#### § § 1508.140

      Check the  to determine whether a person is excluded. The General Services Administration (GSA) maintains the  and makes it available, as detailed in subpart E of this part. When a Federal agency takes an action to exclude a person under the nonprocurement or procurement debarment and suspension system, the agency enters the information about the excluded person into the

      § 1508.145   Does this part address persons who are disqualified, as well as those who are excluded from nonprocurement transactions?

#### § § 1508.145

      Except if provided for in Subpart J of this part, this part—

      (a) Addresses disqualified persons only to—

      (1) Provide for their inclusion in the  and

      (2) State responsibilities of Federal agencies and participants to check for disqualified persons before entering into covered transactions.

      (b) Does not specify the—

      (1) ADF transactions for which a disqualified person is ineligible. Those transactions vary on a case-by-case basis, because they depend on the language of the specific statute, Executive order, or regulation that caused the disqualification;

      (2) Entities to which the disqualification applies; or

      (3) Process that the agency uses to disqualify a person. Unlike exclusion, disqualification is frequently not a discretionary action that a Federal agency takes.

    Subpart B—Covered Transactions

      § 1508.200   What is a covered transaction?

#### § § 1508.200

      A covered transaction is a nonprocurement or procurement transaction that is subject to the prohibitions of this part. It may be a transaction at—

      (a) The primary tier, between a Federal agency and a person (see appendix to this part); or

      (b) A lower tier, between a participant in a covered transaction and another person.

      § 1508.205   Why is it important if a particular transaction is a covered transaction?

#### § § 1508.205

      The importance of a covered transaction depends upon who you are.

      (a) As a participant in the transaction, you have the responsibilities laid out in Subpart C of this part. Those include responsibilities to the person or Federal agency at the next higher tier from whom you received the transaction, if any. They also include responsibilities if you subsequently enter into other covered transactions with persons at the next lower tier.

      (b) As a Federal official who enters into a primary tier transaction, you have the responsibilities laid out in subpart D of this part.

      (c) As an excluded person, you may not be a participant or principal in the transaction unless—

      (1) The person who entered into the transaction with you allows you to continue your involvement in a transaction that predates your exclusion, as permitted under § 1508.310 or § 1508.415; or

      (2) A(n) ADF official obtains an exception from the ADF President to allow you to be involved in the transaction, as permitted under § 1508.120.

      § 1508.210   Which nonprocurement transactions are covered transactions?

#### § § 1508.210

      All nonprocurement transactions, as defined in § 1508.970, are covered transactions unless listed in § 1508.215. (See appendix to this part.)

      § 1508.215   Which nonprocurement transactions are not covered transactions?

#### § § 1508.215

      The following types of nonprocurement transactions are not covered transactions:

      (a) A direct award to—

      (1) A foreign government or foreign governmental entity;

      (2) A public international organization;

      (3) An entity owned (in whole or in part) or controlled by a foreign government; or

      (4) Any other entity consisting wholly or partially of one or more foreign governments or foreign governmental entities.

      (b) A benefit to an individual as a personal entitlement without regard to the individual's present responsibility (but benefits received in an individual's business capacity are not excepted). For example, if a person receives social security benefits under the Supplemental Security Income provisions of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. 1301  those benefits are not covered transactions and, therefore, are not affected if the person is excluded.

      (c) Federal employment.

      (d) A transaction that the African Development Foundation needs to respond to a national or agency-recognized emergency or disaster.

      (e) A permit, license, certificate, or similar instrument issued as a means to regulate public health, safety, or the environment, unless the African Development Foundation specifically designates it to be a covered transaction.

      (f) An incidental benefit that results from ordinary governmental operations.

      (g) Any other transaction if the application of an exclusion to the transaction is prohibited by law.

      § 1508.220   Are any procurement contracts included as covered transactions?

#### § § 1508.220

      (a) Covered transactions under this part—

      (1) Do not include any procurement contracts awarded directly by a Federal agency; but

      (2) Do include some procurement contracts awarded by non-Federal participants in nonprocurement covered transactions (see appendix to this part).

      (b) Specifically, a contract for goods or services is a covered transaction if any of the following applies:

      (1) The contract is awarded by a participant in a nonprocurement transaction that is covered under § 1508.210, and the amount of the contract is expected to equal or exceed $25,000.

      (2) The contract requires the consent of a(n) ADF official. In that case, the contract, regardless of the amount, always is a covered transaction, and it does not matter who awarded it. For example, it could be a subcontract awarded by a contractor at a tier below a nonprocurement transaction, as shown in the appendix to this part.

      (3) The contract is for federally-required audit services.

      § 1508.225   How do I know if a transaction in which I may participate is a covered transaction?

#### § § 1508.225

      As a participant in a transaction, you will know that it is a covered transaction because the agency regulations governing the transaction, the appropriate agency official, or participant at the next higher tier who enters into the transaction with you, will tell you that you must comply with applicable portions of this part.

    Subpart C—Responsibilities of Participants Regarding Transactions

      Doing Business With Other Persons

        § 1508.300   What must I do before I enter into a covered transaction with another person at the next lower tier?

#### § § 1508.300

        When you enter into a covered transaction with another person at the next lower tier, you must verify that the person with whom you intend to do business is not excluded or disqualified. You do this by:

        (a) Checking the  or

        (b) Collecting a certification from that person if allowed by this rule; or

        (c) Adding a clause or condition to the covered transaction with that person.

#### § § 1508.305

        (a) You as a participant may not enter into a covered transaction with an excluded person, unless the African Development Foundation grants an exception under § 1508.120.

        (b) You may not enter into any transaction with a person who is disqualified from that transaction, unless you have obtained an exception under the disqualifying statute, Executive order, or regulation.

        § 1508.310   What must I do if a Federal agency excludes a person with whom I am already doing business in a covered transaction?

#### § § 1508.310

        (a) You as a participant may continue covered transactions with an excluded person if the transactions were in existence when the agency excluded the person. However, you are not required to continue the transactions, and you may consider termination. You should make a decision about whether to terminate and the type of termination action, if any, only after a thorough review to ensure that the action is proper and appropriate.

        (b) You may not renew or extend covered transactions (other than no-cost time extensions) with any excluded person, unless the African Development Foundation grants an exception under § 1508.120.

        § 1508.315   May I use the services of an excluded person as a principal under a covered transaction?

#### § § 1508.315

        (a) You as a participant may continue to use the services of an excluded person as a principal under a covered transaction if you were using the services of that person in the transaction before the person was excluded. However, you are not required to continue using that person's services as a principal. You should make a decision about whether to discontinue that person's services only after a thorough review to ensure that the action is proper and appropriate.

        (b) You may not begin to use the services of an excluded person as a principal under a covered transaction unless the African Development Foundation grants an exception under § 1508.120.

        § 1508.320   Must I verify that principals of my covered transactions are eligible to participate?

#### § § 1508.320

        Yes, you as a participant are responsible for determining whether any of your principals of your covered transactions is excluded or disqualified from participating in the transaction. You may decide the method and frequency by which you do so. You may, but you are not required to, check the

        § 1508.325   What happens if I do business with an excluded person in a covered transaction?

#### § § 1508.325

        If as a participant you knowingly do business with an excluded person, we may disallow costs, annul or terminate the transaction, issue a stop work order, debar or suspend you, or take other remedies as appropriate.

        § 1508.330   What requirements must I pass down to persons at lower tiers with whom I intend to do business?

#### § § 1508.330

        Before entering into a covered transaction with a participant at the next lower tier, you must require that participant to—

        (a) Comply with this subpart as a condition of participation in the transaction. You may do so using any method(s), unless § 1508.440 requires you to use specific methods.

        (b) Pass the requirement to comply with this subpart to each person with whom the participant enters into a covered transaction at the next lower tier.

      Disclosing Information—Primary Tier Participants

#### § § 1508.335

        Before you enter into a covered transaction at the primary tier, you as the participant must notify the ADF office that is entering into the transaction with you, if you know that you or any of the principals for that covered transaction:

        (a) Are presently excluded or disqualified;

        (b) Have been convicted within the preceding three years of any of the offenses listed in § 1508.800(a) or had a civil judgment rendered against you for one of those offenses within that time period;

        (c) Are presently indicted for or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity (Federal, State or local) with commission of any of the offenses listed in § 1508.800(a); or

        (d) Have had one or more public transactions (Federal, State, or local) terminated within the preceding three years for cause or default.

        § 1508.340   If I disclose unfavorable information required under § 1508.335, will I be prevented from participating in the transaction?

#### § § 1508.340

        As a primary tier participant, your disclosure of unfavorable information about yourself or a principal under § 1508.335 will not necessarily cause us to deny your participation in the covered transaction. We will consider the information when we determine whether to enter into the covered transaction. We also will consider any additional information or explanation that you elect to submit with the disclosed information.

        § 1508.345   What happens if I fail to disclose information required under § 1508.335?

#### § § 1508.345

        (a) Terminate the transaction for material failure to comply with the terms and conditions of the transaction; or

        (b) Pursue any other available remedies, including suspension and debarment.

        § 1508.350   What must I do if I learn of information required under § 1508.335 after entering into a covered transaction with the African Development Foundation?

#### § § 1508.350

        At any time after you enter into a covered transaction, you must give immediate written notice to the ADF office with which you entered into the transaction if you learn either that—

        (a) You failed to disclose information earlier, as required by § 1508.335; or

        (b) Due to changed circumstances, you or any of the principals for the transaction now meet any of the criteria in § 1508.335.

You should make a decision about whether to terminate and the type of termination action, if any, only after a thorough review to ensure that the action is proper.

      (b) You may not renew or extend covered transactions (other than no-cost time extensions) with any excluded person, or under which an excluded person is a principal, unless you obtain an exception under § 1508.120.

      § 1508.420   May I approve a transaction with an excluded or disqualified person at a lower tier?

#### § § 1508.420

      If a transaction at a lower tier is subject to your approval, you as an agency official may not approve—

      § 1508.435   What must I require of a primary tier participant?

#### § § 1508.435

      You as an agency official must require each participant in a primary tier covered transaction to—

      (b) Communicate the requirement to comply with Subpart C of this part to persons at the next lower tier with whom the primary tier participant enters into covered transactions.

      § 1508.440   What method do I use to communicate those requirements to participants?

#### § § 1508.440

    Subpart E—Excluded Parties List System

      § 1508.500   What is the purpose of the Excluded Parties List System (EPLS)?

#### § § 1508.500

      The  is a widely available source of the most current information about persons who are excluded or disqualified from covered transactions.

      § 1508.505   Who uses the EPLS?

    Subpart F—General Principles Relating to Suspension and Debarment Actions

      § 1508.600   How do suspension and debarment actions start?

#### § § 1508.600

      When we receive information from any source concerning a cause for suspension or debarment, we will promptly report and investigate it. We refer the question of whether to suspend or debar you to our suspending or debarring official for consideration, if appropriate.

      § 1508.605   How does suspension differ from debarment?

#### § § 1508.605

      § 1508.610   What procedures does the African Development Foundation use in suspension and debarment actions?

#### § § 1508.610

      In deciding whether to suspend or debar you, we handle the actions as informally as practicable, consistent with principles of fundamental fairness.

      (a) For suspension actions, we use the procedures in this subpart and subpart G of this part.

      (b) For debarment actions, we use the procedures in this subpart and subpart H of this part.

      (b) The notice is effective if sent to any of these persons.

      § 1508.620   Do Federal agencies coordinate suspension and debarment actions?

#### § § 1508.620

      Yes, when more than one Federal agency has an interest in a suspension or debarment, the agencies may consider designating one agency as the lead agency for making the decision. Agencies are encouraged to establish methods and procedures for coordinating their suspension and debarment actions.

      § 1508.625   What is the scope of a suspension or debarment?

#### § § 1508.625

      If you are suspended or debarred, the suspension or debarment is effective as follows:

      (a) Your suspension or debarment constitutes suspension or debarment of all of your divisions and other organizational elements from all covered transactions, unless the suspension or debarment decision is limited—

      (1) By its terms to one or more specifically identified individuals, divisions, or other organizational elements; or

      (2) To specific types of transactions.

      (b) Any affiliate of a participant may be included in a suspension or debarment action if the suspending or debarring official—

      (1) Officially names the affiliate in the notice; and

      (2) Gives the affiliate an opportunity to contest the action.

      § 1508.630   May the African Development Foundation impute conduct of one person to another?

#### § § 1508.630

      For purposes of actions taken under this rule, we may impute conduct as follows:

      (a)  We may impute the fraudulent, criminal, or other improper conduct of any officer, director, shareholder, partner, employee, or other individual associated with an organization, to that organization when the improper conduct occurred in connection with the individual's performance of duties for or on behalf of that organization, or with the organization's knowledge, approval or acquiescence. The organization's acceptance of the benefits derived from the conduct is evidence of knowledge, approval or acquiescence.

      (b)  We may impute the fraudulent, criminal, or other improper conduct of any organization to an individual, or from one individual to another individual, if the individual to whom the improper conduct is imputed either participated in, had knowledge of, or reason to know of the improper conduct.

      (c)  We may impute the fraudulent, criminal, or other improper conduct of one organization to another organization when the improper conduct occurred in connection with a partnership, joint venture, joint application, association or similar arrangement, or when the organization to whom the improper conduct is imputed has the power to direct, manage, control or influence the activities of the organization responsible for the improper conduct. Acceptance of the benefits derived from the conduct is evidence of knowledge, approval or acquiescence.

      § 1508.635   May the African Development Foundation settle a debarment or suspension action?

#### § § 1508.635

      Yes, we may settle a debarment or suspension action at any time if it is in the best interest of the Federal Government.

      § 1508.640   May a settlement include a voluntary exclusion?

#### § § 1508.640

      Yes, if we enter into a settlement with you in which you agree to be excluded, it is called a voluntary exclusion and has governmentwide effect.

    Subpart G—Suspension

      § 1508.700   When may the suspending official issue a suspension?

#### § § 1508.700

      Suspension is a serious action. Using the procedures of this subpart and subpart F of this part, the suspending official may impose suspension only when that official determines that—

      (a) There exists an indictment for, or other adequate evidence to suspect, an offense listed under § 1508.800(a), or

      (b) There exists adequate evidence to suspect any other cause for debarment listed under § 1508.800(b) through (d); and

      (c) Immediate action is necessary to protect the public interest.

      § 1508.705   What does the suspending official consider in issuing a suspension?

#### § § 1508.705

      (a) In determining the adequacy of the evidence to support the suspension, the suspending official considers how much information is available, how credible it is given the circumstances, whether or not important allegations are corroborated, and what inferences can reasonably be drawn as a result. During this assessment, the suspending official may examine the basic documents, including grants, cooperative agreements, loan authorizations, contracts, and other relevant documents.

      (b) An indictment, conviction, civil judgment, or other official findings by Federal, State, or local bodies that determine factual and/or legal matters, constitutes adequate evidence for purposes of suspension actions.

      (c) In deciding whether immediate action is needed to protect the public interest, the suspending official has wide discretion. For example, the suspending official may infer the necessity for immediate action to protect the public interest either from the nature of the circumstances giving rise to a cause for suspension or from potential business relationships or involvement with a program of the Federal Government.

      § 1508.710   When does a suspension take effect?

#### § § 1508.710

      A suspension is effective when the suspending official signs the decision to suspend.

      § 1508.715   What notice does the suspending official give me if I am suspended?

#### § § 1508.715

      After deciding to suspend you, the suspending official promptly sends you a Notice of Suspension advising you—

      (a) That you have been suspended;

      (b) That your suspension is based on—

      (1) An indictment;

      (2) A conviction;

      (3) Other adequate evidence that you have committed irregularities which seriously reflect on the propriety of further Federal Government dealings with you; or

      (4) Conduct of another person that has been imputed to you, or your affiliation with a suspended or debarred person;

      (c) Of any other irregularities in terms sufficient to put you on notice without disclosing the Federal Government's evidence;

      (d) Of the cause(s) upon which we relied under § 1508.700 for imposing suspension;

      (e) That your suspension is for a temporary period pending the completion of an investigation or resulting legal or debarment proceedings;

      (f) Of the applicable provisions of this subpart, Subpart F of this part, and any other ADF procedures governing suspension decision making; and

      (g) Of the governmentwide effect of your suspension from procurement and nonprocurement programs and activities.

      § 1508.720   How may I contest a suspension?

#### § § 1508.720

      If you as a respondent wish to contest a suspension, you or your representative must provide the suspending official with information in opposition to the suspension. You may do this orally or in writing, but any information provided orally that you consider important must also be submitted in writing for the official record.

      § 1508.725   How much time do I have to contest a suspension?

#### § § 1508.725

      (b) We consider the notice to be received by you—

      (1) When delivered, if we mail the notice to the last known street address, or five days after we send it if the letter is undeliverable;

      (2) When sent, if we send the notice by facsimile or five days after we send it if the facsimile is undeliverable; or

      (3) When delivered, if we send the notice by e-mail or five days after we send it if the e-mail is undeliverable.

      § 1508.730   What information must I provide to the suspending official if I contest a suspension?

#### § § 1508.730

      (a) In addition to any information and argument in opposition, as a respondent your submission to the suspending official must identify—

      (1) Specific facts that contradict the statements contained in the Notice of Suspension. A general denial is insufficient to raise a genuine dispute over facts material to the suspension;

      (2) All existing, proposed, or prior exclusions under regulations implementing E.O. 12549 and all similar actions taken by Federal, state, or local agencies, including administrative agreements that affect only those agencies;

      (3) All criminal and civil proceedings not included in the Notice of Suspension that grew out of facts relevant to the cause(s) stated in the notice; and

      (4) All of your affiliates.

      § 1508.735   Under what conditions do I get an additional opportunity to challenge the facts on which the suspension is based?

#### § § 1508.735

      (a) You as a respondent will not have an additional opportunity to challenge the facts if the suspending official determines that—

      (1) Your suspension is based upon an indictment, conviction, civil judgment, or other finding by a Federal, State, or local body for which an opportunity to contest the facts was provided;

      (2) Your presentation in opposition contains only general denials to information contained in the Notice of Suspension;

      (3) The issues raised in your presentation in opposition to the suspension are not factual in nature, or are not material to the suspending official's initial decision to suspend, or the official's decision whether to continue the suspension; or

      (4) On the basis of advice from the Department of Justice, an office of the United States Attorney, a State attorney general's office, or a State or local prosecutor's office, that substantial interests of the government in pending or contemplated legal proceedings based on the same facts as the suspension would be prejudiced by conducting fact-finding.

      (b) You will have an opportunity to challenge the facts if the suspending official determines that—

      (1) The conditions in paragraph (a) of this section do not exist; and

      (2) Your presentation in opposition raises a genuine dispute over facts material to the suspension.

      (c) If you have an opportunity to challenge disputed material facts under this section, the suspending official or designee must conduct additional proceedings to resolve those facts.

      § 1508.740   Are suspension proceedings formal?

#### § § 1508.740

      (a) Suspension proceedings are conducted in a fair and informal manner. The suspending official may use flexible procedures to allow you to present matters in opposition. In so doing, the suspending official is not required to follow formal rules of evidence or procedure in creating an official record upon which the official will base a final suspension decision.

      (b) You as a respondent or your representative must submit any documentary evidence you want the suspending official to consider.

      § 1508.745   How is fact-finding conducted?

      § 1508.750   What does the suspending official consider in deciding whether to continue or terminate my suspension?

#### § § 1508.750

      (a) The suspending official bases the decision on all information contained in the official record. The record includes—

      (1) All information in support of the suspending official's initial decision to suspend you;

      (2) Any further information and argument presented in support of, or opposition to, the suspension; and

      (3) Any transcribed record of fact-finding proceedings.

      (b) The suspending official may refer disputed material facts to another official for findings of fact. The suspending official may reject any resulting findings, in whole or in part, only after specifically determining them to be arbitrary, capricious, or clearly erroneous.

      § 1508.755   When will I know whether the suspension is continued or terminated?

#### § § 1508.755

      The suspending official must make a written decision whether to continue, modify, or terminate your suspension within 45 days of closing the official record. The official record closes upon the suspending official's receipt of final submissions, information and findings of fact, if any. The suspending official may extend that period for good cause.

      § 1508.760   How long may my suspension last?

#### § § 1508.760

      (a) If legal or debarment proceedings are initiated at the time of, or during your suspension, the suspension may continue until the conclusion of those proceedings. However, if proceedings are not initiated, a suspension may not exceed 12 months.

      (b) The suspending official may extend the 12 month limit under paragraph (a) of this section for an additional 6 months if an office of a U.S. Assistant Attorney General, U.S. Attorney, or other responsible prosecuting official requests an extension in writing. In no event may a suspension exceed 18 months without initiating proceedings under paragraph (a) of this section.

      (c) The suspending official must notify the appropriate officials under paragraph (b) of this section of an impending termination of a suspension at least 30 days before the 12 month period expires to allow the officials an opportunity to request an extension.

    Subpart H—Debarment

      § 1508.800   What are the causes for debarment?

      § 1508.860   What factors may influence the debarring official's decision?

#### § § 1508.860

      This section lists the mitigating and aggravating factors that the debarring official may consider in determining whether to debar you and the length of your debarment period. The debarring official may consider other factors if appropriate in light of the circumstances of a particular case. The existence or nonexistence of any factor, such as one of those set forth in this section, is not necessarily determinative of your present responsibility. In making a debarment decision, the debarring official may consider the following factors:

      (a) The actual or potential harm or impact that results or may result from the wrongdoing.

      (b) The frequency of incidents and/or duration of the wrongdoing.

      (c) Whether there is a pattern or prior history of wrongdoing. For example, if you have been found by another Federal agency or a State agency to have engaged in wrongdoing similar to that found in the debarment action, the existence of this fact may be used by the debarring official in determining that you have a pattern or prior history of wrongdoing.

      (d) Whether you are or have been excluded or disqualified by an agency of the Federal Government or have not been allowed to participate in State or local contracts or assistance agreements on a basis of conduct similar to one or more of the causes for debarment specified in this part.

      (f) Whether and to what extent you planned, initiated, or carried out the wrongdoing.

      (g) Whether you have accepted responsibility for the wrongdoing and recognize the seriousness of the misconduct that led to the cause for debarment.

      (h) Whether you have paid or agreed to pay all criminal, civil and administrative liabilities for the improper activity, including any investigative or administrative costs incurred by the government, and have made or agreed to make full restitution.

      (i) Whether you have cooperated fully with the government agencies during the investigation and any court or administrative action. In determining the extent of cooperation, the debarring official may consider when the cooperation began and whether you disclosed all pertinent information known to you.

      (j) Whether the wrongdoing was pervasive within your organization.

      (k) The kind of positions held by the individuals involved in the wrongdoing.

      (l) Whether your organization took appropriate corrective action or remedial measures, such as establishing ethics training and implementing programs to prevent recurrence.

      (q) Whether you have taken appropriate disciplinary action against the individuals responsible for the activity which constitutes the cause for debarment.

      § 1508.865   How long may my debarment last?

#### § § 1508.865

      (a) If the debarring official decides to debar you, your period of debarment will be based on the seriousness of the cause(s) upon which your debarment is based. Generally, debarment should not exceed three years. However, if circumstances warrant, the debarring official may impose a longer period of debarment.

      (b) In determining the period of debarment, the debarring official may consider the factors in § 1508.860. If a suspension has preceded your debarment, the debarring official must consider the time you were suspended.

      (c) If the debarment is for a violation of the provisions of the Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988, your period of debarment may not exceed five years.

      § 1508.870   When do I know if the debarring official debars me?

#### § § 1508.870

      (a) The debarring official must make a written decision whether to debar within 45 days of closing the official record. The official record closes upon the debarring official's receipt of final submissions, information and findings of fact, if any. The debarring official may extend that period for good cause.

      (b) The debarring official sends you written notice, pursuant to § 1508.615 that the official decided, either—

      (1) Not to debar you; or

      (2) To debar you. In this event, the notice:

      (i) Refers to the Notice of Proposed Debarment;

      (ii) Specifies the reasons for your debarment;

      (iii) States the period of your debarment, including the effective dates; and

      (iv) Advises you that your debarment is effective for covered transactions and contracts that are subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (48 CFR chapter 1), throughout the executive branch of the Federal Government unless an agency head or an authorized designee grants an exception.

      § 1508.875   May I ask the debarring official to reconsider a decision to debar me?

#### § § 1508.875

      Yes, as a debarred person you may ask the debarring official to reconsider the debarment decision or to reduce the time period or scope of the debarment. However, you must put your request in writing and support it with documentation.

      § 1508.880   What factors may influence the debarring official during reconsideration?

#### § § 1508.880

      The debarring official may reduce or terminate your debarment based on—

      (a) Newly discovered material evidence;

      (b) A reversal of the conviction or civil judgment upon which your debarment was based;

      (c) A bona fide change in ownership or management;

      (d) Elimination of other causes for which the debarment was imposed; or

      (e) Other reasons the debarring official finds appropriate.

      § 1508.885   May the debarring official extend a debarment?

#### § § 1508.885

      (a) Yes, the debarring official may extend a debarment for an additional period, if that official determines that an extension is necessary to protect the public interest.

      (b) However, the debarring official may not extend a debarment solely on the basis of the facts and circumstances upon which the initial debarment action was based.

      (c) If the debarring official decides that a debarment for an additional period is necessary, the debarring official must follow the applicable procedures in this subpart, and subpart F of this part, to extend the debarment.

  PART 1509—GOVERNMENTWIDE REQUIREMENTS FOR DRUG-FREE WORKPLACE (FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE)

### Part 1509

**Authority:** Authority: 41 U.S.C. 701

**Source:** Source: 68 FR 66592, Nov. 26, 2003, unless otherwise noted.

    Subpart A—Purpose and Coverage

      § 1509.100   What does this part do?

#### § § 1509.100

      This part carries out the portion of the Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988 (41 U.S.C. 701  as amended) that applies to grants. It also applies the provisions of the Act to cooperative agreements and other financial assistance awards, as a matter of Federal Government policy.

      § 1509.105   Does this part apply to me?

#### § § 1509.105

      (a) Portions of this part apply to you if you are either—

      (1) A recipient of an assistance award from the African Development Foundation; or

      (2) A(n) ADF awarding official. (See definitions of award and recipient in §§ 1509.605 and 1509.660, respectively.)

      (b) The following table shows the subparts that apply to you:

      § 1509.110   Are any of my Federal assistance awards exempt from this part?

#### § § 1509.110

      This part does not apply to any award that the ADF President determines that the application of this part would be inconsistent with the international obligations of the United States or the laws or regulations of a foreign government.

      § 1509.115   Does this part affect the Federal contracts that I receive?

#### § § 1509.115

      It will affect future contract awards indirectly if you are debarred or suspended for a violation of the requirements of this part, as described in § 1509.510(c). However, this part does not apply directly to procurement contracts. The portion of the Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988 that applies to Federal procurement contracts is carried out through the Federal Acquisition Regulation in chapter 1 of Title 48 of the Code of Federal Regulations (the drug-free workplace coverage currently is in 48 CFR part 23, subpart 23.5).

    Subpart B—Requirements for Recipients Other Than Individuals

      § 1509.200   What must I do to comply with this part?

#### § § 1509.200

      There are two general requirements if you are a recipient other than an individual.

      (a) First, you must make a good faith effort, on a continuing basis, to maintain a drug-free workplace. You must agree to do so as a condition for receiving any award covered by this part. The specific measures that you must take in this regard are described in more detail in subsequent sections of this subpart. Briefly, those measures are to—

      (1) Publish a drug-free workplace statement and establish a drug-free awareness program for your employees (see §§ 1509.205 through 1509.220); and

      (2) Take actions concerning employees who are convicted of violating drug statutes in the workplace (see § 1509.225).

      (b) Second, you must identify all known workplaces under your Federal awards (see § 1509.230).

      § 1509.205   What must I include in my drug-free workplace statement?

#### § § 1509.205

      You must publish a statement that—

      (a) Tells your employees that the unlawful manufacture, distribution, dispensing, possession, or use of a controlled substance is prohibited in your workplace;

      (b) Specifies the actions that you will take against employees for violating that prohibition; and

      (c) Lets each employee know that, as a condition of employment under any award, he or she:

      (1) Will abide by the terms of the statement; and

      (2) Must notify you in writing if he or she is convicted for a violation of a criminal drug statute occurring in the workplace and must do so no more than five calendar days after the conviction.

      § 1509.210   To whom must I distribute my drug-free workplace statement?

#### § § 1509.210

      You must require that a copy of the statement described in § 1509.205 be given to each employee who will be engaged in the performance of any Federal award.

      § 1509.215   What must I include in my drug-free awareness program?

      You must establish an ongoing drug-free awareness program to inform employees about—

      (a) The dangers of drug abuse in the workplace;

      (b) Your policy of maintaining a drug-free workplace;

      (c) Any available drug counseling, rehabilitation, and employee assistance programs; and

      (d) The penalties that you may impose upon them for drug abuse violations occurring in the workplace.

      § 1509.220   By when must I publish my drug-free workplace statement and establish my drug-free awareness program?

#### § § 1509.220

      If you are a new recipient that does not already have a policy statement as described in § 1509.205 and an ongoing awareness program as described in § 1509.215, you must publish the statement and establish the program by the time given in the following table:

      § 1509.225   What actions must I take concerning employees who are convicted of drug violations in the workplace?

#### § § 1509.225

      There are two actions you must take if an employee is convicted of a drug violation in the workplace:

      (a) First, you must notify Federal agencies if an employee who is engaged in the performance of an award informs you about a conviction, as required by § 1509.205(c)(2), or you otherwise learn of the conviction. Your notification to the Federal agencies must—

      (1) Be in writing;

      (2) Include the employee's position title;

      (3) Include the identification number(s) of each affected award;

      (4) Be sent within ten calendar days after you learn of the conviction; and

      (2) Require the employee to participate satisfactorily in a drug abuse assistance or rehabilitation program approved for these purposes by a Federal, State or local health, law enforcement, or other appropriate agency.

      § 1509.230   How and when must I identify workplaces?

#### § § 1509.230

      (a) You must identify all known workplaces under each ADF award. A failure to do so is a violation of your drug-free workplace requirements. You may identify the workplaces—

      (1) To the ADF official that is making the award, either at the time of application or upon award; or

      (2) In documents that you keep on file in your offices during the performance of the award, in which case you must make the information available for inspection upon request by ADF officials or their designated representatives.

      (b) Your workplace identification for an award must include the actual address of buildings (or parts of buildings) or other sites where work under the award takes place. Categorical descriptions may be used (, all vehicles of a mass transit authority or State highway department while in operation, State employees in each local unemployment office, performers in concert halls or radio studios).

      (c) If you identified workplaces to the ADF awarding official at the time of application or award, as described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, and any workplace that you identified changes during the performance of the award, you must inform the ADF awarding official.

      (1) In writing.

      (2) Within 10 calendar days of the conviction.

      (3) To the ADF awarding official or other designee for each award that you currently have, unless § 1509.301 or the award document designates a central point for the receipt of the notices. When notice is made to a central point, it must include the identification number(s) of each affected award.

      (a) The recipient has violated the requirements of subpart B of this part; or

      (b) The number of convictions of the recipient's employees for violating criminal drug statutes in the workplace is large enough to indicate that the recipient has failed to make a good faith effort to provide a drug-free workplace.

#### § § 1510.140

    No qualified individual with handicaps shall, on the basis of handicap, be subject to discrimination in employment under any program or activity conducted by the agency.

#### § §§ 1510.141-1510.148

    § 1510.149   Program accessibility: Discrimination prohibited.

#### § § 1510.149

    Except as otherwise provided in § 1510.150, no qualified individual with handicaps shall, because the agency's facilities are inaccessible to or unusable by individuals with handicaps, be denied the benefits of, be excluded from participation in, or otherwise be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity conducted by the agency.

    § 1510.150   Program accessibility: Existing facilities.

#### § § 1510.150

    (a)  The agency shall operate each program or activity so that the program or activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps. This paragraph does not—

    (1) Necessarily require the agency to make each of its existing facilities accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps;

    (2) In the case of historic preservation programs, require the agency to take any action that would result in a substantial impairment of significant historic features of an historic property; or

    (3) Require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with § 1510.150(a) would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that individuals with handicaps receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.

    (b) —(1)  The agency may comply with the requirements of this section through such means as redesign of equipment, reassignment of services to accessible buildings, assignment of aides to beneficiaries, home visits, delivery of services at alternate accessible sites, alteration of existing facilities and construction of new facilities, use of accessible rolling stock, or any other methods that result in making its programs or activities readily accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps. The agency is not required to make structural changes in existing facilities where other methods are effective in achieving compliance with this section. The agency, in making alterations to existing buildings, shall meet accessibility requirements to the extent compelled by the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), and any regulations implementing it. In choosing among available methods for meeting the requirements of this section, the agency shall give priority to those methods that offer programs and activities to qualified individuals with handicaps in the most integrated setting appropriate.

    (2)  In meeting the requirements of § 1510.150(a) in historic preservation programs, the agency shall give priority to methods that provide physical access to individuals with handicaps. In cases where a physical alteration to an historic property is not required because of § 1510.150(a) (2) or (3), alternative methods of achieving program accessibility include—

    (i) Using audio-visual materials and devices to depict those portions of an historic property that cannot otherwise be made accessible;

    (ii) Assigning persons to guide individuals with handicaps into or through portions of historic properties that cannot otherwise be made accessible; or

    (iii) Adopting other innovative methods.

    (c)  The agency shall comply with the obligations established under this section by November 7, 1988, except that where structural changes in facilities are undertaken, such changes shall be made by September 6, 1991, but in any event as expeditiously as possible.

    (d)  In the event that structural changes to facilities will be undertaken to achieve program accessibility, the agency shall develop, by March 6, 1989, a transition plan setting forth the steps necessary to complete such changes. The agency shall provide an opportunity to interested persons, including individuals with handicaps or organizations representing individuals with handicaps, to participate in the development of the transition plan by submitting comments (both oral and written). A copy of the transition plan shall be made available for public inspection. The plan shall, at a minimum—

    (1) Identify physical obstacles in the agency's facilities that limit the accessibility of its programs or activities to individuals with handicaps;

    (2) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the facilities accessible;

    (3) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve compliance with this section and, if the time period of the transition plan is longer than one year, identify steps that will be taken during each year of the transition period; and

    (4) Indicate the official responsible for implementation of the plan.

    § 1510.151   Program accessibility: New construction and alterations.

#### § § 1510.151

    Each building or part of a building that is constructed or altered by, on behalf of, or for the use of the agency shall be designed, constructed, or altered so as to be readily accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps. The definitions, requirements, and standards of the Architectural Barriers Act (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), as established in 41 CFR 101-19.600 to 101-19.607, apply to buildings covered by this section.

    (a) The agency shall take appropriate steps to ensure effective communication with applicants, participants, personnel of other Federal entities, and members of the public.

    (1) The agency shall furnish appropriate auxiliary aids where necessary to afford an individual with handicaps an equal opportunity to participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, a program or activity conducted by the agency.

    (i) In determining what type of auxiliary aid is necessary, the agency shall give primary consideration to the requests of the individual with handicaps.

    (ii) The agency need not provide individually prescribed devices, readers for personal use or study, or other devices of a personal nature.

    (2) Where the agency communicates with applicants and beneficiaries by telephone, telecommunication devices for deaf persons (TDD's) or equally effective telecommunication systems shall be used to communicate with persons with impaired hearing.

    (b) The agency shall ensure that interested persons, including persons with impaired vision or hearing, can obtain information as to the existence and location of accessible services, activities, and facilities.

    (c) The agency shall provide signage at a primary entrance to each of its inaccessible facilities, directing users to a location at which they can obtain information about accessible facilities. The international symbol for accessibility shall be used at each primary entrance of an accessible facility.

    (d) This section does not require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with § 1510.160 would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action required to comply with this section would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that, to the maximum extent possible, individuals with handicaps receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.
