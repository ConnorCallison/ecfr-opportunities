      Subpart A—General

        § 701.1   Administration.

#### § § 701.1

        (a) Subject to the availability of funds, this part provides the terms, conditions and requirements of the Emergency Conservation Program (ECP) and the Emergency Forest Restoration Program (EFRP) administered by the Farm Service Agency (FSA). Neither program is an entitlement program and payments will only be made to the extent that the Deputy Administrator announces the eligibility of benefits for certain natural disasters, the areas in which such benefits will be available, the time period in which the disaster and the rehabilitation must occur, and only so long as all the conditions for eligibility specified in this part and elsewhere in law are met. However, the Deputy Administrator will not apply any non-statutory limitation on payments provided for in this part in such a way that it would necessarily result in the non-expenditure of program funds required to otherwise be made by law.

        (b) ECP and EFRP are administered by the Administrator, FSA through the Deputy Administrator, FSA, and shall be carried out in the field by State and county FSA committees (State and county committees), subject to the availability of funds. Except as otherwise provided in this rule, discretionary determinations to be made under this rule will be made by the Deputy Administrator. Matters committed to the discretion of the Deputy Administrator shall be considered in all cases to be permissive powers and no person or legal entity shall, under any circumstances, be considered to be entitled to an exercise of such power in their favor.

        (c) State and county committees, and representatives and employees, do not have authority to modify or waive any regulations in this part.

        (d) The State committee may take any action authorized or required of the county committee by this part, but which the county committee has not taken, such as:

        (1) Correct or require a county committee to correct any action taken by such county committee that is not in accordance with this part; or

        (2) Require a county committee to withhold taking any action that is not in accordance with this part.

        (e) No provision or delegation herein to a State or county committee shall preclude the Administrator, FSA, or a designee, from determining any question arising under the program or from reversing or modifying any determination made by a State or county committee.

        (f) The Deputy Administrator may authorize State and county committees to waive or modify deadlines and other requirements in cases where lateness or failure to meet such other requirements does not adversely affect the operation of the program.

        (g) The Deputy Administrator may limit the authority of state and county committees to approve cost share in excess of specified amounts.

        (h) Data furnished by the applicants will be used to determine eligibility for program benefits. Furnishing the data is voluntary; however, the failure to provide data could result in program benefits being withheld or denied.

        (i) FSA may consult with any other Federal agency, State agency, or other provider of technical assistance for such assistance as is determined by FSA to be necessary to implement ECP or EFRP. FSA is responsible for the technical aspects of ECP and EFRP but may enter into a Memorandum of Agreement with another party to provide technical assistance. If the requirement for technical assistance results in undue delay or significant hardship to producers in a county, the State committee may request in writing that FSA waive this requirement for that county. However, nothing in this paragraph or in this part creates a right of appeal or action for an applicant with respect to provisions relating to internal procedures of FSA.

        (j) The provisions in this part shall not create an entitlement in any person or legal entity to any ECP or EFRP cost share or claim or any particular notice or form or procedure.

        (k) Additional terms and conditions may be set forth in the application or the forms participants will be required to sign for participation in the ECP or EFRP.

        (b) If more than one participant contributed to the performance of the practice, the cost-share assistance for the practice shall be divided among those eligible participants in the proportion they contributed to the performance of the practice. FSA may determine what proportion was contributed by each participant by considering the value of the labor, equipment, or material contributed by each participant and any other factors deemed relevant toward performance.

        (c) Allowance by a participant of a credit to another participant through adjustment in rent, cash or other consideration, may be considered as a cost of a practice to the paying party only if FSA determines that such credit is directly related to the practice. An applicant who was fully reimbursed shall be considered as not having contributed to the practice performance.

        § 701.25   Practices carried out with aid from ineligible persons or ineligible legal entities.

#### § § 701.25

        Any assistance provided by someone other than the eligible participant, including assistance from a State or Federal agency, shall be deducted from the participant's total costs incurred for the practice for the purpose of computing ECP or EFRP cost shares. If unusual conditions exist, the Deputy Administrator may waive deduction of such contributions upon a request from the State committee and demonstration of the need for such a waiver.

        (a) Each participant receiving cost-share assistance is responsible for the required maintenance and proper use of the practice. Some practices have an established life span or minimum period of time during which they are expected to function as a conservation practice with proper maintenance. Cost-share assistance shall not be authorized for normal upkeep or maintenance of any practice.

        (b) If a practice is not properly maintained for the established life span, the participant may be required to refund all or part of cost-share assistance received. The Deputy Administrator will determine what constitutes failure to maintain a practice and the amount that must be refunded.

        § 701.32   Failure to comply with program provisions.

#### § § 701.32

#### § § 701.36

        (a) If FSA determines that a participant has taken any action designed to defeat, or has the effect of defeating, the purposes of this program, the participant shall be required to refund all or part of any of the program payments otherwise due or paid that participant or related person or legal entity for that particular disaster. These actions include, but are not limited to, failure to properly maintain or deliberately destroying a practice and providing false or misleading information related to practices, costs, or arrangements between entities or individuals that would have an effect on any eligibility determination, including, but not limited to, a payment limit eligibility.

        (b) All or any part of cost-share assistance that otherwise would be due any participant may be withheld, or required to be refunded, if the participant has adopted, or participated in, any scheme or device designed to evade the maximum cost-share limitation that applies to the program or to evade any other requirement or provision of the program or this part.

        (c) If FSA determines that a participant has employed any scheme or device to deprive any other person or legal entity of cost-share assistance, or engaged in any actions to receive payments under this part that also were designed to avoid claims of the United States or its instrumentalities or agents against that party, related parties, or third parties, the participant shall refund all or part of any of those program payments paid to that participant for the project.

        (d) For purposes of this section, a scheme or device can include, but is not limited to, instances of coercion, fraud, or misrepresentation regarding the claim for ECP or EFRP assistance and the facts and circumstances surrounding such claim.

        (e) A participant who has knowingly supplied false information or filed a false claim shall be ineligible for cost-share assistance related to the disaster for which the false information was filed, or for any period of time FSA deems appropriate. False information or a false claim includes, but is not limited to, a request for payment for a practice not carried out, a false billing, or a billing for practices that do not meet required specifications.

#### § § 701.37

        In the event of voluntary or involuntary loss of control of the land by the ECP or EFRP cost-share recipient during the practice life-span, if the person or legal entity acquiring control elects not to become a successor to the ECP or EFRP agreement and the practice is not maintained, each participant who received cost-share assistance for the practice may be jointly and severally liable for refunding any ECP or EFRP cost-share assistance related to that practice. The practice life span, for purposes of this section, includes any maintenance period that is essential to its success.

        (i) Impair or endanger the land;

        (ii) Materially affect the productive capacity of the land;

        (iii) Represent unusual damage that, except for wind erosion, is not of the type likely to recur frequently in the same area; and

        (iv) Be so costly to repair that Federal assistance is or will be required to return the land to productive agricultural use. Conservation problems existing prior to the disaster are not eligible for cost-share assistance.

        (2) Be physically located in a county in which the ECP has been implemented; and

        (3) Be one of the following:

        (i) Land expected to have annual agricultural production,

        (ii) A field windbreak or a farmstead shelterbelt on which the ECP practice to be implemented involves removing debris that interferes with normal farming operations on the farm and correcting damage caused by the disaster; or

        (iii) A farm access road on which debris interfering with the normal farming operation needs to be removed.

        (b) Land is ineligible for cost share if the Deputy Administrator determines that it is, as applicable:

        (1) Protected by a levee or dike that was not effectively and properly functioning prior to the disaster, or is protected, or intended to be protected, by a levee or dike not built to U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, NRCS, or comparable standards;

        (2) Adjacent to water impoundment reservoirs that are subject to inundation when the reservoir is filled to capacity;

        (3) Land on which levees or dikes are located;

        (4) Subject to frequent damage or susceptible to severe damage according to paragraph (c) of this section;

        (5) Subject to flowage or flood easements and inundation when water is released in normal operations;

        (6) Between any levee or dike and a stream, river, or body of water, including land between two or more levees or dikes;

        (7) Located in an old or new channel of a stream, creek, river or other similar body of water, except that land located within or on the banks of an irrigation canal may be eligible if the Deputy Administrator determines that the canal is not a channel subject to flooding;

        (8) In greenhouses or other confined areas, including but not limited to, land in corrals, milking parlors, barn lots, or feeding areas;

        (9) Land on which poor farming practices, such as failure to farm on the contour, have materially contributed to damaging the land;

        (10) Unless otherwise provided for, not considered to be in annual agricultural production, such as land devoted to stream banks, channels, levees, dikes, native woodland areas, roads, and recreational uses; or

        (11) Devoted to trees including, but not limited to, timber production.

        (c) To determine the likely frequency of damage and of the susceptibility of the land to severe damage under paragraph (b)(6) of this section, FSA will consider all relevant factors, including, but not limited to, the location of the land, the history of damage to the land, and whether the land was or could have been protected by a functioning levee or dike built to U. S. Army Corps of Engineers, NRCS, or comparable standards. Further, in making such determinations, information may be obtained and used from the Federal Emergency Management Agency or any other Federal, State (including State agencies or political subdivisions), or other entity or individual providing information regarding, for example, flood susceptibility for the land, soil surveys, aerial photographs, or flood plain data or other relevant information.

#### § § 707.3

      (a) Where any person who would otherwise be eligible to receive a payment dies before the payment is received, payment may be released in accordance with this section so long as, and only if, a timely program application has been filed by the deceased before the death or filed in a timely way before or after the death by a person legally authorized to act for the deceased. Timeliness will be determined under the relevant program regulations. All program conditions for payment under the relevant program regulations must have been met for the deceased to be considered otherwise eligible for the payment.

If these conditions are met, payment may be released without regard to the claims of creditors other than the United States, in accordance with the following order of precedence:

      (1) To the administrator or executor of the deceased person's estate.

      (3) If there is no surviving spouse, to the sons and daughters in equal shares. Children of a deceased son or daughter of a deceased person shall be entitled to their parent's share of the payment, share and share alike.

      (4) If there is no surviving spouse and no direct descendant, payment shall be made to the father and mother of the deceased person in equal shares, or the whole thereof to the surviving father or mother.

      (5) If there is no surviving spouse, no direct descendant, and no surviving parent, payment shall be made to the brothers and sisters of the deceased person in equal shares. Children of a deceased brother or sister shall be entitled to their parent's share of the payment, share and share alike. If there are no surviving direct descendants of the deceased brother or sister of such deceased person, the share of the payment which otherwise would have been made to such brother or sister shall be divided equally among the surviving brothers and sisters of such deceased person and the estates of any deceased brothers or sisters where there are surviving direct descendants.

      (6) If there is no surviving spouse, direct descendant, parent, or brothers or sisters or their descendants, the payment shall be made to the heirs-at-law in accordance with the law of the State of domicile of the deceased person.

      (b) If any person who is entitled to payment under the above order of precedence is a minor, payment of his share shall be made to his legal guardian, but if no legal guardian has been appointed payment shall be made to his natural guardian or custodian for his benefit, unless the minor's share of the payment exceeds $1,000, in which event payment shall be made only to his legal guardian.

      (c) Any payment which the deceased person could have received may be made jointly to the persons found to be entitled to such payment or shares thereof under this section or, pursuant to instructions issued by the Farm Service Agency, a separate payment may be issued to each person entitled to share in such payment.

Timeliness will be determined under the relevant program regulations. All program conditions for payment under the relevant program regulations must have been met for the person involved to be considered otherwise eligible for the payment. However, the payment will not be made unless, in addition, a separate release application is filed in accordance with § 707.7.

#### § § 707.5

      (a) Where any person who would otherwise be eligible to receive a payment is adjudged incompetent by a court of competent jurisdiction before the payment is received, payment may be released in accordance with this section so long as, and only if, a timely and binding program application has been filed by the person involved while capable or by someone legally authorized to file an application for the person involved. Timeliness is determined under the relevant program regulations. In all cases, the payment application must have been timely under the relevant program regulations and all program conditions for payment must have been met by or on behalf of the person involved. However, the payment will not be made unless, in addition, a separate release application is filed in accordance with § 707.7. If these conditions are met, payment may be released without regard to the claims of creditors other than the United States, to the guardian or committee legally appointed for the person involved. In case no guardian or committee had been appointed, payment, if for not more than $1,000, may be released without regard to claims of creditors other than the United States, to one of the following in the following order for the benefit of the person who was the subject of the adjudication:

      (1) The spouse.

      (b) In case payment is more than $1,000, payment may be released only to such person as may be authorized under State law to receive payment for the incompetent, so long as all conditions for other payments specified in paragraph (a) of this section and elsewhere in the applicable regulations have been met. Those requirements include the filing of a proper and timely and legally authorized program application by or for the person adjudged incompetent. The release of funds under this paragraph will be made without regard to claims of creditors other than the United States unless the agency determines otherwise.

      § 707.7   Release application.

#### § § 707.7

      No payment may be made under this part unless a proper program application was filed in accordance with the rules for the program that generated the payment. That application must have been timely and filed by someone legally authorized to act for the deceased, disappeared, or declared-incompetent person. The filer can be the party that earned the payment themselves—such as the case of a person who filed a program application before they died—or someone legally authorized to act for the party that earned the payment. All program conditions for payment must have been met before the death, disappearance, or incompetency except for the timely filing of the application for payment by the person legally authorized to act for the party earning the payment. But, further, for the payment to be released under the rules of this part, a second application must be filed. That second application is a release application filed under this section. In particular, as to the latter, where all other conditions have been met, persons desiring to claim payment for themselves or an estate in accordance with this part 707 must do so by filing a release application on Form FSA-325, “Application for Payment of Amounts Due Persons Who Have Died, Disappeared or Have Been Declared Incompetent.If the person who died, disappeared, or was declared incompetent did not apply for payment by filing the applicable program application for payment form, such program application for payment must also be filed in accordance with applicable regulations. If the payment is made under the Naval Stores Conservation Program, Part II of the Form FSA-325 shall be executed by the local District Supervisor of the U.S. Forest Service.

        § 718.8   Administrative county and servicing FSA county office.

#### § § 718.8

        (a) FSA farm records are maintained in an administrative county determined by FSA. Generally, a farm's administrative county is based on the physical location county of the farm. If all land on the farm is physically located in one physical location county, the farm's records will be administratively located in that physical location county.

        (b) In cases where there is no FSA office in the county in which the farm is physically located or where a servicing FSA county office is responsible for more than one administrative county, the farm records will be administratively located as specified in paragraph (a) of this section and with a servicing FSA county office that FSA as designated as responsible for that administrative county.

        (c) Farm operators and owners can conduct their farm's business in any FSA county office. FSA's designation of a farm's administrative county is based on where land of the farm is located as specified in paragraph (a) of this section or as might be required under paragraph (b) of this section.

        (d) Farm operators and owners can request a change to their servicing FSA county office and that request may necessitate a change to the farm's administrative county as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this section. If the requested servicing FSA county office is not responsible for and does not have an administrative county for the physical location of the farm according to paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section and FSA approves the request for change of servicing FSA county office, FSA will designate the administrative county for the farm from those available in the requested servicing FSA county office.

        (e) If a county contiguous to the county in which the farm is physically located in the same State does not have a servicing FSA county office, the farm will be administratively located by FSA in a contiguous county in another contiguous State that is convenient to the farm operator and owner. Requests for changes to a farm's servicing FSA county office, which may or may not result in a change to a farm's administrative county under this section, must be submitted to FSA by August 1 of each year for the change to take effect that calendar year.

        (f) When land on the farm is physically located in more than one county, the farm will be administered by a servicing FSA county office determined by FSA to be the administrative county responsibility for administration of programs for one or more of the physical counties involved in the farm's constitution. Paragraph (b), (c), or (d) of this section applies if changes occur to the servicing FSA county office and administrative county.

        (g) Farm operators and owners cannot request a change to a farm's administrative county. The operator and owner of a farm serviced by an FSA county office responsible for a farm's administrative county can request a change of servicing FSA county office to another FSA servicing county office in the same State by August 1 for the change to take effect that calendar year. Review and approval of any change to the servicing FSA county office is solely at the discretion of FSA. Requests for change in servicing FSA county office, which may or may not result in a change to a farm's administrative county, will be reviewed and approved by county committee if all the following can be determined to apply:

        (1) The requested change does not impact the constitution of a farm;

        (2) The requested change will not result in increased program eligibility or additional benefits for the farm's producers that would not be earned absent the change in servicing FSA county office and, if applicable, administrative county being made; and

        (3) The change is not to circumvent any of the provisions of other program regulations to which this part applies.

        (h) The State committee will submit all requests for exceptions from regulations specified in this section to the Deputy Administrator.

        § 718.9   Signature requirements.

#### § § 718.9

        (a) When a program authorized by this chapter or chapter XIV of this title requires the signature of a producer, landowner, landlord, or tenant, then a spouse may sign all such FSA or CCC documents on behalf of the other spouse, except as otherwise specified in this section, unless such other spouse has provided written notification to FSA and CCC that such action is not authorized. The notification must be provided to FSA for each farm.

        (b) A spouse may not sign a document on behalf of the other spouse with respect to:

        (1) Program document required to be executed in accordance with part 3 of this title;

        (2) Easements entered into under part 1410 of this title;

        (3) Power of attorney;

        (4) Such other program documents as determined by FSA or CCC.

        (c) An individual; duly authorized officer of a corporation; duly authorized partner of a partnership; executor or administrator of an estate; trustee of a trust; guardian; or conservator may delegate to another the authority to act on their behalf with respect to FSA and CCC programs administered by USDA service center agencies by execution of a Power of Attorney, or such other form as approved by the Deputy Administrator. FSA and CCC may, at their discretion, allow the delegations of authority by other individuals through use of the Power of Attorney or such other form as approved by the Deputy Administrator.

        (d) Notwithstanding another provision of this regulation or any other FSA or CCC regulation in this title, a parent may execute documents on behalf of a minor child unless prohibited by a statute or court order.

        (e) Notwithstanding any other provision in this title, an authorized agent of the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) of the United States Department of Interior may sign as agent for landowners with properties affiliated with or under the management or trust of the BIA. For collection purposes, such payments will be considered as being made to the persons who are the beneficiaries of the payment or may, alternatively, be considered as an obligation of all persons on the farm in general. In the event of a need for a refund or other claim may be collected, among other means, by other monies due such persons or the farm.

        (f) Documents that were previously acted on and approved by the FSA county office or county committee will not subsequently be determined inadequate or invalid because of the lack of signature authority of any person signing the document on behalf of the applicant or any other individual, entity, general partnership, or joint venture, unless the person signing the program document knowingly and willfully falsified the evidence of signature authority or a signature. However, FSA may require affirmation of the document by those parties deemed appropriate for an affirmation, as determined by the Deputy Administrator. Nothing in this paragraph relieves participants of any other program requirements.

Where the action required to be taken is with a prescribed number of days after the mailing of notice, the day of mailing shall be excluded in computing such period of time.

        § 718.11   Disqualification due to Federal crop insurance violation.

#### § § 718.11

        (a) Section 515(h) of the Federal Crop Insurance Act (FCIA) provides that a person who willfully and intentionally provides false or inaccurate information to the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC) or to an approved insurance provider with respect to a policy or plan of FCIC insurance, after notice and an opportunity for a hearing on the record, will be subject to one or more of the sanctions described in section 515(h)(3). In section 515(h)(3), the FCIA specifies that in the case of a violation committed by a producer, the producer may be disqualified for a period of up to 5 years from receiving any monetary or non-monetary benefit under a number of programs. The list includes, but is not limited to, benefits under:

        (1) The FCIA.

        (2) The Agricultural Market Transition Act (7 U.S.C. 7201 ), including the Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance Program under section 196 of that Act (7 U.S.C. 7333).

        (3) The Agricultural Act of 1949 (7 U.S.C. 1421 ).

        (8) Any law that provides assistance to a producer of an agricultural commodity affected by a crop loss or a decline in prices of agricultural commodities.

        (b) Violation determinations are made by FCIC. However, upon notice from FCIC to FSA that a producer has been found to have committed a violation to which paragraph (a) of this section applies, that person will be ineligible for payments under the programs specified in paragraph (a) of this section that are funded by FSA for the same period of time for which, as determined by FCIC, the producer will be ineligible for crop insurance benefits of the kind referred to in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. Appeals of the determination of ineligibility will be administered under the rules set by FCIC.

        (c) Other sanctions may also apply.

#### § § 718.101

        (a) Measurement services include, but are not limited to, measuring land and crop areas, measuring quantities of farm-stored commodities, and appraising the yields of crops in the field when required for program administration purposes. The county committee will provide measurement service if the producer requests such service and pays the cost, except that measurement service is not available and will not be provided to determine total acreage or production of a crop when the request is made:

        (1) For acreage, after the established final reporting date for the applicable crop, unless a late filed report is accepted as provided in § 718.104; or

        (2) After the farm operator has furnished production evidence when required for program administration purposes except as provided in this subpart.

        (b) Except for measurements and determinations performed by FSA in accordance with late-filed acreage reports filed in accordance with § 718.104, when a producer requests, pays for, and receives written notice that measurement services have been furnished, the measured acreage is guaranteed to be correct and used for all program purposes for the current year even though an error is later discovered in the measurement.

        § 718.103   Prevented planted and failed acreage.

#### § § 718.103

        (a) Prevented planting is the inability to plant an eligible crop with proper equipment during the planting period as a result of an eligible cause of loss, as determined by CCC. The eligible cause of loss that prevented the planting must have:

        (1) Occurred after a previous planting period for the crop;

        (2) Occurred before the final planting date for the crop in the applicable crop year or, in the case of multiple plantings, the harvest date of the first planting in the applicable planting period, and

        (3) Similarly affected other producers in the area, as determined by CCC.

        (b) FSA may approve acreage as “prevented planted acreage” if all other conditions for such approval are met and provided the conditions in paragraphs (b)(1) through (6) of this section are met.

        (1) Except as specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, producers must report the acreage, on forms specified by FSA, within 15 calendar days after the final planting date determined for the crop by FSA.

        (2) If the acreage is reported after the period identified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the application must be filed in time to permit:

        (i) The county committee or its authorized representative to make a farm visit to verify eligible disaster conditions that prevented the specified acreage or crop from being planted; or

        (ii) The county committee or its authorized representative the opportunity to determine, based on visual inspection, that the acreage or crop in question was affected by eligible disaster conditions such as damaging weather or other adverse natural occurrences that prevented the acreage or crop from being planted.

        (3) A farm visit to inspect the acreage or crop is required for all late-filed acreage reports where prevented planting credit is sought. Under no circumstance may acreage reported after the 15-day period referenced in paragraph (b)(1) of this section be deemed acceptable unless the criteria in paragraph (b)(2) of this section are met. State and county committees do not have the authority to waive the field inspection and verification provisions for late-filed reports.

        (4) All determinations made during field inspections must be documented on each late-filed acreage report, with results also recorded in county committee minutes to support the documentation.

        (5) The acreage must have been prevented from being planted as the result of a natural disaster and not a management decision.

        (6) The prevented planted acreage report was approved by the county committee. The county committee may disapprove prevented planted acreage credit if it is not satisfied with the documentation provided.

        (c) To receive prevented planted credit for acreage, the producer must show to the satisfaction of FSA that the producer intended to plant the acreage. Documentation supporting such intent includes documents related to field preparation, seed purchase, and any other information that shows the acreage could and would have been planted and harvested absent the natural disaster or eligible cause of loss that prevented the planting.

        (d) Prevented planted acreage credit will not be given to crops where the prevented-planted acreage was affected by drought, unless:

        (1) On the final planting date for non-irrigated acreage, the area that is prevented from being planted has insufficient soil moisture for germination of seed and progress toward crop maturity because of a prolonged period of dry weather, as determined by CCC; and

        (2) Prolonged precipitation deficiencies exceeded the D2 level as determined using the U.S. Drought Monitor; and

        (3) Verifiable information is collected from sources whose business or purpose it is to record weather conditions, as determined by CCC, and including but not limited to the local weather reporting stations of the U.S. National Weather Service.

        (e) Prevented planted acreage credit under this part applies to irrigated crops where the acreage was prevented from being planted due to a lack of water resulting from drought conditions or contamination by saltwater intrusion of an irrigation supply resulting from drought conditions if there was not a reasonable probability of having adequate water to carry out an irrigation practice.

        (f) Acreage ineligible for prevented planting coverage includes, but is not limited to, acreage:

        (1) With respect to which the planting history or conservation plans indicate it would remain fallow for crop rotation purposes;

        (2) Used for conservation purposes or intended to be or considered to have been left unplanted under any program administered by USDA, including the Conservation Reserve and Wetland Reserve Programs;

        (3) Not planted because of a management decision;

        (4) Affected by the containment or release of water by any governmental, public, or private dam or reservoir project, if an easement exists on the acreage affected for the containment or release of water;

        (5) Where any other person receives a prevented planted payment for any crop for the same crop year, unless the acreage meets all the requirements for double cropping under this part;

        (6) Where pasture or other forage crop is in place on the acreage during the time that planting of the crop generally occurs in the area;

        (7) Where another crop is planted (previous or subsequent) that does not meet the double cropping definition;

        (8) Where any volunteer or cover crop is hayed, grazed, or otherwise harvested on the acreage for the same crop year;

        (9) Where there is an inadequate supply of irrigation water beginning on the Federal crop insurance sale closing date for the previous crop year or the Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance Program (NAP) application closing date for the crop as specified in part 1437 of this title through the final planting date of the current year;

        (10) On which a failure or breakdown of irrigation equipment or facilities, unless the failure or breakdown is due to a natural disaster;

        (11) That is under quarantine imposed by a county, State, or Federal government agency;

        (12) That is affected by chemical or herbicide residue, unless the residue is due to a natural disaster;

        (13) That is affected by drifting herbicide;

        (14) On which a crop was produced, but the producer was unable to obtain a market for the crop;

        (15) Involving a planned planting of a “value loss crop” as that term is defined for NAP as specified in part 1437 of this title, including, but not limited to, Christmas trees, aquaculture, or ornamental nursery, for which NAP assistance is provided under value loss procedure;

        (16) For which the claim for prevented planted credit relates to trees or other perennials unless the producer can prove resources were available to plant, grow, and harvest the crop, as applicable;

        (17) That is affected by wildlife damage;

        (18) Upon which, the reduction in the water supply for irrigation is due to participation in an electricity buy-back program, or the sale of water under a water buy-back or legislative changes regarding water usage, or any other cause which is not a natural disaster; or

        (19) That is devoted to non-cropland.

        (g) CCC may allow exceptions to acreage ineligible for prevented planting coverage when surface water or ground water is reduced because of a natural disaster (as determined by CCC).

        (h) Failed acreage is acreage that was planted with the proper equipment during the planting period but failed as a result of an eligible cause of loss, as determined by CCC.

        (i) To be approved by CCC as failed acreage the acreage must have been reported as failed acreage before disposition of the crop, and the acreage must have been planted under normal conditions but failed as the result of a natural disaster and not a management decision. Producers who file a failed acreage report must have the request acted on by the county committee. The county committee will deny the acreage report if it is not satisfied with the documentation provided.

        (j) To receive failed acreage credit the producer must show all of the following:

        (1) That the acreage was planted under normal conditions using the proper equipment with the intent to harvest the acreage.

        (2) Provide documentation that the crop was planted using farming practices consistent for the crop and area, but could not be brought to harvest because of disaster-related conditions.

        (k) The eligible cause for failed acreage must have:

        (1) Occurred after the crop was planted, and

        (2) Before the normal harvest date for the crop in the applicable crop year or in the case of multiple plantings, the harvest date of the first planting in the applicable planting period, and

        (3) Other producers in the area were similarly affected as determined by CCC.

        (l) Eligible failed acreage will be determined on the basis of the producer planting the crop under normal conditions with the expectation to take the crop to harvest.

        (m) Acreage ineligible for failed acreage credit includes, but is not limited to acreage:

        (1) Which was planted using methods that could not be considered normal for the area and without the expectation of harvest;

        (2) Used for conservation purposes or intended to be or considered to have been un-harvested under any program administered by USDA, including the Conservation Reserve and Wetland Reserve Programs; or

        (3) That failed because of a management decision.

        § 718.104   Late-filed and revised acreage reports.

#### § § 718.104

        (a) Late-filed acreage reports may be accepted after the final reporting date through the crop's immediately subsequent crop year's final reporting date and processed by FSA if both of the following apply:

        (1) The crop or identifiable crop residue remains in the field, permitting FSA to verify and determine the acreage and

        (2) The crop acreage and common land unit for which the reported crop acreage report is being filed has not already been determined by FSA.

        (b) Acreage reports submitted later than the date specified in paragraph (a) of this section will not be processed by FSA and will not be used for program purposes.

        (c) The person or legal entity filing a report late must pay the cost of a farm inspection and measurement unless FSA determines that failure to report in a timely manner was beyond the producer's control. The cost of the inspection and measurement is equal to the amount FSA would charge for measurement service; however, FSA's determination of acreage as a result of the inspection and measurement is not considered a paid for measurement service under § 718.101. The acreage measured will be entered as determined acres.

        (d) When an acceptable late-filed acreage report is filed in accordance with this section, the reported crop acreage will be entered for the amount that was actually reported to FSA before FSA determined acres, and the determined crop acreage will be entered as it was determined and established by FSA.

        (e) Revised acreage reports may be filed to change the acreage reported if:

        (1) The acreage has not already been determined by FSA; and

        (2) Actual crop or residue is present in the field.

        (f) Revised reports will be filed and accepted:

        (1) At any time for all crops if the crop or residue still exists in the field for inspection to verify the existence and use made of the crop, the lack of the crop, or a disaster condition affecting the crop; and

        (2) If the producer was in compliance with all other program requirements at the reporting date.

        § 718.105   Tolerances and adjustments.

#### § § 718.105

        (a) Tolerance is the amount by which the determined acreage for a crop may differ from the reported acreage or allotment for the crop and still be considered in compliance with program requirements under §§ 718.102(b)(1), (b)(3) and (b)(5).

        (b) Tolerance rules apply to those fields for which a staking and referencing was performed but such acreage was not planted according to those measurements or when a measurement service is not requested for acreage destroyed to meet program requirements.

        (c) Tolerance rules do not apply to:

        (1) Program requirements of §§ 718.102(b)(2), (b)(4) and (b)(6);

        (2) Official fields upon which the entire field is devoted to one crop;

        (3) Those fields for which staking and referencing was performed and such acreage was planted according to those measurements; or

        (4) The adjusted acreage for farms using measurement after planting which have a determined acreage greater than the marketing quota crop allotment.

        (d) If the acreage report for a crop is outside the tolerance for that crop:

        (1) FSA may consider the requirements of §§ 718.102 (b)(1), (b)(3) and (b)(5) not to have been met;

        (2) Participants may be ineligible for all or a portion of payments or benefits subject to the requirements of §§ 718.102 (b)(1), (b)(3) and (b)(5); and

        (3) Participants may be ineligible for all or a portion of payments or benefits under a program that requires accurate crop acreage reports under rules governing the program.

        § 718.106   Non-compliance and false acreage reports.

#### § § 718.106

        § 718.107   Acreages.

#### § § 718.107

        (a) If an acreage has been established by FSA for an area delineated on an aerial photograph or within a GIS, such acreage will be recognized by the county committee as the acreage for the area until such time as the boundaries of such area are changed. When boundaries not visible on the aerial photograph are established from data furnished by the producer, such acreage shall not be recognized as official acreage until an authorized representative of FSA verifies the boundaries.

        (b) Measurements of any row crop shall extend beyond the planted area by the larger of 15 inches or one-half the distance between the rows.

        (c) The entire acreage of a field or subdivision of a field devoted to a crop shall be considered as devoted to the crop subject to a deduction or adjustment except as otherwise provided in this part.

        § 718.108   Measuring acreage including skip row acreage.

#### § § 718.108

        (a) When one crop is alternating with another crop, whether or not both crops have the same growing season, only the acreage that is actually planted to the crop being measured will be considered to be acreage devoted to the measured crop.

        (b) Subject to the provisions of this paragraph and section, whether planted in a skip row pattern or without a pattern of skipped rows, the entire acreage of the field or subdivision may be considered as devoted to the crop only where the distance between the rows, for all rows, is 40 inches or less. If there is a skip that creates idle land wider than 40 inches, or if the distance between any rows is more than 40 inches, then the area planted to the crop shall be considered to be that area which would represent the smaller of; a 40 inch width between rows, or the normal row spacing in the field for all other rows in the field—those that are not more than 40 inches apart. The allowance for individual rows would be made based on the smaller of actual spacing between those rows or the normal spacing in the field. For example, if the crop is planted in single, wide rows that are 48 inches apart, only 20 inches to either side of each row (for a total of 40 inches between the two rows) could, at a maximum, be considered as devoted as the crop and normal spacing in the field would control. Half the normal distance between rows will also be allowed beyond the outside planted rows not to exceed 20 inches and will reflect normal spacing in the field.

        (c) In making calculations under this section, further reductions may be made in the acreage considered planted if it is determined that the acreage is more sparsely planted than normal using reasonable and customary full production planting techniques.

        (d) The Deputy Administrator has the discretionary authority to allow row allowances other than those specified in this section in those instances in which crops are normally planted with spacings greater or less than 40 inches, such as in case of tobacco, or where other circumstances are present which the Deputy Administrator finds justifies that allowance.

        (e) Paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section shall apply with respect to the 2003 and subsequent crops. For preceding crops, the rules in effect on January 1, 2002, shall apply.

        § 718.109   Deductions.

#### § § 718.109

        (a) Any contiguous area which is not devoted to the crop being measured and which is not part of a skip-row pattern under § 718.108 shall be deducted from the acreage of the crop if such area meets the following minimum national standards or requirements:

        (1) A minimum width of 30 inches;

        (2) For tobacco—three-hundredths (.03) acre. Turn areas, terraces, permanent irrigation and drainage ditches, sod waterways, non-cropland, and subdivision boundaries each of which is at least 30 inches in width may be combined to meet the 0.03-acre minimum requirement; or

        (3) For all other crops and land uses—one-tenth (.10) acre. Turn areas, terraces, permanent irrigation and drainage ditches, sod waterways, non-cropland, and subdivision boundaries each of which is at least 30 inches in width and each of which contain 0.1 acre or more may be combined to meet any larger minimum prescribed for a State in accordance with this subpart.

        (b) If the area not devoted to the crop is located within the planted area, the part of any perimeter area that is more than 217.8 feet (33 links) in width will be considered to be an internal deduction if the standard deduction is used.

        (c) A standard deduction of 3 percent of the area devoted to a row crop and zero percent of the area devoted to a close-sown crop may be used in lieu of measuring the acreage of turn areas.

        § 718.110   Adjustments.

#### § § 718.110

        (a) The farm operator or other interested producer having excess tobacco acreage (other than flue-cured or burley) may adjust an acreage of the crop in order to avoid a marketing quota penalty if such person:

        (1) Notifies the county committee of such election within 15 calendar days after the date of mailing of notice of excess acreage by the county committee; and

        (2) Pays the cost of a farm inspection to determine the adjusted acreage prior to the date the farm visit is made.

        (b) The farm operator may adjust an acreage of tobacco (except flue-cured and burley) by disposing of such excess tobacco prior to the marketing of any of the same kind of tobacco from the farm. The disposition shall be witnessed by a representative of FSA and may take place before, during, or after the harvesting of the same kind of tobacco grown on the farm. However, no credit will be allowed toward the disposition of excess acreage after the tobacco is harvested but prior to marketing, unless the county committee determines that such tobacco is representative of the entire crop from the farm of the kind of tobacco involved.

        § 718.111   Notice of measured acreage.

#### § § 718.111

        (a) FSA will provide notice of measured acreage and mail it to the farm operator. This notice constitutes notice to all parties who have ownership, leasehold interest, or other interest in such farm.

        § 718.112   Redetermination.

#### § § 718.112

        (a) A redetermination of crop acreage, appraised yield, or farm-stored production for a farm may be initiated by the county committee, State committee, or Deputy Administrator at any time. Redetermination may be requested by a producer with an interest in the farm if the producer pays the cost of the redetermination. The request must be submitted to FSA within 5 calendar days after the initial appraisal of the yield of a crop, or before the farm-stored production is removed from storage. A redetermination will be undertaken in the manner prescribed by the Deputy Administrator. A redetermination will be used in lieu of any prior determination unless it is determined by the representative of the Deputy Administrator that there is good cause not to do so.

        (b) FSA will refund the payment of the cost for a redetermination when, because of an error in the initial determination:

        (1) The appraised yield is changed by at least the larger of:

        (i) Five percent or 5 pounds for cotton;

        (ii) Five percent or 1 bushel for wheat, barley, oats, and rye; or

        (iii) Five percent or 2 bushels for corn and grain sorghum; or

        (2) The farm stored production is changed by at least the smaller of 3 percent or 600 bushels; or

        (3) The acreage of the crop is:

        (i) Changed by at least the larger of 3 percent or 0.5 acre; or

        (ii) Considered to be within program requirements.

      Subpart C—Reconstitution of Farms, Allotments, Quotas, and Base Acres

**Source:** Source: 68 FR 16178, Apr. 3, 2003, unless otherwise noted.

        § 718.201   Farm constitution.

#### § § 718.201

        (a) In order to implement FSA programs and monitor compliance with regulations, FSA must have records on what land is being farmed by a particular producer. This is accomplished by a determination of what land or group of lands “constitute” an individual unit or farm. Land that was properly constituted under prior regulations will remain so constituted until a reconstitution is required by paragraph (c) of this section. The constitution and identification of land as a “farm” for the first time and the subsequent reconstitution of a farm made thereafter will include all land operated by an individual entity or joint operation as a single farming unit except that it may not include:

        (1) Land under separate ownership unless the owners agree in writing or have previously agreed in writing and the labor, equipment, accounting system, and management are operated in common by the operator, but separate from other tracts;

        (2) Land under a lease agreement of less than 1 year duration;

        (3) Federally owned land unless it is rangeland on which no crops are planted and on which there are no crop base acres established;

        (4) State-owned wildlife lands unless the former owner has possession of the land under a leasing agreement;

        (5) Land constituting a farm that is declared ineligible to be enrolled in a program under the regulations governing the program;

        (6) For base acre crops, land located in counties that are not contiguous except where:

        (i) Counties are divided by a river;

        (ii) Counties do not share a common border because of a correction line adjustment; or

        (iii) The land is within 20 miles, by road, of other land that will be a part of the farming unit;

        (7) Land subject to either a default election or a valid election made under part 1412 of this title for each and all covered commodities constituted with land that has a different default election or valid election for each and all covered commodities, irrespective of whether or not any of the land has base acres; or

        (8) Land subject to an election of individual coverage under the Agriculture Risk Coverage Program (ARC-IC) in any State constituted with any land in another State.

        (b)(1) If all land on the farm is physically located in one county, the farm shall be administratively located in such county. If there is no FSA office in the county or the county offices have been consolidated, the farm shall be administratively located in the contiguous county most convenient for the farm operator.

        (2) If the land on the farm is located in more than one county, the farm shall be administratively located in either of such counties as the county committees and the farm operator agree. If no agreement can be reached, the farm shall be administratively located in the county where the principal dwelling is situated, or where the major portion of the farm is located if there is no dwelling.

        (c) A reconstitution of a farm either by division or by combination is required whenever:

        (1) A change has occurred in the operation of the land since the last constitution or reconstitution and as a result of such change the farm does not meet the conditions for constitution of a farm as specified in paragraph (a) of this section, except that no reconstitution will be made if the county committee determines that the primary purpose of the change in operation is to establish eligibility to transfer allotments subject to sale or lease, or increase the amount of program benefits received;

        (2) The farm was not properly constituted the previous time;

        (3) An owner requests in writing that the land no longer be included in a farm composed of tracts under separate ownership;

        (4) The county committee determines that the farm was reconstituted on the basis of false information;

        (5) The county committee determines that tracts included in a farm are not being operated as a single farming unit.

        (d) An owner can file a written request to have FSA reconstitute from original tracts areas that are less than 10 DCP cropland acres and less than 5 percent of the original tract, if such request is accompanied by sufficient data from which FSA can determine the political county and State of land in both the original tract and the proposed tract. Any owner-initiated requests for tract divisions for physical location will be performed and effective prospectively from date of request and approval by FSA.

        (e) Reconstitution shall not be approved if the county committee determines that the primary purpose of the reconstitution is to:

        (1) Circumvent the provisions of part 12 of this title; or

        (2) Circumvent any other chapter of this title.

> [68 FR 16178, Apr. 3, 2003, as amended at 80 FR 41996, July 16, 2015; 84 FR 45887, Sept. 3, 2019]

        § 718.202   Determining the land constituting a farm.

#### § § 718.202

        (a) In determining the constitution of a farm, consideration shall be given to provisions such as ownership and operation. For purposes of this part, the following rules shall be applicable to determining what land is to be included in a farm.

        (b) A minor shall be considered to be the same owner or operator as the parent, court-appointed guardian, or other person responsible for the minor child, unless the parent or guardian has no interest in the minor's farm or production from the farm, and the minor:

        (1) Is a producer on a farm;

        (2) Maintains a separate household from the parent or guardian;

        (3) Personally carries out the farming activities; and

        (4) Maintains a separate accounting for the farming operation.

        (c) A minor shall not be considered to be the same owner or operator as the parent or court-appointed guardian if the minor's interest in the farming operation results from being the beneficiary of an irrevocable trust and ownership of the property is vested in the trust or the minor.

        (d) A life estate tenant shall be considered to be the owner of the property for their life.

        (e) A trust shall be considered to be an owner with the beneficiary of the trust; except a trust can be considered a separate owner or operator from the beneficiary, if the trust:

        (1) Has a separate and distinct interest in the land or crop involved;

        (2) Exercises separate responsibility for the separate and distinct interest; and

        (3) Maintains funds and accounts separate from that of any other individual or entity for the interest.

        (f) The county committee shall require specific proof of ownership.

        (g) Land owned by different persons of an immediate family living in the same household and operated as a single farming unit shall be considered as being under the same ownership in determining a farm.

        (h) All land operated as a single unit and owned and operated by a parent corporation and subsidiary corporations of which the parent corporation owns more than 50 percent of the value of the outstanding stock, or where the parent is owned and operated by subsidiary corporations, shall be constituted as one farm.

        § 718.203   County committee action to reconstitute a farm.

#### § § 718.203

        Action to reconstitute a farm may be initiated by the county committee, the farm owner, or the operator with the concurrence of the owner of the farm. Any request for a farm reconstitution shall be filed with the county committee.

        § 718.204   Reconstitution of base acres.

#### § § 718.204

        (a) Farms will be reconstituted in accordance with this subpart when it is determined that the land areas are not properly constituted and, to the extent practicable as determined by county committee, the reconstitution will be based on the facts and conditions existing at the time the change requiring the reconstitution occurred.

        (b) Reconstitutions will be effective for the calendar year if initiated by August 1 of that year. Any reconstitution initiated after August 1 will not be effective for that year; it will be effective for the subsequent year.

        (c) The Deputy Administrator may approve an exception to permit a reconstitution initiated after August 1 to be effective for the same year, if FSA determines that the failure is due to administrative problems as determined by FSA at the local or national level. Producers have no right to seek an exception under this paragraph. When such situations exist, FSA will establish procedures under which reconstitutions will be accepted and when those reconstitutions will become effective.

        § 718.205   Substantive change in farming operation, and changes in related legal entities.

#### § § 718.205

        (a) Land that is properly constituted as a farm shall not be reconstituted if:

        (1) The reconstitution request is based upon the formation of a newly established legal entity which owns or operates the farm or any part of the farm and the county committee determines there is not a substantive change in the farming operation;

        (2) The county committee determines that the primary purpose of the request for reconstitution is to:

        (i) Obtain additional benefits under one or more commodity programs;

        (ii) Avoid damages or penalties under a contract or statute;

        (iii) Correct an erroneous acreage report; or

        (iv) Circumvent any other program provisions. In addition, no farm shall remain as constituted when the county committee determines that a substantive change in the farming operation has occurred which would require a reconstitution, except as otherwise approved by the State committee with the concurrence of the Deputy Administrator.

        (b) In determining whether a substantive change has occurred with respect to a farming operation, the county committee shall consider factors such as the composition of the legal entities having an interest in the farming operation with respect to management, financing, and accounting. The county committee shall also consider the use of land, labor, and equipment available to the farming operations and any other relevant factors that bear on the determination.

        (c) Unless otherwise approved by the State committee with the concurrence of the Deputy Administrator, when the county committee determines that a corporation, trust, or other legal entity is formed primarily for the purpose of obtaining additional benefits under the commodity programs of this title, the farm shall remain as constituted, or shall be reconstituted, as applicable, when the farm is owned or operated by:

        (1) A corporation having more than 50 percent of the stock owned by members of the same family living in the same household;

        (2) Corporations having more than 50 percent of the stock owned by stockholders common to more than one corporation; or

        (3) Trusts in which the beneficiaries and trustees are family members living in the same household.

        (d) Application of the provisions of paragraph (c) of this section shall not limit or affect the application of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.

        § 718.206   Determining farms, tracts, and base acres when reconstitution is made by division.

#### § § 718.206

        (a) The methods for dividing farms, tracts, and base acres are, in order of precedence: Estate, designation by landowner, cropland, and default. The proper method will be determined on a crop-by-crop basis.

        (b) The estate method for reconstitution is the pro-rata distribution of base acres for a parent farm among the heirs in settling an estate. If the estate sells a tract of land before the farm is divided among the heirs, the base acres for that tract will be determined according to paragraphs (c) through (e) of this section.

        (1) Base acres must be divided in accordance with a will, but only if the county committee determines that the terms of the will are such that a division can reasonably be made by the estate method.

        (2) If there is no will or the county committee determines that the terms of a will are not clear as to the division of base acres, the base acres will be apportioned in the manner agreed to in writing by all interested heirs or devisees who acquire an interest in the property for which base acres have been established. An agreement by the administrator or executor will not be accepted in lieu of an agreement by the heirs or devisees.

        (3) If base acres are not apportioned as specified in paragraph (b)(1) or (2) of this section, the base acres must be divided as specified in paragraph (d) or (e) of this section, as applicable.

        (c) If the ownership of a tract of land is transferred from a parent farm, the transferring owner may request that the county committee divide the base acres, including historical acreage that has been double cropped, between the parent farm and the transferred tract, or between the various tracts if the entire farm is sold to two or more purchasers.

        (1) If the county committee determines that base acres cannot be divided in the manner designated by the owner because the owner's designation does not meet the requirements of paragraph (c)(2) of this section, FSA will notify the owner and permit the owner to revise the designation to meet the requirements. If the owner does not furnish a revised designation of base acres within a reasonable time after such notification, or if the revised designation does not meet the requirements, the county committee will divide the base acres in a pro-rata manner in accordance with paragraph (d) or (e) of this section.

        (2) The landowner may designate a manner in which base acres are divided by filing a signed written memorandum of understanding of the designation of base acres with the county committee before the transfer of ownership of the land. Both the transferring owner and transferee must sign the written designation of base acres.

        (i) Within 30 days after a prescribed form, letter, or notice of base acres is issued by FSA following the reconstitution of a farm but before any subsequent transfer of ownership of the land, all owners in existence at time of the reconstitution request may seek a different manner of base acre designation by agreeing in writing by executing a form CCC-517 or other designated form.

        (ii) The landowner must designate the base acres that will be permanently reduced when the sum of the base acres exceeds the effective cropland plus double-cropped acres for the farm.

        (iii) When the part of the farm from which the ownership is being transferred was owned for less than 3 years, the designation by landowner method of designating base acres cannot be used unless the county committee determines that the primary purpose of the ownership transfer was other than to retain or to sell base acres. In the absence of such a determination, and if the farm contains land that has been owned for less than 3 years, the part of the farm that has been owned for less than 3 years will be considered as a separate farm and the base acres must be assigned to that farm in accordance with paragraph (d) or (e) of this section. Such apportionment will be made prior to any designation of base acres with respect to the part that has been owned for 3 years or more.

        (3) The designation by landowner method may be applied, at the owner's request, to land owned by an Indian Tribal Council that is leased to two or more producers for the production of any crop of a commodity for which base acres have been established. If the land is leased to two or more producers, an Indian Tribal Council may request that the county committee divide the base acres between the applicable tracts in the manner designated by the Council. The use of this method is not subject to the requirements specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.

        (d) The cropland method for reconstitution is the pro-rata distribution of base acres to the resulting tracts in the same proportion that each resulting tract bears to the cropland for the parent tract. This method of division will be used if paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section do not apply.

        (e) The default method for reconstitution is the separation of tracts from a farm with each tract maintaining the base acres attributed to the tract when the reconstitution is initiated.

        (f) Farm program payment yields calculated for the resulting farms of a division may be increased or decreased if the county committee determines the method used did not provide an equitable distribution considering available land, cultural operations, and changes in the type of farming conducted on the farm. Any increase in the farm program payment yield on a resulting farm will be offset by a corresponding decrease on another resulting farm of the division.

        § 718.307   Special relief approval authority for State Executive Directors.

#### § § 718.307

        (a)  Notwithstanding provisions in this subpart providing supervision and relief authority to other officials, an SED, after consultation with and approval from OGC but without further review by other officials (other than the Secretary) may grant relief to a participant under the provisions of §§ 718.303 through 718.305 as if the SED were the final arbiter within the agency of such matters so long as:

        (1) The program matter with respect to which the relief is sought is a program matter in a covered program which is operated within the State under the control of the SED;

        (2) The total amount of relief which will be provided to the participant (that is, to the individual or entity that applies for the relief) by that SED under this special authority for errors during that year is less than $20,000 (including in that calculation, any loan amount or other benefit of any kind payable for that year and any other year);

        (3) The total amount of such relief which has been previously provided to the participant using this special authority for errors, as calculated above, is not more than $5,000;

        (4) The total amount of loans, payments, and benefits of any kind for which relief is provided to similarly situated participants by an SED for errors for any year under the authority provided in this section, as calculated above, is not more than $1,000,000.

        (b)  A grant of relief shall be considered to be under this section and subject to the special finality provided in this section only if the SED grants the relief in writing when granting the relief to the party who will receive the benefit of such relief and only if, in that document, the SED declares that they are exercising that power. The SED must report the exercise of that power to the Deputy Administrator so that a full accounting may be made in keeping with the limitations of this section. Absent such a report, relief will not be considered to have been made under this section.

        (c)  The authority provided under this section does not extend to:

        (1) The administration of payment limitations under part 1400 of this chapter (§§ 1001 to 1001F of 7 U.S.C. 1308 );

        (d) Relief may not be provided by the SED under this section until a written opinion or written acknowledgment is obtained from OGC that grounds exist for determination that requirements for granting relief under § 718.303 or § 718.304 have been met, that the form of relief is authorized under § 718.305, and that the granting of the relief is within the lawful authority of the SED.

        (e)  The authority provided under this section is in addition to any other applicable authority that may allow relief.

      means evidence that is used to substantiate the amount of eligible reimbursements by geographically disadvantaged farmers and ranchers in an agricultural operation that can be verified by FSA through an independent source.

      § 755.3   Time and method of application.

#### § § 755.3

      (a) To be eligible for payment, producers must obtain and submit a completed application for payment and meet other eligibility requirements specified in this part. Producers may obtain an application in person, by mail, or by facsimile from any county FSA office. In addition, producers may download a copy of the application at

      (b) An application for payment must be submitted on a completed application form. Applications and any other supporting documentation must be submitted to the FSA county office serving the county where the agricultural operation is located, but, in any case, must be received by the FSA county office by the close of business on the last day of the application period established by the Deputy Administrator.

      (c) All producers who incurred transportation costs for eligible reimbursements and who share in the risk of an agricultural operation must certify to the information on the application before the application will be considered complete. FSA may require the producer to provide documentation to support all verifiable records.

      (d) Each producer requesting payment under this part must certify to the accuracy and truthfulness of the information provided in their application and any supporting documentation. All information provided is subject to verification by FSA. Refusal to allow FSA or any other agency of the Department of Agriculture to verify any information provided will result in a denial of eligibility. Furnishing the information is voluntary; however, without it program benefits will not be approved. Providing a false certification to the Federal Government may be punishable by imprisonment, fines and other penalties or sanctions.

      (e) To ensure all producers are provided an opportunity to submit actual costs for reimbursement at the actual cost rate, applicants will have 30 days after the end of the FY to provide supporting documentation of actual transportation costs to the FSA County Office. The actual costs documented in supporting documentation will override previously reported costs of eligible reimbursable costs at the fixed or set rate made during the application period.

      (f) If verifiable records are not provided to FSA, the producer will be ineligible for payment.

      (g) If supporting documentation is provided within 30 days after the end of the FY, but an application was not submitted to the applicable FSA County Office before the end of the application period, the producer is not eligible for payment.

      (h) Producers who submit applications after the application period are not entitled to any payment consideration or determination of eligibility. Regardless of the reason why an application is not submitted to or received by FSA, any application received after the close of business on such date will not be eligible for benefits under this program.

      § 755.4   Eligibility.

#### § § 755.4

      (a) To be eligible to receive payments under this part, a geographically disadvantaged farmer or rancher must:

      (1) Be a producer of an eligible agricultural commodity in substantial commercial quantities;

      (2) Incur transportation costs for the transportation of the agricultural commodity or input used to produce the agricultural commodity;

      (3) Submit an accurate and complete application for payment as specified in § 755.3; and

      (4) Be in compliance with the wetland and highly erodible conservation requirements in part 12 of this title and meet the adjusted gross income and pay limit eligibility requirements in part 1400 of this title, as applicable, except that the $8,000 cap provided for in this rule is a per producer cap, not a per person cap. For example, a partnership of four individuals would be considered one producer, not four persons, for the purposes of this cap and thus the partnership could only generate a single $8,000 payment under this program if the cap holds because of full subscription of the program.

      (b) Individual producers in an agricultural operation that is an entity are only eligible for a payment based on their share of the operation. A producer is not eligible for payment based on the share of production of any other producer.

      (c) Multiple producers, such as the buyer and seller of a commodity (for example, a producer of hay and a livestock operation that buys the hay), are not eligible for payments for the same eligible transportation cost. Unless the multiple producers agree otherwise, only the last buyer will be eligible for the payment.

      (d) A person or entity determined to be a “foreign person” under part 1400 of this title is not eligible to receive benefits under this part, unless that person provides land, capital, and a substantial amount of active personal labor in the production of crops on such farm.

      (e) State and local governments and their political subdivisions and related agencies are not eligible for RTCP payments.

      § 755.5   Proof of eligible reimbursement costs incurred.

#### § § 755.5

      (a) To be eligible for reimbursement based on FSA fixed or set rates as specified in § 755.7, the requirements specified in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section must be met at the time of the application. To be eligible for reimbursement of actual costs, the requirements of paragraph (d) must also be met, within 30 days after the end of the applicable fiscal year.

      (b) Eligible verifiable records to support eligible reimbursement costs include, but are not limited to:

      (1) Invoices;

      (2) Account statements;

      (3) Contractual Agreements; or

      (4) Bill of Lading.

      (c) Verifiable records must show:

      (1) Name of producer(s);

      (2) Commodity and unit of measure;

      (3) Type of input(s) associated with transportation costs;

      (4) Date(s) of service;

      (5) Name of person or entity providing the service, as applicable, and;

      (6) Retail sales receipts with verifiable records handwritten as applicable.

      (d) To be eligible for reimbursement based on actual costs, the producer must provide supporting documentation that documents the specific costs incurred for transportation of each commodity or input. Such documentation must:

      (1) Show transportation costs for each specific commodity or input, and

      (2) Show the units of measure for each commodity or input, such that FSA can determine the transportation cost per unit.

      § 755.6   Availability of funds.

#### § § 755.6

      (a) Payments under this part are subject to the availability of funds.

      (b) A reserve will be created to handle appeals and errors.

      § 755.7   Transportation rates.

#### § § 755.7

      (a) Payments may be based on fixed, set, or actual transportation rates. Fixed and set transportation rates will be established by FSA, based on available data for transportation costs for that commodity or input in the applicable State or insular region.

      (b) Fixed transportation rates will establish per unit transportation costs for each eligible commodity or input used to produce the eligible commodity.

      (c) Set transportation rates will be established for those transportation costs that are not on the FSA list of fixed rates and for which an actual rate cannot be documented. The set transportation rate will be set by FSA, based on available data of transportation costs for similar commodities and inputs.

      (d) Actual transportation rates will be determined based on supporting documentation.

      § 755.8   Calculation of individual payments.

#### § § 755.8

      (a) Transportation cost for each commodity or input will be calculated by multiplying the number of reported eligible units (the reported transportation amount) times the fixed, set, or actual transportation rate, as applicable.

      (b) Eligible reimbursement amounts will be calculated by multiplying the result of paragraph (a) of this section times the appropriate FY COLA percentage, as provided in this part.

      (c) If transported inputs are used for both eligible and ineligible commodities, the eligible reimbursable costs will be determined on a revenue share of eligible commodities times input cost, as determined by FSA, and transportation may be allowed only for those commodities which were produced for the commercial market.

      (d) The total payment amount for a producer is the sum of all eligible reimbursable amounts determined in paragraph (b) of this section for all commodities and inputs used to produce the eligible commodities listed on the application.

      (e) Payment amounts are subject to $8,000 cap per FY per producer as defined in this part, not per “person” or “legal entity” as those terms might be defined in part 1400 of this title.

      (f) In the event that approval of all calculated payment amounts would result in expenditures in excess of the amount available, FSA will recalculate the payment amounts in a manner that FSA determines to be fair and reasonable.

      § 755.9   Misrepresentation and scheme or device.

#### § § 755.9

      (a) In addition to other penalties, sanctions or remedies as may apply, a producer will be ineligible to receive payments under this part if the producer is determined by FSA to have:

      (1) Adopted any scheme or device that tends to defeat the purpose of this part;

      (2) Made any fraudulent representation; or

      (3) Misrepresented any fact affecting a program determination.

      (b) Any payment to any producer engaged in a misrepresentation, scheme, or device, must be refunded with interest together with such other sums as may become due. Any producer engaged in acts prohibited by this section and receiving payment under this part will be jointly and severally liable with other producers involved in such claim for benefits for any refund due under this section and for related charges. The remedies provided in this part will be in addition to other civil, criminal, or administrative remedies that may apply.

      § 755.10   Death, incompetence, or disappearance.

#### § § 755.10

      (a) In the case of the death, incompetency, or disappearance of a person or the dissolution of an entity that is eligible to receive a payment in accordance with this part, such alternate person or persons specified in part 707 of this chapter may receive such payment, as determined appropriate by FSA.

      (b) Payments may be made to an otherwise eligible producer who is now deceased or to a dissolved entity if a representative who currently has authority to enter into an application for the producer or the producer's estate signs the application for payment. Proof of authority over the deceased producer's estate or a dissolved entity must be provided.

      (c) If a producer is now a dissolved general partnership or joint venture, all members of the general partnership or joint venture at the time of dissolution or their duly authorized representatives must be identified in the application for payment.

      § 755.11   Maintaining records.

#### § § 755.11

      Persons applying for payment under this part must maintain records and accounts to document all eligibility requirements specified in this part. Such records and accounts must be retained for 3 years after the date of payment to the producer under this part.

      § 755.12   Refunds; joint and several liability.

#### § § 755.12

      (a) Any producer that receives excess payment, payment as the result of erroneous information provided by any person, or payment resulting from a failure to comply with any requirement or condition for payment under this part, must refund the amount of that payment to FSA.

      (b) Any refund required will be due from the date of the disbursement by the agency with interest determined in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section and late payment charges as provided in part 1403 of this title.

      (c) Each producer that has an interest in the agricultural operation will be jointly and severally liable for any refund and related charges found to be due to FSA.

Likewise, nothing shall inhibit the ability of the Secretary to reassign any duties with respect to the designations of disasters under this part.

      § 759.2   Purpose.

#### § § 759.2

      (a) This part specifies the types of incidents that can result in an area being determined a disaster area, which under other regulations makes qualified farmers in such areas eligible for Emergency loans (EM) or eligible for such other assistance that may be available, based on Secretarial disaster designations. Nothing in this part overrides provision of those regulations that govern the actual administration and availability of the disaster assistance regulations.

      (b) This part specifies the responsibility of the County Emergency Board (CEB), State Emergency Board (SEB), and the State Executive Director (SED) in regard to Secretarial Designations with regards to disasters. It also addresses matters relating to the handling of a Presidential declaration of disaster or the imposition of a USDA quarantine by the Secretary with respect to triggering the availability of EM loans.

For programs other than the EM Program, disaster assistance regulations will specify whether benefits will be available only in the primary counties or also in the contiguous counties. For the EM Program that issue is addressed in § 759.6, unless specified otherwise in the disaster assistance regulations for other programs or in § 759.6 for the EM Program, only the “primary” county will be considered the qualifying “disaster county.” Therefore, if the disaster assistance regulations specify that they cover the disaster area and contiguous counties, then the only eligible counties would be the primary county and those contiguous to that county. Coverage would not include coverage of those counties that are in turn contiguous to those counties that are contiguous to the primary county.

      is used when referring to a geographical area, a local administrative subdivision of a State or a similar political subdivision of the United States generally considered to be in county usage, for example, it includes an area referred to as a “county” or “parish.” Except where otherwise specified, the use of the term county or similar political subdivision is for administrative purposes only.

      is the county or counties declared or designated as a disaster area as a result of natural disaster related losses. The disaster area only includes the primary counties, but benefits may be available in the counties contiguous to the primary county if so provided by the disaster assistance regulations or, in the case of the EM Program, in § 759.6.

      is a loss assessment report prepared by the CEB relating to the State and county where the potential disaster occurred and for which county or counties the CEB is responsible. The _LAR_ includes as applicable, but is not limited to, starting and ending dates of the disaster, crop year affected, type of disaster incident, area of county affected by disaster; total number of farms affected, crop loss or pasture loss data associated with the applicable disaster (or both types of losses), livestock destroyed, and other property losses.

      is a disaster in which unusual and adverse weather conditions or other natural phenomena have substantially affected farmers by causing severe physical losses, severe production losses, or both.

      is a county determined to be a disaster area.

      is a declaration of a disaster by the President under the Robert T.

      means the State Emergency Board which is comprised of the representatives of several USDA agencies having emergency program responsibilities at the State level. The board is required to respond to emergencies and carry out the Secretary's emergency preparedness responsibilities.

      is the person who serves as the Chairperson of the USDA SEB in each State, is responsible for providing the leadership and coordination for all USDA emergency programs at the State level, and is subject to the supervision of DAFP.

      means, for the purpose of determining an Administrator's declaration of physical loss, losses that consist of severe damage to, or destruction of: Physical farm property including farmland (except sheet erosion); structures on the land including, but not limited to, building, fences, dams; machinery, equipment, supplies, and tools; livestock, livestock products, poultry and poultry products; harvested crops and stored crops.

      when used to refer to producers and to the relationship of a particular producer to a particular disaster means a producer who has sustained qualifying physical or production losses, as defined in this section, as a result of the natural disaster.

      is a system for classifying drought severity according to a range of abnormally dry to exceptional drought. It is a collaborative effort between Federal and academic partners that is produced on a weekly basis to synthesize multiple indices, outlooks, and drought impacts on a map and in narrative form. This synthesis of indices is reported by the National Drought Mitigation Center.

      means each of the several States, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands of the _United States_, Guam, American Samoa, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. Extension of disaster assistance, following a disaster designation, to insular areas of the United States not covered by this definition of “United States” will be only as authorized by law, and as determined by the Administrator on behalf of the Secretary to be appropriate.

      § 759.5   Secretarial disaster area determination and notification process.

#### § § 759.5

      (a)  With respect to drought and without requiring an LAR:

      (1) If any portion of a county is physically located in an area with a Drought Monitor Intensity Classification value of D3 (drought-extreme) or higher during any part of the growing season of the crops affected by the disaster in the county, then the county will be designated a disaster area by the Secretary.

      (2) If any portion of a county meets the threshold Drought Monitor Intensity Classification value of D2 (drought-severe) for at least 8 consecutive weeks during the growing season of affected crops, then the county will be designated a disaster area by the Secretary.

      (b)  In instances where counties have been impacted by a disaster but the county has not been designated a disaster area under the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section, CEB will make a disaster designation recommendation request to SEB when a disaster has resulted in severe production losses. The determination of the sufficiency of the production losses will be governed by the provisions in paragraph (c) of this section. The CEB may make such efforts as are needed to identify counties that have been impacted and had such production losses. A farmer, Indian Tribal Council, or local governing body may initiate the process by reporting production losses or drought conditions to CEB and suggesting that there be a recommendation in favor of designating a county as a disaster area. Recommendations by a CEB in favor of a disaster designation by a CEB under this paragraph are subject to the following:

      (1) A LAR is required as part of a CEB disaster designation request. CEB will submit a disaster designation request with a LAR to SEB for review and recommendation for approval by the Secretary. CEB's written request and SEB recommendation must be submitted within three months of the last day of the occurrence of a natural disaster.

      (2) If SEB determines a qualifying natural disaster and loss have occurred, SEB will forward the recommendation to the Administrator. The natural disaster may include drought conditions that were not sufficiently severe to meet the criteria in paragraph (a) of this section. Since the U.S. Drought Monitor tracks only drought conditions, not specifically agricultural losses resulting from those conditions, it is possible for a drought that does not meet the criteria in paragraph (a) of this section to result in production losses that constitute a natural disaster.

      (3) The Secretary or the Secretary's designee will make disaster area determinations. The Secretary may delegate the authority to the SED. In such case, the SED will act on behalf of the Secretary, subject to review by DAFP as may be appropriate and consistent with the delegation. The delegation of authority to the SED may be revoked by the authority making that delegation or by other authorized person. In all cases, DAFP may reverse any SED determination made in accordance with this section unless the delegation to the SED specifies that such review is not allowed.

      (c)  For purposes of making determinations under paragraph (b) of this section, in order for an area to be declared a disaster area under paragraph (b) of this section based on production losses, the county must have had production losses of 30 percent of at least one crop in the county as the result of a natural disaster.

      (d)  For purposes of the EM program only, unless otherwise specified in the designation, a county may be designated by DAFP as a designated disaster county even though the conditions specified in paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section are not present so long as the disaster has otherwise produced such significant production losses, or other such extenuating circumstances so as to justify, in the opinion of the Secretary, the designation of a county as a disaster area. In making this determination, the Secretary may consider all relevant factors including such factors as the nature and extent of production losses; the number of farmers who have sustained qualifying production losses; the number of farmers that other lenders in the county indicate they will not be in position to provide emergency financing; whether the losses will cause undue hardship to a certain segment of farmers in the county; whether damage to particular crops has resulted in undue hardship; whether other Federal or State benefit programs, which are being made available due to the same disaster, will consequently lessen undue hardship and the demand for EM; and any other factors considered relevant.

      § 759.6   EM to be made available.

#### § § 759.6

      (a) For purposes of the EM Program under part 764, subpart I, of this chapter, a county will be considered an eligible disaster area as designated by FSA for coverage of the EM Program as follows:

      (1)  When production losses meet the requirements in § 759.5 and the county has been designated as a disaster area for that reason, or when the discretionary exception to production losses for EM under § 759.5(d) has been exercised, the primary and contiguous counties will be areas in which otherwise eligible producers can receive EM loans.

      (2)  When only qualifying physical losses occur, the SED will submit a request to the FSA Administrator to make a determination that a natural disaster has occurred in a county, resulting in severe physical losses. If the FSA Administrator determines that such a natural disaster has occurred, then EM can be made available to eligible farmers for physical losses only in the primary county (the county that was the subject of that determination) and the counties contiguous to that county.

      (3)  Any quarantine imposed by the Secretary of Agriculture under the Plant Protection Act or the animal quarantine laws, as defined in section 2509 of the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990, automatically authorizes EM for production and physical losses resulting from the quarantine in a primary county (the county in which the quarantine was in force) and (where the quarantine effects extend beyond that county) the counties contiguous to that primary county.

      (4)  Whenever the President declares a Major Disaster Declaration or an Emergency Declaration, FSA will make EM available to eligible applicants in declared and contiguous counties, provided:

      (i) The Presidential declaration is not solely for Category A or Category B Public Assistance or Hazard Mitigation Grant Assistance, and

      (ii) The Presidential Major Disaster declaration is for losses due to severe, general disaster conditions including but not limited to conditions such as flood, hurricane, or earthquake.

      (b) [Reserved]

        Payments to Dairy Farmers for Milk

          § 760.3   Indemnity payments on milk.

#### § § 760.3

          (a) The amount of an indemnity payment for milk, including, but not limited to organic milk, made to an affected farmer who is determined by the county committee to be in compliance with all the terms and conditions of this subpart will be in the amount of the fair market value of the farmer's normal marketings for the application period, as determined in accordance with §§ 760.4 and 760.5, less:

          (1) Any amount the affected farmer received for whole milk marketed during the application period; and

          (2) Any payment not subject to refund that the affected farmer received from a milk handler with respect to milk removed from the commercial market during the application period.

          (b) The eligible period for Dairy Indemnity Payment Program (DIPP) benefits for milk for the same loss is limited to 3 calendar months from when the first claim for milk benefits is approved. Upon written request from an affected farmer on the milk indemnity form authorized by the Deputy Administrator, the Deputy Administrator may authorize, at the Deputy Administrator's discretion, additional months of benefits for the affected farmer for milk due to extenuating circumstances, which may include allowing additional time for public agency approval of a removal plan for cow indemnification and confirmation of site disposal for affected cows. Additionally, the Deputy Administrator has discretion to approve additional months based on issues that are beyond the control of the affected farmer who is seeking cow indemnification, as well as when the affected farmer is following a plan to reduce chemical residues in milk, cows, and heifers to marketable levels.

> [86 FR 70703, Dec. 13, 2021]

          § 760.4   Normal marketings of milk.

#### § § 760.4

          (a) The county committee shall determine the affected farmer's normal marketings which, for the purposes of this subpart, shall be the sum of the quantities of whole milk which such farmer would have sold in the commercial market in each of the pay periods in the application period but for the removal of his whole milk from the commercial market because of the detection of a residue of a violating substance.

          (b) Normal marketings for each pay period are based on the average daily production during the base period.

          (c) Normal marketings determined in paragraph (b) of this section are adjusted for any change in the daily average number of cows milked during each pay period the milk is off the market compared with the average number of cows milked daily during the base period.

          (d) If only a portion of a pay period falls within the application period, normal marketings for such pay period shall be reduced so that they represent only that part of such pay period which is within the application period.

> [43 FR 10535, Mar. 14, 1978, as amended by Amdt. 1, 44 FR 36360, July 22, 1979]

          § 760.5   Fair market value of milk.

#### § § 760.5

          (a) The county committee shall determine the fair market value of the affected farmer's normal marketings, which, for the purposes of this subpart, shall be the sum of the net proceeds such farmer would have received for his normal marketings in each of the pay periods in the application period.

          (b) The county committee shall determine the net proceeds the affected farmer would have received in each of the pay periods in the application period (1) in the case of an affected farmer who markets his whole milk through a milk handler, by multiplying the affected farmer's normal marketings for each such pay period by the average net price per hundred-weight of whole milk paid during the pay period by such farmer's milk handler in the same area for whole milk similar in quality and butterfat test to that marketed by the affected farmer in the base period used to determine his normal marketings, or (2) in the case of an affected farmer whose commercial market consists of direct retail sales to consumers, by multiplying the affected farmer's normal marketings for each such pay period by the average net price per hundredweight of whole milk, as determined by the county committee, which other producers in the same area who marketed their whole milk through milk handlers received for whole milk similar in quality and butterfat test to that marketed by the affected farmer during the base period used to determine his normal marketings.

          (c) In determining the net price for whole milk, the county committee shall deduct from the gross price therefor any transportation, administrative, and other costs of marketing which it determines are normally incurred by the affected farmer but which were not incurred because of the removal of his whole milk from the commercial market.

          § 760.6   Information to be furnished.

#### § § 760.6

          The affected farmer shall furnish to the county committee complete and accurate information sufficient to enable the county committee or the Deputy Administrator to make the determinations required in this subpart. Such information shall include, but is not limited to:

          (a) A copy of the notice from, or other evidence of action by, the public agency which resulted in the removal of the affected farmer's whole milk from the commercial market.

          (b) The specific name of the violating substance causing the removal of his whole milk from the commercial market, if not included in the notice or other evidence of action furnished under paragraph (a) of this section.

          (c) The quantity and butterfat test of whole milk produced and marketed during the base period. This information must be a certified statement from the affected farmer's milk handler or any other evidence the county committee accepts as an accurate record of milk production and butterfat tests during the base period.

          (d) The average number of cows milked during the base period and during each pay period in the application.

          (e) If the affected farmer markets his whole milk through a milk handler, a statement from the milk handler showing, for each pay period in the application period, the average price per hundred-weight of whole milk similar in quality to that marketed by the affected farmer during the base period used to determine his normal marketings. If the milk handler has information as to the transportation, administrative, and other costs of marketing which are normally incurred by producers who market through the milk handler but which the affected farmer did not incur because of removal of his whole milk from the market, the average price stated by the milk handler shall be the average gross price paid producers less any such costs. If the milk handler does not have such information, the affected farmer shall furnish a statement setting forth such costs, if any.

          (f) The amount of proceeds, if any, received by the affected farmer from the marketing of whole milk produced during the application period.

          (g) The amount of any payments not subject to refund made to the affected farmer by the milk handler with respect to the whole milk produced during the application period and remove from the commercial market.

          (h) To the extent that such information is available to the affected farmer, the name of any pesticide, chemical, or toxic substance used on the farm within 24 months prior to the application period, the use made of the pesticide, chemical, or toxic substance, the approximate date of such use, and the name of the manufacturer and the registration number, if any, on the label on the container of the pesticide, chemical, or toxic substance.

          (i) To the extent possible, the source of the pesticide, chemical, or toxic substance that caused the contamination of the whole milk, the results of any laboratory tests on the feed supply, and the monthly milk testing results that detail the chemical residue levels.

          (j) Such other information as the county committee may request to enable the county committee or the Deputy Administrator to make the determinations required in this subpart.

          § 760.7   Conditions required for milk or cow indemnity.

#### § § 760.7

          (a) An indemnity payment for milk or cows (dairy cows including, but not limited to, bred and open heifers) may be made under this subpart to an affected farmer under the conditions in this section.

          (b) If the pesticide, chemical, or toxic substance, in the contaminated milk was used by the affected farmer, the affected farmer must establish that each of the conditions in this section are met:

          (1) That the pesticide, chemical, or toxic substance, when used, was registered (if applicable) and approved for use as provided in § 760.2(f);

          (2) That the contaminated milk was not the result of the affected farmer's failure to use the pesticide, chemical, or toxic substance, according to the directions and limitations stated on the label; and

          (3) That the contaminated milk was not otherwise the affected farmer's fault.

          (c) If the violating substance in the contaminated milk was not used by the affected farmer, the affected farmer must establish that each of the conditions in this section are met:

          (1) The affected farmer did not know or have reason to believe that any purchased feed contained a violating substance;

          (2) None of the milk was produced by dairy cattle that the affected farmer knew, or had reason to know at the time they were acquired, had elevated levels of a violating substance; and

          (3) The contaminated milk was not otherwise the affected farmer's fault.

          (d) The affected farmer has adopted recommended practices and taken action to eliminate or reduce chemical residues of violating substances from the milk as soon as practicable following the initial discovery of the contaminated milk.

          § 760.8   Application for payments for milk.

#### § § 760.8

          The affected farmer or his legal representative, as provided in §§ 760.25 and 760.29, must sign and file an application for payment on a form which is approved for that purpose by the Deputy Administrator. The form must be filed with the county FSA office for the county where the farm headquarters are located no later than December 31 following the end of the fiscal year in which the loss occurred, or such later date as the Deputy Administrator may specify. The application for payment shall cover application periods of at least 28 days, except that, if the entire application period, or the last application period, is shorter than 28 days, applications for payment may be filed for such shorter period. The application for payment shall be accompanied by the information required by § 760.6 as well as any other information which will enable the county committee to determine whether the making of an indemnity payment is precluded for any of the reasons set forth in § 760.7. Such information shall be submitted on forms approved for the purpose by the Deputy Administrator.

> [43 FR 10535, Mar. 14, 1978, as amended at 51 FR 12986, Apr. 17, 1986; 52 FR 17935, May 13, 1987]

          § 760.9   Payments for the same loss.

#### § § 760.9

          (a) No indemnity payment shall be made for contaminated milk resulting from residues of chemicals or toxic substances if, within 30 days after receiving a complete application, the Deputy Administrator determines that other legal recouse is available to the farmer. An application shall not be deemed complete unless it contains all information necessary to make a determination as to whether other legal recourse is available to the farmer. However, notwithstanding such a determination, the Deputy Administrator may reopen the case at a later date and make a new determination on the merits of the case as may be just and equitable.

          (b) In the event that a farmer receives an indemnity payment under this subpart, and such farmer is later compensated for the same loss by the person (or the representative or successor in interest of such person) responsible for such loss, the indemnity payment shall be refunded by the farmer to the Department of Agriculture:  That the amount of such refund shall not exceed the amount of other compensation received by the farmer.

          (c) For any affected farmer that exceeded 3 months of milk indemnity payments before December 13, 2021 no further payments for milk indemnity will be made for the same loss except as provided in § 760.3(b) and the affected farmer may apply for cow indemnity as specified in this subpart.

          (d) An affected farmer that has an approved application for cow indemnity is no longer eligible for milk indemnity payments for the same loss.

          (e) Cows purchased or bred after the initial discovery of the milk contamination are not eligible for DIPP benefits due to the same loss.

> [Amdt. 1, 44 FR 36361, June 22, 1979, as amended at 84 FR 28176, June 18, 2019; 86 FR 70703, Dec. 13, 2021]

          § 760.10   Indemnity payments for cows.

#### § § 760.10

          (a) The Deputy Administrator for Farm Programs (DAFP) will determine eligibility for DIPP indemnification based on if the cows of the affected farmer are likely to be not marketable for 3 months or longer [from the date the affected farmer submits an application for cow indemnification per § 760.13]. The Deputy Administrator will review the following factors in making that determination:

          (1) Milk testing results;

          (2) Non marketability of affected cows through commercial marketing facilities;

          (3) Type and source of chemical residues impacting the milk and animal tissues; and

          (4) Projected duration for chemical residue reduction including the actions taken by the affected farmer to reduce the chemical residues to marketable levels since the affected cows were discovered.

          (b) See § 760.11 for indemnity payment eligibility for bred and open heifers.

          (c) Affected farmers applying for indemnification of cows, including heifers, must develop a removal plan both to permanently remove the affected cows by depopulating the cows.

          (1) The removal plan for affected cows for which an affected farmer applies for indemnification under DIPP must be approved by the applicable public agency where the cows are located and must be in accordance with any applicable Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and public agency depopulation and animal disposal requirements and guidelines, including contaminant disposal requirements, in the State where the affected cows are located.

          (2) The approved removal plan must be submitted with the application for indemnification.

          (d) The amount of an indemnity payment for cows to an affected farmer who is determined by the Deputy Administrator to be eligible for indemnification and by the county committee to be in compliance with all the terms and conditions of this subpart will be based on the national average fair market value of the cows. DIPP cow indemnification will be based on the 100 percent value of the Livestock Indemnity Program (LIP) rates as applicable for the calendar year for milk indemnification established for dairy cows, per head. For example, for a 100-cow farm: 100 cows multiplied by $1,300 (2021 LIP rate based on 100 percent value of average cow) = $130,000 payment.

          (e) For any cow indemnification payment under this section or § 760.11, the affected farmer has the option to receive 50 percent of calculated payment in advance after application approval with the remaining fifty percent paid after the affected cows have been depopulated and removed. Otherwise, the affected farmer may choose to receive 100 percent of payment after cows have been depopulated and removed. Documented records of depopulation and removal of affected cows must be provided to FSA to the satisfaction of the county committee, before the final payment will be made.

          (f) Upon written request from an affected farmer on a form authorized by the Deputy Administrator, the Deputy Administrator may approve, at the Deputy Administrator's discretion, indemnification of additional affected cows as specified in paragraphs (f)(1) through (3) of this section.

          (1) The affected cows were depopulated or died above normal mortality rates for cows between approval of the affected farmer's application for the first month of milk indemnity and public agency approval of the affected farmer's removal plan for cow indemnification. Normal mortality rates established annually by the FSA State committee for their state for the following cow and heifer weight groups will be used:

          (i) Dairy, nonadult less than 400 pounds;

          (ii) Dairy, nonadult 400 pounds or more; and

          (iii) Dairy, adult cow.

          (2) This request may include both cows that were included in applications for milk indemnity and heifers that were affected from the same loss.

          (3) An affected farmer making such a request must submit the information specified in § 760.12(c).

          (g) Affected cows that are marketed as cull or for breeding are not eligible for indemnification.

> [86 FR 70703, Dec. 13, 2021]

          § 760.11   Indemnity payments for bred and open heifers.

#### § § 760.11

          (a) Bred (young dairy female in gestation) and open (young dairy female not in gestation) heifers that contain elevated levels of chemical residues as the result of the same loss may be eligible for indemnification through DIPP. For affected bred and open heifers participating affected farmers may receive indemnification if the farmer's dairy cows were determined to be likely not marketable for three months or longer according to § 760.10(a) and the Deputy Administrator determines the bred and open heifers to be eligible under paragraph (b) of this section. Except as provided in this section or otherwise stated in this subpart, the provisions in this subpart for cow indemnity apply equally to bred and open heifers, for example the removal requirements in § 760.10(b).

          (b) The county committee will make the recommendation to the Deputy Administrator to determine if eligible bred and open heifers that have been affected by the same loss will likely be not marketable for 3 months or longer from the date the affected farmer submits an application for cow indemnification per § 760.13 because of elevated levels of chemical residues that will pass through milk once lactating. Affected farmers must provide the information specified in § 760.12(a) and (b) for the county committee to make a recommendation of eligibility to the Deputy Administrator. The Deputy Administrator will take into consideration the recommendation of the county committee in making its eligibility determination.

          (c) The amount of the cow indemnity for bred and open heifers will be based on the national average fair market value of the non-adult heifers. DIPP bred and open heifer indemnification will be based on the 100 percent value of the Livestock Indemnity Program (LIP) rates as applicable for the calendar year of milk indemnification established for non-adult dairy, by weight range, per head. For example, for an affected farmer with 40 bred or open heifers at different weight ranges: 10 bred heifers at 800 pounds or more multiplied by $986.13 ($9861.30), 10 bred or open heifers at 400 to 799 pounds multiplied by $650.00 ($6500.00), 10 open heifers at 250 to 399 pounds multiplied by $325.00 ($3250.00), and 10 open heifers 250 pounds or less multiplied by $57.65 ($576.50) = $20,187.80 payment.

Participants have no right to seek an exception under this provision. The Deputy Administrator's refusal to consider cases or circumstances or decision not to exercise this discretionary authority under this provision will not be considered an adverse decision and is not appealable.

        § 760.103   Eligible producer.

#### § § 760.103

        (a) In general, the term “eligible producer” means, in addition to other requirements as may apply, an individual or entity described in paragraph (b) of this section that, as determined by the Secretary, assumes the production and market risks associated with the agricultural production of crops or livestock on a farm either as the owner of the farm, when there is no contract grower, or a contract grower of the livestock when there is a contract grower.

        (b) To be eligible for benefits, an individual or entity must be a:

        (1) Citizen of the United States;

        (2) Resident alien; for purposes of this part, resident alien means “lawful alien” as defined in 7 CFR part 1400;

        § 760.104   Risk management purchase requirements.

#### § § 760.104

        (a) To be eligible for program payments under:

        (1) ELAP, SURE, and TAP, eligible producers for any commodity at any location for which the producer seeks benefits must have for every commodity on every farm in which the producer has an interest for the relevant program year:

        (i) In the case of an “insurable commodity,” (which for this part means a commodity for which the Deputy Administrator determines catastrophic coverage is available from the USDA Risk Management Agency (RMA)) obtained catastrophic coverage or better under a policy or plan of insurance administered by RMA under the Federal Crop Insurance Act (FCIA) (7 U.S.C. 1501-1524), except that this obligation will not include crop insurance pilot programs so designated by RMA or to forage crops intended for grazing, and

        (ii) In the case of a “noninsurable commodity,” (which is any commodity for which, as to the particular production in question, is not an “insurable commodity,” but for which coverage is available under the Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance Program (NAP) operated under 7 CFR part 1437), have obtained NAP coverage by filing the proper paperwork and fee within the relevant deadlines, except that this requirement will not include forage on grazing land.

        (2) LFP, with respect to those grazing lands incurring losses for which assistance is being requested, eligible livestock producers must have:

        (i) Obtained a policy or plan of insurance for the forage crop under FCIA, or

        (ii) Filed the required paperwork and paid the administrative fee by the applicable State filing deadline for NAP coverage for that grazing land.

        (b) Producers who did not purchase a policy or plan of insurance administered by RMA in accordance with FCIA (7 U.S.C. 1501-1524), or NAP coverage for their applicable crops, will not be eligible for assistance under ELAP, LFP, SURE, and TAP, as provided in paragraph (a) of this section unless the producer is one of the classes of farmers for which an exemption under § 760.107 apply, is exempt under the “buy-in” provisions of this subpart, or is granted relief from that requirement by the Deputy Administrator under some other provision of this part.

        (c) Producers who have obtained insurance by a written agreement as specified in § 400.652(d) of this title even though that production would not normally be considered an “insurable commodity” under the rules of this subpart, will be considered to have met the risk management purchase requirement of this subpart with respect to such production. The commodity to which the agreement applies will be considered for purposes of this subpart to be an “insurable commodity.”

        (d) Producers by an administrative process who were granted NAP coverage for the relevant period as a form of relief in an administrative proceeding, or who were awarded NAP coverage for the relevant period through an appeal through the National Appeals Division (NAD), will be considered as having met the NAP eligibility criteria of this section for that crop as long as the applicable NAP service fee has been paid.

        (e) The risk management purchase requirement for programs specified under this part will be determined based on the initial intended use of a crop at the time a policy or plan of insurance or NAP coverage was purchased and as reported on the acreage report.

        § 760.105   Waiver for certain crop years; buy-in.

#### § § 760.105

        (a) For the 2008 crop year, the insurance or NAP purchase requirements of § 760.104 (this is referred to as the “purchase” requirement) will be waived for eligible producers for losses during the 2008 crop year if the eligible producer paid a fee (buy-in fee) equal to the applicable NAP service fee or catastrophic risk protection plan fee to the Secretary by September 16, 2008. Payment of a buy-in fee under this section is for the sole purpose of becoming eligible for participation in ELAP, LFP, SURE, and TAP. Payment of a buy-in fee does not provide any actual insurance or NAP coverage or assistance.

        (b) For the 2009 crop year, the purchase requirement will be waived for purchases where the closing date for coverage occurred prior to August 14, 2008, so long as the buy-in fee set by the Secretary of Agriculture was paid by January 12, 2009.

        (c) Any producer of 2008 commodities who is otherwise ineligible because of the purchase requirement and who did not meet the conditions of paragraph (a) of this section may still be covered for ELAP, SURE, or TAP assistance if the producer paid the applicable fee described in paragraph (d) of this section no later than May 18, 2009, provided that in the case of each:

        (1) Insurable commodity, excluding grazing land, the eligible producers on the farm agree to obtain a policy or plan of insurance under FCIA (7 U.S.C. 1501-1524), excluding a crop insurance pilot program under that subtitle, for the next insurance year for which crop insurance is available to the eligible producers on the farm at a level of coverage equal to 70 percent or more of the recorded or appraised average yield indemnified at 100 percent of the expected market price, or an equivalent coverage, and

        (2) Noninsurable commodity, the eligible producers on the farm must agree to file the required paperwork, and pay the administrative fee by the applicable State filing deadline, for NAP for the next year for which a policy is available.

        (d) For producers seeking eligibility under paragraph (c) of this section, the applicable buy-in fee for the 2008 crop year was the catastrophic risk protection plan fee or the applicable NAP service fee in effect prior to NAP service fee adjustments specified in the 2008 Farm Bill.

        § 760.106   Equitable relief.

#### § § 760.106

        (a) The Secretary may provide equitable relief on a case-by-case basis for the purchase requirement to eligible participants that:

        (1) Are otherwise ineligible or provide evidence, satisfactory to FSA, that the failure to meet the requirements of § 760.104 for one or more eligible crops on the farm was unintentional and not because of any fault of the participant, as determined by the Secretary, or

        (2) Failed to meet the requirements of § 760.104 due to the enactment of the 2008 Farm Bill after the:

        (i) Applicable sales closing date for a policy or plan of insurance in accordance with the FCIA (7 U.S.C. 1501-1524) or

        (ii) Application closing date for NAP.

        (b) Equitable relief will not be granted to participants in instances of:

        (1) A scheme or device that had the effect or intent of defeating the purposes of a program of insurance, NAP, or any other program administered under this part or elsewhere in this title,

        (2) An intentional decision to not meet the purchase or buy-in requirements,

        (3) Producers against whom sanctions have been imposed by RMA or FSA prohibiting the purchase of coverage or prohibiting the receipt of payments otherwise payable under this part,

        (4) Violations of highly erodible land and wetland conservation provisions of 7 CFR part 12,

        (5) Producers who are ineligible under any provisions of law, including regulations, relating to controlled substances (see for example 7 CFR 718.6), or

        (6) A producer's debarment by a federal agency from receiving any federal government payment if such debarment included payments of the type involved in this matter.

        (c) In general, no relief that is discretionary will be allowed except upon a finding by the Deputy Administrator or the Deputy Administrator's designee that the person seeking the relief acted in good faith as determined in accordance with such rules and procedures as may be set by the Deputy Administrator.

        § 760.108   Payment limitation.

#### § § 760.108

        (a) For 2008, no person, as defined and determined under the provisions in part 1400 of this title in effect for 2008 may receive more than:

        (1) $100,000 total for the 2008 program year under ELAP, LFP, LIP, and SURE combined or

        (2) $100,000 for the 2008 program year under TAP.

        (b) For 2009 and subsequent program years, no person or legal entity, excluding a joint venture or general partnership, as determined by the rules in part 1400 of this title may receive, directly or indirectly, more than:

        (1) $100,000 per program year total under ELAP, LFP, LIP, and SURE combined; or

        (2) $100,000 per program year under TAP.

        (c) The Deputy Administrator may take such actions as needed, whether or not specifically provided for, to avoid a duplication of benefits under the multiple programs provided for in this part, or duplication of benefits received in other programs, and may impose such cross-program payment limitations as may be consistent with the intent of this part.

        (1) FSA will review ELAP payments after the funding factor as specified in § 760.208 is determined to be 100 percent. FSA will ensure that total ELAP payments provided to a participant in a year, together with any amount provided to the same participant for the same loss as a result of any Federal crop insurance program, the Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance Program, or any other Federal disaster program, plus the value of the commodity that was not lost, is not more than 95 percent of the value of the commodity in the absence of the loss, as estimated by FSA.

        (2) [Reserved]

        (d) In applying the limitation on average adjusted gross income (AGI) for 2008, an individual or entity is ineligible for payment under ELAP, LFP, LIP, SURE, and TAP if the individual's or entity's average adjusted gross income (AGI) exceeds $2.5 million for 2007, 2006, and 2005 under the provisions in part 1400 of this title in effect for 2008.

        (e) For 2009 through 2011, the average AGI limitation provisions in part 1400 of this title relating to limits on payments for persons or legal entities, excluding joint ventures and general partnerships, with certain levels of average adjusted gross income (AGI) will apply under this subpart and will apply to each applicant for ELAP, LFP, LIP, SURE, and TAP. Specifically, for 2009 through 2011, a person or legal entity with an average adjusted gross nonfarm income, as defined in § 1404.3 of this title, that exceeds $500,000 will not be eligible to receive benefits under this part.

        (f) The direct attribution provisions in part 1400 of this title apply to ELAP, LFP, LIP, SURE, and TAP for 2009 and subsequent years. Under those rules, any payment to any legal entity will also be considered for payment limitation purposes to be a payment to persons or legal entities with an interest in the legal entity or in a sub-entity. If any such interested person or legal entity is over the payment limitation because of direct payment or their indirect interests or a combination thereof, then the payment to the actual payee will be reduced commensurate with the amount of the interest of the interested person in the payee. Likewise, by the same method, if anyone with a direct or indirect interest in a legal entity or sub-entity of a payee entity exceeds the AGI levels that would allow a participant to directly receive a payment under this part, then the payment to the actual payee will be reduced commensurately with that interest. For all purposes under this section, unless otherwise specified in part 1400 of this title, the AGI figure that will be relevant for a person or legal entity will be an average AGI for the three taxable years that precede the most immediately preceding complete taxable year, as determined by CCC.

#### § § 760.112

        (a) Any participant receiving payments under any program in ELAP, LFP, LIP, SURE, or TAP, or any other legal entity or person who provides information for the purposes of enabling a participant to receive a payment under ELAP, LFP, LIP, SURE, or TAP, must:

        (1) Maintain any books, records, and accounts supporting the information for 3 years following the end of the year during which the request for payment was submitted, and

#### § § 760.203

        (a) An eligible loss covered under this subpart is a loss that an eligible producer or contract grower of livestock, honeybees, or farm-raised fish incurs due to an eligible adverse weather or eligible loss condition, as determined by the Deputy Administrator, (including, but not limited to, blizzards and wildfires).

        (b) A loss covered under LFP, LIP, or SURE is not eligible for ELAP.

        (c) To be eligible, the loss must have occurred:

        (1) During the calendar year for which payment is being requested and

        (2) Due to an eligible adverse weather event or loss condition that occurred on or after January 1, 2008, and before October 1, 2011.

        (d) For a livestock feed loss to be considered an eligible loss, the livestock feed loss must be one of the following:

        (1) Loss of purchased forage or feedstuffs that was intended for use as feed for the participant's eligible livestock that was physically located in the county where the eligible adverse weather or eligible loss condition occurred on the beginning date of the eligible adverse weather or eligible loss condition. The loss must be due to an eligible adverse weather or eligible loss condition, as determined by the Deputy Administrator, including, but not limited to, blizzard, flood, hurricane, tidal surge, tornado, volcanic eruption, wildfire on non-Federal land, or lightning;

        (2) Loss of mechanically harvested forage or feedstuffs intended for use as feed for the participant's eligible livestock that was physically located in the county where the eligible adverse weather or eligible loss condition occurred on the beginning date of the eligible adverse weather or eligible loss condition.

The additional costs incurred must have been incurred for losses suffered in the county where the eligible adverse weather or eligible loss condition occurred;

        (4) A loss resulting from the additional cost of purchasing additional livestock feed, above normal quantities, required to maintain the eligible livestock during an eligible adverse weather or eligible loss condition, until additional livestock feed becomes available, as determined by the Deputy Administrator. To be eligible, the additional feed purchased above normal quantities must be feed that is fed to maintain livestock in the county where the eligible adverse weather or eligible loss condition occurred.

        (e) For a grazing loss to be considered eligible, the grazing loss must have been incurred on eligible grazing lands physically located in the county where the eligible adverse weather or eligible loss condition occurred.

To be eligible for a loss of honeybees due to colony collapse disorder, the eligible honeybee producer must provide acceptable documentation to support that the loss was due to colony collapse disorder. Except for 2008 and 2009 honeybee losses, acceptable documentation must include an acceptable colony collapse disorder certification by an independent third party as determined by the Deputy Administrator, plus any other documentation requested by FSA. For 2008 and 2009 honeybee losses such an independent certification is not required in all cases, but rather a self-certification by the honeybee producer as determined acceptable by the Deputy Administrator may be allowed in addition to whatever other documentation might be requested.

        (i) For a death loss for bait fish or game fish to be considered eligible, the producer must have incurred the loss in the county where the eligible adverse weather or eligible loss condition occurred. The bait fish or game fish death must be due to an eligible adverse weather or eligible loss condition as determined by the Deputy Administrator including, but not limited to, an earthquake, flood, hurricane, tidal surge, tornado, and volcanic eruption.

        § 760.208   Availability of funds.

#### § § 760.208

        By law, “up to” $50 million per year for the years in question may be approved for use by the Secretary and accordingly, within that cap, the only funds that will be considered available to pay claims will be that amount approved by the Secretary. Nothing in these regulations will limit the ability of the Secretary to restrict the availability of funds for the program as permitted by the relevant legislation. Payments will not be made for claims arising out of a particular year until, for all claims for that year, the time for applying for a payment has passed. In the event that, within the limits of the funding made available by the Secretary within the statutory cap, approval of eligible applications would result in expenditures in excess of the amount available, FSA will prorate the available funds by a national factor to reduce the total expected payments to the amount made available by the Secretary. FSA will make payments based on the factor for the national rate determined by FSA. FSA will prorate the payments in such manner as it determines appropriate and reasonable. Claims that are unpaid or prorated for a calendar year for any reason will not be carried forward for payment under other funds for later years or otherwise, but will be considered, as to any unpaid amount, void and nonpayable.

        § 760.209   Livestock payment calculations.

#### § § 760.209

        (a) Payments for an eligible livestock producer will be calculated based on losses for no more than 90 days during the calendar year. Payment calculations for feed losses will be based on 60 percent of the producer's actual cost for:

        (1) Livestock feed that was purchased forage or feedstuffs intended for use as feed for the participant's eligible livestock that was physically damaged or destroyed due to the direct result of an eligible adverse weather or eligible loss condition, as provided in § 760.203(d)(1);

        (2) Livestock feed that was mechanically harvested forage or feedstuffs intended for use as feed for the participant's eligible livestock that was physically damaged or destroyed after harvest due to the direct result of an eligible adverse weather or eligible loss condition, as provided in § 760.203(d)(2);

        (3) The additional cost incurred for providing or transporting livestock feed to eligible livestock due to an eligible adverse weather or eligible loss condition, as provided in § 760.203(d)(3); or

        (4) The additional cost of purchasing additional livestock feed above normal, to maintain the eligible livestock during an eligible adverse weather or eligible loss condition until additional livestock feed becomes available, as provided in § 760.203(d)(4).

        (b) Payments for an eligible livestock producer for grazing losses, except for losses due to wildfires on non-Federal land, will be calculated based on 60 percent of the lesser of:

        (1) The total value of the feed cost for all covered livestock owned by the eligible livestock producer based on the number of days grazing was lost, not to exceed 90 days of daily feed cost for all covered livestock, or

        (2) The total value of grazing lost for all eligible livestock based on the normal carrying capacity, as determined by the Secretary, of the eligible grazing land of the eligible livestock producer for the number of grazing days lost, not to exceed 90 days of lost grazing.

        (c) The total value of feed cost to be used in the calculation for paragraph (b)(1) of this section is based on the number of days grazing was lost and equals the product obtained by multiplying:

        (1) A payment quantity equal to the feed grain equivalent, as determined in paragraph (d) of this section;

        (2) A payment rate equal to the corn price per pound, as determined in paragraph (e) of this section;

        (3) The number of all covered livestock owned by the eligible producer converted to an animal unit basis;

        (4) The number of days grazing was lost, not to exceed 90 calendar days during the normal grazing period for the specific type of grazing land; and

        (5) The producer's ownership share in the livestock.

        (d) The feed grain equivalent to be used in the calculation for paragraph (c)(1) of this section equals, in the case of:

        (1) An adult beef cow, 15.7 pounds of corn per day or

        (2) Any other type or weight of livestock, an amount determined by the Secretary that represents the average number of pounds of corn per day necessary to feed that specific type of livestock.

        (e) The corn price per pound to be used in the calculation for paragraph (c)(2) of this section equals the quotient obtained by dividing:

        (1) The higher of:

        (i) The national average corn price per bushel of corn for the 12-month period immediately preceding March 1 of the calendar year for which payments are calculated; or

        (ii) The national average corn price per bushel of corn for the 24-month period immediately preceding March 1 of the calendar year for which payments are calculated; by

        (2) 56.

        (f) The total value of grazing lost to be used in the calculation for paragraph (b)(2) of this section equals the product obtained by multiplying:

        (1) A payment quantity equal to the feed grain equivalent of 15.7 pounds of corn per day;

        (2) A payment rate equal to the corn price per pound, as determined in paragraph (e) of this section;

        (3) The number of animal units the eligible livestock producer's grazing land or pastureland can sustain during the normal grazing period in the county for the specific type of grazing land or pastureland, in the absence of an eligible adverse weather or eligible loss condition, determined by dividing the:

        (i) Number of eligible grazing land or pastureland acres of the specific type of grazing land or pastureland by

        (ii) The normal carrying capacity of the specific type of eligible grazing land or pastureland; and

        (4) The number of days grazing was lost, not to exceed 90 calendar days during the normal grazing period for the specific type of grazing land.

        (g) Payments for an eligible livestock producer for grazing losses due to a wildfire on non-Federal land will be calculated by multiplying:

        (1) The result of dividing:

        (i) The number of acres of grazing land or pastureland acres affected by the fire by

        (ii) The normal carrying capacity of the specific type of eligible grazing land or pastureland; times

        (2) The daily value of grazing as calculated by FSA under this section; times

        (3) The number of days grazing was lost due to fire, not to exceed 180 calendar days; times

        (4) 50 percent.

        (h) Payments for an eligible livestock producer for eligible livestock death losses due to an eligible loss condition will be based on the following:

        (1) Payments will be calculated by multiplying:

        (i) The national payment rate for each livestock category times

        (ii) The number of eligible livestock that died in each category as a result of an eligible loss condition in excess of normal mortality, as determined in paragraph (d)(2) of this section;

        (2) Normal mortality for each livestock category as determined by FSA on a statewide basis using local data sources including, but not limited to, State livestock organizations and the Cooperative Extension Service for the State.

        (3) National payment rates to be used in the calculation for paragraph (b)(1) of this section for eligible livestock owners and eligible livestock contract growers are:

        (i) A national payment rate for eligible livestock owners that is based on 75 percent of the average fair market value of the applicable livestock as computed using nationwide prices for the previous calendar year unless some other price is approved by the Deputy Administrator.

        (ii) A national payment rate for eligible livestock contract growers that is based on 75 percent of the relevant average income loss sustained by the contract grower, with respect to the dead livestock.

        (i) Payments calculated in this section are subject to the adjustments and limits provided for in this part.

        § 760.305   Eligible grazing losses.

#### § § 760.305

        (a) A grazing loss due to drought is eligible for LFP only if the grazing loss for the covered livestock occurs on land that:

        (1) Is native or improved pastureland with permanent vegetative cover or

        (2) Is planted to a crop planted specifically for the purpose of providing grazing for covered livestock; and

        (3) Is grazing land or pastureland that is owned or leased by the eligible livestock producer that is physically located in a county that is, during the normal grazing period for the specific type of grazing land or pastureland for the county, rated by the U.S. Drought Monitor as having a:

        (i) D2 (severe drought) intensity in any area of the county for at least 8 consecutive weeks during the normal grazing period for the specific type of grazing land or pastureland for the county, as determined by the Secretary, or

        (ii) D3 (extreme drought) or D4 (exceptional drought) intensity in any area of the county at any time during the normal grazing period for the specific type of grazing land or pastureland for the county, as determined by the Secretary. (As specified elsewhere in this subpart, the amount of potential payment eligibility will be higher than under (a)(3)(i) of this section where the D4 trigger applies or where the D3 condition as determined by the Secretary lasts at least 4 weeks during the normal grazing period for the specific type of grazing land or pastureland for the county.)

        (b) A grazing loss is not eligible for LFP if the grazing loss due to drought on land used for haying or grazing under the Conservation Reserve Program established under subchapter B of chapter 1 of subtitle D of title XII of the Food Security Act of 1985 (16 U.S.C. 3831-3835a).

        (c) A fire qualifies for LFP only if:

        (1) The grazing loss occurs on rangeland that is managed by a Federal agency and

        (2) The eligible livestock producer is prohibited by the Federal agency from grazing the normal permitted livestock on the managed rangeland due to a fire.

        (d) An eligible livestock producer may be eligible for LFP payments only on those grazing lands incurring losses for which the livestock producer:

        (1) Meets the risk management purchase requirements specified in § 760.104; or

        (2) Does not meet the risk management purchase requirements specified in § 760.104 because the risk management purchase requirement is waived according to §§ 760.105, 760.106, or 760.107.

        § 760.306   Application for payment.

#### § § 760.306

        (i) Was for the covered livestock;

        (ii) If the loss of grazing occurred as the result of a fire that the:

        (A) Loss was due to a fire and

        (B) Participant was prohibited by the Federal agency from grazing the normal permitted livestock on the managed rangeland due to a fire;

        (iii) Occurred on or after January 1, 2008, and before October 1, 2011; and

        (iv) Occurred in the calendar year for which payments are being requested;

        (7) Adequate proof, absent an appropriate waiver (if there is a waiver, it itself must be documented by the producer), as determined by FSA, that the participant had obtained, for the grazing land incurring the losses for which assistance is being requested, one or both of the following:

        (c) Data furnished by the participant will be used to determine eligibility for program benefits. Furnishing the data is voluntary; however, without all required data, program benefits will not be approved or provided.

        § 760.307   Payment calculation.

#### § § 760.307

        (a) An eligible livestock producer will be eligible to receive payments for grazing losses for qualifying drought as specified in § 760.305(a) equal to one, two, or three times the monthly payment rate specified in paragraphs (e) or (f) of this section. Total LFP payments to an eligible livestock producer in a calendar year for grazing losses due to qualifying drought will not exceed three monthly payments for the same livestock. Payments calculated in this section or elsewhere with respect to LFP are subject to the adjustments and limits provided for in this part and are also subject to the payment limitations and average adjusted gross income provisions that are contained in subpart B. Payment may only be made to the extent that eligibility is specifically provided for in this subpart. Hence, with respect to drought, payments will be made only as a “one month” payment, a “two month” payment, or a “three month” payment based on the provisions of paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section.

        (b) To be eligible to receive a one month payment, that is a payment equal to the monthly feed cost as determined under paragraph (g) of this section, the eligible livestock producer must own or lease grazing land or pastureland that is physically located in a county that is rated by the U.S. Drought Monitor as having at least a D2 severe drought (intensity) in any area of the county for at least 8 consecutive weeks during the normal grazing period for the specific type of grazing land or pastureland in the county.

        (c) To be eligible to receive a two month payment, that is a payment equal to twice the monthly feed cost as determined under paragraph (g) of this section, the eligible livestock producer must own or lease grazing land or pastureland that is physically located in a county that is rated by the U.S. Drought Monitor as having at least a D3 (extreme drought) intensity in any area of the county at any time during the normal grazing period for the specific type of grazing land or pastureland for the county.

        (d) To be eligible to receive a three month payment, that is a payment equal to three times the monthly feed cost as determined under paragraph (g) of this section, the eligible livestock producer must own or lease grazing land or pastureland that is physically located in a county that is rated by the U.S. Drought Monitor as having at least a D3 (extreme drought) intensity in any area of the county for at least 4 weeks during the normal grazing period for the specific type of grazing land or pastureland for the county, or is rated as having a D4 (exceptional drought) intensity in any area of the county at any time during the normal grazing period for the specific type of grazing land or pastureland for the county.

        (e) The monthly payment rate for LFP for grazing losses due to a qualifying drought, except as provided in paragraph (f) of this section, will be equal to 60 percent of the lesser of:

        (1) The monthly feed cost for all covered livestock owned or leased by the eligible livestock producer, as determined in paragraph (g) of this section or

        (2) The monthly feed cost calculated by using the normal carrying capacity of the eligible grazing land of the eligible livestock producer, as determined in paragraph (j) of this section.

        (f) In the case of an eligible livestock producer that sold or otherwise disposed of covered livestock due to a qualifying drought in 1 or both of the 2 production years immediately preceding the current production year, the payment rate is 80 percent of the monthly payment rate calculated in paragraph (e) of this section.

        (g) The monthly feed cost for covered livestock equals the product obtained by multiplying:

        (1) 30 days;

        (2) A payment quantity equal to the amount referred to in paragraph (h) of this section as the “feed grain equivalent”, as determined under paragraph (h) of this section; and

        (3) A payment rate equal to the corn price per pound, as determined in paragraph (i) of this section.

        (h) The feed grain equivalent equals, in the case of:

        (1) An adult beef cow, 15.7 pounds of corn per day or

        (2) In the case of any other type or weight of covered livestock, an amount determined by the Secretary that represents the average number of pounds of corn per day necessary to feed that specific type of livestock.

        (i) The corn price per pound equals the quotient obtained by dividing:

        (1) The higher of:

        (i) The national average corn price per bushel for the 12-month period immediately preceding March 1 of the calendar year for which LFP payment is calculated or

        (ii) The national average corn price per bushel for the 24-month period immediately preceding March 1 of the calendar year for which LFP payment is calculated

        (2) By 56.

        (j) The monthly feed cost using the normal carrying capacity of the eligible grazing land equals the product obtained by multiplying:

        (1) 30 days;

        (2) A payment quantity equal to the feed grain equivalent of 15.7 pounds of corn per day;

        (3) A payment rate equal to the corn price per pound, as determined in paragraph (i) of this section; and

        (4) The number of animal units the eligible livestock producer's grazing land or pastureland can sustain during the normal grazing period in the county for the specific type of grazing land or pastureland, in the absence of a drought or fire, determined by dividing the:

        (i) Number of eligible grazing land or pastureland acres of the specific type of grazing land or pastureland by

        (ii) The normal carrying capacity of the specific type of eligible grazing land or pastureland as determined under this subpart.

        (k) An eligible livestock producer will be eligible to receive payments for grazing losses due to a fire as specified in § 760.305(c):

        (1) For the period, subject to paragraph (l)(2) of this section:

        (i) Beginning on the date on which the Federal Agency prohibits the eligible livestock producer from using the managed rangeland for grazing and

        (ii) Ending on the earlier of the last day of the Federal lease of the eligible livestock producer or the day that would make the period a 180 day period and

        (2) For grazing losses that occur on not more than 180 days per calendar year.

        (3) For 50 percent of the monthly feed cost, as determined under § 760.308(g), pro-rated to a daily rate, for the total number of livestock covered by the Federal lease of the eligible livestock producer.

        § 760.401   Applicability.

#### § § 760.401

        (a) This subpart establishes the terms and conditions under which the Livestock Indemnity Program (LIP) will be administered under Titles XII and XV of the 2008 Farm Bill (Pub. L. 110-246).

        (b) Eligible livestock owners and contract growers will be compensated in accordance with § 760.406 for eligible livestock deaths in excess of normal mortality that occurred in the calendar year for which benefits are being requested as a direct result of an eligible adverse weather event. An “eligible adverse weather event” is one, as determined by the Secretary, occurring in the program year that could and did, even when normal preventative or corrective measures were taken and good farming practices were followed, directly result in the death of livestock. Because feed can be purchased or otherwise obtained in the event of a drought, drought is not an eligible adverse weather event except when anthrax, resulting from drought, causes the death of eligible livestock.

        (2) The third party is an independent source who is not affiliated with the farming operation such as a hired hand and is not a “family member,” defined as a person whom a member in the farming operation or their spouse is related as lineal ancestor, lineal descendant, sibling, spouse, and provides their telephone number, address, and a written statement containing specific details about:

        (i) Their knowledge of the livestock deaths;

        (ii) Their affiliation with the livestock owner;

        (iii) The accuracy of the deaths claimed by the livestock owner or contract grower including, but not limited to, the number and kind or type of the participant's livestock that died because of the eligible adverse weather event; and

        (iv) Other information required by FSA to determine the certification acceptable.

        (g) Data furnished by the participant and the third party will be used to determine eligibility for program benefits. Furnishing the data is voluntary; however, without all required data program benefits will not be approved or provided.

        § 760.406   Payment calculation.

#### § § 760.406

        (a) Under this subpart, separate payment rates for eligible livestock owners and eligible livestock contract growers are specified in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, respectively. Payments for LIP are calculated by multiplying the national payment rate for each livestock category by the number of eligible livestock in excess of normal mortality in each category that died as a result of an eligible adverse weather event. Normal mortality for each livestock category will be determined by FSA on a State-by-State basis using local data sources including, but not limited to, State livestock organizations and the Cooperative Extension Service for the State. Adjustments will be applied as specified in paragraph (d) of this section.

        (b) The LIP national payment rate for eligible livestock owners is based on 75 percent of the average fair market value of the applicable livestock as computed using nationwide prices for the previous calendar year unless some other price is approved by the Deputy Administrator.

        (c) The LIP national payment rate for eligible livestock contract growers is based on 75 percent of the average income loss sustained by the contract grower with respect to the dead livestock.

        (d) The LIP payment calculated for eligible livestock contract growers will be reduced by the amount the participant received from the party who contracted with the producer to raise the livestock for the loss of income from the dead livestock.

#### § § 760.506

        (a) Payment to an eligible orchardist or nursery tree grower for the cost of replanting or rehabilitating trees, bushes, or vines damaged or lost due to a natural disaster, in excess of 15 percent damage or mortality (adjusted for normal damage or mortality), will be calculated as follows:

        (1) For the cost of planting seedlings or cuttings, to replace lost trees, bushes, or vines, the lesser of:

        (i) 70 percent of the actual cost of the practice, or

        (ii) The amount calculated using rates established by the Deputy Administrator for the practice.

        (2) For the cost of pruning, removal, and other costs incurred for salvaging damaged trees, bushes, or vines, or in the case of mortality, to prepare the land to replant trees, bushes, or vines, the lesser of:

        (i) 50 percent of the actual cost of the practice, or

        (ii) The amount calculated using rates established by the Deputy Administrator for the practice.

        (b) An orchardist or nursery tree grower that did not plant the trees, bushes, or vines, but has a production history for commercial purposes on planted or existing trees and lost the trees, bushes, or vines as a result of a natural disaster, in excess of 15 percent damage or mortality (adjusted for normal damage or mortality), will be eligible for the salvage, pruning, and land preparation payment calculation as specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. To be eligible for the replanting payment calculation as specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the orchardist or nursery grower who did not plant the stock must be a new owner who meets all of the requirements of § 760.504(b) or be considered the owner of the trees under provisions appearing elsewhere in this subpart.

        (c) Eligible costs for payment calculation include costs for:

        (1) Seedlings or cuttings, for tree, bush, or vine replanting;

        (2) Site preparation and debris handling within normal horticultural practices for the type of stand being re-established, and necessary to ensure successful plant survival;

        (3) Pruning, removal, and other costs incurred to salvage damaged trees, bushes, or vines, or, in the case of tree mortality, to prepare the land to replant trees, bushes, or vines;

        (4) Chemicals and nutrients necessary for successful establishment;

        (5) Labor to plant seedlings or cuttings as determined reasonable by the county committee; and

        (6) Labor used to transplant existing seedlings established through natural regeneration into a productive tree stand.

        (d) The following costs are not eligible:

        (1) Costs for fencing, irrigation, irrigation equipment, protection of seedlings from wildlife, general improvements, re-establishing structures, and windscreens.

        (2) Any other costs not listed in paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(6) of this section, unless specifically determined eligible by the Deputy Administrator.

        (e) Producers must provide the county committee documentation of actual costs to complete the practices, such as receipts for labor costs, equipment rental, and purchases of seedlings or cuttings.

        (f) When lost stands are replanted, the types planted may be different from those originally planted. The alternative types will be eligible for payment if the new types have the same general end use, as determined and approved by the county committee. Payments for alternative types will be based on the lesser of rates established to plant the types actually lost or the cost to establish the alternative used. If the type of plantings, seedlings, or cuttings differs significantly from the types lost, the costs may not be approved for payment.

        (g) When lost stands are replanted, the types planted may be planted on the same farm in a different location than the lost stand. To be eligible for payment, site preparation costs for the new location must not exceed the cost to re-establish the original stand in the original location.

        (h) Eligible orchardists or nursery tree growers may elect not to replant the entire eligible stand. If so, the county committee will calculate payment based on the number of qualifying trees, bushes, or vines actually replanted.

        (i) If a practice, such as site preparation, is needed to both replant and rehabilitate trees, bushes, or vines, the producer must document the expenses attributable to replanting versus rehabilitation. The county committee will determine whether the documentation of expenses detailing the amounts attributable to replanting versus rehabilitation is acceptable. In the event that the county committee determines the documentation does not include acceptable detail of cost allocation, the county committee will pro-rate payment based on physical inspection of the loss, damage, replanting, and rehabilitation.

        (j) The cumulative total quantity of acres planted to trees, bushes, or vines for which a producer may receive payment under this part for losses that occurred between January 1, 2008, and September 30, 2011, will not exceed 500 acres.

        § 760.507   Obligations of a participant.

If the Adjusted Gross Revenue Plan of crop insurance was the only plan of insurance available for the crop in the county in the applicable crop year, insurance is considered not available for that crop. If an AGR plan or a pilot plan was the only plan available, producers are not required to purchase it to meet the risk management purchase requirement, but it will satisfy the risk management purchase requirement. In that case, the other ways to meet the requirement would be, if all the requirements of this subpart are met, a buy-in or NAP.

        means the original use for which a crop or a commodity is grown and produced.

        § 760.610   Participant eligibility.

#### § § 760.610

        (a) In addition to meeting the eligibility requirements of § 760.103, a participant must meet all of the following conditions:

        (1) All insurable crops on the participant's farm must be covered by crop insurance administered by RMA in accordance with FCIA, and all noninsured crops must be covered under NAP, as specified in § 760.104, unless the participant meets the requirements in either § 760.105 or § 760.107. At the discretion of FSA, the equitable relief provisions in § 760.106 may apply.

        (2) Crop losses must have occurred in crop year 2008 or subsequent crop years due to an eligible disaster event that occurred on or before September 30, 2011.

        (i) For insured crops, the coverage period, as defined in the insurance policy, must have begun on or before September 30, 2011;

        (ii) For NAP crops, the coverage period must have begun on or before September 30, 2011; and

        (iii) The final planting date for that crop according to the Federal crop insurance or NAP policy must have been on or before September 30, 2011.

        (3) A qualifying loss as defined in § 760.602 must have occurred.

        (4) The participant must have been in compliance with the Highly Erodible Land Conservation and Wetland Conservation provisions of part 12 of this title, for 2008 and subsequent crop years through September 30, 2011, as applicable, and must not otherwise be barred from receiving benefits or payments under part 12 of this title or any other law.

        (5) The participant must not be ineligible or otherwise barred from the requisite risk management insurance programs or NAP because of past violations where those insurance programs or NAP would otherwise be available absent such violations.

        (6) The participant must have an entitlement to an ownership share of the crop and also assume production and market risks associated with the production of the crop. In the event the crop was planted but not produced, participants must have an ownership share of the crop that would have been produced.

        (i) Any verbal or written contract that precludes the grower from having an ownership share renders the grower ineligible for payments under this subpart.

        (ii) Growers growing eligible crops under contract are not eligible participants under this subpart unless the grower has an ownership share of the crop.

        (b) In the event that a producer is determined not to be an eligible producer of a crop in accordance with this section, such crop will be disregarded in determining the producer's production or eligibility for payments under this subpart. However, any insurance, farm program, or NAP payments received by the producer on such crop will count as farm revenue if that producer is an eligible participant as a producer of other crops.

        (c) Participants may not receive payments with respect to volunteer stands of crops. Volunteer stands will not be considered in either the calculation of revenue or of the SURE guarantee.

        (d) A deceased applicant or an applicant that is a dissolved entity that suffered losses prior to the death or the dissolution that met all eligibility criteria prior to death or dissolution may be eligible for payments for such losses if an authorized representative signs the application for payment. Proof of authority to sign for the deceased participant or dissolved entity must be provided. If a participant is now a dissolved general partnership or joint venture, all members of the general partnership or joint venture at the time of dissolution or their duly authorized representatives must sign the application for payment. Eligibility of such participant will be determined, as it is for other participants, based upon ownership share and risk in producing the crop.

        (e) Participants receiving payments under the Emergency Assistance for Livestock, Honey Bees, and Farm-Raised Fish Program (ELAP) as specified in subpart C of this part are not eligible to receive payments under SURE for the same loss.

        (f) Participants with a farming interest in multiple counties who apply for SURE payment based on a Secretarial disaster designation must have a 10 percent loss of a crop of economic significance located in at least one disaster county, as defined in this subpart, to be eligible for SURE.

        § 760.611   Qualifying losses, eligible causes and types of loss.

#### § § 760.611

        (a) Eligible causes of loss are disasters which cause types of losses where the crop could not be planted or where crop production was adversely affected in quantity, quality, or both. A qualifying loss, as defined in this subpart, must be the result of a disaster.

        (b) A loss will not be considered a qualifying loss if any of the following apply:

        (1) The cause of the loss was not the result of disaster;

        (2) The cause of loss was due to poor management decisions or poor farming practices, as determined by the FSA county committee on a case-by-case basis;

        (3) The cause of loss was due to failure of the participant to re-seed or replant to the same crop in a county where it is customary to re-seed or replant after a loss before the final planting date;

        (4) The cause of loss was due to water contained or released by any governmental, public, or private dam or reservoir project if an easement exists on the acreage affected by the containment or release of the water;

        (5) The cause of loss was due to conditions or events occurring outside of the applicable crop year growing season; or

        (6) The cause of loss was due to a brownout.

        (c) The following types of loss, regardless of whether they were the result of a disaster, are not qualifying losses:

        (1) Losses to crops not intended for harvest in the applicable crop year;

        (2) Losses of by-products resulting from processing or harvesting a crop, such as, but not limited to, cotton seed, peanut shells, wheat or oat straw, or corn stalks or stovers;

        (3) Losses to home gardens; or to a crop subject to a de minimis election according to § 760.613;

        (4) Losses of crops that were grazed or, if prevented from being planted, had the intended use of grazing; or

        (5) Losses of first year seeding for forage production, or immature fruit crops.

        (d) The following losses of ornamental nursery stock are not a qualifying loss:

        (1) Losses caused by a failure of power supply or brownout as defined in § 760.602;

        (2) Losses caused by the inability to market nursery stock as a result of quarantine, boycott, or refusal of a buyer to accept production;

        (3) Losses caused by fires that are not the result of disaster;

        (4) Losses affecting crops where weeds and other forms of undergrowth in the vicinity of nursery stock have not been controlled; or

        (5) Losses caused by the collapse or failure of buildings or structures.

        (e) The following losses for honey, where the honey production by colonies or bees was diminished, are not a qualifying loss:

        (1) Losses caused by the unavailability of equipment or the collapse or failure of equipment or apparatus used in the honey operation;

        (2) Losses caused by improper storage of honey;

        (3) Losses caused by bee feeding;

        (4) Losses caused by the application of chemicals;

        (5) Losses caused by theft or fire not caused by a natural condition including, but not limited to, arson or vandalism;

        (6) Losses caused by the movement of bees by the participant or any other legal entity or person;

        (7) Losses caused by disease or pest infestation of the colonies, unless approved by the Secretary;

        (8) Losses of income from pollinators; or

        (9) Losses of equipment or facilities.

        § 760.613   De minimis exception.

#### § § 760.613

        (a) Participants seeking the de minimis exception to the risk management purchase requirements of this subpart, must certify:

        (1) That a specific crop on the farm is not a crop of economic significance on the farm; or

        (2) That the administrative fee required for the purchase of NAP coverage for a crop exceeds 10 percent of the value of that coverage.

        (b) To be eligible for a de minimis exception to the risk management purchase requirement in § 760.104, the participant must elect such exception at the same time the participant files the application for payment and the certification of interests, as specified in § 760.620, and specify the crop or crops for which the participant is requesting such exception.

        (c) FSA will not consider the value of any crop elected under paragraph (b) of this section in calculating both the SURE guarantee and the total farm revenue.

        (d) All provisions of this subpart apply in the event a participant does not obtain an exception according to this section.

        § 760.614   Lack of access.

#### § § 760.614

        In addition to other provisions for eligibility provided for in this part, the Deputy Administrator may provide assistance to participants who suffered 2008 production losses that meet the lack of access provisions in 19 U.S.C. 2497(g)(7)(F), where deemed appropriate, and consistent with the statutory provision. Such a determination to exercise that authority, and the terms on which to exercise that authority, will be considered to be a determination of general effect, not a “relief” determination, and will not be considered by the Farm Service Agency to be appealable administratively either within FSA or before the National Appeals Division.

        § 760.620   Time and method of application and certification of interests.

#### § § 760.620

        (a) Each producer interested in obtaining a SURE payment must file an application for payment and provide an accurate certification of interests. The application will be on a form prescribed by FSA and will require information or certifications from the producer regarding any other assistance, payment, or grant benefit the producer has received for any of the producer's crops or interests on a farm as defined in this subpart; regardless of whether the crop or interest is covered in the farm's SURE guarantee according to § 760.631. The producer's certification of interests will help FSA establish whether the producer is an eligible participant.

        (b) Eligible participants with a qualifying loss as defined in this subpart must submit an application for payment and certification of interests by March 1 of the calendar year that is two years after the relevant corresponding calendar year for the crop year which benefits are sought to be eligible for payment (for example, the final date to submit an application for a SURE payment for the 2009 crop year will be March 1, 2011). Producers who do not submit the application by that date will not be eligible for payment.

        (c) To the extent available and practicable, FSA will assist participants with information regarding their interests in a farm, as of the date of certification, based on information already available to FSA from various sources. However, the participant is solely responsible for providing an accurate certification from which FSA can determine the participant's farm interests for the purposes of this program. As determined appropriate by FSA, failure of a participant to provide an accurate certification of interests as part of the application may render the participant ineligible for any assistance under SURE.

        (d) To elect a de minimis exception to the risk management purchase requirement for a crop or crops, the participant must meet the requirements specified in § 760.613. When electing a de minimis exception, the participant must specify the crops for which the exception is requested and provide the certification and supporting documentation for that exception at the time the application and certification of interests is filed with FSA.

        § 760.621   Requirement to report acreage and production.

#### § § 760.621

        (a) As a condition of eligibility for payment under this subpart, participants must submit an accurate and timely report of all cropland, non-cropland, prevented planting, and subsequent crop acreage and production for the farm in all counties.

        (b) Acreage and production reports that have been submitted to FSA for NAP or to RMA for crop insurance purposes may satisfy the requirement of paragraph (a) of this section provided that the participant's certification of interests submitted as required by § 760.620 corresponds to the report requirements in paragraph (a) of this section, as determined by the FSA county committee.

        (c) Reports of production submitted for NAP or FCIA purposes must satisfy the requirements of NAP or FCIA, as applicable. In all other cases, in order for production reports or appraisals to be considered acceptable for SURE, production reports and appraisals must meet the requirements set forth in part 1437 of this title.

        (d) In any case where production reports or an appraisal is not acceptable, maximum loss provisions apply as specified in § 760.637.

        § 760.622   Incorrect or false producer production evidence.

#### § § 760.622

        (a) If production evidence, including but not limited to acreage and production reports, provided by a participant is false or incorrect, as determined by the FSA county committee at any time after an application for payment is made, the FSA county committee will determine whether:

        (1) The participant submitting the production evidence acted in good faith or took action to defeat the purposes of the program, such that the information provided was intentionally false or incorrect.

        (2) The same false, incorrect, or unacceptable production evidence was submitted for payment(s) under crop insurance or NAP, and if so, for NAP covered crops, make any NAP program adjustments according to § 1437.15 of this title.

        (b) If the FSA county committee determines that the production evidence submitted is false, incorrect, or unacceptable, and the participant who submitted the evidence did not act in good faith or took action to defeat the purposes of the program, the provisions of § 760.109, including a denial of future program benefits, will apply. The Deputy Administrator may take further action, including, but not limited to, making further payment reductions or requiring refunds or taking other legal action.

        (c) If the FSA county committee determines that the production evidence is false, incorrect, or unacceptable, but the participant who submitted the evidence acted in good faith, payment may be adjusted and a refund may be required.

        § 760.631   SURE guarantee calculation.

#### § § 760.631

        (a) Except as otherwise provided in this part, the SURE guarantee for a farm is the sum obtained by adding the dollar amounts calculated in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(3) of this section.

        (1) For each insurable crop on the farm except for value loss crops, 115 percent of the product obtained by multiplying together:

        (i) The price election. If a price election was not made or a participant is eligible as specified in §§ 760.105, 760.106, or 760.107, then the percentage of price will be 55 percent of the NAP established price;

        (ii) The payment acres determined according to § 760.632;

        (iii) The SURE yield as calculated according to § 760.638; and

        (iv) The coverage level elected by the participant. If a coverage level was not elected or a participant is eligible as specified in § 760.105, § 760.106, or § 760.107, a coverage level of 50 percent will be used in the calculation.

        (2) For each noninsurable crop on a farm except for value loss crops, 120 percent of the product obtained by multiplying:

        (i) 100 percent of the NAP established price for the crop;

        (ii) The payment acres determined according to § 760.632;

        (iii) The SURE yield calculated according to § 760.638; and

        (iv) 50 percent.

        (3) The guarantee for value loss crops as calculated according to § 760.634.

        (4) In the case of an insurable crop for which crop insurance provides for an adjustment in the guarantee liability, or indemnity, such as in the case of prevented planting, that adjustment will be used in determining the guarantee for the insurable crop.

        (5) In the case of a noninsurable crop for which NAP provides for an adjustment in the level of assistance, such as in the case of unharvested crops, that adjustment will be used for determining the guarantee for the noninsurable crop.

        (b) Those participants who are eligible according to § 760.105, § 760.106, or § 760.107 who do not have crop insurance or NAP coverage will have their SURE guarantee calculated based on catastrophic risk protection or NAP coverage available for those crops.

        (c) FSA will not include in the SURE guarantee the value of any crop that has a de minimis exception, according to § 760.613.

        (d) For crops where coverage may exist under both crop insurance and NAP, such as for pasture, rangeland, and forage, adjustments to the guarantee will be the product obtained by multiplying the county expected yield for that crop times:

        (1) 115 percent;

        (2) 100 percent of the NAP established price;

        (3) The payment acres determined according to § 760.632;

        (4) The SURE yield calculated according to § 760.638; and

        (5) The coverage level elected by the participant.

        (e) Participants who do not have a SURE yield as specified in § 760.638 will have a yield determined for them by the Deputy Administrator.

        (f) The SURE guarantee may not be greater than 90 percent of the sum of the expected revenue for each of the crops on a farm, as determined by the Deputy Administrator.

        § 760.632   Payment acres.

#### § § 760.632

        (a) Payment acres as calculated in this section are used in determining both total farm revenue and the SURE guarantee for a farm. Payment acreage will be calculated using the lesser of the reported or determined acres shown to have been planted or prevented from being planted to a crop.

        (b) Initial crop acreage will be the payment acreage for SURE, unless the provisions for subsequent crops in this section are met. Subsequently planted or prevented planted acre acreage is considered acreage for SURE only if the provisions of this section are met. All plantings of an annual or biennial crop are considered the same as a planting of an initial crop in tropical regions as defined in part 1437, subpart F, of this title.

        (c) In cases where there is double cropped acreage, each crop may be included in the acreage for SURE only if the specific crops are either insured crops eligible for double cropping according to RMA or approved by the FSA State committee as eligible double cropping practices in accordance with procedures approved by the Deputy Administrator.

        (d) Except for insured crops, participants with double cropped acreage not meeting the criteria in paragraph (c) of this section may have such acreage included in the acreage for SURE on more than one crop only if the participant submits verifiable records establishing a history of carrying out a successful double cropping practice on the specific crops for which payment is requested.

        (e) Participants having multiple plantings may have each planting included in the SURE guarantee only if the planting meets the requirements of part 1437 of this title and all other provisions of this subpart are satisfied.

        (f) Provisions of part 718 of this title specifying what is considered prevented planting and how it must be documented and reported will apply to this payment acreage for SURE.

        (g) Subject to the provisions of this subpart, the FSA county committee will:

        (1) Use the most accurate data available when determining planted and prevented planted acres; and

        (2) Disregard acreage of a crop produced on land that is not eligible for crop insurance or NAP.

        (h) For any crop acreage for which crop insurance or NAP coverage is canceled, those acres will no longer be considered the initial crop and will, therefore, no longer be eligible for SURE.

        (i) Notwithstanding any other provisions of these or other applicable regulations that relate to tolerance in part 718 of this title, if a farm has a crop that has both FSA and RMA acreage for insured crops, payment acres for the SURE guarantee calculation will be based on acres for which an indemnity was received if RMA acres do not differ from FSA acres by more than the larger of 5 percent or 10 acres not to exceed 50 acres. If the difference between FSA and RMA acres is more than the larger of 5 percent or 10 acres not to exceed 50 acres, then the payment acres for the SURE guarantee will be calculated using RMA acres. In that case, the participant will be notified of the discrepancy and that refunds of unearned payments may be required after FSA and RMA reconcile acreage data.

        § 760.633   2008 SURE guarantee calculation.

#### § § 760.633

        (a) For a participant who is eligible due to the 2008 buy-in waiver for risk management purchase under the provisions of § 760.105(c), the SURE guarantee for their farm for the 2008 crop will be calculated according to § 760.631, or according to § 760.634 for value loss crops, with the exception that the:

        (1) Price election in § 760.631(a)(1)(i) is 100 percent of the NAP established price for the crop;

        (2) Coverage level in § 760.631(a)(1)(iv) is 70 percent; and

        (3) The percent specified in § 760.631(a)(2)(iv) is 70 percent instead of 50 percent; and

        (4) Coverage level used in § 760.634(a)(1)(ii) is 70 percent; and

        (5) The percent specified in § 760.634(a)(2)(ii) is 70 percent instead of 50 percent.

        (b) For those 2008 crops that meet the requirements of §§ 760.104, 760.105(a), 760.106, or 760.107, the SURE guarantee will be the higher of:

        (1) The guarantee calculated according to § 760.631, or according to § 760.634 for value loss crops, with the exception that the percent specified in §§ 760.631(a)(1) and 760.634(a)(1) will be 120 percent instead of 115 percent;

        (2) The guarantee calculated according to § 760.631, or according to § 760.634 for value loss crops, will be used with the exception that the:

        (i) Price election in § 760.631(a)(1)(i) is 100 percent of the NAP established price for the crop; and

        (ii) Coverage level in §§ 760.631(a)(1)(iv) and 760.634(a)(1)(ii) will be 70 percent; and

        (iii) The percent specified in §§ 760.631(a)(2)(iv) and 760.634(a)(2)(ii) will be 70 percent instead of 50 percent.

        § 760.634   SURE guarantee for value loss crops.

#### § § 760.634

        (a) The SURE guarantee for value loss crops will be the sum of the amounts calculated in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise specified.

        (1) For each insurable crop on the farm, 115 percent of the product obtained by multiplying:

        (i) The value of inventory immediately prior to disaster, and

        (ii) The coverage level elected by the participant. If a coverage level was not elected or a participant is eligible as specified in §§ 760.106 or 760.107, a coverage level of 27.5 percent will be used in the calculation.

        (2) For each noninsurable crop on the farm, 120 percent of the product obtained by multiplying:

        (i) The value of inventory immediately prior to a disaster, and

        (ii) 50 percent.

        (b) Aquaculture participants who received assistance under the Aquaculture Grant Program (Pub. L. 111-5) will not be eligible for SURE assistance on those species for which a grant benefit was received under the Aquaculture Grant Program for feed losses associated with that species.

        (c) In the case of an insurable value loss crop for which crop insurance provides for an adjustment in the guarantee, liability, or indemnity, such as in the case of inventory exceeding peak inventory value, the adjustment will be used in determining the SURE guarantee for the insurable crop.

        (d) In the case of a noninsurable value loss crop for which NAP provides for an adjustment in the level of assistance, such as in the case of unharvested field grown inventory, the adjustment will be used in determining the SURE guarantee for the noninsurable crop.

        § 760.635   Total farm revenue.

#### § § 760.635

        (a) For the purpose of SURE payment calculation, total farm revenue will equal the sum obtained by adding the amounts calculated in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(12) of this section.

        (1) The estimated actual value for each crop produced on a farm, except for value loss crops, which equals the product obtained by multiplying:

        (i) The actual production of the payment acres for each crop on a farm for purposes of determining losses under FCIA or NAP; and

        (ii) NAMP, as calculated for the marketing year as specified in § 760.640 and as adjusted if required as specified in § 760.641.

        (2) The estimated actual value for each value loss crop produced on a farm that equals the value of inventory immediately after disaster.

        (3) 15 percent of the amount of any direct payments made to the participant under part 1412 of this title.

        (4) The total amount of any counter-cyclical and average crop revenue election payments made to the participant under part 1412 of this title.

        (5) The total amount of any loan deficiency payments, marketing loan gains, and marketing certificate gains made to the participant under parts 1421 and 1434 of this title.

        (6) The amount of payments for prevented planting.

        (7) The amount of crop insurance indemnities.

        (8) The amount of NAP payments received.

        (9) The value of any guaranteed payments made to a participant in lieu of production pursuant to an agreement or contract, if the crop is included in the SURE guarantee.

        (10) Salvage value for any crops salvaged.

        (11) The value of any other disaster assistance payments provided by the Federal Government for the same loss for which the eligible participant applied for SURE.

        (12) For crops for which the eligible participant received a waiver under the provisions of § 760.105(c) or obtained relief according to § 760.106, the value determined by FSA based on what the participant would have received, irrespective of any other provision, if NAP or crop insurance coverage had been obtained.

        (b) Sale of plant parts or by-products, such as straw, will not be counted as farm revenue.

        (c) For value loss crops:

        (1) Other inventory on hand or marketed at some time other than immediately prior to and immediately after the disaster event are irrelevant for revenue purposes and will not be counted as revenue for SURE.

        (2) Revenue will not be adjusted for market loss.

        (3) Quality losses will not be considered in determining revenue.

        (4) In no case will market price declines in value loss crops, due to any cause, be considered in the calculation of payments for those crops.

        § 760.636   Expected revenue.

#### § § 760.636

        The expected revenue for each crop on a farm is:

        (a) For each insurable crop, except value loss crops, the product obtained by multiplying:

        (1) The SURE yield as specified in § 760.638;

        (2) The payment acres as specified in § 760.632; and

        (3) 100 percent of the price for the crop used to calculate a crop insurance indemnity for an applicable policy of insurance if a crop insurance indemnity is triggered. If a price is not available, then the price is 100 percent of the NAP established price for the crop, and

        (b) For each noninsurable crop, except value loss crops, the product obtained by multiplying

        (1) The SURE yield as specified in § 760.638;

        (2) The payment acres as specified in § 760.632; and

        (3) 100 percent of the NAP price.

        (c) For each value loss crop, the value of inventory immediately prior to the disaster.

        § 760.637   Determination of production.

#### § § 760.637

        (a) Except for value loss crops, production for the purposes of this part includes all harvested, appraised, and assigned production for the payment acres determined according to § 760.632.

        (b) The FSA county committee will use the best available data to determine production, including RMA and NAP loss records and yields for insured and noninsured crops.

        (c) The production of any eligible crop harvested more than once in a crop year will include the total harvested production from all harvests.

        (d) Crop production losses occurring in tropical regions, as defined in part 1437, subpart F of this chapter, will be based on a crop year beginning on January 1 and ending on December 31 of the same calendar year. All crop harvests in tropical regions that take place between those dates will be considered a single crop.

        (e) Any record of an appraisal of crop production conducted by RMA or FSA through a certified loss adjustor will be used if available. Unharvested appraised production will be included in the calculation of revenue under SURE. If the unharvested appraised crop is subsequently harvested for the original intended use, the larger of the actual or appraised production will be used to determine payment.

        (1) If no appraisal is available, the participant is required to submit verifiable or reliable production evidence.

        (2) If the participant does not have verifiable or reliable production evidence, the FSA county committee will use the higher of the participant's crop certification or the maximum average loss level to determine the participant's crop production losses.

        (f) Production will be adjusted based on a whole grain equivalent, as established by FSA, for all crops with an intended use of grain, but harvested as silage, cobbage, or hay, cracked, rolled, or crimped.

        (g) For crops sold in a market that is not a recognized market for that crop and has no established county expected yield and NAMP, the quantity of such crops will not be considered production; rather, 100 percent of the salvage value will be included in the revenue calculation.

        (h) Production from different counties that is commingled on the farm before it was a matter of record and cannot be separated by using records or other means acceptable to FSA will have the NAMP prorated to each respective county by FSA. Commingled production may be attributed to the applicable county, if the participant made the location of production of a crop a matter of record before commingling, if the participant does either of the following:

        (1) Provides copies of verifiable documents showing that production of the crop was purchased, acquired, or otherwise obtained from the farm in that county; or

        (2) Had the farm's production in that county measured in a manner acceptable to the FSA county committee.

        (i) The FSA county committee will assign production for the purpose of NAMP for the farm if the FSA county committee determines that the participant failed to provide verifiable or reliable production records.

        (j) If RMA loss records are not available, or if the FSA county committee determines that the RMA loss records as reported by the insured participant appear to be questionable or incomplete, or if the FSA county committee makes inquiry, then participants are responsible for:

        (1) Retaining and providing, when required, the best available verifiable and reliable production records available for the crops;

        (2) Summarizing all the production evidence;

        (3) Accounting for the total amount of production for the crop on a farm, whether or not records reflect this production;

        (4) Providing the information in a manner that can be easily understood by the FSA county committee; and

        (5) Providing supporting documentation if the FSA county committee has reason to question the disaster event or that all production has been taken into account.

        (k) The participant must supply verifiable or reliable production records to substantiate production to the FSA county committee. If the eligible crop was sold or otherwise disposed of through commercial channels, acceptable production records include: Commercial receipts; settlement sheets; warehouse ledger sheets or load summaries; or appraisal information from a loss adjuster acceptable to FSA. If the eligible crop was farm-stored, sold, fed to livestock, or disposed of by means other than commercial channels, acceptable production records for these purposes include: Truck scale tickets; appraisal information from a loss adjuster acceptable to FSA; contemporaneous reliable diaries; or other documentary evidence, such as contemporaneous reliable measurements. Determinations of reliability with respect to this paragraph will take into account, as appropriate, the ability of the agency to verify the evidence as well as the similarity of the evidence to reports or data received by FSA for the crop or similar crops. Other factors deemed relevant may also be taken into account.

        (l) If no verifiable or reliable production records are available, the FSA county committee will use the higher of the participant's certification or the maximum average loss level to determine production.

        (m) Participants must provide all records for any production of a crop that is grown with an arrangement, agreement, or contract for guaranteed payment.

        (n) FSA may verify the production evidence submitted with records on file at the warehouse, gin, or other entity that received or may have received the reported production.

        § 760.638   Determination of SURE yield.

#### § § 760.638

        (a) Except for value loss crops as specified in § 760.634, a SURE yield will be determined for each crop, type, and intended use on a farm, using the higher of the participant's weighted:

        (1) Adjusted actual production history yield as determined in paragraph (b) of this section; or

        (2) Counter-cyclical yield as determined in paragraph (c) of this section.

        (b) The adjusted actual production history yield, as defined in § 760.602, will be weighted by the applicable crop year total planted and prevented planted acres, by crop, type, and intended use for each county. RMA data will be used for calculating the SURE yield for insured crops.

        (c) The counter-cyclical yield for a crop on a SURE farm will be weighted in such manner as FSA deems fit taking into account a desire for a consistent system and FSA's ability to make timely yield determinations.

        (d) Participants who do not purchase crop insurance or NAP coverage, but who are otherwise eligible for payment, will have a SURE yield determined by the FSA county committee as follows:

        (1) A weighted yield, based on planted and prevented planted acres, the location county, crop type, and intended use, will be determined at 65 percent of the county expected yield for each crop.

        (2) The SURE yield will be the higher of the yield calculated using the method in paragraph (d)(1) of this section or 65 percent of the weighted counter-cyclical yield as determined in paragraph (c) of this section.

        (e) For those participants with crop insurance but without an adjusted actual production history yield, a SURE yield will be determined by the applicable FSA county committee. This paragraph will apply in the case where the insurance policy does not require an actual production history yield, or where a participant has no production history.

> [74 FR 68490, Dec. 28, 2009, as amended at 75 FR 19189, Apr. 14, 2010]

        § 760.640   National average market price.

#### § § 760.640

        (a) The Deputy Administrator will establish the National Average Market Price (NAMP) using the best sources available, as determined by the Deputy Administrator, which may include, but are not limited to, data from NASS, Cooperative Extension Service, Agricultural Marketing Service, crop insurance, and NAP.

        (b) NAMP may be adjusted by the FSA State committee, in accordance with instructions issued by the Deputy Administrator and as specified in § 760.641, to recognize average quality loss factors that are reflected in the market by county or part of a county.

        (c) With respect to a crop for which an eligible participant on a farm receives assistance under NAP, the NAMP will not exceed the price of the crop established under NAP.

        (d) To the extent practicable, the NAMP will be established on a harvested basis without the inclusion of transportation, storage, processing, marketing, or other post-harvest expenses, as determined by FSA.

        (e) NAMP may be adjusted by the FSA State committee, as authorized by The Deputy Administrator, to reflect regional variations in price consistent with those prices established under the FCIA or NAP.

        § 760.641   Adjustments made to NAMP to reflect loss of quality.

#### § § 760.641

        (a) The Deputy Administrator will authorize FSA county committees, with FSA State committee concurrence, to adjust NAMP for a county or part of a county:

        (1) To reflect the average quality discounts applied to the local or regional market price of a crop due to a reduction in the intrinsic characteristics of the production resulting from adverse weather, as determined annually by the State office of the FSA; or

        (2) To account for a crop for which the value is reduced due to excess moisture resulting from a disaster related condition.

        (3) For adjustments specified in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section, an adjustment factor that represents the regional or local price received for the crop in the county will be calculated by the FSA State committee. The adjustment factor will be based on the average actual market price compared to NAMP.

        (b) For adjustments made under paragraph (a) of this section, participants must provide verifiable evidence of actual or appraised production, clearly indicating an average loss of value caused by poor quality or excessive moisture that meets or exceeds the quality adjustment for the county or part of a county established in paragraph (a)(3) of this section to be eligible to receive the quality-adjusted NAMP as part of their SURE payment calculation. In order to be considered at all for the purpose of quality adjustments, the verifiable evidence of production must itself detail the extent of the quality loss for a specific quantity. With regard to test evidence, in addition to meeting all the requirements of this section, tests must have been completed by January 1 of the year following harvest.

        § 760.650   Calculating SURE.

#### § § 760.650

        (a) Subject to the provision of this subpart, SURE payments for crop losses in crop year 2008 and subsequent crop years will be calculated as the amount equal to 60 percent of the difference between:

        (1) The SURE guarantee, as specified in § 760.631, § 760.633 or § 760.634 of this subpart, and

        (2) The total farm revenue, as specified in § 760.635.

        (b) In addition to the other provisions of this subpart and subpart B of this part, SURE payments may be adjusted downward as necessary to insure compliance with the payment limitations in subpart B and to insure that payments do not exceed the maximum amount specified in § 760.108(a)(1) or (b)(1) or otherwise exceed the perceived intent of 19 U.S.C. 2497(j). Such adjustments can include, but are not limited to, adjustments to insure that there is no duplication of benefits as specified in § 760.108(c).

      Subpart H—Crop Assistance Program

**Authority:** Authority: 7 U.S.C. 612c.

**Source:** Source: 75 FR 65428, Oct. 25, 2010, unless otherwise noted.

        § 760.701   Applicability.

#### § § 760.701

        (a) This subpart specifies the eligibility requirements and payment calculations for the Crop Assistance Program (CAP), which will be administered using funds authorized by Section 32 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1935 (7 U.S.C. 612c, as amended).

        (b) CAP, within the limits of the funds made available by the Secretary for this program, is intended to help reestablish purchasing power to producers of long grain rice, medium or short grain rice, upland cotton, soybeans, and sweet potatoes who suffered a five percent or greater loss in the 2009 crop year due to disaster.

        (c) Only producers who have a share in a farm located in a disaster county (a county that is the primary county that is the subject of a Secretarial disaster designation for 2009 crop year due to excessive moisture and related conditions, as determined by FSA) are eligible for CAP benefits.

        § 760.702   Definitions.

#### § § 760.702

        The following definitions apply to CAP. The definitions in parts 718, 760, and 1400 of this title also apply, except where they conflict with the definitions in this section.

        means verifiable or reliable production records deemed acceptable by FSA.

        means the CAP application form.

        means the 45-day period established by the Deputy Administrator for producers on farms in disaster counties to apply for CAP that ends December 9, 2010.

        means the amount of production per acre, computed in accordance with FCIC's Actual Production History (APH) Program at part 400, subpart G of this title or, for crops not included under part 400, subpart G of this title, the yield used to determine the guarantee. For crops covered under NAP, the approved yield is established according to part 1437 of this title.

        means acreage approved as prevented planted or failed in accordance with § 718.103 of this chapter.

        means the reported or determined 2009 crop year planted and considered planted acres of long grain rice, medium or short grain rice, upland cotton, soybean, or sweet potatoes as reflected on 2009 crop year form FSA-578, Report of Acreage, for a producer in a disaster county as of October 22, 2010. Subsequent crops, replacement crops, reseeded crops, and replanted crops are not eligible crops under this part and no revision of the Report of Acreage that would increase an eligibility for payment will be permitted to produce that effect.

        means for 2009:

        (1) For insurable crops, the crop year as defined according to the applicable crop insurance policy;

        (2) For NAP covered crops, the crop year as provided in part 1437 of this title.

        means excessive moisture or related condition, resulting from any of the following: flood, flash flooding, excessive rain, moisture, humidity, severe storms, thunderstorms, ground saturation or standing water, hail, winter storms, ice storms, snow, blizzard, hurricane, typhoons, tropical storms, and cold wet weather. A disaster does not include brownouts or power failures.

        means a county included in the geographic area covered by a qualifying natural disaster designation under section 321(a) of the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act (7 U.S.C. 1961(a)). For CAP, the term “disaster county” is limited to those primary counties declared a disaster by the Secretary for excessive moisture or a related condition, which are limited to designations based on any of the following: flood, flash flooding, excessive rain, moisture, humidity, severe storms, thunderstorms, ground saturation or standing water, hail, winter storms, ice storms, snow, blizzard, hurricane, typhoons, tropical storms, and cold wet weather.

        means, for a producer on a farm who attempts to determine what the producer might produce for an eligible crop on a farm, the historic yield multiplied by the producer's share of planted and considered planted acres of the crop for the farm. _Expected production_ may be used to assist producers in determining whether the producer has a crop or crops that suffered a qualifying loss of five percent and to determine whether that crop is eligible for CAP benefits.

        means, for a producer on a farm, the higher of the county average yield or the producer's approved yields for eligible crops on the farm.

        (1) An insured producer's yield will be the higher of the county average yield listed or the approved federal crop insurance APH, for the disaster year.

        (2) A NAP producer's yield will be the higher of the county average yield or NAP approved yield for the disaster year.

        means the planting or approved prevented planting of any crop for harvest following the failed planting or prevented planting of a crop of long grain rice, medium or short grain rice, upland cotton, soybeans, or sweet potatoes not in a recognized double-cropping sequence. _Replacement crop_s are not eligible for CAP.

        means the second planting of a crop of long grain rice, medium or short grain rice, upland cotton, soybeans, or sweet potatoes on the same acreage after the first planting of that same crop that failed.

        § 760.703   Producer eligibility requirements.

#### § § 760.703

        (a) A producer must meet all of the requirements in this subpart to be eligible for a CAP payment.

        (b) To be eligible, a producer must be an individual or entity who is entitled to an ownership share of an eligible crop and who has the production and market risks associated with the agricultural production of the crop on a farm. An eligible producer must be a:

        (1) Citizen of the United States;

        (2) Resident alien, which for purposes of this subpart means “lawful alien” as defined in 7 CFR part 1400;

        (3) Partnership of citizens of the United States; or

        (4) Corporation, limited liability corporation, or other farm organizational structure organized under State law.

        (c) To be eligible, a producer must have:

        (1) Produced a 2009 crop year planted or considered planted long grain rice, medium or short grain rice, upland cotton, soybean, or sweet potato crop in a 2009 eligible disaster county, and

        (2) Suffered a five percent or greater loss in an eligible disaster county in 2009. A list of the disaster counties for CAP is available on the FSA Web site and at FSA county offices.

        § 760.704   Time and method of application.

#### § § 760.704

        (a) To request a CAP payment, the producer must submit a CAP application on the form designated by FSA to the FSA county office responsible for administration of the farm.

        (b) Producers submitting an application for a crop must certify that they suffered a five percent or greater loss of the crop on the farm in a disaster county and that they have documentation to support that certification as required in § 760.713.

        (c) Once submitted by a producer, the application is considered to contain information and certifications of and pertaining to the producer's crop and farm regardless of who entered the information on the application.

        (d) Producers requesting benefits under CAP must certify the accuracy and truthfulness of the information provided in the application as well as with any documentation that may be provided with the application or documentation that will be provided to FSA in substantiation of the application. All certifications and information are subject to verification by FSA.

        (e) Producers applying for CAP must certify that they have an eligible ownership share interest in the 2009 crop acreage that sustained a five percent or greater loss. The determination and certification by a producer that a crop suffered the requisite five percent or greater farm crop loss is the expected quantity of production of the crop less the actual production of the crop.

        (f) In the event that the producer does not submit documentation in response to any request of FSA to support the producer's application or documentation furnished does not show a crop loss of at least five percent as claimed, the application for that crop will be disapproved in its entirety. For quantity losses, producers need to apply a standard similar to the historic yield provisions used under previous ad hoc disaster programs. Those provisions provided that a historic yield was the higher of a county average yield or a producer's approved yield. Thus, if an applicant is determining whether a farm has a crop that suffered a loss of five percent or greater on the farm's planted and considered planted acreage, the applicant could compare the amount successfully produced in 2009 from those planted and considered planted acres to what the participant expected to produce from that acreage using either the county average yield (which may be obtained from FSA by request) or based on analysis of approved actual production history yields that may exist for producers of the crop on the farm.

        (g) Unless otherwise determined necessary by FSA, producers will not be required to submit documentation of farm crop production or loss at time of application. FSA's decision not to require proof, documentation, or evidence in support of any application at time of application is not to be construed as a determination of a producer's eligibility.

        (h) Producers who apply are required to retain documentation in support of their application for three years after the date of application in accordance with § 760.713.

        (i) The application submitted in accordance with this section is not considered valid and complete for issuance of payment under this part unless FSA determines all the applicable eligibility provisions have been satisfied and the producer has submitted all the required forms. In addition to the completed, certified application form, if the information for the following forms or certifications is not on file in the FSA county office or is not current for 2009, the producer must also submit:

        (1) Farm operating plan for individual or legal entity;

        (2) Average adjusted gross income statement for 2009; and

        (3) Highly erodible land conservation (HELC) and wetland conservation certification.

        (j) Application approval and payment by FSA does not relieve a producer from having to submit any form, records, or documentation required, but not filed at the time of application or payment, according to paragraph (h) of this section.

        § 760.705   Payment rates and calculation of payments.

#### § § 760.705

        (a) CAP payments will be calculated by multiplying the total number of reported or determined acres of an eligible crop by the per acre payment rate for that crop. Payment rates are as follows:

        (1) Long grain rice, $31.93 per acre;

        (2) Medium or short grain rice, $52.46 per acre;

        (3) Upland cotton, $17.70 per acre;

        (4) Soybeans, $15.62 per acre; and

        (5) Sweet potatoes, $155.41 per acre.

        (b) Payments will be calculated based on the 2009 crop year reported or determined planted or considered planted acres of an eligible crop on a farm in a disaster county as reflected on a form FSA-578, Report of Acreage, on file in FSA as of October 22, 2010.

        § 760.706   Availability of funds.

#### § § 760.706

        (a) Payments specified in this subpart are subject to the availability of funds. The total available program funds are $550 million. In order to keep payments within available funds, the Deputy Administrator may pro-rate payments, to the extent the Deputy Administrator determines that necessary.

        (b) Funds for CAP are being made available only for the 2009 crop year reported and determined eligible crop acreage in disaster counties as reflected on a form FSA-578, Report of Acreage, as of October 22, 2010.

        § 760.707   Proof of loss.

#### § § 760.707

        (a) All certifications, applications, and documentation are subject to spot check and verification by FSA. Producers must submit documentation to FSA if and when FSA requests documentation to substantiate any certified application.

        (b) Producers are responsible for retaining or providing, when required, verifiable or reliable production or loss records available for the crop. Producers are also responsible for summarizing all the production or loss evidence and providing the information in a manner that can be understood by the county committee.

        (c) Any producer receiving payment under this subpart agrees to maintain any books, records, and accounts supporting any information or certification made according to this part for 3 years after the end of the year following application.

        (d) Producers receiving payments or any other person who furnishes such information to FSA must permit FSA or authorized representatives of USDA and the General Accounting Office during regular business hours to inspect, examine, and to allow such persons to make copies of such books, records or other items for the purpose of confirming the accuracy of the information provided by the producer.

        § 760.708   Miscellaneous provisions and limitations.

#### § § 760.708

        (a) A person ineligible under § 1437.15(c) of this title concerning violations of the Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance Program for the 2009 crop year is ineligible for benefits under this subpart.

        (b) A person ineligible under § 400.458 of this title for the 2009 crop year concerning violations of crop insurance regulations is ineligible for CAP.

        (c) In the event that any request for CAP payment resulted from erroneous information or a miscalculation, the payment will be recalculated and the producer must refund any excess to FSA with interest to be calculated from the date of the disbursement to the producer. If for whatever reason the producer signing a CAP application overstates the loss level of the crop when the actual loss level determined by FSA for the crop is less than the level claimed, or where the CAP payment would exceed the producer's actual loss, the application will be disapproved for the crop and the full CAP payment for that crop will be required to be refunded with interest from date of disbursement. The CAP payment cannot exceed the producer's actual loss.

        (d) The liability of anyone for any penalty or sanction under or in connection with this subpart, or for any refund to FSA or related charge is in addition to any other liability of such person under any civil or criminal fraud statute or any other provision of law including, but not limited to: 18 U.S.C. 286, 287, 371, 641, 651, 1001, and 1014; 15 U.S.C. 714; and 31 U.S.C. 3729.

        (e) The regulations in parts 11 and 780 of this title apply to determinations under this subpart.

        (f) Any payment to any person under this subpart will be made without regard to questions of title under State law and without regard to any claim or lien against the crop, or its proceeds.

        (g) Any payment made under this subpart will be considered farm revenue for 2009 for the Supplemental Revenue Assistance Payments Program.

        (h) The average AGI limitation provisions in part 1400 of this title relating to limits on payments for persons or legal entities, excluding joint ventures and general partnerships, with certain levels of average adjusted gross income (AGI) apply to each applicant for CAP. Specifically, a person or legal entity with an average adjusted gross nonfarm income, as defined in § 1404.3 of this title, that exceeds $500,000 is not eligible to receive CAP payments.

        (i) No person or legal entity, excluding a joint venture or general partnership, as determined by the rules in part 1400 of this title may receive, directly or indirectly, more than $100,000 in payments under this subpart.

        (j) The direct attribution provisions in part 1400 of this title apply to CAP. Under those rules, any payment to any legal entity will also be considered for payment limitation purposes to be a payment to persons or legal entities with an interest in the legal entity or in a sub-entity. If any such interested person or legal entity is over the payment limitation because of direct payment or their indirect interests or a combination thereof, then the payment to the actual payee will be reduced commensurate with the amount of the interest of the interested person in the payee. Likewise, by the same method, if anyone with a direct or indirect interest in a legal entity or sub-entity of a payee entity exceeds the AGI levels that would allow a producer to directly receive a CAP payment, then the payment to the actual payee will be reduced commensurately with that interest. For CAP, unless otherwise specified in part 1400 of this title, the AGI amount will be that person's or legal entity's average AGI for the three taxable years that precede the 2008 taxable year (that is 2005, 2006, and 2007).

        (k) For the purposes of the effect of lien on eligibility for Federal programs (28 U.S.C. 3201(e)), FSA waives the restriction on receipt of funds under CAP but only as to beneficiaries who, as a condition of such waiver, agree to apply the CAP payments to reduce the amount of the judgment lien.

        (l) For CAP, producers are either eligible or ineligible. Therefore, the provisions of § 718.304 of this chapter, “Failure to Fully Comply,” do not apply to this subpart.

        (m) The regulations in subpart B apply to CAP. In addition to those regulations that specifically include subpart H or apply to this part, the following sections specifically apply to this subpart: §§ 760.113(a), 760.114, and 760.116(a).

        (c) The participant requesting benefits under this program certifies the accuracy and truthfulness of the information provided in the application as well as any documentation filed with or in support of the application. All information is subject to verification by FSA. For example, as specified in § 760.818(f), the participant may be required to provide documentation to substantiate and validate quality standards and marketing contract prices. Refusal to allow FSA or any agency of the Department of Agriculture to verify any information provided will result in the participant's forfeiting eligibility under this program. Furnishing required information is voluntary; however without it, FSA is under no obligation to act on the application or approve benefits. Providing a false certification to the government is punishable by imprisonment, fines, and other penalties.

        (d) FSA may require the participant to submit any additional information it deems necessary to implement or determine any eligibility provision of this part. For example, as specified in § 760.818(f), the participant may be required to provide documentation to substantiate and validate quality standards and marketing contract prices.

        (e) The application submitted in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section is not considered valid and complete for issuance of payment under this part unless FSA determines all the applicable eligibility provisions have been satisfied and the participant has submitted all of following completed forms:

        (1) If Item 16 on FSA-840 is answered “YES,” FSA-840M, Crop Disaster Program for Multiple Crop—Same Acreage Certification;

        (2) CCC-502, Farm Operating Plan for Payment Eligibility;

        (3) CCC-526, Payment Eligibility Average Adjusted Gross Income Certification;

        (4) AD-1026, Highly Erodible Land Conservation (HELC) and Wetland Conservation Certification; and

        (5) FSA-578, Report of Acreage.

        (f) Application approval and payment by FSA does not relieve a participant from having to submit any form required, but not filed, according to paragraph (e) of this section.

        § 760.805   Limitations on payments and other benefits.

#### § § 760.805

        (a) A participant may receive benefits for crop losses for only one of the 2005, 2006, or 2007 crop years as specified under this part.

        (b) Payments will not be made under this part for grazing losses.

        (c) Payments determined to be issued are considered due and payable not later than 60 days after a participant's application is completed with all information necessary for FSA to determine producer eligibility for benefits.

        (d) FSA may divide and classify crops based on loss susceptibility, yield, and other factors.

        (e) No person, as defined by part 1400 subpart B of this title, may receive more than a total of $80,000 in disaster benefits under this part. In applying the $80,000 per person payment limitation, regardless of whether 2005, 2006, or 2007 crop year benefits are at issue or sought, the most restrictive “person” determination for the participant in the years 2005, 2006, and 2007, will be used to limit benefits.

        (f) No participant may receive disaster benefits under this part in an amount that exceeds 95 percent of the value of the expected production for the relevant period as determined by FSA. Accordingly, the sum of the value of the crop not lost, if any; the disaster payment received under this part; and any crop insurance payment or payments received under the NAP for losses to the same crop, cannot exceed 95 percent of what the crop's value would have been if there had been no loss.

        (g) An individual or entity whose adjusted gross income is in excess of $2.5 million, as defined by and determined under part 1400 subpart G of this title, is not eligible to receive disaster benefits under this part.

        (h) Any participant in a county eligible for either of the following programs must complete a duplicate benefits certification. If the participant received a payment authorized by either of the following, the amount of that payment will be reduced from the calculated 2005-2007 CDP payment:

        (1) The Hurricane Indemnity Program (subpart B of this part);

        (2) The Hurricane Disaster Programs (subparts D, E, F, and G of part 1416 of this title);

        (3) The 2005 Louisiana Sugarcane Hurricane Disaster Assistance Program; or

        (4) The 2005 Crop Florida Sugarcane Disaster Program.

        § 760.806   Crop eligibility requirements.

#### § § 760.806

        (a) A participant on a farm is eligible for assistance under this section with respect to losses to an insurable commodity or NAP if the participant:

        (1) In the case of an insurable commodity, obtained a policy or plan of insurance under the Federal Crop Insurance Act for the crop incurring the losses; or

        (2) In the case of a NAP covered crop, filed the required paperwork and paid the administrative fee by the applicable filing deadline, for the noninsurable commodity under section 196 of the Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996 for the crop incurring the losses.

        (b) The reasons a participant either elected not to have coverage or did not have coverage mentioned in paragraphs (a)(1) or (2) of this section are not relevant to the determination of the participant's ineligibility under this section. In addition, such reasons for not having crop insurance coverage have no bearing for consideration under part 718, subpart D of this chapter.

        § 760.807   Miscellaneous provisions.

#### § § 760.807

        (a) A person is not eligible to receive disaster assistance under this part if it is determined by FSA that the person has:

        (1) Adopted any scheme or other device that tends to defeat the purpose of this part;

        (2) Made any fraudulent representation;

        (3) Misrepresented any fact affecting a program determination;

        (4) Is ineligible under § 1400.5 of this title; or

        (5) Does not have entitlement to an ownership share of the crop.

        (i) Growers growing eligible crops under contract for crop owners are not eligible unless the grower can be determined to have a share of the crop.

        (ii) Any verbal or written contract that precludes the grower from having an ownership share renders the grower ineligible for benefits under this part.

        (b) A person ineligible under § 1437.15(c) of this title for any year is likewise ineligible for benefits under this part for that year or years.

        (c) A person ineligible under § 400.458 of this title for any year is likewise ineligible for benefits under this part for that year or years.

        (d) All persons with a financial interest in the operation receiving benefits under this part are jointly and severally liable for any refund, including related charges, which is determined to be due FSA for any reason.

        (e) In the event that any request for assistance or payment under this part resulted from erroneous information or a miscalculation, the assistance or payment will be recalculated and any excess refunded to FSA with interest to be calculated from the date of the disbursement to the producer.

        (f) The liability of anyone for any penalty or sanction under or in connection with this part, or for any refund to FSA or related charge is in addition to any other liability of such person under any civil or criminal fraud statute or any other provision of law including, but not limited to: 18 U.S.C. 286, 287, 371, 641, 651, 1001, and 1014; 15 U.S.C. 714; and 31 U.S.C. 3729.

        (g) The regulations in parts 11 and 780 of this title apply to determinations under this part.

        (h) Any payment to any person will be made without regard to questions of title under State law and without regard to any claim or lien against the crop, or its proceeds.

        (i) For the purposes of the effect of lien on eligibility for Federal programs (28 U.S.C. 3201(e)), FSA waives the restriction on receipt of funds or benefits under this program but only as to beneficiaries who, as a condition of such waiver, agree to apply the benefits received under this part to reduce the amount of the judgment lien.

        (j) Under this program, participants are either eligible or ineligible. Participants in general, do not render performance or need to comply. They either suffered eligible losses or they did not. Accordingly, the provisions of § 718.304 of this chapter do not apply to this part.

        § 760.808   General provisions.

#### § § 760.808

        (a) For calculations of loss, the participant's existing unit structure will be used as the basis for the calculation established in accordance with:

        (1) For insured crops, part 457 of this title; or

        (2) For NAP covered crops, part 1437 of this title.

        (b) County average yield for loss calculations will be the average of the 2001 through 2005 official county yields established by FSA, excluding the years with the highest and lowest yields, respectively.

        (c) County committees will assign production or reduce the historic yield when the county committee determines:

        (1) An acceptable appraisal or record of harvested production does not exist;

        (2) The loss is due to an ineligible cause of loss or practices, soil type, climate, or other environmental factors that cause lower yields than those upon which the historic yield is based;

        (3) The participant has a contract providing a guaranteed payment for all or a portion of the crop; or

        (4) The crop was planted beyond the normal planting period for the crop.

        (d) The county committee will establish a maximum average loss level that reflects the amount of production producers would have produced if not for the eligible damaging weather or related conditions in the area or county for the same crop. The maximum average loss level for the county will be expressed as either a percent of loss or yield per acre. The maximum average loss level will apply when:

        (1) Unharvested acreage has not been appraised by FSA, or a company reinsured by FCIC; or

        (2) Acceptable production records for harvested acres are not available from any source.

        (e) Assignment of production or reduction in yield will apply for practices that result in lower yields than those for which the historic yield is based.

        § 760.809   Eligible damaging conditions.

#### § § 760.809

        (a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, to be eligible for benefits under this part the loss of the crop, or reduction in quality, or prevented planting must be due to damaging weather or related conditions as defined in § 760.802.

        (b) Benefits are not available under this part for any losses in quantity or quality, or prevented planting due to:

        (1) Poor farming practices;

        (2) Poor management decisions; or

        (3) Drifting herbicides.

        (c) With the exception of paragraph (d) of this section, in all cases, the eligible damaging condition must have directly impacted the specific crop or crop acreage during its planting or growing period.

        (d) If FSA has determined that there has been an eligible loss of surface irrigation water due to drought and such loss of surface irrigation water impacts eligible crop acreage, FSA may approve assistance to the extent permitted by section 760.814.

        § 760.810   Qualifying 2005, 2006, or 2007 quantity crop losses.

#### § § 760.810

        (a) To receive benefits under this part, the county committee must determine that because of eligible damaging weather or related condition specifically impacting the crop or crop acreage, the participant with respect to the 2005, 2006, or 2007 crop:

        (1) Was prevented from planting a crop;

        (2) Sustained a loss in excess of 35 percent of the expected production of a crop; or

        (3) Sustained a loss in excess of 35 percent of the value for value loss crops.

        (b) Qualifying losses under this part do not include losses:

        (1) For the 2007 crop, those acres planted, or in the case of prevented planting, would have been planted, on or after February 28, 2007;

        (2) That are determined by FSA to be the result of poor management decisions, poor farming practices, or drifting herbicides;

        (3) That are the result of the failure of the participant to re-seed or replant the same crop in the county where it is customary to re-seed or replant after a loss;

        (4) That are not as a result of a damaging weather or a weather related condition specifically impacting the crop or crop acreage;

        (5) To crops not intended for harvest in crop year 2005, 2006, or 2007;

        (6) Of by-products resulting from processing or harvesting a crop, such as cottonseed, peanut shells, wheat, or oat straw;

        (7) To home gardens;

        (8) That are a result of water contained or released by any governmental, public, or private dam or reservoir project if an easement exists on the acreage affected for the containment or release of the water; or

        (9) If losses could be attributed to conditions occurring outside of the applicable crop year growing season.

        (c) Qualifying losses under this part for nursery stock will not include losses:

        (1) For the 2007 crop, that nursery inventory acquired on or after February 28, 2007;

        (2) Caused by a failure of power supply or brownouts;

        (3) Caused by the inability to market nursery stock as a result of lack of compliance with State and local commercial ordinances and laws, quarantine, boycott, or refusal of a buyer to accept production;

        (4) Caused by fire unless directly related to an eligible natural disaster;

        (5) Affecting crops where weeds and other forms of undergrowth in the vicinity of the nursery stock have not been controlled; or

        (6) Caused by the collapse or failure of buildings or structures.

        (d) Qualifying losses under this part for honey, where the honey production by colonies or bees was diminished, will not include losses:

        (1) For the 2007 crop, for production from those bees acquired on or after February 28, 2007;

        (2) Where the inability to extract was due to the unavailability of equipment, the collapse or failure of equipment, or apparatus used in the honey operation;

        (3) Resulting from storage of honey after harvest;

        (4) To honey production because of bee feeding;

        (5) Caused by the application of chemicals;

        (6) Caused by theft, fire, or vandalism;

        (7) Caused by the movement of bees by the producer or any other person; or

        (8) Due to disease or pest infestation of the colonies.

        (e) Qualifying losses for other value loss crops, except nursery, will not include losses for the 2007 crop that were acquired on or after February 28, 2007.

        (f) Loss calculations will take into account other conditions and adjustments provided for in this part.

        § 760.811   Rates and yields; calculating payments.

#### § § 760.811

        (a)(1) Payments made under this part to a participant for a loss of quantity on a unit with respect to yield-based crops are determined by multiplying the average market price times 42 percent, times the loss of production which exceeds 35 percent of the expected production, as determined by FSA, of the unit.

        (2) Payments made under this part to a participant for a quantity loss on a unit with respect to value-based crops are determined by multiplying the payment rate established for the crop by FSA times the loss of value that exceeds 35 percent of the expected production value, as determined by FSA, of the unit.

        (3) As determined by FSA, additional quality loss payments may be made using a 25 percent quality loss threshold. The quality loss threshold is determined according to § 760.817.

        (b) Payment rates for the 2005, 2006, or 2007 year crop losses will be 42 percent of the average market price.

        (c) Separate payment rates and yields for the same crop may be established by the State committee as authorized by the Deputy Administrator, when there is supporting data from NASS or other sources approved by FSA that show there is a significant difference in yield or value based on a distinct and separate end use of the crop. Despite potential differences in yield or values, separate rates or yields will not be established for crops with different cultural practices, such as those grown organically or hydroponically.

        (d) Production from all end uses of a multi-use crop or all secondary uses for multiple market crops will be calculated separately and summarized together.

        (e) Each eligible participant's share of a disaster payment will be based on the participant's ownership entitlement share of the crop or crop proceeds, or, if no crop was produced, the share of the crop the participant would have received if the crop had been produced. If the participant has no ownership share of the crop, the participant is ineligible for assistance under this part.

        (f) When calculating a payment for a unit loss:

        (1) An unharvested payment factor will be applied to crop acreage planted but not harvested;

        (2) A prevented planting factor will be applied to any prevented planted acreage eligible for payment; and

        (3) Unharvested payment factors may be adjusted if costs normally associated with growing the crop are not incurred.

        § 760.812   Production losses; participant responsibility.

#### § § 760.812

        (a) Where available and determined accurate by FSA, RMA loss records will be used for insured crops.

        (b) If RMA loss records are not available, or if the FSA county committee determines the RMA loss records are inaccurate or incomplete, or if the FSA county committee makes inquiry, participants are responsible for:

        (1) Retaining or providing, when required, the best verifiable or reliable production records available for the crop;

        (2) Summarizing all the production evidence;

        (3) Accounting for the total amount of unit production for the crop, whether or not records reflect this production;

        (4) Providing the information in a manner that can be easily understood by the county committee; and

        (5) Providing supporting documentation if the county committee has reason to question the damaging weather event or question whether all production has been accounted for.

        (c) In determining production under this section, the participant must supply verifiable or reliable production records to substantiate production to the county committee. If the eligible crop was sold or otherwise disposed of through commercial channels, production records include: commercial receipts; settlement sheets; warehouse ledger sheets; load summaries; or appraisal information from a loss adjuster acceptable to FSA. If the eligible crop was farm-stored, sold, fed to livestock, or disposed of in means other than commercial channels, production records for these purposes include: truck scale tickets; appraisal information from a loss adjuster acceptable to FSA; contemporaneous diaries; or other documentary evidence, such as contemporaneous measurements.

        (d) Participants must provide all records for any production of a crop that is grown with an arrangement, agreement, or contract for guaranteed payment.

        § 760.813   Determination of production.

#### § § 760.813

        (a) Production under this part includes all harvested production, unharvested appraised production, and assigned production for the total planted acreage of the crop on the unit.

        (b) The harvested production of eligible crop acreage harvested more than once in a crop year includes the total harvested production from all these harvests.

        (c) If a crop is appraised and subsequently harvested as the intended use, the actual harvested production must be taken into account to determine benefits. FSA will analyze and determine whether a participant's evidence of actual production represents all that could or would have been harvested.

        (d) For all crops eligible for loan deficiency payments or marketing assistance loans with an intended use of grain but harvested as silage, ensilage, cobbage, hay, cracked, rolled, or crimped, production will be adjusted based on a whole grain equivalent as established by FSA.

        (e) For crops with an established yield and market price for multiple intended uses, a value will be calculated by FSA with respect to the intended use or uses for disaster purposes based on historical production and acreage evidence provided by the participant and FSA will determine the eligible acres for each use.

        (f) For crops sold in a market that is not a recognized market for the crop with no established county average yield and average market price, 42 percent of the salvage value received will be deducted from the disaster payment.

        (g) If a participant does not receive compensation based upon the quantity of the commodity delivered to a purchaser, but has an agreement or contract for guaranteed payment for production, the determination of the production will be the greater of the actual production or the guaranteed payment converted to production as determined by FSA.

        (h) Production that is commingled between units before it was a matter of record or combination of record and cannot be separated by using records or other means acceptable to FSA will be prorated to each respective unit by FSA. Commingled production may be attributed to the applicable unit, if the participant made the unit production of a commodity a matter of record before commingling and does any of the following, as applicable:

        (1) Provides copies of verifiable documents showing that production of the commodity was purchased, acquired, or otherwise obtained from beyond the unit;

        (2) Had the production measured in a manner acceptable to the county committee; or

        (3) Had the current year's production appraised in a manner acceptable to the county committee.

        (i) The county committee will assign production for the unit when the county committee determines that:

        (1) The participant has failed to provide adequate and acceptable production records;

        (2) The loss to the crop is because of a disaster condition not covered by this part, or circumstances other than natural disaster, and there has not otherwise been an accounting of this ineligible cause of loss;

        (3) The participant carries out a practice, such as multiple cropping, that generally results in lower yields than the established historic yields;

        (4) The participant has a contract to receive a guaranteed payment for all or a portion of the crop;

        (5) A crop was late-planted;

        (6) Unharvested acreage was not timely appraised; or

        (7) Other appropriate causes exist for such assignment as determined by the Deputy Administrator.

        (j) For peanuts, the actual production is all peanuts harvested for nuts, regardless of their disposition or use, as adjusted for low quality.

        (k) For tobacco, the actual production is the sum of the tobacco: marketed or available to be marketed; destroyed after harvest; and produced but unharvested, as determined by an appraisal.

        § 760.814   Calculation of acreage for crop losses other than prevented planted.

#### § § 760.814

        (a) Payment acreage of a crop is limited to the lesser of insured acreage or NAP covered acreage of the crop, as applicable, or actual acreage of the crop planted for harvest.

        (b) In cases where there is a repeat crop or a multiple planted crop in more than one planting period, or if there is multiple cropped acreage meeting criteria established in paragraph (c) or (d) of this section, each of these crops may be considered separate crops if the county committee determines that all of the following conditions are met:

        (1) Were planted with the intent to harvest;

        (2) Were planted within the normal planting period for that crop;

        (3) Meet all other eligibility provisions of this part including good farming practices; and

        (4) Could reach maturity if each planting was harvested or would have been harvested.

        (c) In cases where there is multiple-cropped acreage, each crop may be eligible for disaster assistance separately if both of the following conditions are met:

        (1) The specific crops are approved by the State committee as eligible multiple-cropping practices in accordance with procedures approved by the Deputy Administrator and separately meet all requirements, including insurance or NAP requirements ; and

        (2) The farm containing the multiple-cropped acreage has a history of successful multiple cropping more than one crop on the same acreage in the same crop year, in the year previous to the disaster, or at least 2 of the 4 crop years immediately preceding the disaster crop year based on timely filed crop acreage reports.

        (d) A participant with multiple-cropped acreage not meeting the criteria in paragraph (c) of this section may be eligible for disaster assistance on more than one crop if the participant has verifiable records establishing a history of carrying out a successful multiple-cropping practice on the specific crops for which assistance is requested. All required records acceptable to FSA as determined by the Deputy Administrator must be provided before payments are issued.

        (e) A participant with multiple-cropped acreage not meeting the criteria in paragraphs (c) or (d) of this section must select the crop for which assistance will be requested. If more than one participant has an interest in the multiple cropped acreage, all participants must agree to the crop designated for payment by the end of the application period or no payment will be approved for any crop on the multiple-cropped acreage.

        (f) Benefits under this part apply to irrigated crops where, in cases determined by the Deputy Administrator, acreage was affected by a lack of surface irrigation water due to drought or contamination of ground water or surface irrigation water due to saltwater intrusion. In no case is a loss of ground water, for any reason, an eligible cause of loss.

        § 760.815   Calculation of prevented planted acreage.

#### § § 760.815

        (a) When determining losses under this part, prevented planted acreage will be considered separately from planted acreage of the same crop.

        (b) For insured crops, or NAP covered crops, as applicable, disaster payments under this part for prevented planted acreage will not be made unless RMA or FSA, as applicable, documentation indicates that the eligible participant received a prevented planting payment under either NAP or the RMA-administered program.

        (c) The participant must prove, to the satisfaction of the county committee, an intent to plant the crop and that such crop could not be planted because of an eligible disaster. The county committee must be able to determine the participant was prevented from planting the crop by an eligible disaster that:

        (1) Prevented other producers from planting on acreage with similar characteristics in the surrounding area;

        (2) Occurred after the previous planting period for the crop; and

        (3) Unless otherwise approved by the Deputy Administrator, began no earlier than the planting season for that crop.

        (d) Prevented planted disaster benefits under this part do not apply to:

        (1) Acreage not insured or NAP covered;

        (2) Any acreage on which a crop other than a cover crop was harvested, hayed, or grazed during the crop year;

        (3) Any acreage for which a cash lease payment is received for the use of the acreage the same crop year, unless the county committee determines the lease was for haying and grazing rights only and was not a lease for use of the land;

        (4) Acreage for which the participant or any other person received a prevented planted payment for any crop for the same acreage, excluding share arrangements;

        (5) Acreage for which the participant cannot provide verifiable proof to the county committee that inputs such as seed, chemicals, and fertilizer were available to plant and produce a crop with the expectation of producing at least a normal yield; and

        (6) Any other acreage for which, for whatever reason, there is cause to question whether the crop could have been planted for a successful and timely harvest, or for which prevented planting credit is not allowed under the provisions of this part.

        (e) Prevented planting payments are not provided on acreage that had either a previous or subsequent crop planted in the same crop year on the acreage, unless the county committee determines that all of the following conditions are met:

        (1) There is an established practice of planting two or more crops for harvest on the same acreage in the same crop year;

        (2) Both crops could have reached maturity if each planting was harvested or would have been harvested;

        (3) Both the initial and subsequent planted crops were planted or prevented planting within the normal planting period for that crop;

        (4) Both the initial and subsequent planted crops meet all other eligibility provisions of this part including good farming practices; and

        (5) The specific crops meet the eligibility criteria for a separate crop designation as a repeat or approved multiple cropping practice set out in § 760.814.

        (f)(1) Disaster benefits under this part do not apply to crops where the prevented planted acreage was affected by a disaster that was caused by drought unless on the final planting date or the late planting period for non-irrigated acreage, the area that was prevented from being planted had insufficient soil moisture for germination of seed and progress toward crop maturity because of a prolonged period of dry weather;

        (2) Verifiable information collected by sources whose business or purpose is to record weather conditions, including, but not limited to, local weather reporting stations of the U.S. National Weather Service.

This limit must be enforced by the state government administering the grant program.

        (e) The provisions of part 1400, subpart G, of this title apply to these programs. That is the rules that limit the eligibility for benefits of those individuals or entities with an adjusted gross income greater than a certain limit will be applied in the same manner to payments under subparts L and M of this part.

        (f) As a condition to receive benefits under subparts L and M of this part, a participant must have been in compliance with the provisions of parts 12 and 718 of this title for the calendar year for which benefits are being requested and must not otherwise be precluded from receiving benefits under any law.

        (g) An individual or entity determined to be a foreign person under part 1400 of this title is not eligible to receive benefits under subparts L and M of this part.

        (h) In addition to limitations provided in subparts L and M of this part, participants cannot receive duplicate benefits under subparts L and M of this part for the same loss or any similar loss under:

        (2) For 2006 LCP under this subpart will be reduced by the amount the participant received for the same or similar loss under the Livestock Assistance Grant Program in accordance with subpart H of this part.

        (c) Subject to such other limitations as may apply, including those in paragraph (b) of this section, the payment under the 2005-2007 LCP may not exceed for the relevant year chosen by the producer the smaller of either the:

        (1) Payment calculated in paragraph (a) of this section for that year; or

        (2) Value of the producer's eligible feed loss, increased feed costs, or forage or grazing loss as determined by FSA for that year.

        (d) The actual payment to the producer will be the amount provided for in paragraph (c) of this section subject to the adjustments and limits provided for in this section or in this part.

Participants receiving payments or any other person who furnishes the information to FSA must allow authorized representatives of USDA and the General Accounting Office, during regular business hours, and to enter upon, inspect, examine, and make copies of the books or records, and to inspect and verify all applicable livestock and acreage in which the participant has an interest for the purpose of confirming the accuracy of the information provided by or for the participant.

        § 760.1110   Refunds; joint and several liability.

#### § § 760.1110

        In the event there is a failure to comply with any term, requirement, or condition for payment or assistance arising under this subpart, and if any refund of a payment to FSA will otherwise become due in connection with this subpart, all payments made in regard to such matter must be refunded to FSA together with interest and late-payment charges as provided for in part 792 of this title, provided that interest will run from the date of the disbursement of the refund to the producer.

        § 760.1303   Requesting benefits.

#### § § 760.1303

        (a) If as a dairy operation or producer, your records are currently available in the FSA county office from previous participation in a fiscal year 2009 dairy program administered by FSA, you do not need to request benefits under this subpart to receive payments. FSA will make payments as specified in this subpart to eligible dairy producers based on production data maintained by the FSA county office for the months of February through July 2009.

        (b) If records are not available in the FSA county office, dairy producers may request benefits. The request for benefits may be a letter or email; no specific form is required.

        (1) Submit your request for DELAP to: Deputy Administrator for Farm Programs, FSA, USDA, STOP 0512, 1400 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20250-0512; Attention: DELAP Program. Or you may send your request for DELAP via fax to (202) 690-1536 or e-mail to

        (2) The complete request as described in this subpart must be received by FSA by the close of business on January 19, 2010.

        (3) The complete request for benefits must include all of the following:

        (i) The name and location of the dairy operation;

        (ii) Contact information for the dairy operation, including telephone number;

        (iii) Name, percentage share, and tax identification number for the entity or individual producer's receiving a share of the payment; and

        (iv) Proof of production (acceptable documentation as specified in § 760.1305).

        (4) Requests for benefits and related documents not provided to FSA as required by this subpart, will not be approved.

        (5) If not already provided and available to FSA, the dairy producer or dairy operation must provide documentation to support:

        (i) The amount (quantity in pounds) of milk produced by the dairy operation during the months of February 2009 through July 2009;

        (ii) Percentage share of milk production during February through July 2009 attributed to each producer in the dairy operation; and

        (iii) Average adjusted gross income for each individual or entity with a share in the operation and any additional entities or individuals as needed to apply the adjusted gross income rules of these regulations.

        (6) Each dairy producer requesting benefits under this subpart is responsible for providing accurate and truthful information and any supporting documentation. If the dairy operation provides the required information, each dairy producer who shares in the risk of a dairy operation's total production is responsible for the accuracy and truthfulness of the information submitted for the request for benefits before the request will be considered complete. Providing a false statement, request, or certification to the Government may be punishable by imprisonment, fines, other penalties, or sanctions.

        (c) All information provided by the dairy producer or dairy operation is subject to verification, spot check, and audit by FSA. Further verification information may be obtained from the dairy operation's milk handler or marketing cooperative if necessary for FSA to verify provided information. Refusal to allow FSA or any other USDA agency to verify any information provided or the inability of FSA to verify such information will result in a determination of ineligibility for benefits under this subpart.

        (d) Data furnished by dairy producers and dairy operations, subject to verification, will be used to determine eligibility for program benefits. Although participation in the DELAP program is voluntary, program benefits will not be provided unless a producer or operation furnishes all requested data or such data is already recorded at the FSA county office.

        § 760.1304   Eligibility.

#### § § 760.1304

        (a) Payment under DELAP will only be made to producers, but the dairy “operation” must first qualify its production within limits provided for in this subpart in order to have the individuals or entities that qualify as “producers” receive payment subject to whatever additional limits (such as the adjusted gross income provisions of these regulations) apply. As needed the agency may construe the terms of this regulation in any manner needed to facilitate and expedite payments using existing data and records from other assistance programs. Further, those parties (State and local governments and their political subdivisions and related agencies) excluded from the MILC program will not be eligible for DELAP payments notwithstanding any other provision of these regulation. That said, to be eligible to receive payments under this subpart, a dairy producer in the United States must:

        (1) Have produced milk in the United States and commercially marketed the milk produced any time during February 2009 through July 2009;

        (2) Be a producer, as defined in § 760.1302;

        (3) Provide FSA with proof of milk production commercially marketed by all dairy producers in the dairy operation during February 2009 through July 2009; and

        (4) Submit an accurate and complete request for benefits as specified in § 760.1303, if production data is not available in the FSA county office.

        (b) To be eligible to receive a payment, each producer in an eligible dairy operation must meet the average adjusted gross income eligibility requirements of 7 CFR part 1400. No person or entity will be eligible to receive any payment or direct or indirect benefit under this subpart if their annual average adjusted nonfarm income is over $500,000 as determined under 7 CFR part 1400. In the case of indirect benefits, direct benefits to other parties will be reduced accordingly. This will mean that all of the attribution rules of part 1400 will apply. For example if Individual A is over the limit and owns 100 percent of Corporation C which had a 20 percent interest in Corporation B which had a 50 percent interest in milk producer Corporation A, the AGI of Individual A would result in a 10 percent (100 percent times 20 percent times 50 percent) loss in benefits to Corporation A. For DELAP, the relevant period for the annual average adjusted nonfarm income is 2005 through 2007.

        (1) Individual dairy producers in a dairy operation that is an entity are only eligible for a payment based on their share of the dairy operation.

        (2) No payment will be made to any other producer based on the share of any dairy producer who exceeds the income limit or who, because of the attribution rules, has their payment reduced.

        § 760.1305   Proof of production.

#### § § 760.1305

        (a) Dairy producers requesting benefits must, as required by this subpart, provide adequate proof of the dairy operation's eligible production during the months of February through July 2009, if those records are not already available at the FSA county office. The dairy operation must also provide proof that the eligible production was also commercially marketed during the same period.

        (b) To be eligible for payment, dairy producers marketing milk during February through July 2009 must provide any required supporting documents to assist FSA in verifying production. Supporting documentation may be provided by either the dairy producer or by the dairy operation for each of its producers. Examples of supporting documentation may include, but are not limited to: Milk marketing payment stubs, tank records, milk handler records, daily milk marketings, copies of any payments received as compensation from other sources, or any other documents available to confirm the production and production history of the dairy operation. Dairy operations and producers may also be required to allow FSA to examine the herd of cattle as production evidence. If supporting documentation requested is not presented to FSA, the request for benefits will be denied.

        § 760.1306   Availability of funds.

#### § § 760.1306

        (a) Payments under this subpart are subject to the availability of funds. The total available program funds are $290,000,000.

        (b) FSA will prorate the available funds by a national factor to ensure payments do not exceed $290,000,000. The payment will be made based on the national payment rate as determined by FSA. FSA will prorate the payments based on the amount of milk production eligible for payments in a fair and reasonable manner.

        (c) A reserve will be created to handle new applications, appeals, and errors.

        § 760.1307   Dairy operation payment quantity.

#### § § 760.1307

        (a) A dairy operation's payment quantity (the quantity of milk on which the “operation” can generate payments for “producers” involved in the operation) will be determined by FSA, based on the pounds of production of commercially marketed milk during the months of February 2009 through July 2009, multiplied by two.

        (b) The maximum payment quantity for which a dairy operation can generate payments for its dairy producers under this subpart will be 6,000,000 pounds.

        (c) The dairy operation's payment quantity will be used to determine the amount of DELAP payments made to dairy producers.

        § 760.1308   Payment rate.

#### § § 760.1308

        (a) A national per-hundredweight payment rate will be calculated by dividing the available funding, less a reserve established by FSA, by the total pounds of eligible production approved for payment.

        (b) Each eligible dairy producer's payment with respect to an operation will be calculated by multiplying the payment rate determined in paragraph (a) of this section by the dairy producer's share in the dairy operation's eligible production payment quantity as determined in accordance with section § 760.1307.

        (c) In the event that approval of all eligible requests for benefits would result in expenditures in excess of the amount available, FSA will reduce the payment rate in a manner that FSA determines to be fair and reasonable.

        § 760.1309   Appeals.

#### § § 760.1309

        The appeal regulations set forth at 7 CFR parts 11 and 780 apply to determinations made under this subpart.

        § 760.1310   Misrepresentation and scheme or device.

#### § § 760.1310

        (a) In addition to other penalties, sanctions or remedies as may apply, a dairy producer or operation will be ineligible to receive benefits under this subpart if the producer or operation is determined by FSA to have:

        (1) Adopted any scheme or device that tends to defeat the purpose of this subpart;

        (2) Made any fraudulent representation; or

        (3) Misrepresented any fact affecting a program determination.

        (b) Any payment to any person or operation engaged in a misrepresentation, scheme, or device, must be refunded with interest together with such other sums as may become due. Any dairy operation or person engaged in acts prohibited by this section and receiving payment under this subpart will be jointly and severally liable with other producers or operations involved in such claim for benefits for any refund due under this section and for related charges. The remedies provided in this subpart will be in addition to other civil, criminal, or administrative remedies that may apply.

        § 760.1311   Death, incompetence, or disappearance.

#### § § 760.1311

        (a) In the case of the death, incompetency, or disappearance of a person or the dissolution of an entity that is eligible to receive benefits in accordance with this subpart, such alternate person or persons specified in 7 CFR part 707 may receive such benefits, as determined appropriate by FSA.

        (b) Payments may be made to an otherwise eligible dairy producer who is now deceased or to a dissolved entity if a representative who currently has authority to enter into an application for the producer or the producer's estate makes the request for benefits as specified in § 760.1303. Proof of authority over the deceased producer's estate or a dissolved entity must be provided.

        (c) If a dairy producer is now a dissolved general partnership or joint venture, all members of the general partnership or joint venture at the time of dissolution or their duly authorized representatives must be identified in the request for benefits.

        § 760.1312   Maintaining records.

#### § § 760.1312

        (a) Persons requesting benefits under this subpart must maintain records and accounts to document all eligibility requirements specified in this subpart. Such records and accounts must be retained for 3 years after the date of payment to the dairy producer under this subpart.

        (b) Destruction of the records after 3 years from the date of payment will be at the decision and risk of the party undertaking the destruction.

        § 760.1313   Refunds; joint and several liability.

#### § § 760.1313

        (a) Any dairy producer that receives excess payment, payment as the result of erroneous information provided by any person, or payment resulting from a failure to comply with any requirement or condition for payment under this subpart, must refund the amount of that payment to FSA.

        (b) Any refund required will be due from the date of the disbursement by the agency with interest determined in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section and late payment charges as provided in 7 CFR part 1403.

        (c) Each dairy producer that has an interest in the dairy operation will be jointly and severally liable for any refund and related charges found to be due to FSA.

        (d) Interest will be applicable to any refunds to FSA required in accordance with 7 CFR parts 792 and 1403. Such interest will be charged at the rate that the U.S. Department of the Treasury charges FSA for funds, and will accrue from the date FSA made the payment to the date the refund is repaid.

        (e) FSA may waive the accrual of interest if it determines that the cause of the erroneous payment was not due to any action of the person or entity, or was beyond the control of the person or entity committing the violation. Any waiver is at the discretion of FSA alone.

        § 760.1314   Miscellaneous provisions.

#### § § 760.1314

        (a)  FSA may offset or withhold any amount due to FSA from any benefit provided under this subpart in accordance with the provisions of 7 CFR part 1403.

        (b)  Claims or debts will be settled in accordance with the provisions of 7 CFR part 1403.

        (c)  Payments or any portion thereof due under this subpart will be made without regard to questions of title under State law and without regard to any claim or lien against the milk production, or proceeds thereof, in favor of the owner or any other creditor except agencies and instrumentalities of the U.S. Government.

        (d)  Any dairy producer entitled to any payment under this part may assign any payments in accordance with the provisions of 7 CFR part 1404.

        (e)  The provisions of part 12 of this title apply to this subpart. That part sets out certain conservation requirements as a general condition for farm benefits.

        (f)  The provisions of § 718.6 of this title, which generally limit program payment eligibility for persons who have engaged in certain offenses with respect to controlled substances, will apply to this subpart.

        (2) For the 2019 and 2020 crop years, an initial payment will be issued for 50 percent of each WHIP+ payment calculated according to this subpart, as determined by the Secretary. Up to the remaining 50 percent of the calculated WHIP+ payment will be paid only to the extent that there are funds available for such payment as discussed in this subpart.

        (3) In the event that, within the limits of the funding made available by the Secretary, approval of eligible applications would result in payments in excess of the amount available, FSA will prorate 2019 and 2020 payments by a national factor to reduce the payments to the remaining available funds, as determined by the Secretary. FSA will prorate the payments accordingly.

        (4) Applications and claims that are unpaid or prorated for aforementioned reasons of fund availability will not be carried forward for payment and will be considered, as to any unpaid amount, void and non-payable.

        (a) Payments made under this subpart to a participant for a loss to yield-based crops, including losses due to prevented planting, subject to § 760.1514(i) and (j), are determined for a unit by:

        (1) Multiplying the eligible acres by the 2017 WHIP yield in paragraph (c) of this section or the WHIP+ yield in paragraph (d) of this section by the price;

        (2) Multiplying the result from paragraph (a)(1) of this section by the applicable 2017 WHIP factor or WHIP+ factor in paragraph (b) of this section;

        (3) Multiplying the applicable production in paragraph (d) of this section by the price;

        (4) Subtracting the result from paragraph (a)(3) of this section from the result of paragraph (a)(2) of this section;

        (5) Multiplying the result from paragraph (a)(4) of this section by the participant's share in paragraph (e) of this section;

        (6) Multiplying the result from paragraph (a)(5) of this section by the applicable payment factor in paragraph (g) of this section;

        (7) Subtracting the amount of the gross insurance indemnity or NAP payment from the result from paragraph (a)(6) of this section;

        (8) Subtracting the secondary use or salvage value of the crop from the result from paragraph (a)(7) of this section; and

        (b) If the NAP or crop insurance coverage is at the coverage level listed in the first column, then the 2017 WHIP factor is listed in the second column, and the WHIP+ factor is listed in the third column:

        (c) The 2017 WHIP yield is:

        (1) The producer's APH for insured crops under a crop insurance policy that has an associated yield and for NAP covered crops, excluding all crops located in Puerto Rico;

        (2) The county expected yield for crops located in Puerto Rico and uninsured crops, excluding citrus crops located in Florida; or

        (3) For uninsured citrus crops located in Florida:

        (i) Determined based on information provided on FSA-893 and supported by evidence that meets the requirements of § 760.1513(c), or

        (ii) If FSA-893 and supporting documentation are not submitted, the county expected yield.

        (d) The WHIP+ yield is:

        (1) The producer's APH for insured crops under a crop insurance policy that has an associated yield and for NAP covered crops, excluding all crops located in Puerto Rico;

        (2) The county expected yield for crops located in Puerto Rico and uninsured crops, excluding select crops; or

        (3) For select crops:

        (i) Determined based on information provided on FSA-897 and supported by evidence that meets the requirements of § 760.1513(c), or

        (ii) If FSA-897 and supporting documentation are not submitted, the county expected yield.

        (e) The production used to calculate a payment under this subpart will be determined as specified in § 760.1513.

        (f) The eligible participant's share of a payment under this subpart is based on the participant's ownership entitlement share of the crop or crop proceeds, or, if no crop was produced, the share of the crop the participant would have received if the crop had been produced. If the participant has no ownership share of the crop, the participant is ineligible for payment.

        (g) Payment factors will be used to calculate payments for crops produced with significant and variable production and harvesting expenses that are not incurred because the crop acreage was prevented planted, or planted but not harvested, as determined by FSA. The use of payment factors is based on whether the crop acreage was unharvested or prevented planted, not whether a participant actually incurs or does not incur expenses. Payment factors are generally applicable to all similarly situated participants and are not established in response to individual participants. Accordingly established payment factors are not appealable under parts 11 and 780 of this title. A crop that is intended for mechanical harvest, but subsequently grazed and not mechanically harvested, will have an unharvested payment factor applied.

        (h) Production from all end uses of a multi-use crop will be calculated separately and summarized together.

        § 760.1512   Production losses; participant responsibility.

#### § § 760.1512

        (a) For any record submitted along with the certification of production, the record must be either a verifiable or reliable record that substantiates the certification to the satisfaction of the FSA county committee. If the eligible crop was sold or otherwise disposed of through commercial channels, a record of that disposition must be provided to FSA with the certification.

        (1) Acceptable production records include:

        (i) RMA or NAP records, if accurate and complete;

        (ii) Commercial receipts;

        (iii) Settlement sheets;

        (iv) Warehouse ledger sheets or load summaries; or

        (v) Appraisal information from a loss adjuster acceptable to FSA.

        (2) If the eligible crop was farm-stored, sold, fed to livestock, or disposed of by means other than verifiable commercial channels, acceptable records for these purposes include:

        (i) Truck scale tickets;

        (ii) Appraisal information from a loss adjuster acceptable to FSA;

        (iii) Contemporaneous reliable diaries; or

        (iv) Other documentary evidence, such as contemporaneous reliable measurements.

        (3) Determinations of reliability with respect to this paragraph will take into account, as appropriate, the ability for FSA to review and verify or compare the evidence against the similarity of the evidence or reports or data received by FSA for the crop or similar crops. Other factors deemed relevant may also be taken into account.

        (b) If RMA or NAP records are not available, or if the FSA county committee determines the RMA or NAP records as reported by the insured or covered participant appear to be questionable or incomplete, or if the FSA county committee makes inquiry, the participant is responsible for:

        (1) Retaining and providing, at time of application and whenever required by FSA, the best available verifiable or reliable or other production records for the crop;

        (2) Summarizing all the production evidence;

        (3) Accounting for the total amount of unit production for the crop, whether or not records reflect this production;

        (4) Providing the information in a manner that can be easily understood by the FSA county committee; and

        (5) Providing supporting documentation if the FSA county committee has reason to question the disaster event or that all production has been taken into account.

        (c) FSA may verify the production evidence submitted with records on file at the warehouse, gin, or other entity that received or may have received the reported production.

        (d) Participants must provide all records for any production of a crop that is grown with an arrangement, agreement, or contract for guaranteed payment.

        (e) Under WHIP+, participants requesting payments for losses to adulterated wine grapes must submit verifiable sales tickets that document that the reduced price received was due to adulteration due to a qualifying disaster event. For adulterated wine grapes that have not been sold, participants must submit verifiable records obtained by testing or analysis to establish that the wine grapes were adulterated due to a qualifying disaster event and the price they would receive due to adulteration.

        § 760.1513   Determination of production.

#### § § 760.1513

        (a) The harvested production of eligible crop acreage harvested more than once in a crop year includes the total harvested production from all the harvests in the crop year.

        (b) If a crop is appraised and subsequently harvested as the intended use, the actual harvested production must be taken into account to determine payments. FSA will analyze and determine whether a participant's evidence of actual production represents all that could or would have been harvested.

        (c) For all crops eligible for loan deficiency payments or marketing assistance loans (see parts 1421 and 1434 of this title) with an intended use of grain but harvested as silage, ensilage, cabbage, hay, cracked, rolled, or crimped, production will be converted to a whole grain equivalent based on conversion factors as previously established by FSA.

        (d) If a participant does not receive compensation based upon the quantity of the commodity delivered to a purchaser, but has an agreement or contract for guaranteed payment for production, the determination of the production will be the greater of the actual production or the guaranteed payment converted to production as determined by FSA.

        (e) Production that is commingled between crop years, units, ineligible and eligible acres, or different practices before it was a matter of record or combination of record and cannot be separated by using records or other means acceptable to FSA will be prorated to each respective year, unit, type of acreage, or practice, respectively. Commingled production may be attributed to the applicable unit, if the participant made the unit production of a commodity a matter of record before commingling and does any of the following, as applicable:

        (1) Provides copies of verifiable documents showing that production of the commodity was purchased, acquired, or otherwise obtained from beyond the unit;

        (2) Had the production measured in a manner acceptable to the FSA county committee; or

        (3) Had the current year's production appraised in a manner acceptable to the FSA county committee.

        (f) The FSA county committee will assign production for the unit when the FSA county committee determines that:

        (1) The participant has failed to provide adequate and acceptable production records;

        (2) The loss to the crop is because of a disaster condition not covered by this subpart, or circumstances other than natural disaster, and there has not otherwise been an accounting of this ineligible cause of loss;

        (3) The participant carries out a practice, such as multiple cropping, that generally results in lower yields than the established historic yields;

        (5) A crop was late-planted;

        (6) Unharvested acreage was not timely appraised; or

        (7) Other appropriate causes exist for such assignment as determined by the Deputy Administrator.

        (g) The FSA county committee will establish a county disaster yield that reflects the amount of production producers would have produced considering the eligible disaster events in the county or area for the same crop. The county disaster yield for the county or area will be expressed as either a percent of loss or yield per acre. The county disaster yield will apply when:

        (1) Unharvested acreage has not been appraised by FSA or a company reinsured by FCIC; or

        (2) Acceptable production records for harvested acres are not available from any source.

        (h) In no case will the production amount of any applicant be less than the producer's certified loss.

        (i) Under WHIP+, production for eligible adulterated wine grapes will be adjusted for quality deficiencies due to a qualifying disaster event. Wine grapes are eligible for production adjustment only if adulteration occurred prior to harvest and as a result of a qualifying disaster event or as a result of a related condition (such as application of fire retardant). Losses due to all other causes of adulteration (such as addition of artificial flavoring or chemicals for economic purposes) are not eligible for WHIP+. Production will be eligible for quality adjustment if, due to a qualifying disaster event, it has a value of less than 75 percent of the average market price of undamaged grapes of the same or similar variety. The value per ton of the qualifying damaged production and the average market price of undamaged grapes will be determined on the earlier of the date the damaged production is sold or the date of final inspection for the unit. Grape production that is eligible for quality adjustment will be reduced by:

        (1) Dividing the value per ton of the damaged grapes by the value per ton for undamaged grapes; and

        (2) Multiplying this result (not to exceed 1.000) by the number of tons of the eligible damaged grapes.

        § 760.1514   Eligible acres.

#### § § 760.1514

        (a) Eligible acreage will be calculated using the lesser of the reported or determined acres shown to have been planted or prevented from being planted to a crop.

        (b) Initial crop acreage will be the payment acreage for under this subpart, unless the provisions for subsequent crops in this section are met. Subsequently planted or prevented planted acre acreage is considered acreage for under this subpart only if the provisions of this section are met. All plantings of an annual or biennial crop are considered the same as a planting of an initial crop in tropical regions as defined in part 1437, subpart F, of this title.

        (c) In cases where there is double cropped acreage, each crop may be included in the acreage only if the specific crops are approved by the FSA State committee as eligible double cropping practices in accordance with procedures approved by the Deputy Administrator.

        (d) Except for insured crops, participants with double cropped acreage not meeting the criteria in paragraph (c) of this section may have such acreage included in the acreage on more than one crop only if the participant submits verifiable records establishing a history of carrying out a successful double cropping practice on the specific crops for which payment is requested.

        (e) Participants having multiple plantings may receive payments for each planting included only if the planting meets the requirements of part 1437 of this title and all other provisions of this subpart are satisfied.

        (f) Losses due to prevented planting are eligible under this subpart only if the loss was due to a qualifying disaster event. Provisions of parts 718 and 1437 of this title specifying what is considered prevented planting and how it must be documented and reported apply. Crops located in tropical regions are not eligible for prevented planting.

        (g) Subject to the provisions of this subpart, the FSA county committee will:

        (1) Use the most accurate data available when determining planted and prevented planted acres; and

        (2) Disregard acreage of a crop produced on land that is not eligible for crop insurance or NAP.

        (h) If a farm has a crop that has both FSA and RMA acreage for insured crops, eligible acres will be based on the lesser of RMA or FSA acres.

        (i) For 2017 WHIP, prevented planting acres will be considered eligible acres if they meet all requirements of this subpart.

        (j) For WHIP+:

        (1) 2018 and 2020 crop year prevented planting acres and 2019 crop year uninsured and NAP-covered prevented planting acres will be eligible acres if they meet all requirements of this subpart; and

        (2) 2019 crop year insured prevented planting acres will not be eligible acres.

        § 760.1515   Calculating payments for value loss crops.

#### § § 760.1515

        (a) Payments made under this subpart to a participant for a loss on a unit with respect to value loss crops are determined by:

        (1) Multiplying the field market value of the crop immediately before the qualifying disaster event by the  WHIP factor or WHIP+ factor specified in § 760.1511(b);

        (2) Subtracting the sum of the field market value of the crop immediately after the qualifying disaster event and the value of the crop lost due to ineligible causes of loss from the result from paragraph (a)(1) of this section;

        (3) Multiplying the result from paragraph (a)(2) of this section by the participant's share;

        (4) Multiplying the result from paragraph (a)(3) of this section by the applicable payment factor;

        (5) Subtracting the gross insurance indemnity or NAP payment from the result from paragraph (a)(4) of this section;

        (6) Subtracting the secondary use or salvage value of the crop from the result from paragraph (a)(5) of this section; and

        (7) Subtracting the amount of any payment for future economic losses received under the Florida Citrus Recovery Block Grant Program.

        (b) In the case of an insurable value loss crop for which crop insurance provides for an adjustment in the guarantee, liability, or indemnity, such as in the case of inventory exceeding peak inventory value, the adjustment will be used in determining the payment under this subpart for the crop.

        (c) In the case of a NAP eligible value loss crop for which NAP provides for an adjustment in the level of assistance, such as in the case of unharvested field grown inventory, the adjustment will be used in determining the payment for the crop.

        § 760.1516   Calculating payments for tree, bush, and vine losses.

#### § § 760.1516

        (a) Payments will be calculated separately based on the growth stage of the trees, bushes, or vines, as determined by the Deputy Administrator.

        (b) Payments made under this subpart to a participant for a loss on a unit with respect to tree, bush, and vine losses are determined by:

        (1) Multiplying the expected value (see paragraph (c) of this section) of the trees, bushes, or vines immediately before the qualifying disaster event by the  WHIP factor or WHIP+ factor specified in § 760.1511(b);

        (2) Subtracting the actual value (see paragraph (d) of this section) of the trees, bushes, or vines immediately after the qualifying disaster event from the result of paragraph (b)(1) of this section;

        (3) Multiplying the result of paragraph (b)(2) of this section by the participant's share;

        (4) Subtracting the amount of any insurance indemnity received from the result of paragraph (b)(3) of this section; and

        (5) Subtracting the value of any secondary use or salvage value from the result of paragraph (b)(4) of this section.

        (c) Expected value is determined by multiplying the total number of trees, bushes, or vines that were damaged or destroyed by a qualifying disaster event by the price.

        (d) Actual value is determined by:

        (1) Multiplying the number of trees, bushes, or vines damaged by a qualifying disaster event by the damage factor;

        (2) Adding the result of paragraph (d)(1) of this section and the number of trees, bushes, or vines destroyed by a qualifying disaster event;

        (3) Multiplying the result of paragraph (d)(2) of this section by the price; and

        (4) Subtracting the result of paragraph (d)(3) of this section from the expected value from paragraph (c) of this section.

        (e) The FSA county committee will adjust the number of damaged and destroyed trees, bushes, and vines, if it determines that the number of damaged or destroyed trees, bushes, or vines certified by the participant is inaccurate.

        (f) Citrus trees located in Florida are ineligible for payment under 2017 WHIP.

        § 760.1517   Requirement to purchase crop insurance or NAP coverage.

#### § § 760.1517

        (a) For the first 2 consecutive crop years for which crop insurance or NAP coverage is available after the enrollment period for 2017 WHIP or WHIP+ ends, subject to paragraph (c) of this section, a participant who receives payment under this subpart for a crop loss in a county must obtain:

        (1) For an insurable crop, crop insurance with at least a 60 percent coverage level for that crop in that county; or

        (2) For a NAP eligible crop:

        (i) NAP coverage with a coverage level of 60 percent, if available for the applicable crop year, or NAP catastrophic coverage if NAP coverage is not offered at a 60 percent coverage level for that crop year.

        (ii) Participants who exceed the average adjusted gross income limitation for NAP payment eligibility   for the applicable crop year may meet the purchase requirement specified in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section by purchasing Whole-Farm Revenue Protection crop insurance coverage, if eligible, or paying the NAP service fee and premium even though the participant will not be eligible to receive a NAP payment due to the average adjusted gross income limit but will be eligible for the WHIP payment.

        (b) For the first 2 consecutive insurance years for which crop insurance is available after the enrollment period for 2017 WHIP ends, subject to paragraph (c) of this section, any participant who receives 2017 WHIP payments for a tree, bush, or vine loss must purchase a plan of insurance for the tree, bush, or vine with at least a 60 percent coverage level.

        (c) The final crop year to purchase crop insurance or NAP coverage to meet the requirements of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section is the:

        (1) 2021 crop year for 2017 WHIP payment eligibility, except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section;

        (2) 2023 crop year for:

        (i) WHIP+ payment eligibility; and

        (ii) 2017 WHIP payment eligibility for losses due to Tropical Storm Cindy, losses of peach and blueberry crops in calendar year 2017 due to extreme cold, and blueberry productivity losses in calendar year 2018 due to extreme cold and hurricane damage in calendar year 2017.

        (d) If a producer fails to obtain crop insurance or NAP coverage as required in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, the producer must reimburse FSA for the full amount of 2017 WHIP payment or WHIP+ payment plus interest that the producer received for that crop, tree, bush, or vine loss. A producer will only be considered to have obtained NAP coverage for the purposes of this section if the participant applied and payed the requisite NAP service fee and paid any applicable premium by the applicable deadline and completed all program requirements, including filing an acreage report as may be required under such coverage agreement.

        § 760.1705   Normal marketings of milk.

#### § § 760.1705

        (a) The FSA county committee will determine the affected farmer's normal marketings of milk which, for the purposes of this subpart, will be the sum of the quantities of  milk for which the farmer would have sold in the commercial market in each of the pay periods in the application period be it not for the removal of the affected farmer's  milk from the commercial market as a result of a qualifying disaster event.

        (b) Normal marketings for each pay period are based on the average daily production during the base period.

        (c) Normal marketings determined in paragraph (b) of this section are adjusted for any change in the daily average number of cows milked during each pay period the milk is off the market compared with the average number of cows milked daily during the base period.

        (d) If only a portion of a pay period falls within the application period, normal marketings for such pay period will be reduced so that they represent only that part of such pay period which is within the application period.

#### § § 760.1706

        (a) The FSA county committee will determine the fair market value of the affected farmer's dumped milk, which, for the purposes of this subpart, will be the sum of the net proceeds such farmer would have received for normal marketings in each of the pay periods in the application period but for the qualifying disaster event.

        (b) The base period per cow average daily milk production is determined by dividing the full month of milk marketings by the average number of cows in milk production for that month and the number of days in that month. To determine the milk loss payment, the base period per cow average daily milk production is multiplied by the number of milking cows in production for the claim period and by the number of days milk was removed or dumped in the claim period with the result divided by 100 to determine the applicable hundredweight and then multiplied by the hundredweight pay price.

        (c) To determine the hundredweight pay price for milk, the FSA county committee will deduct from the gross pay price from the claim period milk marketing statement the per hundredweight hauling rate for the applicable month and the per hundredweight $0.15 promotion fee which it determines are normally incurred by the affected farmer but which were not incurred because of the removal of the farmer's milk from the commercial market.

        § 760.1709   Payment limitation and AGI.

#### § § 760.1709

        (a) Per calendar year, a person or legal entity, other than a joint venture or general partnership, is eligible to receive, directly or indirectly payments of not more than $125,000 according to the provisions in § 760.1507(b)(1); or not more than $250,000 according to the provisions in § 760.1507(b)(2) if at least 75 percent of the person's or legal entity's average adjusted gross income is average adjusted gross farm income and the applicant provides the required certification(s) and documentation. Payments made to a joint venture or general partnership cannot exceed an amount determined by multiplying the maximum payment limitation by the number of persons and legal entities that comprise the first-level ownership of the joint venture or general partnership.

        (b) To certify the average adjusted gross farm income, a person or legal entity, including all members with an ownership interest in a legal entity, general partnership, or joint venture, must provide the following:

        (1) A certification in the manner prescribed by FSA from the person or legal entity that the average adjusted gross farm income of the person or legal entity is at least 75 percent of the average adjusted gross income; and

        (2) A certification in the manner prescribed by FSA from a licensed certified public accountant or attorney that the average adjusted gross farm income of the person or legal entity is at least 75 percent of the average adjusted gross income.

        (c) A new legal entity will have its adjusted gross farm income averaged only for those years for which it was in business; however, a new legal entity will not be considered “new” to the extent it takes over an existing operation and has any elements of common ownership interest and land with the preceding person or legal entity, or with persons or legal entities with an interest in the “old” legal entity. When there is such commonality, income of the previous person or legal entity will be averaged with that of the “new” legal entity for the base period.

        (d) For a person filing a joint federal tax return, the certification of average adjusted gross farm income will be reported as if the person had filed a separate federal tax return and the calculation is consistent with the information supporting the filed joint return.

        (e) All persons and legal entities are subject to an audit by FSA of any information submitted for the purpose of increasing the program's payment limitation. As a part of this audit, income tax returns may be requested, and if requested, must be supplied by all related persons and legal entities. In addition to any other requirement under any Federal statute, relevant Federal income tax returns and documentation must be retained a minimum of 2 years after the end of the calendar year corresponding to the year for which payments or benefits are requested. Failure to provide necessary and accurate information to verify compliance will result in ineligibility for Milk Loss Program benefits.

        (f) The direct attribution provisions in § 760.1507 apply for both payment limitation as well as in determining average adjusted gross farm income as defined and used in this subpart.

        § 760.1803   Participant eligibility.

#### § § 760.1803

        (a) Participants will be eligible to receive a payment under this subpart only if they incurred a loss to an eligible crop due to a qualifying disaster event, as further specified in this subpart.

        (b) To be an eligible participant under this subpart, a person or legal entity must be a:

        (1) Citizen of the United States;

        (2) Resident alien; for purposes of this subpart, resident alien means “lawful alien” (see § 1400.3 of this title);

        (3) Partnership consisting solely of citizens of the United States or resident aliens; or

        (c) If any person who would otherwise be eligible to receive a payment dies before the payment is received, payment may be released as specified in § 707.3 of this chapter. Similarly, if any person or legal entity who would otherwise have been eligible to apply for a payment dies or is dissolved, respectively, before the payment is applied for, payment may be released in accordance with this subpart if a timely application is filed by an authorized representative. Proof of authority to sign for the deceased producer or dissolved entity must be provided. If a participant is now a dissolved general partnership or joint venture, all members of the general partnership or joint venture at the time of dissolution or their duly authorized representatives must sign the application. Eligibility of such participant will be determined, as it is for other participants, based upon ownership share and risk in producing the crop.

Growers growing eligible crops under contract for crop owners are not eligible for a payment under this subpart unless the grower is also determined to have an ownership share of the crop. Any verbal or written contract that precludes the grower from having an ownership share renders the grower ineligible for payments under this subpart.

        (e) A person or legal entity is not eligible to receive assistance under this subpart if FSA determines that the person or legal entity:

        (1) Adopted any scheme or other device that tends to defeat the purpose of this subpart or any of the regulations applicable to this subpart;

        (2) Made any fraudulent representation; or

        (3) Misrepresented any fact affecting a program determination under any or all of the following: This subpart and parts 12, 400, 1400, and 1437 of this title.

        (f) A person who is ineligible for crop insurance or NAP under § 400.458 or § 1437.16 of this title, respectively, for any year is ineligible for payments under this subpart for the same year.

        (g) The provisions of § 718.11 of this chapter, providing for ineligibility for payments for offenses involving controlled substances, apply.

        (h) As a condition of eligibility to receive payments under this subpart, the participant must have been in compliance with the Highly Erodible Land Conservation and Wetland Conservation provisions of part 12 of this title for the applicable crop year for which the producer is applying for benefits under this subpart, and must not otherwise be precluded from receiving payments under part 12, 400, 1400, or 1437 of this title or any law.

        § 760.1804   Eligibility of affected production.

#### § § 760.1804

        (a) To be eligible for the QLA Program, an eligible crop's affected production must have suffered a quality loss due to a qualifying disaster event and had at least a 5 percent quality loss due to all eligible disaster events. Whether affected production of a crop had a 5 percent loss will be determined separately for crops with different crop types, intended uses, certified organic or conventional status, county, and crop year.

        (b) Affected production of the following is not eligible for the QLA Program:

        (1) Crops that were not grown commercially;

        (9) First-year seeding for forage production;

        (10) Immature fruit crops;

        (11) Crops for which FCIC coverage or NAP coverage is unavailable;

        (12) Multiple market crops for which the producer previously received a crop insurance indemnity or WHIP+ payment for a quality loss;

        (13) Crops for which production used to calculate a crop insurance indemnity or WHIP+ payment was adjusted based on a comparison of the producer's sale price to FCIC established price;

        (14) Crops that received a crop insurance indemnity, NAP payment, or WHIP+ payment based on the quantity of production that was considered unmarketable;

        (15) Crops for which the producer previously received a crop insurance indemnity, NAP payment, or WHIP+ payment for which production was reported as salvage value or secondary use;

        (16) Sugar beets for which a member of a cooperative processor received a payment through a cooperative agreement; and

        (17) Crops that were destroyed.

        (c) Only affected production from initial crop acreage will be eligible for a QLA Program payment, unless the provisions for subsequent crops in this section are met. All plantings of an annual or biennial crop are considered the same as a planting of an initial crop in tropical regions as defined in part 1437, subpart F, of this title.

        (d) In cases where there is double cropped acreage, affected production of each crop may be eligible only if the specific crops are approved by the FSA State committee as eligible double cropping practices in accordance with procedures approved by the Deputy Administrator.

        (e) Participants having affected production from multiple plantings may receive payments for each planting only if the planting meets the requirements of part 1437 of this title and all other provisions of this subpart are satisfied.

        (g) The producer applying for payment under this subpart certifies the accuracy and truthfulness of the information provided in the application as well as any documentation filed with or in support of the application. All information is subject to verification or spot check by FSA at any time, either before or after payment is issued. Refusal to allow FSA or any agency of the USDA to verify any information provided will result in the participant's forfeiting eligibility for payment under this subpart. FSA may at any time, including before, during, or after processing and paying an application, require the producer to submit any additional information necessary to implement or determine any eligibility provision of this subpart. Furnishing information specified in this subpart is voluntary; however, FSA may choose not to act on the application or approve payment if the required information is not provided. Providing a false certification will result in ineligibility and can also be punishable by imprisonment, fines, and other penalties.

        § 760.1811   Required documentation and verification.

#### § § 760.1811

        (a) If requested by FSA, an applicant must provide documentation that establishes the applicant's ownership share and value at risk in the crop.

        (b) The applicant must provide acceptable documentation that is dated and contains all information required to substantiate the applicant's certification to the satisfaction of the FSA county committee. Verifiable documentation is required to substantiate the total dollar value loss and associated affected production, grading factors, and nutritional factors. FSA may verify the records with records on file at the warehouse, gin, or other entity that received or may have received the reported production. Reliable production records are required to substantiate the reported amount of affected production for applications not based on the total dollar value loss.

        (c) To be considered acceptable, verifiable documentation for grain crops that were sold may come from any time between harvest and sale of the affected production, unless the FSA county committee determines the record is not representative of the condition within 30 days of harvest. For all other crops, the verifiable documentation must come from tests or analysis completed within 30 days of harvest, unless the FSA county committee determines that the record is representative of the condition of the affected production at time of harvest. Examples of acceptable records for purposes of this paragraph (c) include:

        (1) Warehouse grading sheets;

        (2) Settlement sheets;

        (3) Sales receipts showing grade and price or disposition to secondary market due to quality; and

        (4) Laboratory test results.

        (d) For forage crops, producers must submit verifiable documentation showing the nutrient factors for the affected production. Producers must also submit verifiable documentation of the historical nutrient factors for the 3 preceding crop years if available. The nutrient factors that must be documented for a crop will determined by the FSA county committee based on the standard practice for the crop in that county.

        (e) For all crops other than forage crops, producers must submit verifiable documentation of the total dollar value loss due to quality, if available, and verifiable documentation of grading factors due to quality.

        (f) The participant is responsible for:

        (1) Retaining, providing, and summarizing, at time of application and whenever required by FSA, the best available verifiable production records for the crop;

        (2) Providing the information in a manner that can be easily understood by the FSA county committee; and

        (3) Providing supporting documentation about the disaster event if the FSA county committee has reason to question the disaster event.

        (e) Participants must provide all records for any production of a crop that is grown with an arrangement, agreement, or contract for guaranteed payment.

        (f) Participants are required to retain documentation in support of their application for 3 years after the date of approval.

        (g) Participants receiving QLA Program payments or any other person who furnishes such information to USDA must permit authorized representatives of USDA or the Government Accountability Office, during regular business hours, to enter the agricultural operation and to inspect, examine, and make copies of books, records, or other items for the purpose of confirming the accuracy of the information provided by the participant.

        § 760.1812   Payment calculation.

#### § § 760.1812

        (a) Payments will be calculated separately for crops based on the crop type, intended use, certified organic or conventional status, county, and crop year.

        (b) For forage crops with verifiable documentation of nutrient factors for the affected production and for the 3 preceding crop years, the payment will be equal to the producer's total affected production multiplied by the producer's verifiable percentage of loss, multiplied by the average market price, multiplied by 70 percent.

        (c) For forage crops with verifiable documentation of nutrient factors for the affected production but not for the 3 preceding crop years, the payment will be equal to the producer's total affected production multiplied by the county average percentage of loss in paragraph (f) of this section, multiplied by the average market price, multiplied by 70 percent, multiplied by 50 percent.

        (d) For crops other than forage with verifiable documentation of the total dollar value loss due to quality, the payment will be equal to the producer's total dollar value loss on the affected production, multiplied by 70 percent.

        (e) For crops other than forage without verifiable documentation of the total dollar value loss but with verifiable documentation of grading factors, the payment will be equal to the producer's affected production multiplied by the county average loss per unit of measure in paragraph (g) of this section, multiplied by 70 percent, multiplied by 50 percent.

        (f) The county average percentage of loss is the average percentage of loss from producers eligible for payment under paragraph (b) of this section if at least 5 producers in a county are eligible for payment for a crop under paragraph (b) of this section. If less than 5 producers in a county are eligible for payment for a crop under paragraph (b) of this section, the Deputy Administrator will:

        (1) Determine a county average percentage of loss based on the best available data, including, but not limited to, evidence of losses in contiguous counties; or

        (2) If a county average percentage of loss cannot be determined due to insufficient data, not issue payments to applicants under paragraph (c) of this section.

        (g) The county average loss per unit of measure is based on the weighted average sales price from producers eligible for payment under paragraph (d) of this section if at least 5 producers in a county are eligible for payment for a crop under paragraph (d) of this section. If less than 5 producers are eligible for payment in a county under paragraph (d) of this section, the Deputy Administrator will:

        (1) Determine a county average loss per unit of measure based on the best available data, including, but not limited to, evidence of losses in contiguous counties; or

        (2) If a county average loss per unit of measure cannot be determined due to insufficient data, not issue payments to applicants under paragraph (e) of this section.

        § 760.1813   Availability of funds and timing of payments.

#### § § 760.1813

        (a) Payments will be issued after the application period has ended and all applications have been reviewed by FSA.

        (b) In the event that, within the limits of the funding made available by the Secretary, approval of eligible applications would result in payments in excess of the amount available, FSA will prorate payments by a national factor to reduce the payments to an amount that is less than available funds as determined by the Secretary.

        (c) Applications and claims that are unpaid or prorated for any reason will not be carried forward for payment under other funds for later years or otherwise, but will be considered, as to any unpaid amount, void and nonpayable.

        § 760.1814   Requirement to purchase crop insurance or NAP coverage.

#### § § 760.1814

        (a) For the first 2 consecutive crop years for which crop insurance or NAP coverage is available after the enrollment period for the QLA Program ends, a participant who receives payment under this subpart for a crop loss in a county must obtain:

        (1) For an insurable crop, crop insurance with at least a 60 percent coverage level for that crop in that county; or

        (2) For a NAP-eligible crop, NAP coverage with a coverage level of 60 percent.

        (b) Participants who exceed the average adjusted gross income limitation for NAP payment eligibility   for the applicable crop year may meet the purchase requirement specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section by purchasing Whole-Farm Revenue Protection crop insurance coverage, if eligible, or paying the NAP service fee and premium even though the participant will not be eligible to receive a NAP payment due to the average adjusted gross income limit.

        (c) The final crop year to purchase crop insurance or NAP coverage to meet the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section is the 2023 crop year.

        (d) A participant who obtained crop insurance or NAP coverage for the crop in accordance with the requirements for WHIP+ in § 760.1517 is considered to have met the requirement to purchase crop insurance or NAP coverage for the QLA Program.

        (e) If a producer fails to obtain crop insurance or NAP coverage as required in this section, the producer must reimburse FSA for the full amount of QLA Program payment plus interest. A producer will only be considered to have obtained NAP coverage for the purposes of this section if the participant submitted a NAP application for coverage and paid the requisite NAP service fee and any applicable premium by the applicable deadline and completed all program requirements required under the coverage agreement, including filing an acreage report.

        (c) A producer is required to certify to an adjusted allowable gross revenue for the benchmark year on FSA-521 if the producer had a decreased operation capacity in a disaster year for which they are applying for ERP Phase 2, compared to the benchmark year.

        (d) A producer may certify to an adjusted allowable gross revenue for the benchmark year on FSA-521 if either of the following apply:

        (1) The producer did not have a full year of revenue for 2018 or 2019; or

        (2) The producer had expanded their operation capacity in a disaster year for which they are applying for ERP Phase 2, compared to the benchmark year.

        (e) Change in operation capacity does not include crop rotation from year to year, changes in farming practices such as converting from conventional tillage to no-till, or increasing the rate of fertilizers or chemicals. If requested by FSA, producers are required to submit documentation to FSA to support adjustments described in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section within 30 calendar days of the request. The documentation to support an adjustment due to a change in operation capacity must show that the adjustment to the producer's benchmark revenue is due to an:

        (1) Addition or decrease in production capacity of the farming operation;

        (2) Increase or decrease in the use of existing production capacity; or

        (3) Physical alterations that were made to existing production capacity.

        (f) If a producer began farming in 2020 or 2021 and did not have allowable gross revenue in a benchmark year, the producer may certify to an adjusted benchmark allowable gross revenue on form FSA-521 that represents what had been the producer's reasonably expected disaster year revenue prior to the impact of the qualifying disaster event. If requested by FSA, documentation required to support a producer's certification must be provided within 30 calendar days of FSA's request, or the producer will be considered ineligible for ERP Phase 2. Acceptable documentation must be generated in the ordinary course of business and dated prior to the impact of the disaster event and includes, but is not limited to:

        (1) Financial documents such as a business plan or cash flow statement that demonstrate an expected level of revenue;

        (2) Sales contracts or purchase agreements; and

        (3) Documentation supporting production capacity, use of existing production capacity, or physical alterations that demonstrate production capacity.

        (g) The allowable gross revenue will be based on the year for which the revenue would be reported for the purpose of filing a tax return, except for the ERP Phase 1 payments specified in paragraph (a)(12) of this section.

        (h) Producers who file or would be eligible to file a joint tax return will certify their allowable gross revenue based on what it would have been had they filed taxes separately for the applicable year.

        (i) On form FSA-521, for each applicable disaster year, producers must indicate the percentage of their allowable gross revenue from specialty and high value crops and the percentage from other crops. The percentages certified must be equal to the percentages that the producer would have reasonably expected to receive for the disaster year if not for the qualifying disaster event.

        (j) The Deputy Administrator may determine that certain eligible crops produced by a producer that do not generate revenue for the producer directly from the sale of the crop and that the producer uses within their ordinary operation may be included in a producer's allowable gross revenue. This determination is at the Deputy Administrator's discretion. The value of the eligible crop reported in the producer's allowable gross revenue will be based on the producer's actual production of the crop and a price for the crop based on the best available data for each crop, as determined by the Deputy Administrator and published through guidance on FSA's website.

        (5) Form FSA-510, Request for an Exception to the $125,000 Payment Limitation for Certain Programs, accompanied by a certification from a certified public accountant or attorney as to that person or legal entity's certification, for a legal entity and all members of that entity, for each applicable program year, including the legal entity's members, partners, or shareholders, as provided in 7 CFR part 1400; and

        (6) Form AD-1026, Highly Erodible Land Conservation (HELC) and Wetland Conservation (WC) Certification, for the ERP Phase 2 applicant and applicable affiliates as provided in 7 CFR part 12.

        (c) If requested by FSA, the producer must provide additional documentation that establishes the producer's eligibility for ERP Phase 2. If supporting documentation is requested, the documentation must be submitted to FSA within 30 calendar days from the request or the application will be disapproved by FSA. FSA may request supporting documentation to verify information provided by the producer and the produce's eligibility including, but not limited to, the producer's:

        (1) Allowable gross revenue reported on the ERP Phase 2 application;

        (2) Percentages of the expected allowable gross revenue from:

        (i) Specialty and high value crops; and

        (ii) Other crops; and

        (3) Ownership share in the agricultural commodities.

        § 760.1905   Payment calculation.

#### § § 760.1905

        (a) ERP Phase 2 payments will be calculated separately for each disaster year. If a producer indicates that they have expected revenue for both specialty and high value crops and other crops for a disaster year, a payment will be calculated separately for:

        (1) Specialty and high value crops; and

        (2) Other crops.

        (b) To determine a producer's ERP Phase 2 payment amount, FSA will calculate:

        (1) The producer's benchmark year allowable gross revenue, adjusted according to 7 CFR 760.1903, if applicable, multiplied by the ERP factor of 70 percent; minus

        (2) The producer's disaster year allowable gross revenue; minus

        (3) The sum of the producer's gross ERP Phase 1 payments for the 2020 program year, if the calculation is for the 2020 disaster year, or for the 2021 and 2022 program years, if the calculation is for the 2021 disaster year; minus

        (4) The sum of the producer's net CFAP payments (excluding payments for contract producer revenue), net 2020 WHIP+ payments, and net 2020 Quality Loss Adjustment (QLA) Program payments, if the calculation is for the 2020 disaster year; and

        (5) Multiplied by the percentage of the expected disaster year revenue for specialty and high value crops or other crops, as applicable, to determine the separate payments for specialty and high value crops or other crops.

        (c) FSA will issue an initial payment equal to the lesser of the amount calculated according to this section or the maximum initial payment amount of $2,000. If a producer has also received a payment under ERP Phase 1, FSA will reduce the producer's initial ERP Phase 2 payment amount by subtracting the producer's ERP Phase 1 gross payment amount.

        (d) After the close of the ERP Phase 2 application period, FSA will issue a final payment equal to the amount calculated according to this section minus the amount of the producer's initial payment. If total calculated payments exceed the total funding available for ERP Phase 2, the ERP factor may be adjusted and the final payment amounts will be prorated to stay within the amount of available funding. If there are insufficient funds, a differential of 15 percent will be used for underserved producers similar to ERP Phase 1, but with a cap at the statutory maximum of 70 percent. For example, if the ERP Factor is set at 50 percent, the factor used for underserved producers will be 65 percent, but if the factor is set at 55 percent or higher, the factor for underserved producers will be capped at 70 percent.

        (e) If a producer receives assistance through CFAP or ERP Phase 1 after their ERP Phase 2 payment is calculated, the producer's ERP Phase 2 payment will be recalculated and the producer must refund any resulting overpayment.

        § 760.1906   Payment limitation and attribution.

#### § § 760.1906

        (a) The payment limitation for ERP is determined by the person's or legal entity's average adjusted gross farm income (income from activities related to farming, ranching, or forestry). Specifically, if their average adjusted gross farm income is less than 75 percent of their average adjusted gross income (AGI) for the three taxable years preceding the most immediately preceding complete tax year, a person or legal entity, other than a joint venture or general partnership, cannot receive, directly or indirectly, more than $125,000 in payments for specialty crops and high value crops   and $125,000 in payment for all other crops under:

        (1) ERP Phase 1 for program year 2020 and ERP Phase 2 for program year 2020, combined; and

        (2) ERP Phase 1 for program year 2021 and ERP Phase 2 for program year 2021, combined.

        (b) If at least 75 percent of the person or legal entity's average AGI is derived from farming, ranching, or forestry related activities and the producer provides the required certification and documentation, as discussed below, the person or legal entity, other than a joint venture or general partnership, is eligible to receive, directly or indirectly, up to:

        (1) $900,000 for specialty crops and high value crops combined for:

        (i) ERP Phase 1 for program year 2020 and ERP Phase 2 for program year 2020, combined; and

        (ii) ERP Phase 1 for program year 2021 and ERP Phase 2 for program year 2021, combined.; and

        (2) $250,000 for all other crops for:

        (i) ERP Phase 1 for program year 2020 and ERP Phase 2 for program year 2020, combined; and

        (ii) ERP Phase 1 for program year 2021 and ERP Phase 2 for program year 2021, combined.

        (c) The relevant tax years for establishing a producer's AGI and percentage derived from farming, ranching, or forestry related activities are:

        (1) Years 2016, 2017, and 2018 for program year 2020; and

        (2) Years 2017, 2018, and 2019 for program year 2021.

        (d) To receive more than $125,000 in ERP payments, producers must submit form FSA-510, accompanied by a certification from a certified public accountant or attorney as to that person or legal entity's certification. If a producer requesting the increased payment limitation is a legal entity, all members of that entity must also complete form FSA-510 and provide the required certification according to the direct attribution provisions in 7 CFR 1400.105, “Attribution of Payments.” If a legal entity would be eligible for the increased payment limitation based on the legal entity's average AGI from farming, ranching, or forestry related activities but a member of that legal entity either does not complete a form FSA-510 and provide the required certification or is not eligible for the increased payment limitation, the payment to the legal entity will be reduced for the limitation applicable to the share of the ERP Phase 2 payment attributed to that member.

        (e) If a producer files form FSA-510 and the accompanying certification after their ERP Phase 2 payment is issued but before the deadline announced by FSA, FSA will process the form FSA-510 and issue the additional payment amount if a maximum initial payment amount has not been reached.

        (f) A payment made to a legal entity will be attributed to those members who have a direct or indirect ownership interest in the legal entity, unless the payment of the legal entity has been reduced by the proportionate ownership interest of the member due to that member's ineligibility. Attribution of payments made to legal entities will be tracked through four levels of ownership in legal entities as follows:

        (1) First level of ownership: Any payment made to a legal entity that is owned in whole or in part by a person will be attributed to the person in an amount that represents the direct ownership interest in the first-level or payment legal entity;

        (2) Second level of ownership: Any payment made to a first-level legal entity that is owned in whole or in part by another legal entity (referred to as a second-level legal entity) will be attributed to the second-level legal entity in proportion to the ownership of the second-level legal entity in the first-level legal entity; if the second-level legal entity is owned in whole or in part by a person, the amount of the payment made to the first-level legal entity will be attributed to the person in the amount that represents the indirect ownership in the first-level legal entity by the person;

        (3) Third and fourth levels of ownership: Except as provided in the second-level ownership in paragraph (f)(2) of this section and in the fourth level of ownership in paragraph (f)(4) of this section, any payments made to a legal entity at the third and fourth levels of ownership will be attributed in the same manner as specified in paragraph (f)(2) of this section; and

        (4) Fourth-level of ownership: If the fourth level of ownership is that of a legal entity and not that of a person, a reduction in payment will be applied to the first-level or payment legal entity in the amount that represents the indirect ownership in the first-level or payment legal entity by the fourth-level legal entity.

        (g) Payments made directly or indirectly to a person who is a minor child will not be combined with the earnings of the minor's parent or legal guardian.

        (h) A producer that is a legal entity must provide the names, addresses, ownership share, and valid taxpayer identification numbers of the members holding an ownership interest in the legal entity. Payments to a legal entity will be reduced in proportion to a member's ownership share when a valid taxpayer identification number for a person or legal entity that holds a direct or indirect ownership interest, at the first through fourth levels of ownership in the business structure, is not provided to FSA.

        (i) If an individual or legal entity is not eligible to receive ERP Phase 2 payments due to the individual or legal entity failing to satisfy payment eligibility provisions, the payment made either directly or indirectly to the individual or legal entity will be reduced to zero. The amount of the reduction for the direct payment to the producer will be commensurate with the direct or indirect ownership interest of the ineligible individual or ineligible legal entity.

        (j) Like other programs administered by FSA, payments made to an Indian Tribe or Tribal organization, as defined in section 4(b) of the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act (25 U.S.C. 5304), will not be subject to payment limitation.

        (a) If an ERP Phase 2 payment resulted from erroneous information provided by a producer, or any person acting on their behalf, the payment will be recalculated and the producer must refund any excess payment with interest calculated from the date of the disbursement of the payment.

        (b) If FSA determines that the producer intentionally misrepresented information provided on their application, the application will be disapproved and the producer must refund the full payment to FSA with interest from the date of disbursement.

        (c) Any required refunds must be resolved in accordance with part 3 of this title.

        (d) A producer, whether a person or legal entity, that either fails to timely provide all required documentation or fails to satisfy any eligibility requirement for ERP Phase 2, is not eligible to receive ERP Phase 2 payments, directly or indirectly. An ERP Phase 2 payment to an eligible legal entity applicant whose member(s) either fails to timely provide all required documentation or fails to satisfy any eligibility requirement for ERP Phase 2 will be reduced proportionate to that member's ownership interest in the legal entity.

        (e) Any payment under this subpart will be made without regard to questions of title under State law and without regard to any claim or lien against the commodity or proceeds from the sale of the commodity. The regulations governing offsets in part 3 of this title apply to payments made under this subpart.

        (f) For the purposes of the effect of a lien on eligibility for Federal programs (28 U.S.C. 3201(e)), USDA waives the restriction on receipt of funds under ERP Phase 2 but only as to beneficiaries who, as a condition of the waiver, agree to apply the ERP Phase 2 payments to reduce the amount of the judgment lien.

        (g) In addition to any other Federal laws that apply to ERP Phase 2, the following laws apply: 15 U.S.C. 714; 18 U.S.C. 286, 287, 371, and 1001.

        § 760.1909   Perjury.

#### § § 760.1909

        In either applying for or participating in ERP Phase 2, or both, the producer is subject to laws against perjury and any resulting penalties and prosecution, including, but not limited to, 18 U.S.C. 1621. If the producer willfully makes and represents as true any verbal or written declaration, certification, statement, or verification that the producer knows or believes not to be true, in the course of either applying for or participating in ERP Phase 2, or both, then the producer may be guilty of perjury and, except as otherwise provided by law, may be fined, imprisoned for not more than 5 years, or both, regardless of whether the producer makes such verbal or written declaration, certification, statement, or verification within or without the United States.

        § 760.1910   Requirement to purchase crop insurance or NAP coverage.

#### § § 760.1910

        (a) Producers must report all crops that suffered a revenue loss in whole or in part due to a qualifying disaster event on form FSA-522, Crop Insurance and/or NAP Coverage Agreement.

        (b) All producers who receive ERP Phase 2 payments must file an accurate acreage report and purchase crop insurance or NAP coverage where crop insurance is not available, for the next 2 available crop years. For each crop reported according to paragraph (a) of this section, participants must obtain crop insurance or NAP, as may be applicable:

        (1) At a coverage level equal to or greater than 60 percent for insurable crops; or

        (2) At the catastrophic level or higher for NAP crops.

        (c) Availability will be determined from the date a producer receives an ERP payment and may vary depending on the timing and availability of crop insurance or NAP for a producer's particular crops. The final crop year to purchase crop insurance or NAP coverage to meet the second year of coverage for this requirement is the 2026 crop year.

        (d) In situations where crop insurance is unavailable for a crop, an ERP participant must obtain NAP coverage. Section 1001D of the Food Security Act of 1985 (1985 Farm Bill) provides that a person or entity with an AGI greater than $900,000 is not eligible to participate in NAP; however, producers with an AGI greater than $900,000 are eligible for ERP. To reconcile this restriction in the 1985 Farm Bill and the requirement to obtain NAP or crop insurance coverage, ERP participants may meet the purchase requirement by purchasing Whole-Farm Revenue Protection (WFRP) crop insurance coverage, if eligible, or they may pay the applicable NAP service fee despite their ineligibility for a NAP payment. In other words, the service fee must be paid even though no NAP payment may be made because the AGI of the person or entity exceeds the 1985 Farm Bill limitation.

        (e) If both Federal crop insurance and NAP coverage are unavailable for a crop, the producer must obtain WFRP crop insurance coverage, if eligible.

        (f) For all crops listed on form FSA-522, producers who have the crop or crop acreage in subsequent years and who fail to obtain the 2 years of crop insurance or NAP coverage required as required by this section, must refund the ERP Phase 2 payment with interest from the date of disbursement. Producers who do not plant a crop listed on form FSA-522 in a year for which this requirement applies are not subject to the crop insurance or NAP purchase requirement for that year.

        (g) Producers who received an ERP Phase 1 payment for a crop are not required to obtain additional years of crop insurance or NAP coverage for that crop if they also receive an ERP Phase 2 payment for a loss associated with that crop.

        (iii) FSA Farm Program actual yield records;

        (iv) County averages;

        (v) State averages.

        (4) If the applicant or borrower's production history has been substantially affected by a disaster declared by the President or designated by the Secretary of Agriculture, or the applicant or borrower has had a qualifying loss from such disaster but the farming operation was not located in a declared or designated disaster area, the applicant or borrower may:

        (i) Use county average yields, or state average yields if county average yields are not available, in place of the disaster year yields when the county or state average yields are realistic and reasonable compared to the applicant's actual non-disaster year yields, as determined by the agency approval official; or

        (ii) Exclude the production year with the lowest actual or county average yield if their yields were affected by disasters during at least 2 of the 3 years.

        (d) Unit prices for agricultural commodities established by the Agency will generally be used. Applicants and borrowers that provide evidence that they will receive a premium price for a commodity may use a price above the price established by the Agency.

        (e) For MLs, when projected yields and unit prices cannot be determined as specified in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section because the data is not available or practicable, other documentation from other reliable sources may be used to assist in developing the applicant's farm operating plan.

        (f) Development of farm operating plans and determination of appropriate repayment terms must include consideration of a reasonable amount of cash flow margin to increase working capital reserves and savings, including reasonable savings for retirement and education, to support operational stability and growth.

        (g) Except as provided in paragraph (h) of this section, the applicant or borrower must sign the final farm operating plan prior to approval of any loan or servicing action.

        (h) If the Agency believes the applicant or borrower's farm operating plan is inaccurate, or the information upon which it is based cannot be verified, the Agency will discuss and try to resolve the concerns with the applicant or borrower. If an agreement cannot be reached, the Agency will make loan approval and servicing determinations based on the Agency's revised farm operating plan.

        (a) This subpart addresses:

        (1) The allocation of funds for direct and guaranteed FO, CL, and OL loans;

        (2) The establishment of socially disadvantaged target participation rates; and

        (3) The reservation of loan funds for beginning farmers.

        (b) The Agency does not allocate EM loan funds to State Offices but makes funds available following a designated or declared disaster. EM loan funds are available on a first-come first-served basis.

        § 761.202   Timing of allocations.

#### § § 761.202

        The Agency's National Office allocates funds for FO, CL, and OL loans to the State Offices on a fiscal year basis, as made available by the Office of Management and Budget. However, the National Office will retain control over the funds when funding or administrative constraints make allocation to State Offices impractical.

        § 761.203   National reserves for Farm Ownership and Operating loans.

#### § § 761.203

        (a)  At the start of each fiscal year, the National Office reserves a portion of the funds available for each direct and guaranteed loan program. These reserves enable the Agency to meet unexpected or justifiable program needs during the fiscal year.

        (b)  The National Office distributes funds from the reserve to one or more State Offices to meet a program need or Agency objective.

        § 761.204   Methods of allocating funds to State Offices.

#### § § 761.204

        FO, CL, and OL loan funds are allocated to State Offices using one or more of the following allocation methods:

        (a) Formula allocation, if data, as specified in § 761.205, is available to use the formula for the State.

        (b) Administrative allocation, if the Agency cannot adequately meet program objectives with a formula allocation. The National Office determines the amount of an administrative allocation on a case-by-case basis.

        (c) Base allocation, to ensure funding for at least one loan in each State, District, or County Office. In making a base allocation, the National Office may use criteria other than those used in the formula allocation, such as historical Agency funding information.

> [72 FR 63285, Nov. 8, 2007, as amended at 75 FR 54013, Sept. 3, 2010]

        § 761.205   Computing the formula allocation.

#### § § 761.205

        (a) The formula allocation for FO, CL, or OL loan funds is equal to:

        (1) The amount available for allocation by the Agency minus the amounts held in the National Office reserve and distributed by base and administrative allocation, multiplied by

        (2) The State Factor, which represents the percentage of the total amount of the funds for a loan program that the National Office allocates to a State Office.

        (b) To calculate the State Factor, the Agency:

        (1) Uses the following criteria, data sources, and weights:

        (2) Determines each State's percentage of the national total for each criterion;

        (3) Multiplies the percentage for each State determined in paragraph (b)(2) of this section by the applicable weight for that criterion;

        (4) Sums the weighted criteria for each State to obtain the State factor.

#### § § 761.206

        The Agency periodically pools unobligated FO, CL, and OL loan funds that have been allocated to State Offices. When pooling these funds, the Agency places all unobligated funds in the appropriate National Office reserve. The pooled funds may be retained in the national reserve or reallocated to the States.

#### § § 761.207

        A State Office may distribute its allocation of loan funds to District or County level using the same allocation methods that are available to the National Office. State Offices may reserve a portion of the funds to meet unexpected or justifiable program needs during the fiscal year.

        § 761.208   Target participation rates for socially disadvantaged groups.

        (b)  The FO and CL, loan target participation rate based on ethnicity or race in each:

        (1) State is equal to the percent of the total rural population in the State who are members of such socially disadvantaged groups.

        (2) County is equal to the percent of rural population in the county who are members of such socially disadvantaged groups.

        (c)  The OL loan target participation rate based on ethnicity or race in each:

#### § §§ 762.1-762.100

      § 762.101   Introduction.

#### § § 762.101

      (a)  This subpart contains regulations governing Operating loans, Farm Ownership loans, and Conservation loans guaranteed by the Agency. This subpart applies to lenders, holders, borrowers, Agency personnel, and other parties involved in making, guaranteeing, holding, servicing, or liquidating such loans.

      (b)  The Agency maintains a current list of lenders who express a desire to participate in the guaranteed loan program. This list is made available to farmers upon request.

      (c)  Lenders who participate in the Agency guaranteed loan program will be classified into one of the following categories:

      (1) Standard Eligible Lender under § 762.105;

      (2) Certified Lender;

      (3) Preferred Lender under § 762.106; or

      (4) Micro Lender under § 762.107.

      (d)  Guarantees are available for both a loan note or a line of credit. A loan note is used for a loan of fixed amount and term. A line of credit has a fixed term, but no fixed amount. The principal amount outstanding at any time, however, may not exceed the line of credit ceiling contained in the contract. Both guarantees are evidenced by the same loan guarantee form.

      (e)  The loan guarantee will automatically terminate as follows:

      (1) Upon full payment of the guaranteed loan. A zero balance within the period authorized for advances on a line of credit will not terminate the guarantee;

      (2) Upon payment of a final loss claim; or

      (3) Upon written notice from the lender to the Agency that a guarantee is no longer desired provided the lender holds all of the guaranteed portion of the loan. The loan guarantee will be returned to the Agency office for cancellation within 30 days of the date of the notice by the lender.

      § 762.103   Full faith and credit.

#### § § 762.103

      (a)  The loan guarantee constitutes an obligation supported by the full faith and credit of the United States. The Agency may contest the guarantee only in cases of fraud or misrepresentation by a lender or holder, in which:

      (1) The lender or holder had actual knowledge of the fraud or misrepresentation at the time it became the lender or holder, or

      (2) The lender or holder participated in or condoned the fraud or misrepresentation.

      (b)  The loan guarantee cannot be enforced by the lender, regardless of when the Agency discovers the violation, to the extent that the loss is a result of:

      (1) Violation of usury laws;

      (2) Negligent servicing;

      (A) The lender documents in writing why the excessive loss rate is beyond their control;

      (B) The lender provides a written plan that will reduce the loss rate to the PLP maximum rate within two years from the date of the plan, and

      (C) The Agency determines that exceeding the maximum PLP loss rate standard was beyond the control of the lender. Examples include, but are not limited to, a freeze with only local impact, economic downturn in a local area, drop in local land values, industries moving into or out of an area, loss of access to a market, and biological or chemical damage.

      (D) The Agency will revoke PLP status if the maximum PLP loss rate is not met at the end of the two-year period, unless a second two year extension is granted under this subsection.

      (iii) Knowingly submitting false or misleading information to the Agency;

      (3) A lender which has lost PLP or CLP status must be reconsidered for eligibility to continue as a Standard Eligible Lender (for former PLP and CLP lenders), or as a CLP lender (for former PLP lenders) in submitting loan guarantee requests. They may reapply for CLP or PLP status when the problem causing them to lose their status has been resolved.

      (ii) Waive eligibility for emergency crop loss assistance in connection with the uninsured crop. EM loan assistance under part 764 of this chapter is not considered emergency crop loss assistance for purposes of this waiver and execution of the waiver does not render the borrower ineligible for EM loans.

      (3) Applicants must purchase flood insurance if buildings are or will be located in a special flood hazard area as defined by FEMA flood hazard area maps and if flood insurance is available.

      (4) Insurance, including crop insurance, must be obtained as required by the lender or the Agency based on the strengths and weaknesses of the loan.

      § 762.124   Interest rates, terms, charges, and fees.

#### § § 762.124

      (a)  (1) The interest rate on a guaranteed loan or line of credit may be fixed or variable as agreed upon between the borrower and the lender. The lender may charge different rates on the guaranteed and the non-guaranteed portions of the note. The guaranteed portion may be fixed while the unguaranteed portion may be variable, or vice versa. If both portions are variable, different bases may be used.

      (2) If a variable rate is used, it must be tied to an index or rate specifically agreed to between the lender and borrower in the loan instruments and the rate adjustments must be in accordance with normal practices of the lender for unguaranteed loans. Upon request, the lender must provide the Agency with copies of its written rate adjustment practices.

      (3) At the time of loan closing or loan restructuring, the interest rate on both the guaranteed portion and the unguaranteed portion of a fixed or variable rate OL or FO loan may not exceed the rates established and announced by the Agency on the FSA website ().

      (4) Interest must be charged only on the actual amount of funds advanced and for the actual time the funds are outstanding. Interest on protective advances made by the lender to protect the security will be charged at the note rate but limited to paragraph (a)(3) of this section.

      (5) The lender and borrower may collectively obtain a temporary reduction in the interest rate through the interest assistance program in accordance with § 762.150.

      (b)  (1) Loan funds or advances on a line of credit used to pay annual operating expenses will be repaid when the income from the year's operation is received, except when the borrower is establishing a new enterprise, developing a farm, purchasing feed while feed crops are being established, or recovering from disaster or economic reverses.

      (2) The final maturity date for each loan cannot exceed 7 years from the date of the promissory note or line of credit agreement. Advances for purposes other than for annual operating expenses will be scheduled for repayment over the minimum period necessary considering the applicant's ability to repay and the useful life of the security, but not in excess of 7 years.

      (3) All advances on a line of credit must be made within 5 years from the date of the Loan Guarantee.

      (c)  Each loan must be scheduled for repayment over a period not to exceed 40 years from the date of the note or such shorter period as may be necessary to assure that the loan will be adequately secured, taking into account the probable depreciation of the security.

      (d)  Each loan must be scheduled for repayment over a period not to exceed 30 years from the date of the note or such shorter period as may be necessary to assure that the loan will be adequately secured, taking into account the probable depreciation of the security.

      (e)  Balloon payment terms are permitted on FO, OL, or CL subject to the following:

      (1) Extended repayment schedules may include equal, unequal, or balloon installments if needed by a borrower on any guaranteed loan to establish a new enterprise, develop a farm, recover from a disaster or an economical reversal, or reasonably increase cash flow margin to increase working capital reserves and savings, including reasonable savings for retirement and education.

      (2) Loans with balloon installments must have adequate collateral at the time the balloon installment comes due. Crops, livestock other than breeding livestock, or livestock products produced are not sufficient collateral for securing such a loan.

      (3) The borrower must be projected to be able to refinance the remaining debt at the time the balloon payment comes due based on the expected financial condition of the operation, the depreciated value of the collateral, and the principal balance on the loan.

      (f)  (1) The lender may charge the applicant and borrower fees for the loan provided they are no greater than those charged to unguaranteed customers for similar transactions. Similar transactions are those involving the same type of loan requested (for example, operating loans or farm real estate loans).

      (2) Late payment charges (including default interest charges) are not covered by the guarantee. These charges may not be added to the principal and interest due under any guaranteed note or line of credit. However, late payment charges may be made outside of the guarantee if they are routinely made by the lender in similar types of loan transactions.

      (3) Lenders may not charge a loan origination and servicing fee greater than 1 percent of the loan amount for the life of the loan when a guaranteed loan is made in conjunction with a down payment FO under part 764 of this chapter.

      § 762.125   Financial feasibility.

#### § § 762.125

      (a)  Except for streamlined CL guarantees (see § 762.110(f)), the following requirements must be met:

      (1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, PLP lenders will follow their internal procedures on financial feasibility as agreed to by the Agency during PLP certification.

      (2) The applicant's proposed operation must project a feasible plan.

      (3) For standard eligible lenders, the projected income and expenses of the borrower and operation used to determine a feasible plan must be based on the applicant's proven record of production and financial management.

      (4) For CLP lenders, the projected income and expenses of the borrower and the operation must be based on the applicant's financial history and proven record of financial management.

      (5) For those farmers without a proven history, a combination of any actual history and any other reliable source of information that are agreeable with the lender, the applicant, and the Agency will be used.

      (6) The cash flow budget analyzed to determine a feasible plan must represent the predicted cash flow of the operating cycle.

      (7) Lenders must use price forecasts that are reasonable and defensible. Sources must be documented by the lender and acceptable to the Agency.

      (8) When a feasible plan depends on income from other sources in addition to income from owned land, the income must be dependable and likely to continue.

      (9) The lender will analyze business ventures other than the farm operation to determine their soundness and contribution to the operation. Except for CL, guaranteed loan funds will not be used to finance a nonfarm enterprise. Nonfarm enterprises include, but are not limited to: raising earthworms, exotic birds, tropical fish, dogs, or horses for nonfarm purposes; welding shops; boarding horses; and riding stables.

      (10) When the applicant has or will have a cash flow budget developed in conjunction with a proposed or existing Agency direct loan, the two cash flow budgets must be consistent.

      (b)  Except for streamlined CL guarantees (see § 762.110(f)), the following requirements must be met:

      (1) Standard eligible lenders must use the best sources of information available for estimating production in accordance with this subsection when developing cash flow budgets.

      (2) Deviations from historical performance may be acceptable, if specific to changes in operation and adequately justified and acceptable to the Agency.

      (3) For existing farmers, actual production for the past 3 years will be utilized.

      (4) For those farmers without a proven history, a combination of any actual history and any other reliable source of information that are agreeable with the lender, the applicant, and the Agency will be used.

      (5) When the production of a growing commodity can be estimated, it must be considered when projecting yields.

      (6) When the applicant's production history has been so severely affected by a declared disaster that an accurate projection cannot be made, the following applies:

      (i) County average yields are used for the disaster year if the applicant's disaster year yields are less than the county average yields. If county average yields are not available, State average yields are used. Adjustments can be made, provided there is factual evidence to demonstrate that the yield used in the farm plan is the most probable to be realized.

      (ii) To calculate a historical yield, the crop year with the lowest actual or county average yield may be excluded, provided the applicant's yields were affected by disasters at least 2 of the previous 5 consecutive years.

      (c)  Loan guarantee requests for refinancing must ensure that a reasonable chance for success still exists. The lender must demonstrate that problems with the applicant's operation that have been identified, can be corrected, and the operation returned to a sound financial basis.

      (d)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this section:

      (1) The Agency will evaluate EZ Guarantee application financial feasibility using criteria determined and announced by the Agency on the FSA Web site ().

      (2)  applications that satisfy the criteria will be determined to meet the financial feasibility standards in this section.

      (3)  applications that do not satisfy the criteria will require further documentation as determined by the Agency and announced on the FSA Web site ().

      § 762.126   Security requirements.

#### § § 762.126

      (a)  (1) The lender is responsible for ensuring that proper and adequate security is obtained and maintained to fully secure the loan, protect the interest of the lender and the Agency, and assure repayment of the loan or line of credit.

      (2) The lender will obtain a lien on additional security when necessary to protect the Agency's interest.

      (b)  (1) All security must secure the entire loan or line of credit. The lender may not take separate security to secure only that portion of the loan or line of credit not covered by the guarantee.

      (2) The lender may not require compensating balances or certificates of deposit as means of eliminating the lender's exposure on the unguaranteed portion of the loan or line of credit. However, compensating balances or certificates of deposit as otherwise used in the ordinary course of business are allowed for both the guaranteed and unguaranteed portions.

      (c)  The guaranteed loan must be secured by identifiable collateral. To be identifiable, the lender must be able to distinguish the collateral item and adequately describe it in the security instrument.

      (d)  (1) Guaranteed loans may be secured by any property if the term of the loan and expected life of the property will not cause the loan to be undersecured.

      (2) For loans with terms greater than 7 years, a lien must be taken on real estate.

      (3) Loans can be secured by a mortgage on leasehold properties if the lease has a negotiable value and is subject to being mortgaged.

      (4) The lender or Agency may require additional personal and corporate guarantees to adequately secure the loan. These guarantees are separate from, and in addition to, the personal obligations arising from members of an entity signing the note as individuals.

      (e)  All guaranteed loans will be secured by the best lien obtainable. Provided that:

      (1) Any chattel-secured guaranteed loan must have a higher lien priority (including purchase money interest) than an unguaranteed loan secured by the same chattels and held by the same lender.

      (2) Junior lien positions are acceptable only if the total amount of debt with liens on the security, including the debt in junior lien position, is less than or equal to 85 percent of the value of the security. Junior liens on crops or livestock products will not be relied upon for security unless the lender is involved in multiple guaranteed loans to the same borrower and also has the first lien on the collateral.

      (3) When taking a junior lien, prior lien instruments will not contain future advance clauses (except for taxes, insurance, or other reasonable costs to protect security), or cancellation, summary forfeiture, or other clauses that jeopardize the Government's or the lender's interest or the borrower's ability to pay the guaranteed loan, unless any such undesirable provisions are limited, modified, waived or subordinated by the lienholder for the benefit of the Agency and the lender.

      (f) Additional security, or any loan of $10,000 or less may be secured by the best lien obtainable on real estate without title clearance or legal services normally required, provided the lender believes from a search of the county records that the applicant can give a mortgage on the farm and provided that the lender would, in the normal course of business, waive the title search. This exception to title clearance will not apply when land is to be purchased.

      (g)  If security has multiple owners, all owners must execute the security documents for the loan.

      (h)  The Deputy Administrator for Farm Loan Programs has the authority to grant an exception to any of the requirements involving security, if the proposed change is in the best interest of the Government and the collection of the loan will not be impaired.

#### § § 762.127

      (a)  The general requirements for an appraisal are:

      (1)  The lender is responsible for ensuring that the value of chattel and real estate pledged as collateral is sufficient to fully secure the guaranteed loan.

      (2)  The lender is not required to complete an appraisal or evaluation of collateral that will serve as additional security, but the lender must provide an estimated value.

      (3)  Except for authorized liquidation expenses, the lender is responsible for all appraisal costs, which may be passed on to the borrower or transferee in the case of a transfer and assumption.

      (b)  The requirements for chattel appraisals are:

      (1)  A current appraisal (not more than 12 months old) of primary chattel security is required on all loans except loans or lines of credit for annual production purposes secured by crops, which require an appraisal only when the guarantee is requested late in the current production year and actual yields can be reasonably estimated. An appraisal is not required for loans of $50,000 or less if a strong equity position exists.

      (2)  The appraised value of chattel property will be based on public sales of the same or similar property in the market area. In the absence of such public sales, reputable publications reflecting market values may be used.

      (3)  Appraisal reports may be on the Agency's appraisal of chattel property form or on any other appraisal form containing at least the same information.

      (4)  Chattel appraisals will be performed by appraisers who possess sufficient experience or training to establish market (not retail) values as determined by the Agency.

      (c)  The requirements for real estate appraisals are:

      (1)  The lender must document the value of the real estate by applying the same policies and procedures as their non-guaranteed loans.

      (2)  The lender must document the value of real estate using a current appraisal (not more than 18 months old) completed by a State Certified General Appraiser. Real estate appraisals must be completed in accordance with USPAP. Restricted reports as defined in USPAP are not acceptable. The Agency may allow an appraisal more than 18 months old to be used only if documentation provided by the lender reflects each of the following:

      (i) Market conditions have remained stable or improved based on sales of similar properties,

      (ii) The property in question remains in the same or better condition, and

      (iii) The value of the property has remained the same or increased.

      (3) Agency determinations under paragraph (c)(2) of this section to permit appraisals more than 18 months old are not appealable.

      § 762.128   Environmental and special laws.

#### § § 762.128

      (a)  The requirements found in part 799 of this chapter must be met for guaranteed OL, FO, and CL. CLP, PLP, and MLP lenders may certify that they have documentation in their file to demonstrate compliance with paragraph (c) of this section. Standard eligible lenders must submit evidence supporting compliance with this section.

      (b)  The Agency determination of whether an environmental problem exists will be based on:

      (1) The information supplied with the application;

      (2) The Agency Official's personal knowledge of the operation;

      (3) Environmental resources available to the Agency including, but not limited to, documents, third parties, and governmental agencies;

      (4) A visit to the farm operation when the available information is insufficient to make a determination;

      (5) Other information supplied by the lender or applicant upon Agency request. If necessary, information not supplied with the application will be requested by the Agency.

      (c)  Lenders will assist in the environmental review process by providing environmental information. In all cases, the lender must retain documentation of their investigation in the applicant's case file.

      (1) A determination must be made as to whether there are any potential impacts to a 100 year floodplain as defined by Federal Emergency Management Agency floodplain maps, Natural Resources Conservation Service data, or other appropriate documentation.

      (2) The lender will assist the borrower in securing any applicable permits or waste management plans. The lender may consult with the Agency for guidance on activities which require consultation with State regulatory agencies, special permitting or waste management plans.

      (3) The lender will examine the security property to determine if there are any structures or archeological sites which are listed or may be eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places. The lender may consult with the Agency for guidance on which situations will need further review in accordance with the National Historical Preservation Act and part 799 of this chapter.

      (4) The applicant must certify they will not violate the provisions of § 363 of the Act, the Food Security Act of 1985, and Executive Order 11990 relating to Highly Erodible Land and Wetlands.

      (5) All lenders are required to ensure that due diligence is performed in conjunction with a request for guarantee of a loan involving real estate. Due diligence is the process of evaluating real estate in the context of a real estate transaction to determine the presence of contamination from release of hazardous substances, petroleum products, or other environmental hazards and determining what effect, if any, the contamination has on the security value of the property. The Agency will accept as evidence of due diligence the most current version of the American Society of Testing Materials (ASTM) transaction screen questionnaire available from 100 Barr Harbor Drive, West Conshohocken, Pennsylvania 19428-2959, or similar documentation, approved for use by the Agency, supplemented as necessary by the ASTM phase I environmental site assessments form.

      (d)  (1) With respect to any aspect of a credit transaction, the lender will not discriminate against any applicant on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, or age, provided the applicant can execute a legal contract. Nor will the lender discriminate on the basis of whether all or a part of the applicant's income derives from any public assistance program, or whether the applicant in good faith, exercises any rights under the Consumer Protection Act.

      (2) Where the guaranteed loan involves construction, the contractor or subcontractor must file all compliance reports, equal opportunity and nondiscrimination forms, and otherwise comply with all regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Labor pursuant to Executive Orders 11246 and 11375.

      (e)  Lenders are required to coordinate with all appropriate Federal, State, and local agencies and comply with special laws and regulations applicable to the loan proposal.

      (i) To permit a guaranteed lender to advance funds and perfect a security interest in crops, feeder livestock, livestock offspring, or livestock products;

      (3) The lender may not subordinate its interest in property which secures a guaranteed loan except as follows:

      (i) The lender may subordinate its security interest in crops, feeder livestock, livestock offspring, or livestock products when no funds have been advanced from the guaranteed loan for their production, so a lender can make a loan for annual production expenses; or

      (ii) The lender may, with written Agency approval, subordinate its interest in basic security in cases where the subordination is required to refinance an existing prior lien, no additional debt is being incurred, and the lender's security position will not be adversely affected by the subordination.

      § 762.144   Repurchase of guaranteed portion from a secondary market holder.

#### § § 762.144

      (a)  The holder may request the lender to repurchase the unpaid guaranteed portion of the loan when:

      (1) The borrower has not made a payment of principal and interest due on the loan for at least 60 days; or

      (2) The lender has failed to remit to the holder its pro-rata share of any payment made by the borrower within 30 days of receipt of a payment.

      (b)  (1) When a lender is requested to repurchase a loan from the holder, the lender must consider the request according to the servicing actions that are necessary on the loan. In order to facilitate servicing and simplified accounting of loan transactions, lenders are encouraged to repurchase the loan upon the holder's request.

      (2) The repurchase by the lender will be for an amount equal to the portion of the loan held by the holder plus accrued interest.

      (3) The guarantee will not cover separate servicing fees that the lender accrues after the repurchase.

      (c)  (1) If the lender does not repurchase the loan, the holder must inform the Agency in writing that demand was made on the lender and the lender refused. Following the lender's refusal, the holder may continue as holder of the guaranteed portion of the loan or request that the Agency purchase the guaranteed portion. Within 30 days after written demand to the Agency from the holder with required attachments, the Agency will forward to the holder payment of the unpaid principal balance, with accrued interest to the date of repurchase. If the holder does not desire repurchase or purchase of a defaulted loan, the lender must forward the holder its pro-rata share of payments, liquidation proceeds and Agency loss payments.

      (2) With its demand on the Agency, the holder must include:

      (i) A copy of the written demand made upon the lender.

      (ii) Originals of the guarantee and note properly endorsed to the Agency, or the original of the assignment of guarantee.

      (iii) A copy of any written response to the demand of the holder by the lender.

      (iv) An account to which the Agency can forward the purchase amount via electronic funds transfer.

      (3) The amount due the holder from the Agency includes unpaid principal, unpaid interest to the date of demand, and interest which has accrued from the date of demand to the proposed payment date.

      (i) Upon request by the Agency, the lender must furnish upon Agency request a current statement, certified by a bank officer, of the unpaid principal and interest owed by the borrower and the amount due the holder.

      (ii) Any discrepancy between the amount claimed by the holder and the information submitted by the lender must be resolved by the lender and the holder before payment will be approved by the Agency. The Agency will not participate in resolution of any such discrepancy. When there is a discrepancy, the 30 day Agency payment requirement to the holder will be suspended until the discrepancy is resolved.

      (iii) In the case of a request for Agency purchase, the Agency will only pay interest that accrues for up to 90 days from the date of the demand letter to the lender requesting the repurchase. However, if the holder requested repurchase from the Agency within 60 days of the request to the lender and for any reason not attributable to the holder and the lender, the Agency cannot make payment within 30 days of the holder's demand to the Agency, the holder will be entitled to interest to the date of payment.

      (4) At the time of purchase by the Agency, the original assignment of guarantee will be assigned by the holder to the Agency without recourse, including all rights, title, and interest in the loan.

      (5) Purchase by the Agency does not change, alter, or modify any of the lender's obligations to the Agency specified in the lender's agreement or guarantee; nor does the purchase waive any of the Agency's rights against the lender.

      (6) The Agency succeeds to all rights of the holder under the Guarantee including the right of set-off against the lender.

      (7) Within 180 days of the Agency's purchase, the lender will reimburse the Agency the amount of repurchase, with accrued interest, through one of the following ways:

      (i) By liquidating the loan security and paying the Agency its pro-rata share of liquidation proceeds; or

      (ii) Paying the Agency the full amount the Agency paid to the holder plus any accrued interest.

      (8) The lender will be liable for the purchase amount and any expenses incurred by the Agency to maintain the loan in its portfolio or liquidate the security. While the Agency holds the guaranteed portion of the loan, the lender will transmit to the Agency any payment received from the borrower, including the pro-rata share of liquidation or other proceeds.

      (9) If the borrower files for reorganization under the provisions of the bankruptcy code or pays the account current while the purchase by the Government is being processed, the Agency may hold the loan as long it determines this action to be in the Agency's interest. If the lender is not proceeding expeditiously to collect the loan or reimbursement is not waived under this paragraph, the Agency will demand payment by the lender and collect the purchase amount through administrative offset of any claims due the lender.

      (10) The Agency may sell a purchased guaranteed loan on a non-recourse basis if it determines that selling the portion of the loan that it holds is in the Government's best interest. A non-recourse purchase from the Agency requires a written request to the Agency from the party that wishes to purchase it, and written concurrence from the lender;

      (d)  (1) If, due to loan default or imminent loan restructuring, the lender determines that repurchase is necessary to adequately service the loan, the lender may repurchase the guaranteed portion of the loan from the holder, with the written approval of the Agency.

      (2) The lender will not repurchase from the holder for arbitrage purposes. With its request for Agency concurrence, the lender will notify the Agency of its plans to resell the guaranteed portion following servicing.

      (3) The holder will sell the guaranteed portion of the loan to the lender for an amount agreed to between the lender and holder.

      § 762.145   Restructuring guaranteed loans.

#### § § 762.145

      (a)  (1) To restructure guaranteed loans standard eligible lenders must:

      (i) Obtain prior written approval of the Agency for all restructuring actions; and,

      (ii) Provide the items in paragraph (b) and (e) of this section to the Agency for approval.

      (2) If the standard eligible lender's proposal for servicing is not agreed to by the Agency, the Agency approval official will notify the lender in writing within 14 days of the lender's request.

      (3) To restructure guaranteed loans CLP lenders must:

      (i) Obtain prior written approval of the Agency only for debt write- down under this section.

      (ii) Submit all calculations required in paragraph (e) of this section for debt write-down.

      (iii) For restructuring other than write-down, provide FSA with a certification that each requirement of this section has been met, a narrative outlining the circumstances surrounding the need for restructuring, and copies of any applicable calculations.

      (4) PLP lenders will restructure loans in accordance with their lender's agreement.

      (5) All lenders will submit copies of any restructured notes or lines of credit to the Agency.

      (b)  For any restructuring action, the following conditions apply:

      (1) The borrower meets the eligibility criteria of § 762.120, except the provisions regarding prior debt forgiveness and delinquency on a federal debt do not apply.

      (2) The borrower's ability to make the amended payment is documented by the following:

      (i) A feasible plan.

      (ii) Current financial statements from all liable parties.

      (iii) Verification of nonfarm income.

      (iv) Verification of all debts of exceeding an amount determined by the Agency.

      (v) Applicable credit reports.

      (vi) Financial history (and production history for standard eligible lenders) for the past 3 years to support the cash flow projections.

      (3) A final loss claim may be reduced, adjusted, or rejected as a result of negligent servicing after the concurrence with a restructuring action under this section.

      (4) Loans can be restructured using a balloon payment, equal installments, or unequal installments. Under no circumstances may crops or livestock, other than breeding livestock, be the only security for a loan to be rescheduled using a balloon payment. If a balloon payment is used, the projected value of the security must indicate that the loan will be fully secured when the balloon payment becomes due. The projected value will be derived from a current appraisal adjusted for depreciation of depreciable property, such as buildings and other improvements, that occurs until the balloon payment is due. For other security, a current appraisal is required. The lender is required to project the security value at the time the balloon payment is due based on the remaining life of the security, or the depreciation schedule on the borrower's Federal income tax return. Loans restructured with a balloon payment that are secured by real estate will have a minimum term of 5 years, and other loans will have a minimum term of 3 years before the scheduled balloon payment. If statutory limits on terms of loans prevent the minimum terms, balloon payments may not be used. If the loan is rescheduled with unequal installments, a feasible plan, as defined in § 762.2(b), must be projected for when installments are scheduled to increase.

      (5) If a borrower is current on a loan, but will be unable to make a payment, a restructuring proposal may be submitted prior to the payment coming due.

      (6) The lender may capitalize the outstanding interest when restructuring the loan as follows:

      (i) As a result of the capitalization of interest, a rescheduled promissory note may increase the amount of principal the borrower is required to pay. However, in no case will such principal amount exceed the statutory loan limits contained in § 761.8 of this chapter.

      (ii) When accrued interest causes the loan amount to exceed the statutory loan limits, rescheduling may be approved without capitalization of the amount that exceeds the limit. Noncapitalized interest may be scheduled for repayment over the term of the rescheduled note.

      (iii) Only interest that has accrued at the rate indicated on the borrower's original promissory notes may be capitalized. Late payment fees or default interest penalties that have accrued due to the borrower's failure to make payments as agreed are not covered under the guarantee and may not be capitalized.

      (iv) The Agency will execute a modification of guarantee form to identify the new loan principal and the guaranteed portion if greater than the original loan amounts, and to waive the restriction on capitalization of interest, if applicable, to the existing guarantee documents. The modification form will be attached to the original guarantee as an addendum.

      (v) Approved capitalized interest will be treated as part of the principal and interest that accrues thereon, in the event that a loss should occur.

      (7) The lender's security position will not be adversely affected because of the restructuring. New security instruments may be taken if needed, but a loan does not have to be fully secured in order to be restructured, unless it is restructured with a balloon payment. When a loan is restructured using a balloon payment the lender must project the loan to be fully secured at the time the balloon payment becomes due, in accordance with paragraph (b)(4) of this section.

      (8) Any holder agrees to any changes in the original loan terms. If the holder does not agree, the lender must repurchase the loan from the holder for any loan restructuring to occur.

      (9) After a guaranteed loan is restructured, the lender must provide the Agency with a copy of the restructured promissory note.

      (10) For CL, the lender must ensure that the borrower is maintaining the practice for which the CL was made.

      (c)  The following conditions apply when a guaranteed loan is rescheduled or reamortized:

      (1) Payments will be rescheduled within the following terms:

      (i) FO and existing SW may be amortized over the remaining term of the note or rescheduled with an uneven payment schedule. The maturity date cannot exceed 40 years from the date of the original note.

      (ii) OL notes must be rescheduled over a period not to exceed 15 years from the date of the rescheduling. An OL line of credit may be rescheduled over a period not to exceed 7 years from the date of the rescheduling or 10 years from the date of the original note, whichever is less. Advances cannot be made against a line of credit loan that has had any portion of the loan rescheduled.

      (iii) CL will be amortized over the remaining term or rescheduled with an uneven payment schedule. The maturity date cannot exceed 30 years from the date of the original note.

      (2) The interest rate for a rescheduled loan is the negotiated rate agreed upon by the lender and the borrower at the time of the action, subject to the loan limitations for each type of loan.

      (3) A new note is not necessary when rescheduling occurs. However, if a new note is not taken, the existing note or line of credit agreement must be modified by attaching an allonge or other legally effective amendment, evidencing the revised repayment schedule and any interest rate change. If a new note is taken, the new note must reference the old note and state that the indebtedness evidenced by the old note or line of credit agreement is not satisfied. The original note or line of credit agreement must be retained.

      (d)  The following conditions apply to deferrals:

      (1) Payments may be deferred up to 5 years, but the loan may not be extended beyond the final due date of the note.

      (2) The principal portion of the payment may be deferred either in whole or in part.

      (3) Interest may be deferred only in part. Payment of a reasonable portion of accruing interest as indicated by the borrower's cash flow projections is required for multi-year deferrals.

      (4) There must be a reasonable prospect that the borrower will be able to resume full payments at the end of the deferral period.

      (e)  The following conditions apply to debt write-down:

      (1) A lender may only writedown a delinquent guaranteed loan or line of credit in an amount sufficient to permit the borrower to develop a feasible plan as defined in § 762.102(b).

      (2) The lender will request other creditors to negotiate their debts before a write-down is considered.

      (3) The borrower cannot develop a feasible plan after consideration is given to rescheduling and deferral under this section.

      (4) The present value of the loan to be written down, based on the interest rate of the rescheduled loan, will be equal to or exceed the net recovery value of the loan collateral.

      (5) The loan will be restructured with regular payments at terms no shorter than 5 years for a line of credit and OL term note; and no shorter than 20 years for FO and CL, unless required to be shorter by paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section.

      (6) No further advances may be made on a line of credit that is written down.

      (7) Loans may not be written down with interest assistance. If a borrower's loan presently on interest assistance requires a write-down, the write-down will be considered without interest assistance.

      (8) The write-down is based on writing down the shorter-term loans first.

      (9) When a lender requests approval of a write-down for a borrower with multiple loans, the security for all of the loans will be cross-collateralized and continue to serve as security for the loan that is written down. If a borrower has multiple loans and one loan is written off entirely through debt write-down, the security for that loan will not be released and will remain as security for the other written down debt. Additional security instruments will be taken if required to cross-collateralize security and maintain lien priority.

      (10) The write-down will be evidenced by an allonge or amendment to the existing note or line of credit reflecting the write-down.

      (11) The borrower executes an Agency shared appreciation agreement for loans which are written down and secured by real estate.

      (i) The lender will attach the original agreement to the restructured loan document.

      (ii) The lender will provide the Agency a copy of the executed agreement, and

      (iii) Security instruments must ensure future collection of any appreciation under the agreement.

      (12) The lender will prepare and submit the following to the Agency:

      (i) A current appraisal of all security in accordance with § 762.127.

      (ii) A completed report of loss on the appropriate Agency form for the proposed write-down loss claim.

      (iii) Detailed write-down calculations as follows:

      (A) Calculate the present value.

      (B) Determine the net recovery value.

      (C) If the net recovery value exceeds the present value, write-down is unavailable; liquidation becomes the next servicing consideration. If the present value equals or exceeds the net recovery value, the debt may be written down to the present value.

      (iv) The lender will make any adjustment in the calculations as requested by the Agency.

      (3) In cases of a guaranteed line of credit, lenders may make an emergency advance when a line of credit has reached its ceiling. The emergency advance will be made as an advance under the line and not as a separate note.

      (4) The ratio of the amount of debt to the value of the remaining security is less than or equal to .75, or the withdrawing party has no income or assets from which collection can be made; and

      (5) Withdrawal of the individual does not result in legal dissolution of the entity to which the loans are made. Individually liable members of a general or limited partnership may not be released from liability.

      (6) The remaining liable party projects a feasible plan (see § 761.2(b) of this chapter).

      (c)  After a final loss claim has been paid on the borrower's account, the lender may release the borrower or guarantor from liability if;

      (1) The Agency agrees to the release in writing;

      (2) The lender documents its consideration of the following factors concerning the borrower or guarantors:

      (i) The likelihood that the borrower or guarantor will have a sufficient level of income in the reasonably near future to contribute to a meaningful reduction of the debt;

      (ii) The prospect that the borrower or guarantor will inherit assets in the near term that may be attached by the Agency for payment of a significant portion of the debt;

      (iii) Whether collateral has been properly accounted for, and whether liability should be retained in order to take action against the borrower or a third party for conversion of security;

      (iv) The availability of other income or assets which are not security;

      (v) The possibility that assets have been concealed or improperly transferred;

      (4) If a new note is taken, it will be attached to and refer to the original note.

      (5) The lender will inform the Agency of the rate change.

      (e)  Two or more Agency guaranteed loans may be consolidated, subject to the following conditions:

      (1) The borrower must project a feasible plan after the consolidation. See § 761.2(b) of this chapter for definition of feasible plan.

      (2) Only OL may be consolidated.

      (5) Guaranteed loans made prior to October 1, 1991, cannot be consolidated with those loans made on or after October 1, 1991.

      (6) OL secured by real estate or with an outstanding interest assistance agreement or shared appreciation agreement cannot be consolidated.

      (7) A new note or line of credit agreement will be taken.

The original note or line of credit agreement must be retained.

      (8) The interest rate for a consolidated OL loan is the negotiated rate agreed upon by the lender and the borrower at the time of the action, subject to the loan limitations for each type of loan.

      (9) The Agency approves the consolidation by executing a modification of guarantee. The modification will indicate the consolidated loan amount, new terms, and percentage of guarantee, and will be attached to the originals of the guarantees being consolidated.

      (ii) On repayment of the loan; or

      (iii) If the borrower ceases farming.

      (b)  (1) Reorganization.

      (i) Expenses, such as legal fees and the cost of appraisals incurred by the lender as a direct result of the borrower's chapter 11, 12, or 13 reorganization, are covered under the guarantee, provided they are reasonable, customary, and provide a demonstrated economic benefit to the lender and the Agency.

      (ii) Lender's in-house expenses, which are those expenses which would normally be incurred for administration of the loan, including in-house lawyers, are not covered by the guarantee.

      § 762.149   Liquidation.

#### § § 762.149

      (a)  When it has been determined that default cannot be cured through any of the servicing options available, or if the lender does not wish to utilize any of the authorities provided in this part, the lender must:

      (1) Participate in mediation according to the rules and regulations of any State which has a mandatory farmer-creditor mediation program;

      (2) Consider private mediation services in those States which do not have a mandatory farmer-creditor mediation program; and

      (3) Not agree to any proposals to rewrite the terms of a guaranteed loan which do not comply with this part. Any agreements reached as a result of mediation involving defaults and or loan restructuring must have written concurrence from the Agency before they are implemented.

      (b)  If a default cannot be cured after considering servicing options and mediation, the lender will proceed with liquidation of the collateral in accordance with the following:

      (1) Within 150 days after the payment due date, all lenders will prepare a liquidation plan. Standard eligible and CLP lenders will submit a written liquidation plan to the Agency which includes:

      (i) Current balance sheets from all liable parties or, if the parties are not cooperative, the best information available, or in liquidation bankruptcies, a copy of the bankruptcy schedules or discharge notice;

      (ii) A proposed method of maximizing the collection of debt which includes specific plans to collect any remaining loan balances on the guaranteed loan after loan collateral has been liquidated, including possibilities for judgment;

      (A) If the borrower has converted loan security, the lender will determine whether litigation is cost effective. The lender must address, in the liquidation plan, whether civil or criminal action will be pursued. If the lender does not pursue the recovery, the reason must be documented when an estimated loss claim is submitted.

      (B) Any proposal to release the borrower from liability will be addressed in the liquidation plan in accordance with § 762.146(c)(2);

      (iii) An independent appraisal report on all collateral securing the loan that meets the requirements of § 762.127 and a calculation of the net recovery value of the security as defined in ;§ 761.2(b) of this chapter. The appraisal requirement may be waived by the Agency in the following cases:

      (A) The bankruptcy trustee is handling the liquidation and the lender has submitted the trustee's determination of value;

      (B) The lender's proposed method of liquidation rarely results in receipt of less than market value for livestock and used equipment; or

      (C) A purchase offer has already been received for more than the debt;

      (iv) An estimate of time necessary to complete the liquidation;

      (v) An estimated loss claim must be filed no later than 150 days past the payment due date unless the account has been completely liquidated and then a final loss claim must be filed.

      (vi) An estimate of reasonable liquidation expenses; and

      (vii) An estimate of any protective advances.

      (2) PLP lenders will submit a liquidation plan as required by their lender's agreement.

      (c)  (1) CLP lender's or standard eligible lender's liquidation plan, and any revisions of the plan, must be approved by the Agency.

      (2) If, within 20 calendar days of the Agency's receipt of the liquidation plan, the Agency fails to approve it or fails to request that the lender make revisions, the lender may assume the plan is approved. The lender may then proceed to begin liquidation actions at its discretion as long as it has been at least 60 days since the borrower's eligibility for interest assistance was considered.

      (3) At its option, the Agency may liquidate the guaranteed loan as follows:

      (i) Upon Agency request, the lender will transfer to the Agency all rights and interests necessary to allow the Agency to liquidate the loan. The Agency will not pay the lender for any loss until after the collateral is liquidated and the final loss is determined; and

      (ii) If the Agency conducts the liquidation, interest accrual will cease on the date the Agency notifies the lender in writing that it assumes responsibility for the liquidation.

      (d)  An estimated loss claim must be submitted by all lenders no later than 150 days after the payment due date unless the account has been completely liquidated and then a final loss claim must be filed. The estimated loss will be based on the following:

      (1) The Agency will pay the lender the guaranteed percentage of the total outstanding debt, less the net recovery value of the remaining security, less any unaccounted for security; and

      (2) The lender will discontinue interest accrual on the defaulted loan at the time the estimated loss claim is paid by the Agency. The Agency will not pay interest beyond 210 days from the payment due date. If the lender estimates that there will be no loss after considering the costs of liquidation, an estimated loss of zero will be submitted and interest accrual will cease upon the approval of the estimated loss and never later than 210 days from the payment due date. The following exceptions apply:

      (i) In the case of a Chapter 7 bankruptcy, in cases where the lender filed an estimated loss claim, the Agency will pay the lender interest that accrues during and up to 45 days after the discharge on the portion of the chattel only secured debt that was estimated to be secured, but upon final liquidation was found to be unsecured, and up to 90 days after the date of discharge on the portion of real estate secured debt that was estimated to be secured, but was found to be unsecured upon final disposition.

      (ii) The Agency will pay the lender interest that accrues during and up to 90 days after the time period the lender is unable to dispose of acquired property due to state imposed redemption rights on any unsecured portion of the loan during the redemption period, if an estimated loss claim was paid by the Agency during the liquidation action.

      (3) Packager fees and outside consultant fees for servicing of guaranteed loans are not covered by the guarantee, and will not be paid in an estimated loss claim.

      (e)  (1) Prior written authorization from the Agency is required for all protective advances in excess of $5,000 for CLP lenders and $3,000 for standard eligible lenders. The dollar amount of protective advances allowed for PLP lenders will be specified when PLP status is awarded by the Agency or as contained in the lender's agreement.

      (2) The lender may claim recovery for the guaranteed portion of any loss of monies advanced as protective advances as allowed in this part, plus interest that accrues on the protective advances.

      (3) Payment for protective advances is made by the Agency when the final loss claim is approved, except in bankruptcy actions.

      (4) Protective advances are used only when the borrower is in liquidation, liquidation is imminent, or when the lender has taken title to real property in a liquidation action.

      (5) Legal fees are not a protective advance.

      (6) Protective advances may only be made when the lender can demonstrate the advance is in the best interest of the lender and the Agency.

      (7) Protective advances must constitute a debt of the borrower to the lender and be secured by the security instrument.

      (8) Protective advances must not be made in lieu of additional loans.

      (f)  The amount of any payments made by the borrower on unapproved loans or advances outside of the guarantee will be deducted from any loss claim submitted by the lender on the guaranteed loan, if that loan or advance was paid prior to, and to the detriment of, the guaranteed loan.

      (g)  (1) If the borrower is not in bankruptcy, the lender shall send the borrower notice that the loan is in default and the entire debt has been determined due and payable immediately after other servicing options have been exhausted.

      (2) The loan cannot be accelerated until after the borrower has been considered for interest assistance and the conclusion of mandatory mediation in accordance with § 762.149.

      (3) The lender will submit a copy of the acceleration notice or other document to the Agency.

      (h)  (1) The lender is responsible for determining the necessary parties to any foreclosure action, or who should be named on a deed of conveyance taken in lieu of foreclosure.

      (2) When the property is liquidated, the lender will apply the net proceeds to the guaranteed loan debt.

      (3) When it is necessary to enter a bid at a foreclosure sale, the lender may bid the amount that it determines is reasonable to protect its and the Agency's interest. At a minimum, the lender will bid the lesser of the net recovery value or the unpaid guaranteed loan balance.

      (i)  (1) Lenders must submit a final loss claim when the security has been liquidated and all proceeds have been received and applied to the account. All proceeds must be applied to principal first and then toward accrued interest if the interest is still accruing. The application of the loss claim payment to the account does not automatically release the borrower of liability for any portion of the borrower's debt to the lender. The lender will continue to be responsible for collecting the full amount of the debt and sharing these future recoveries with the Agency in accordance with paragraph (j) of this section.

      (2) If a lender acquires title to property either through voluntary conveyance or foreclosure proceeding, the lender will submit a final loss claim after disposing of the property. The lender may pay reasonable maintenance expenses to protect the value of the property while it is owned by the lender. These may be paid as protective advances or deducted as liquidation expenses from the sales proceeds when the lender disposes of the property. The lender must obtain Agency written concurrence before incurring maintenance expenses which exceed the amounts allowed in § 762.149(e)(1). Packager fees and outside consultant fees for servicing of guaranteed loans are not covered by the guarantee, and will not be paid in a final loss claim.

      (3) The lender will make its records available to the Agency for the Agency's audit of the propriety of any loss payment.

      (4) All lenders will submit the following documents with a final loss claim:

      (i) An accounting of the use of loan funds;

      (ii) An accounting of the disposition of loan security and its proceeds;

      (iii) A copy of the loan ledger indicating loan advances, interest rate changes, protective advances, and application of payments, rental proceeds, and security proceeds, including a running outstanding balance total; and

      (iv) Documentation, as requested by the Agency, concerning the lender's compliance with the requirements of this part.

      (5) The Agency will notify the lender of any discrepancies in the final loss claim or, approve or reject the claim within 40 days. Failure to do so will result in additional interest being paid to the lender for the number of days over 40 taken to process the claim.

      (6) The Agency will reduce a final loss claim based on its calculation of the dollar amount of loss caused by the lender's negligent servicing of the account. Loss claims may be reduced or rejected as a result of the following:

      (i) A loss claim may be reduced by the amount caused by the lender's failure to secure property after a default, and will be reduced by the amount of interest that accrues when the lender fails to contact the borrower or takes no action to cure the default, once it occurs. Losses incurred as a result of interest accrual during excessive delays in collection, as determined by the Agency, will not be paid.

      (ii) Unauthorized release of security proceeds, failure to verify ownership or possession of security to be purchased, or failure to inspect collateral as often required so as to ensure its maintenance.

      (7) Losses will not be reduced for the following:

      (i) Servicing deficiencies that did not contribute materially to the dollar amount of the loss.

      (ii) Unaccounted security, as long as the lender's efforts to locate and recover the missing collateral was equal to that which would have been expended in the case of an unguaranteed loan in the lender's portfolio.

      (8) Default interest, late charges, and loan servicing fees are not payable under the loss claim.

      (9) The final loss will be the remaining outstanding balance after application of the estimated loss payment and the application of proceeds from the liquidation of the security.

      (10) If the final loss is less than the estimated loss, the lender will reimburse the Agency for the overpayment, plus interest at the note rate from the date of the estimated loss payment.

      (11) The lender will return the original guarantee marked paid after receipt of a final loss claim.

      (j)  The lender will remit any recoveries made on the account after the Agency's payment of a final loss claim to the Agency in proportion to the percentage of guarantee, in accordance with the lender's agreement, until the account is paid in full or otherwise satisfied.

      (k)  The lender will repay any final loss overpayment determined by the Agency upon request.

      (l)  The lender will designate one or more financial institutions to which any Agency payments will be made via electronic funds transfer.

      (m)  Any amounts paid by the Agency on account of liabilities of the guaranteed loan borrower will constitute a Federal debt owing to the Agency by the guaranteed loan borrower. In such case, the Agency may use all remedies available to it, including offset under the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996, to collect the debt from the borrower. Interest charges will be established at the note rate of the guaranteed loan on the date the final loss claim is paid.

      § 762.150   Interest assistance program.

#### § § 762.150

      (a)  In addition to the loan application items required by § 762.110, to apply for interest assistance the lender's cash flow budget for the guaranteed applicant must reflect the need for interest assistance and the ability to cash flow with the subsidy. Interest assistance is available only on new guaranteed Operating Loans (OL).

      (b)  The lender must document that the following conditions have been met for the applicant to be eligible for interest assistance:

      (1) A feasible plan cannot be achieved without interest assistance, but can be achieved with interest assistance.

      (2) If significant changes in the borrower's cash flow budget are anticipated after the initial 12 months, then the typical cash flow budget must demonstrate that the borrower will still have a feasible plan following the anticipated changes, with or without interest assistance.

      (3) The typical cash flow budget must demonstrate that the borrower will have a feasible plan throughout the term of the loan.

      (4) The borrower, including members of an entity borrower, does not own any significant assets that do not contribute directly to essential family living or farm operations. The lender must determine the market value of any such non-essential assets and prepare a cash flow budget and interest assistance calculations based on the assumption that these assets will be sold and the market value proceeds used for debt reduction. If a feasible plan can then be achieved, the borrower is not eligible for interest assistance.

      (5) A borrower may only receive interest assistance if their total debts (including personal debts) prior to the new loan exceed 50 percent of their total assets (including personal assets). An entity's debt to asset ratio will be based upon a financial statement that consolidates business and personal debts and assets of the entity and its members. Beginning farmers § 761.2(b) of this chapter, as defined in § 762.102, are excluded from this requirement.

      (c)  The maximum total guaranteed OL debt on which a borrower can receive interest assistance is $400,000, regardless of the number of guaranteed loans outstanding. This is a lifetime limit.

      (d)  (1) A borrower may only receive interest assistance for one 5-year period. The term of the interest assistance agreement executed under this section shall not exceed 5 consecutive years from the date of the initial agreement signed by the applicant, including any entity members, or the outstanding term of the loan, whichever is less. This is a lifetime limit.

      (2) Beginning farmers § 761.2(b) of this chapter, as defined in § 762.102, however, may be considered for two 5-year periods. The applicant must meet the definition of a beginning farmer and meet the other eligibility requirements outlined in paragraph (b) of this section at the onset of each 5-year period. A needs test will be completed in the fifth year of IA eligibility for beginning farmers, to determine continued eligibility for a second 5-year period.

      (3) Notwithstanding the limitation of paragraph (d)(1) of this section, a new interest assistance agreement may be approved for eligible borrowers to provide interest assistance through June 8, 2009, provided the total period does not exceed 10 years from the effective date of the original interest assistance agreement.

      (e)  In the case of a borrower with multiple guaranteed loans with one lender, interest assistance can be applied to each loan, only to one loan or any distribution the lender selects, as necessary to achieve a feasible plan, subject to paragraph (c) of this section.

      (f)  The typical term of scheduled loan repayment will not be reduced solely for the purpose of maximizing eligibility for interest assistance. A loan must be scheduled over the maximum term typically used by lenders for similar type loans within the limits in § 762.124. An OL for the purpose of providing annual operating and family living expenses will be scheduled for repayment when the income is scheduled to be received from the sale of the crops, livestock, and/or livestock products which will serve as security for the loan. An OL for purposes other than annual operating and family living expenses ( purchase of equipment or livestock, or refinancing existing debt) will be scheduled over 7 years from the effective date of the proposed interest assistance agreement, or the life of the security, whichever is less.

      (g)  The lender interest rate will be set according to § 762.124(a).

      (h)  The lender and borrower must execute an interest assistance agreement as prescribed by the Agency.

      (i)  To receive an interest assistance payment, the lender must prepare and submit a claim on the appropriate Agency form. The following conditions apply:

      (1) Interest assistance payments will be four (4) percent of the average daily principal loan balance prorated over the number of days the loan has been outstanding during the payment period. For loans with a note rate less than four (4) percent, interest assistance payments will be the weighted average interest rate multiplied by the average daily principal balance.

      (2) The lender may select at the time of loan closing the date that they wish to receive an interest assistance payment. That date will be included in the interest assistance agreement.

      (i) The initial and final claims submitted under an agreement may be for a period less than 12 months. All other claims will be submitted for a 12-month period, unless there is a lender substitution during the 12-month period in accordance with this section.

      (ii) In the event of liquidation, the final interest assistance claim will be submitted with the estimated loss claim or the final loss claim if an estimated loss claim was not submitted. Interest will not be paid beyond the interest accrual cutoff dates established in the loss claims according to § 762.149(d)(2).

      (3) A claim should be filed within 60 days of its due date. Claims not filed within 1 year from the due date will not be paid, and the amount due the lender will be permanently forfeited.

      (4) All claims will be supported by detailed calculations of average daily principal balance during the claim period.

      (5) Requests for continuation of interest assistance for agreements dated prior to June 8, 2007 will be supported by the lender's analysis of the applicant's farming operation and need for continued interest assistance as set out in their Interest Assistance Agreements. The following information will be submitted to the Agency:

      (i) A summary of the operation's actual financial performance in the previous year, including a detailed income and expense statement.

      (ii) A narrative description of the causes of any major differences between the previous year's projections and actual performance, including a detailed income and expense statement.

      (iii) A current balance sheet.

      (iv) A cash-flow budget for the period being planned. A monthly cash-flow budget is required for all lines of credit and operating loans made for annual operating purposes. All other loans may include either an annual or monthly cash-flow budget.

      (v) A copy of the interest assistance needs analysis portion of the application form which has been completed based on the planned period's cash-flow budget.

      (6) Interest Assistance Agreements dated June 8, 2007 or later do not require a request for continuation of interest assistance. The lender will only be required to submit an Agency IA payment form and the average daily principal balance for the claim period, with supporting documentation.

      (7) Lenders may not charge or cause a borrower with an interest assistance agreement to be charged a fee for preparation and submission of the items required for an annual interest assistance claim.

      (j)  Loans covered by interest assistance agreements cannot be consolidated. Such loans can be transferred only when the transferee was liable for the debt on the effective date of the interest assistance agreement. Loans covered by interest assistance can be transferred to an entity if the entity is eligible in accordance with §§ 762.120 and 762.150(b) and at least one entity member was liable for the debt on the effective date of the interest assistance agreement. Interest assistance will be discontinued as of the date of any write-down on a loan covered by an interest assistance agreement.

      (k)  When a borrower defaults on a loan with interest assistance or the loan otherwise requires rescheduling or deferral, the interest assistance agreement will remain in effect for that loan at its existing terms. The lender may reschedule the loan in accordance with § 762.145. For Interest Assistance Agreements dated June 8, 2007 or later increases in the restructured loan amount above the amount originally obligated do not require additional funding; however, interest assistance is not available on that portion of the loan as interest assistance is limited to the original loan amount.

      (l)  In cases where the interest on a loan covered by an interest assistance agreement is reduced by court order in a reorganization plan under the bankruptcy code, interest assistance will be terminated effective on the date of the court order. Guaranteed loans which have had their interest reduced by bankruptcy court order are not eligible for interest assistance.

      (m)  Interest assistance payments will cease upon termination of the loan guarantee, upon reaching the expiration date contained in the agreement, or upon cancellation by the Agency under the terms of the interest assistance agreement. In addition, for loan guarantees sold into the secondary market, Agency purchase of the guaranteed portion of a loan will terminate the interest assistance.

      (n)  Upon written notice to the lender, borrower, and any holder, the Agency may amend or cancel the interest assistance agreement and collect from the lender any amount of interest assistance granted which resulted from incomplete or inaccurate information, an error in computation, or any other reason which resulted in payment that the lender was not entitled to receive.

      (o)  The Interest Assistance Agreement is incontestable except for fraud or misrepresentation, of which the lender or borrower have actual knowledge at the time the interest assistance agreement is executed, or which the lender or borrower participates in or condones.

      (p)  If there is a substitution of lender, the original lender will prepare and submit to the Agency a claim for its final interest assistance payment calculated through the effective date of the substitution. This final claim will be submitted for processing at the time of the substitution.

      (1) Interest assistance will continue automatically with the new lender.

      (2) The new lender must follow paragraph (i) of this section to receive their initial and subsequent interest assistance payments.

      (q)  The Deputy Administrator for Farm Loan Programs has the authority to grant an exception to any requirement involving interest assistance if it is in the best interest of the Government and is not inconsistent with other applicable law.

#### § § 762.160

      (a) The following general requirements apply to assigning guaranteed loans:

      (1) Subject to Agency concurrence, the lender may assign all or part of the guaranteed portion of the loan to one or more holders at or after loan closing, if the loan is not in default. However, a line of credit cannot be assigned. The lender must always retain the unguaranteed portion in their portfolio, regardless of how the loan is funded.

      (2) The Agency may refuse to execute the Assignment of Guarantee and prohibit the assignment in case of the following:

      (3) The lender will provide the Agency with copies of all appropriate forms used in the assignment.

      (4) The guaranteed portion of the loan may not be assigned by the lender until the loan has been fully disbursed to the borrower.

#### § § 763.19

      (a) The seller and buyer may modify the land contract to lower the interest rate and corresponding amortized payment amount without Agency approval.

      (b) With prior written approval from the Agency, the seller and buyer may modify the land contract provided that, in addition to a feasible plan for the upcoming operating cycle, a feasible plan can be reasonably projected throughout the remaining term of the guarantee. Such modifications may include but are not limited to:

      (1) Deferral of installments,

      (2) Leasing or subleasing, and

      (3) Partial releases. All proceeds from a partial release or royalties from mineral extraction must be applied to a prior lien, if one exists, and in addition, the same amount must be credited to the principal balance of the land contract.

      (4) Transfer and assumption. If the guarantee is to remain in effect, any transfer of the property and assumption of the guaranteed debt must be made to an eligible buyer for the Land Contract Guarantee Program as specified in § 763.5(b), and must be approved by the Agency in writing. If an eligible buyer for transfer and assumption cannot be found, the Deputy Administrator for Farm Loan Programs may make an exception to this requirement when in the Government's best financial interests.

      (5) Assignment. The seller may not assign the contract to another party without written consent of the Agency.

      (c) Any contract modifications other than those listed above must be approved by the Deputy Administrator for Farm Loan Programs, and will only be approved if such action is determined permissible by law and in the Government's best financial interests.

      § 763.20   Delinquent servicing and collecting on guarantee.

#### § § 763.20

      (a)  If the buyer fails to pay an annual amortized installment or a portion of an installment on the contract or taxes or insurance when due, the escrow agent:

      (1) Must make a written demand on the buyer for payment of the defaulted amount within 30 days of the missed payment, taxes, or insurance and send a copy of the demand letter to the Agency and to the seller; and

      (2) Must make demand on the Agency within 90 days from the original payment, taxes, or insurance due date, for the missed payment in the event the buyer has not made the payment.

      (b)  If the buyer fails to pay an annual amortized installment or a portion of an installment on the contract, then the seller has the option of either liquidating the real estate, or having the amount of the loss established by the Agency by an appraisal of the real estate. For either option, the servicing agent:

      (1) Must make a written demand on the buyer for payment of the defaulted amount within 30 days of the missed payment, and send a copy of the demand letter to the Agency and to the seller; and

      (2) Must immediately inform the Agency which option the seller has chosen for establishing the amount of the loss, in the event the buyer does not make the payment within 60 days of the demand letter.

      (i)  If the seller chooses the liquidation method, the servicing agent will:

      (A) Submit a liquidation plan to the Agency within 120 days from the missed payment for approval prior to any liquidation action. The Agency may require and pay for an appraisal prior to approval of the liquidation plan.

      (B) Complete liquidation within 12 months of the missed installment unless prevented by bankruptcy, redemption rights, or other legal action.

      (C) Credit an amount equal to the sale price received in a liquidation of the security property, with no deduction for expenses, to the principal balance of the land contract.

      (D) File a loss claim immediately after liquidation, which must include a complete loan ledger.

      (E) Base the loss claim amount on the appraisal method if the property is reacquired by the seller, through liquidation.

      (ii)  If the seller chooses to have the loss amount established by appraisal rather than liquidation, the Agency will complete an appraisal on the real estate, and the loss claim amount will be based on the difference between the appraised value at the time the loss is calculated and the unpaid principal balance of the land contract at that time.

      (A) The only administrative appeal allowed under § 761.6 of this chapter related to the resulting appraisal amount will be a determination of whether the appraisal is Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP) compliant.

      (B) The seller will give the Agency a lien on the security property in the amount of the loss claim payment. If the property sells within 5 years from the date of the loss payment for an amount greater than the appraised value used to establish the loss claim amount, the seller must repay the difference, up to the amount of the loss claim. For purposes of determining the amount to be repaid (recapture), the market value of the property may be reduced by the value of certain capital improvements, as specified in § 766.202(a)(1)-(3) of this chapter, made by the seller to the property in the time period from the loss claim to final disposition. If the property is not sold within 5 years from the date of the loss payment, the Agency will release the lien and the seller will have no further obligation to the Agency.

      § 763.21   Establishment of Federal debt and Agency recovery of loss claim payments.

#### § § 763.21

      (a) Any amount paid by FSA as a result of an approved loss claim is immediately due and payable by the buyer after FSA notifies the buyer that a loss claim has been paid to the seller. If the debt is not restructured into a repayment plan or the obligation otherwise cured, FSA may use all remedies available, including offset as authorized by the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996, to collect the debt.

      (1) Interest on the debt will be at the FLP non-program real property loan rate in effect at the time of the first Agency payment of a loss claim.

      (2) The debt may be scheduled for repayment consistent with the buyer's repayment ability, not to exceed 7 years. Before any payment plan can be approved, the buyer must provide the Agency with the best lien obtainable on all of the buyer's assets. This includes the buyer's ownership interest in the real estate under contract for guarantees using the prompt payment guarantee plan. When the buyer is an entity, the best lien obtainable will be taken on all of the entity's assets, and all assets owned by individual members of the entity, including their ownership interest in the real estate under contract.

      (b) Annually, buyers with an Agency approved repayment plan under this section will supply the Agency a current balance sheet, income statement, cash flow budget, complete copy of Federal income tax returns, and any additional information needed to analyze the buyer's financial condition.

      (c) If a buyer fails to make required payments to the Agency as specified in the approved repayment plan, the debt will be treated as a non-program loan debt, and servicing will proceed as specified in § 766.351(c) of this chapter.

      § 763.22   Negligence and negligent servicing.

#### § § 763.22

      (a) The Agency may deny a loss claim in whole or in part due to negligence that contributed to the loss claim. This could include, but is not limited to:

      (1) The escrow and servicing agent failing to seek payment of a missed installment from the buyer within the prescribed timeframe or otherwise does not enforce the terms of the land contract;

      (2) Losing the collateral to a third party, such as a taxing authority, prior lien holder,

      (3) Not performing the duties and responsibilities required of the escrow or servicing agent;

      (4) The seller's failure to disclose environmental issues; or

      (5) Any other action in violation of the land contract or guarantee agreement that does not terminate the guarantee.

      (b) [Reserved]

      § 763.23   Terminating the guarantee.

#### § § 763.23

      (a) The guarantee and the Agency's obligations will terminate at the earliest of the following circumstances:

      (1) Full payment of the land contract;

      (2) Agency payment to the seller of 3 annual installments plus property taxes and insurance, if applicable, under the prompt payment guarantee plan, if not repaid in full by the buyer. An Agency approved repayment plan will not constitute payment in full until such time as the entire amount due for the Agency approved repayment plan is paid in full;

      (3) Payment of a loss claim through the standard guarantee plan;

      (4) Sale of real estate without guarantee being properly assigned;

      (5) The seller terminates the land contract for reasons other than monetary default; or

      (6) If for any reason the land contract becomes null and void.

      (b) If none of the events in paragraph (a) of this section occur, the guarantee will automatically expire, without notice, 10 years from the effective date of the guarantee.

#### § §§ 764.55-764.100

      Subpart C—Requirements for All Direct Program Loans

        § 764.101   General eligibility requirements.

#### § § 764.101

        The following requirements must be met unless otherwise provided in the eligibility requirements for the particular type of loan.

        (a)  The applicant, and anyone who will sign the promissory note, must not be ineligible for loans as a result of a conviction for controlled substances according to 7 CFR part 718 of this chapter.

        (b)  The applicant, and anyone who will sign the promissory note, must possess the legal capacity to incur the obligation of the loan. A Youth loan applicant will incur full personal liability upon execution of the promissory note without regard to the applicant's minority status.

        (c)  The applicant, and anyone who will sign the promissory note, must be a citizen of the United States, United States non-citizen national, or a qualified alien under applicable Federal immigration laws.

        (d)  The applicant, and all entity members in the case of an entity, must have acceptable credit history demonstrated by debt repayment.

        (1) As part of the credit history, the Agency will determine whether the applicant, and all entity members in the case of an entity, will carry out the terms and conditions of the loan and deal with the Agency in good faith. In making this determination, the Agency may examine whether the applicant, and all entity members in the case of an entity, has properly fulfilled its obligations to other parties, including other agencies of the Federal Government.

        (2) When the applicant, or an entity member in the case of an entity, caused the Agency a loss by receiving debt forgiveness, the applicant may be ineligible for assistance in accordance with eligibility requirements for the specific loan type. If the debt forgiveness is cured by repayment of the Agency's loss, the Agency may still consider the debt forgiveness in determining the applicant's credit worthiness.

        (3) A history of failures to repay past debts as they came due will demonstrate unacceptable credit history when the ability to repay was within the control of the applicant, or entity member in the case of an entity. The circumstances in paragraphs (d)(3)(i) through (iv) of this section, for example, do not automatically indicate an unacceptable credit history:

        (i) Foreclosures, judgments, delinquent payments which occurred more than 36 months before the application, if no recent similar situations have occurred, or Agency delinquencies that have been resolved through loan servicing programs available under 7 CFR part 766;

        (ii) Isolated incidents of delinquent payments which do not represent a general pattern of unsatisfactory or slow payment;

        (iii) “No history” of credit transactions; and

        (iv) Recent foreclosure, judgment, bankruptcy, or delinquent payment of the applicant, or an entity member in the case of an entity, when it can be satisfactorily demonstrated that the adverse action or delinquency was caused by circumstances that were of a temporary nature and beyond the individual's control; or the result of a refusal to make full payment because of defective goods or services or other justifiable dispute relating to the purchase or contract for goods or services.

        (e)  Except for CL, the applicant, and all entity members in the case of an entity, must be unable to obtain sufficient credit elsewhere to finance actual needs at reasonable rates and terms. The Agency will evaluate the ability to obtain credit based on factors including, but not limited to:

        (1) Loan amounts, rates, and terms available in the marketplace. The authorized Agency official will evaluate and document whether rates and terms of available credit will result in a reasonable amount of cash flow margin to increase working capital reserves and savings, including reasonable savings for retirement and education, to support operational stability and growth; and

        (2) Property interests, income, and significant non-essential assets.

        (f)  As provided in 31 CFR part 285, except for EM loan applicants, the applicant, and anyone who will sign the promissory note, must not be in delinquent status on any Federal debt, other than a debt under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 at the time of loan closing. All delinquent debts, however, will be considered in determining credit history and ability to repay under this part.

        (g)  The applicant, and anyone who will sign the promissory note, must have no outstanding unpaid judgments obtained by the United States in any court. Such judgments do not include those filed as a result of action in the United States Tax Courts.

        (h)  The applicant, and all entity members in the case of an entity, must not be ineligible due to disqualification resulting from Federal crop insurance violation according to 7 CFR part 718.

        (i)  The applicant, and in the case of an entity, the individuals holding a majority interest in the entity, must have sufficient managerial ability to assure reasonable prospects of loan repayment, as determined by the Agency. Managerial ability must be demonstrated by:

        (1)  For example, the applicant or entity member obtained a 4-year college degree in agricultural business, horticulture, animal science, agronomy, or other agricultural-related field;

        (2)  For example, the applicant or entity member is currently working on a farm as part of an apprenticeship program;

        (3)  For example, the applicant or entity member has been a manager or operator of a farm business for at least one entire production cycle or for MLs, made for OL purposes, the applicant may have obtained and successfully repaid one FSA Youth-OL. Farm experience of the applicant, without regard to any lapse of time between the farm experience and the new application, will be taken into consideration in determining loan eligibility. If farm experience occurred more than 10 years prior to the date of the new application, the applicant must demonstrate sufficient on-the-job training or education within the last 10 years to demonstrate managerial ability; or

        (4)  Applicants for MLs made for OL purposes, also may demonstrate managerial ability by one of the following:

        (i) Certification of a past participation with an agriculture-related organization, such as, but not limited to, 4-H Club, FFA, beginning farmer and rancher development programs, or Community Based Organizations, that demonstrates experience in a related agricultural enterprise; or

        (ii) A written description of a self-directed apprenticeship combined with either prior sufficient experience working on a farm or significant small business management experience. As a condition of receiving the loan, the self-directed apprenticeship requires that the applicant seek, receive, and apply guidance from a qualified person during the first cycle of production and marketing typical for the applicant's specific operation. The individual providing the guidance must be knowledgeable in production, management, and marketing practices that are pertinent to the applicant's operation, and agree to form a developmental partnership with the applicant to share knowledge, skills, information, and perspective of agriculture to foster the applicant's development of technical skills and management ability.

        (j)  The applicant must agree to meet the training requirements in subpart K of this part.

        (k)  Except for CL:

        (1) The applicant must be the operator of a family farm after the loan is closed.

        (2) For an entity applicant, if the entity members holding a majority interest are:

        (i) Related by blood or marriage, at least one member must be the operator of a family farm;

        (ii) Not related by blood or marriage, the entity members holding at least 50 percent interest must be operators of a family farm.

        (3) Except for EM loans, the collective interests of the members may be larger than a family farm only if:

        (i) Each member's ownership interest is not larger than a family farm;

        (ii) All of the members of the entity are related by blood or marriage; and

        (iii) All of the members are or will become operators of the family farm; and

        (4) If the entity applicant has an operator and ownership interest for farm ownership loans and emergency loans for farm ownership loan purposes, in any other farming operation, that farming operation must not exceed the requirements of a family farm.

        (l)  If the applicant has one or more embedded entities, at least 75 percent of the individual ownership interests of each embedded entity must be owned by members actively involved in managing or operating the family farm.

        (b) The total principal balance owed to the Agency at any one time by the applicant, or any one who will sign the promissory note, cannot exceed the limits established in § 761.8 of this chapter.

        (c) The funds from the FLP loan must be used for farming operations located in the United States.

        (d) The Agency will not make a loan if the proceeds will be used:

        (1) For any purpose that contributes to excessive erosion of highly erodible land, or to the conversion of wetlands;

        (2) To drain, dredge, fill, level, or otherwise manipulate a wetland; or

        (3) To engage in any activity that results in impairing or reducing the flow, circulation, or reach of water, except in the case of activity related to the maintenance of previously converted wetlands as defined in the Food Security Act of 1985.

        (e) Any construction financed by the Agency must comply with the standards established in § 761.10 of this chapter.

        (f) Loan funds will not be used to establish or support a non-eligible enterprise, even if the non-eligible enterprise contributes to the farm. Notwithstanding this limitation, an EM loan may cover qualified equine losses as specified in subpart I of this part.

        § 764.103   General security requirements.

#### § § 764.103

        (a) Security requirements specific to each loan program are outlined in subparts D through I of this part.

        (b) All loans must be secured by assets having a security value of at least 100 percent of the loan amount, except for EM loans as provided in subpart I of this part. If the applicant's assets do not provide adequate security, the Agency may accept:

        (1) A pledge of security from a third party; or

        (2) Interests in property not owned by the applicant (such as leases that provide a mortgageable value, water rights, easements, mineral rights, and royalties).

        (c) An additional amount of security will be required, if available, to reach a 125 percent security margin. Total loan security in excess of what is needed to achieve a security margin of 125 percent will only be taken when it is not practicable to separate the security, or if necessary to satisfy the requirements of § 764.254(b)(2)(i). Loans that do not require additional security are down payment loans, MLs, youth loans, and FOs for the purchase of a farm where the applicant provides a cash down payment equal to 5 percent or greater of the purchase price. Non-real estate assets will not be taken as additional security for any loan where real estate serves as adequate security.

        (d) The Agency will choose the best security available when there are several alternatives that meet the Agency's security requirements.

        (e) The Agency will take a lien on all assets that are not essential to the farming operation and are not being converted to cash to reduce the loan amount when each such asset, or aggregate value of like assets (such as stocks), has a value in excess of $15,000. The value of this security is not included in the Agency's additional security requirement stated in paragraph (c) of this section. This requirement does not apply to downpayment loans, CL, ML, or youth loans.

        § 764.104   General real estate security requirements.

#### § § 764.104

        (a)  If real estate is pledged as security for a loan, the Agency must obtain a first lien, if available. When a first lien is not available, the Agency may take a junior lien under the following conditions:

        (1) The prior lien does not contain any provisions that may jeopardize the Agency's interest or the applicant's ability to repay the FLP loan;

        (2) Prior lienholders agree to notify the Agency prior to foreclosure;

        (3) The applicant must agree not to increase an existing prior lien without the written consent of the Agency; and

        (4) Equity in the collateral exists.

        (b)  If the real estate offered as security is held under a recorded purchase contract:

        (1) The applicant must provide a security interest in the real estate;

        (2) The applicant and the purchase contract holder must agree in writing that any insurance proceeds received for real estate losses will be used only for one or more of the following purposes:

        (i) To replace or repair the damaged real estate improvements which are essential to the farming operation;

        (ii) To make other essential real estate improvements; or

        (iii) To pay any prior real estate lien, including the purchase contract.

        (3) The purchase contract must provide the applicant with possession, control and beneficial use of the property, and entitle the applicant to marketable title upon fulfillment of the contract terms.

        (4) The purchase contract must not:

        (i) Be subject to summary cancellation upon default;

        (ii) Contain provisions which jeopardize the Agency's security position or the applicant's ability to repay the loan.

        (5) The purchase contract holder must agree in writing to:

        (iv) Consent to the Agency making the loan and taking a security interest in the applicant's interest under the purchase contract as security for the FLP loan;

        (v) Not take any action to foreclose or forfeit the interest of the applicant under the purchase contract because the Agency has acquired the applicant's interest by foreclosure or voluntary conveyance, or because the Agency has subsequently sold or assigned the applicant's interest to a third party who will assume the applicant's obligations under the purchase contract;

        (vi) Notify the Agency in writing of any breach by the applicant; and

        (vii) Give the Agency the option to rectify the conditions that amount to a breach within 30 days after the date the Agency receives written notice of the breach.

        (6) If the Agency acquires the applicant's interest under the purchase contract by foreclosure or voluntary conveyance, the Agency will not be deemed to have assumed any of the applicant's obligations under the contract, provided that if the Agency fails to perform the applicant's obligations while it holds the applicant's interest is grounds for terminating the purchase contract.

        (c)  The Agency may take a lien on Indian Trust lands as security provided the applicant requests the Bureau of Indian Affairs to furnish Title Status Reports to the agency and the Bureau of Indian Affairs provides the reports and approves the lien.

        (d)  The same real estate may be pledged as security for more than one direct or guaranteed loan.

        (e)  A loan may be secured by a mortgage on a leasehold, if the leasehold has negotiable value and can be mortgaged.

The Agency must be listed as loss payee for the insurance indemnity payment or as a beneficiary in the mortgagee loss payable clause.

        (b) Real estate security located in flood or mudslide prone areas must be covered by flood or mudslide insurance. The Agency must be listed as a beneficiary in the mortgagee loss payable clause.

        (d) Prior to closing the loan, the applicant must have obtained at least the catastrophic risk protection level of crop insurance coverage for each crop which is a basic part of the applicant's total operation, if such insurance is available, unless the applicant executes a written waiver of any emergency crop loss assistance with respect to such crop.

        (b)  (1) The Agency schedules repayment of OL loans made for annual farm operating and family living expenses when planned income is projected to be available.

        (i) The term of the loan may not exceed 24 months from the date of the note, except as provided in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section.

        (ii) The term of the loan may exceed 24 months in unusual situations such as establishing a new enterprise, developing a farm, purchasing feed while crops are being established, marketing plans, or recovery from a disaster or economic reverse.

        (2) The standard repayment term of all other OLs must be equal to the useful life of the security or 7 years, whichever is less. Repayment terms less than the standard term must be requested by the applicant in writing. In no event will the term of the loan exceed 7 years from the date of the note.

        (i) Must be secured by an amount projected at the time of loan closing to be at least equal to the direct loan balance outstanding at the time the balloon installment comes due, which may exceed the additional security requirements of § 764.103(c) of this chapter.

        (ii) Are only authorized when the applicant can project the ability to refinance or restructure the remaining debt at the time the balloon payment comes due based on the expected financial condition of the operation, the depreciated value of the collateral, and the principal balance on the loan.

        (iii) Are not authorized when loan funds are used for real estate repairs or improvements.

        (3) The first installment of an OL, for purposes other than annual farm operating and family living expenses, will be an interest-only installment scheduled 12 months from the date of loan closing. An alternative repayment agreement that schedules the first installment sooner than 12 months from the date of closing, or in an amount greater than interest-only, may be provided upon written request from the applicant, or if the Agency determines it necessary to ensure the loan is fully secured for the life of the loan.

        (4) The minimum scheduled installments for the first 3 years of an OL, for purposes other than annual farm operating and family living expenses, must be the interest accrued on the principal balance. Interest-only installments may be permitted for additional years, if determined necessary by the Agency, to establish a new enterprise where production income is delayed, to develop a farm, or to recover from a disaster or economic reversal.

        The applicant:

        (a) Must comply with the general eligibility requirements established at § 764.101.

        (b) Must be an established farmer.

        (c) Must be the owner-operator or tenant-operator as follows:

        (i) The owner-operator of the farm at the time of the disaster; or

        (ii) The tenant-operator of the farm at the time of the disaster whose lease on the affected real estate exceeds the term of the loan. The operator will provide prior notification to the Agency if the lease is proposed to terminate during the term of the loan. The lessor will provide the Agency a mortgage on the real estate as security for the loan;

        (2) For a loan made under § 764.351(a) (2) or (b), must have been the operator of the farm at the time of the disaster; and

        (3) In the case of an entity, the entity must be:

        (d) Must demonstrate the intent to continue the farming operation after the designated or declared disaster.

        (e) And all entity members must be unable to obtain sufficient credit elsewhere at reasonable rates and terms. To establish this, the applicant must obtain written declinations of credit, specifying the reasons for declination, from legally organized commercial lending institutions within reasonable proximity of the applicant as follows:

        (1) In the case of a loan in excess of $300,000, two written declinations of credit are required;

        (2) In the case of a loan of $300,000 or less, one written declination of credit is required; and

        (3) In the case of a loan of $100,000 or less, the Agency may waive the requirement for obtaining a written declination of credit, if the Agency determines that it would pose an undue burden on the applicant, the applicant certifies that they cannot get credit elsewhere, and based on the applicant's circumstances credit is not likely to be available.

        (4) Notwithstanding the applicant's submission of the required written declinations of credit, the Agency may contact other commercial lending institutions within reasonable proximity of the applicant and make an independent determination of the applicant's ability to obtain credit elsewhere.

        (f) And all entity members in the case of an entity, must not have received debt forgiveness from the Agency on more than one occasion on or before April 4, 1996, or any time after April 4, 1996. A write-down associated with a restructuring action under Section 353 of the Act is not considered debt forgiveness for EM Loan purposes.

        (g) Must submit an application to be received by the Agency no later than 8 months after the date the disaster is declared or designated in the county of the applicant's operation.

        (h) For production loss loans, must have a disaster yield that is below the normal production yield of the crop, as determined by the Agency, which comprises a basic part of an applicant's total farming operation.

        (j) Must meet all of the following requirements if the ownership structure of the family farm changes between the time of a qualifying loss and the time an EM loan is closed:

        (1) The applicant, including all owners must meet all of the eligibility requirements;

        (2) The individual applicant, or all owners of a entity applicant, must have had an ownership interest in the farming operation at the time of the disaster; and

        (3) The amount of the loan will be based on the percentage of the former farming operation transferred to the applicant and in no event will the individual portions aggregated equal more than would have been authorized for the former farming operation.

        (k) Must agree to repay any duplicative Federal assistance to the agency providing such assistance. An applicant receiving Federal assistance for a major disaster or emergency is liable to the United States to the extent that the assistance duplicates benefits available to the applicant for the same purpose from another source.

        (l) Whose primary enterprise is to breed, raise, and sell horses may be eligible under this part.

        § 764.353   Limitations.

#### § § 764.353

        (a) EM loans must comply with the general limitations established at § 764.102.

        (b) EM loans may not exceed the lesser of:

        (1) The amount of credit necessary to restore the farming operation to its pre-disaster condition;

        (2) In the case of a physical loss loan, the total eligible physical losses caused by the disaster; or

        (3) In the case of a production loss loan, 100 percent of the total actual production loss sustained by the applicant as calculated in paragraph (c) of this section.

        (c) For production loss loans, the applicant's actual crop production loss will be calculated as follows:

        (1) Subtract the disaster yield from the normal yield to determine the per acre production loss;

        (2) Multiply the per acre production loss by the number of acres of the farming operation devoted to the crop to determine the volume of the production loss;

        (3) Multiply the volume of the production loss by the market price for such crop as determined by the Agency to determine the dollar value for the production loss; and

        (4) Subtract any related compensation or insurance indemnities received or to be received by the applicant for the loss.

        (d) For a physical loss loan, the applicant's total eligible physical losses will be calculated as follows:

        (1) Add the allowable costs associated with replacing or repairing chattel covered by hazard insurance (excluding labor, machinery, equipment, or materials contributed by the applicant to repair or replace chattel);

        (2) Add the allowable costs associated with repairing or replacing real estate, covered by hazard insurance;

        (3) Add the value of replacement livestock and livestock products for which the applicant provided:

        (i) Written documentation of inventory on hand immediately preceding the loss;

        (ii) Records of livestock product sales sufficient to allow the Agency to establish a value;

        (4) Add the allowable costs to restore perennials to the stage of development the damaged perennials had obtained prior to the disaster;

        (5) Add, in the case of an individual applicant, the allowable costs associated with repairing or replacing household contents, not to exceed $20,000; and

        (6) Subtract any other disaster related compensation or insurance indemnities received or to be received by the applicant for the loss or damage to the chattel or real estate.

        (e) EM loan funds may not be used for physical loss purposes unless:

        (1) The physical property was covered by general hazard insurance at the time that the damage caused by the natural disaster occurred. The level of the coverage in effect at the time of the disaster must have been the tax or cost depreciated value, whichever is less. Chattel property must have been covered at the tax or cost depreciated value, whichever is less, when such insurance was readily available and the benefit of the coverage was greater than the cost of the insurance; or

        (2) The loan is to a poultry farmer to cover the loss of a chicken house for which the applicant did not have hazard insurance at the time of the loss and the applicant:

        (i) Applied for, but was unable to obtain hazard insurance for the chicken house;

        (ii) Uses the loan to rebuild the chicken house in accordance with industry standards in effect on the date the applicant submits an application for the loan;

        (iii) Obtains, for the term of the loan, hazard insurance for the full market value of the chicken house; and

        (iv) Meets all other requirements for the loan.

        (f) EM loan funds may not be used to refinance consumer debt, such as automobile loans, or credit card debt unless such credit card debt is directly attributable to the farming operation.

        (g) Losses associated with horses used for racing, showing, recreation, or pleasure or loss of income derived from racing, showing, recreation, boarding, or pleasure are not considered qualified losses under this section.

        (a)  (1) The interest rate is the Agency's Emergency Loan Actual Loss rate, available in each Agency office.

        (2) The interest rate charged will be the lower rate in effect at the time of loan approval or loan closing.

        (b)  (1) The Agency schedules repayment of EMs based on the useful life of the security and the type of loss.

        (2) The repayment schedule must include at least one payment every year.

        (3) EMs for annual farm operating and family living expenses, except expenses associated with establishing a perennial crop that are subject to paragraph (b)(4), must be repaid within 12 months. The Agency may extend this term to not more than 24 months to accommodate the production cycle of the agricultural commodities.

        (4) The standard repayment term of an EM for production losses or physical losses to chattel security (including assets with an expected life between 1 and 7 years) will be equal to the useful life of the security or 7 years, whichever is less. Repayment terms less than the standard term must be requested by the applicant in writing. The Agency may extend the repayment term up to a total length not to exceed 20 years, if adequate security is available, and repayment schedules may include equal installments, or unequal installments, if needed to establish a new enterprise, develop a farm, recover from a disaster or economic reversal, or reasonably increase cash flow margin to increase working capital reserves and savings, including reasonable savings for retirement and education, and security is adequate to support the term of the loan. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, repayment schedules must be designed to ensure the loan is fully secured for the life of the loan.

        (5) The standard repayment term of an EM for physical losses to real estate will be equal to the useful life of the security or 40 years, whichever is less. Repayment terms less than the standard term must be requested by the applicant in writing. In no event will the term be more than 40 years from the date of the note, and repayment schedules may include equal installments, or unequal installments, if needed to establish a new enterprise, develop a farm, recover from a disaster or economic reversal, or reasonably increase cash flow margin to increase working capital reserves and savings, including reasonable savings for retirement and education, and security is adequate to support the term of the loan. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, repayment schedules must be designed to ensure the loan is fully secured for the life of the loan.

        (6) The first installment of an EM, for purposes other than annual farm operating and family living expenses, will be an interest-only installment scheduled 12 months from the date of loan closing. An alternative repayment agreement that schedules the first installment sooner than 12 months from the date of closing, or in an amount greater than interest-only, may be provided upon written request from the applicant, or if the Agency determines it necessary to ensure the loan is fully secured for the life of the loan.

        (7) The minimum scheduled installments for the first 3 years of an EM, for purposes other than annual farm operating and family living expenses, must be the interest accrued on the principal balance. Interest-only installments may be permitted for additional years, if determined necessary by Agency, to establish a new enterprise where production income is delayed, to develop a farm, or to recover from a disaster or economic reversal.

These general security requirements, however, do not apply to equine loss loans to the extent that a lien is not obtainable or obtaining a lien may prevent the applicant from carrying on the normal course of business. Other security may be considered for an equine loss loan in the order of priority as follows:

        (1) Real estate,

        (2) Chattels and crops, other than horses,

        (3) Other assets owned by the applicant,

        (4) Third party pledges of property not owned by the applicant,

        (5) Repayment ability under paragraph (c) of this section.

        (c) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, when adequate security is not available because of the disaster, the loan may be approved if the Agency determines, based on an otherwise feasible plan, there is a reasonable assurance that the applicant has the ability to repay the loan provided:

        (1) The applicant has pledged as security for the loan all available personal and business security, except as provided in § 764.106;

        (2) The farm operating plan, approved by the Agency, indicates the loan will be repaid based upon the applicant's production and income history; addresses applicable pricing risks through the use of marketing contracts, hedging, options, or other revenue protection mechanisms, and includes a marketing plan or similar risk management practice;

        (3) The applicant has had positive net cash farm income in at least 3 of the past 5 years; and

        (4) The applicant has provided the Agency an assignment on any USDA program payments to be received.

        (d) For loans over $25,000, title clearance is required when real estate is taken as security.

        (e) For loans of $25,000 or less, when real estate is taken as security, a certification of ownership in real estate is required. Certification of ownership may be in the form of an affidavit which is signed by the applicant, names the record owner of the real estate in question and lists the balances due on all known debts against the real estate. Whenever the Agency is uncertain of the record owner or debts against the real estate security, a title search is required.

#### § § 764.356

        (a) In the case of physical losses associated with livestock, the applicant must have written documentation of the inventory of livestock and records of livestock product sales sufficient to allow the Agency to value such livestock or livestock products just prior to the loss.

        (b) In the case of farm assets damaged by the disaster, the value of such security shall be established as of the day before the disaster occurred.

        (c) In the case of an equine loss loan:

        (1) The applicant's Federal income tax and business records will be the primary source of financial information. Sales receipts, invoices, or other official sales records will document the sales price of individual animals.

        (2) If the applicant does not have 3 complete years of business records, the Agency will obtain the most reliable and reasonable information available from sources such as the Cooperative Extension Service, universities, and breed associations to document production for those years for which the applicant does not have a complete year of business records.

        (1) The applicant's farm operating plan does not reflect a feasible plan;

        (2) The proposed use of loan funds is not authorized for the type of loan requested;

        (3) The applicant does not meet the eligibility requirements for the type of loan requested;

        (7) The applicant, the farming operation, or other circumstances surrounding the loan are inconsistent with the authorizing statutes, other Federal laws, or Federal credit policies.

        (c)  If an FLP loan denial is overturned on administrative appeal, the Agency will not automatically approve the loan. Unless prohibited by the final appeal determination or otherwise advised by the Office of General Counsel, the Agency will:

        (1) Request current financial information from the applicant as necessary to determine whether any changes in the applicant's financial condition or agricultural conditions which occurred after the Agency's adverse decision was made will adversely affect the applicant's farming operation;

        (2) Approve a loan for crop production:

        (i) Only if the Agency can determine that the applicant will be able to produce a crop in the production cycle for which the loan is requested; or

        (ii) For the next production cycle, upon review of current financial data and a farm operating plan for the next production cycle, if the Agency determines the loan can be repaid. The new farm operating plan must reflect any financial issues resolved in the appeal.

        (3) Determine whether the applicant's farm operating plan, as modified based on the appeal decision, reflects a feasible plan, which includes repayment of the proposed loan and demonstrates that all other credit needs can be met.

#### § § 764.402

        (a)  Signatures on loan documents are required as follows:

        (1) For individual applicants, only the applicant is required to sign the promissory note.

        (d)  (1) The Agency will close a real estate loan only when it determines that the Agency requirements for the loan have been satisfied and the closing agent can issue a policy of title insurance or final title opinion as of the date of closing. The title insurance or final title opinion requirement may be waived:

The applicant may be required to provide updated information for the Agency to reconfirm approval and proceed with loan closing.

        (3) The Agency or closing agent will be responsible for disbursing loan funds. The electronic funds transfer process, followed by Treasury checks, are the Agency's preferred methods of loan funds disbursement. The Agency will use these processes on behalf of borrowers to disburse loan proceeds directly to creditors being refinanced with loan funds or to sellers of chattel property that is being acquired with loan funds. A supervised bank account will be used according to subpart B of part 761 of this chapter when these processes are not practicable.

        § 765.154   Distribution of payments.

#### § § 765.155

        (a)  (1) Unless the Agency has reservations regarding the validity of the payment, the Agency may release the borrower's security instruments at the time payment is made, if the borrower makes a final payment by one of the following methods:

        (3) The Agency will return the paid note and satisfied security instruments to the borrower after the Agency processes the final payment and determines that the total indebtedness is paid in full.

        (b)  If the borrower refunds the entire loan after the loan is closed, the borrower must pay interest from the date of the note to the date the Agency received the funds.

        (c)  If an Agency miscalculation of a final payment results in an overpayment by the borrower of less than $10, the borrower must request a refund from the Agency in writing. Overpayments of $10 or more automatically will be refunded by the Agency.

        (d)  If an Agency miscalculation of a final payment amount results in an underpayment, the Agency may collect all account balances resulting from its error.

        (b) The borrower may not dispose of chattel security for an amount less than its market value. All proceeds, including any amount in excess of the market value, must be distributed to lienholders for application to the borrower's account in the order of lien priority.

        (1) The Agency considers the market value of normal income security to be the prevailing market price of the commodity in the area in which the farm is located.

        (2) The market value for basic security is determined by an appraisal obtained in accordance with § 761.7 of this chapter.

        (c) When the borrower sells chattel security, the property and proceeds remain subject to the Agency lien until the lien is released by the Agency.

        (d) The Agency and all other lienholders must provide written consent before a borrower may use proceeds for a purpose other than payment of lienholders in the order of lien priority.

        (e) The transaction must not interfere with the borrower's farming operation or jeopardize the borrower's ability to repay the FLP loan.

        (h) All checks, drafts, or money orders which the borrower receives from the sale of Agency security must be payable to the borrower and the Agency. If all FLP loan installments and any past due installments, for the period of the agreement for the use of proceeds have been paid, however, these payments from the sale of normal income security may be payable solely to the borrower.

        (2) Proceeds remitted to the Agency may be used as follows:

        (i) Applied to the FLP loan;

        (ii) Pay customary costs appropriate to the transaction.

        (3) With the concurrence of all lienholders, proceeds may be used to preserve the security because of a natural disaster or other severe catastrophe, when funds cannot be obtained by other means in time to prevent the borrower and the Agency from suffering a substantial loss.

        (4) Security may be consumed as follows:

        (i) Livestock may be used by the borrower's family for subsistence;

        (ii) If crops serve as security and usually would be marketed, the Agency may allow such crops to be fed to the borrower's livestock, if this is preferable to marketing, provided the Agency obtains a lien or assignment on the livestock, and livestock products, at least equal to the lien on the crops.

        (b)  In addition to the uses specified in paragraph (a) of this section, the agreement for the use of proceeds will allow for release of proceeds from the sale of normal income security to be used to pay essential family living and farm operating expenses. Such releases will be terminated when an account is accelerated.

        (c)  In addition to the uses specified in paragraph (a) of this section:

        (1) Proceeds from the sale of basic security may not be used for any family living and farm operating expenses.

        (2) Security may be exchanged for chattel property better suited to the borrower's farming needs if the Agency will acquire a lien on the new property at least equal in value to the lien held on the property exchanged.

        (3) Proceeds may be used to purchase chattel property better suited to the borrower's farming needs if the Agency will acquire a lien on the purchased property. The value of the purchased property, together with any proceeds applied to the FLP loan, must at least equal the value of the Agency lien on the old security.

        (2) Provide disposition or use information to enable the Agency to consider post-approval within 30 days of Agency notification.

        (b) Failure to cure the first unauthorized disposition in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section, or a second unauthorized disposition, whether or not cured, constitutes a non-monetary default, will be considered by the Agency when making eligibility determinations for future requests for assistance, may adversely impact such requests, and may result in civil or criminal action.

        (1) The borrower assigns to the Agency the proceeds of any advances made, or to be made, on the wool or mohair by the broker, less shipping, handling, processing, and marketing costs;

        (2) The borrower assigns to the Agency the proceeds of the sale of the wool or mohair, less any remaining costs in shipping, handling, processing, and marketing, and less the amount of any advance (including any interest which may have accrued on the advance) made by the broker against the wool or mohair; and

        (3) The borrower and broker agree that the net proceeds of any advances on, or sale of, the wool or mohair will be paid by checks made payable jointly to the borrower and the Agency.

        (c) The Agency will release its lien on chattel security without compensation, after written request from the borrower, provided all the following criteria are satisfied:

        (1) The borrower is current on all loan accounts with FSA and has not received PLS, DBSA, or DSA on any loan within the last 36 months;

        (2) The borrower has paid in full scheduled direct term loan installments that include principal reduction in each of the last 3 calendar years;

        (3) After the release, the security margin on each Agency direct loan will be 125 percent (or more, if it is not practicable to separate the property, if necessary to ensure the loan is fully secured for the life of the loan, or if the borrower requests only a portion of Agency security to be released). The value of the retained and released security will normally be based on appraisals obtained as specified in § 761.7 of this chapter; however, well-documented recent sales of similar properties can be used if the Agency determines a supportable decision can be made without current appraisals;

        (4) Any asset requested for release must serve only as security for term loan(s) that have been outstanding for at least the prior 36 months and cannot serve as adequate security for another existing Agency direct loan; and

        (2) Any compensation the borrower may receive for damages to the surface of the real estate security resulting from exploration for, or recovery of, minerals must be assigned to the Agency. Such proceeds will be used to repair the damage, and any remaining funds must be remitted to lienholders in the order of lien priority or, with all lienholders' consent, used for an authorized loan purpose.

        (c)  (1) When an exchange of security results in a balance owing to the borrower, the proceeds must be used in accordance with § 765.352.

        (2) The sale of an allotment must comply with all conditions of this subpart.

        (b)  (1) The Agency may release the transferor from liability when all of the security is transferred and the total outstanding debt is assumed.

        (2) If an outstanding debt balance will remain and only part of the transferor's Agency security is transferred, the written request for release of liability will not be approved, unless the deficiency is otherwise resolved to the Agency's satisfaction.

        (3) If an outstanding balance will remain and all of the transferor's security has been transferred, the transferor may pay the remaining balance or request debt settlement in accordance with part 761 subpart F of this chapter. If the transferor does not resolve the debt by paying the remaining balance or submitting a debt settlement offer that is acceptable to the Agency, the Agency will service the debt in accordance with part 3 of this title using all applicable collection tools including, but not limited to, administrative offset, AWG, cross-servicing, Federal salary offset, and TOP.

        (4) Except for loans in default being serviced under 7 CFR part 766, if an individual who is jointly liable for repayment of an FLP loan withdraws from the farming operation and conveys all of their interest in the security to the remaining borrower, the withdrawing party may be released from liability under the following conditions:

        (ii) The Agency will consider a partial deferral if deferral of the total Agency payment would result in the borrower developing more cash availability than necessary to meet debt repayment obligations.

        (b)  (1) The deferral term will not exceed 5 years and will be determined based on the post-deferral plan that results in the:

        (i) Greatest improvement over the first year cash available to service FLP debt;

        (ii) The shortest possible deferral period.

        (2) The Agency will distribute interest accrued on the deferred principal portion of the loan equally to payments over the remaining loan term after the deferral period ends.

        (c)  (1) If during the deferral period the borrower's repayment ability has increased to allow the borrower to make payments on the deferred loans, the borrower must make supplemental payments, as determined by the Agency. If the borrower agrees to make supplemental payments, but does not do so, the borrower will be considered to be in non-monetary default.

        (2) If the Agency determines that the borrower's improved repayment ability will allow graduation, the Agency will require the borrower to graduate in accordance with part 765, subpart C of this chapter.

        (d)  (1) The Agency must cancel an existing deferral if the Agency approves any new primary loan servicing action.

        (2) Loans deferred will also be serviced in accordance with §§ 766.107, 766.108 and 766.111, as appropriate.

        § 766.110   Conservation Contract.

#### § § 766.110

        (a)  (1) A debtor with only SA or Non-program loans is not eligible for a Conservation Contract. However, an SA or Non-program loan may be considered for a Conservation Contract if the borrower also has program loans.

        (2) A current or financially distressed borrower may request a Conservation Contract at any time prior to becoming 90 days past due.

        (3) A delinquent borrower may request a Conservation Contract during the same 60-day time period in which the borrower may apply for primary loan servicing. The borrower eligibility requirements in § 766.104 will apply.

        (4) A Conservation Contract may be established for conservation, recreation, and wildlife purposes.

        (5) The land under a Conservation Contract cannot be used for the production of agricultural commodities during the term of the contract.

        (6) Only loans secured by the real estate that will be subject to the Conservation Contract may be considered for debt reduction under this section.

        (b)  The following types of lands are eligible to be considered for a Conservation Contract by the Conservation Contract review team:

        (1) Wetlands or highly erodible lands; and

        (2) Uplands that meet any one of the following criteria:

        (i) Land containing aquatic life, endangered species, or wildlife habitat of local, State, tribal, or national importance;

        (ii) Land in 100-year floodplains;

        (iii) Areas of high water quality or scenic value;

        (iv) Historic or cultural properties listed in or eligible for the National Register of Historic Places;

        (v) Aquifer recharge areas of local, regional, State, or tribal importance;

        (vi) Buffer areas necessary for the adequate protection of proposed Conservation Contract areas, or other areas enrolled in other conservation programs;

        (vii) Areas that contain soils generally not suited for cultivation; or

        (viii) Areas within or adjacent to Federal, State, tribal, or locally administered conservation areas.

        (c)  Notwithstanding paragraph (b) of this section, acreage is unsuitable for a Conservation Contract if:

        (1) It is not suited or eligible for the program due to legal restrictions;

        (2) It has on-site or off-site conditions that prohibit the use of the land for conservation, wildlife, or recreational purposes; or

        (3) The Conservation Contract review team determines that the land is not suitable for conservation, wildlife, or recreational purposes.

        (3) The Conservation Contract review team determines that the land does not provide measurable conservation, wildlife, or recreational benefits;

        (4) There would be a duplication of benefits as determined by the Conservation Contract review team because the acreage is encumbered under another Federal, State, or local government program for which the borrower has been or is being compensated for conservation, wildlife, or recreation benefits;

        (5) The acreage subject to the proposed Conservation Contract is encumbered under a Federal, State, or local government cost share program that is inconsistent with the purposes of the proposed Conservation Contract, or the required practices of the cost share program are not identified in the conservation management plan;

        (6) The tract does not contain a legal right of way or other permanent access for the term of the contract that can be used by the Agency or its designee to carry out the contract; or

        (7) The tract, including any buffer areas, to be included in a Conservation Contract is less than 10 acres.

        (d)  The borrower selects the term of the contract, which may be 10, 30, or 50 years.

        (e)  The Agency, with the recommendations of the Conservation Contract review team, is responsible for developing a conservation management plan. The conservation management plan will address the following:

        (1) The acres of eligible land and the approximate boundaries, and

        (2) A description of the conservation, wildlife, or recreation benefits to be realized.

        (f)  The Agency has enforcement authority over the Conservation Contract. The Agency, however, may delegate contract management to another entity if doing so is in the Agency's best interest.

        (g)  The Conservation Contract must meet the following conditions:

        (1) Result in a feasible plan for current borrowers; or

        (2) Result in a feasible plan with or without primary loan servicing for financially distressed or delinquent borrowers; and

        (3) Improve the borrower's ability to repay the remaining balance of the loan.

        (h)  The amount of debt reduction by a Conservation Contract is calculated as follows:

        (1) Divide the contract acres by the total acres that secure the borrower's FLP loans to determine the contract acres percentage.

        (2) Multiply the borrower's total unpaid FLP loan balance (principal, interest, and recoverable costs already paid by the Agency) by the percentage calculated under paragraph (h)(1) of this section to determine the amount of FLP debt that is secured by the contract acreage.

        (3) Multiply the borrower's total unpaid FLP loan balance (principal, interest, and recoverable costs already paid by the Agency) by 33 percent.

        (4) The lesser of the amounts calculated in paragraphs (h)(2) and (h)(3) of this section is the maximum amount of debt reduction for a 50-year contract.

        (5) The borrower will receive 60 percent of the amount calculated in paragraph (h)(4) of this section for a 30-year contract.

        (6) The borrower will receive 20 percent of the amount calculated in paragraph (h)(4) of this section for a 10-year contract.

        (i)  The amount of debt reduction by a Conservation Contract is calculated as follows:

        (1) Divide the contract acres by the total acres that secure the borrower's FLP loans to determine the contract acres percentage.

        (2) Multiply the borrower's total unpaid FLP loan balance (principal, interest, and recoverable costs already paid by the Agency) by the percentage calculated in paragraph (i)(1) of this section to determine the amount of FLP debt that is secured by the contract acreage.

        (3) Multiply the market value of the total acres, less contributory value of any structural improvements, that secure the borrower's FLP loans by the percent calculated in paragraph (i)(1) of this section to determine the current value of the acres in the contract.

        (4) Subtract the market value of the contract acres calculated in paragraph (i)(3) of this section from the FLP debt secured by the contract acres as calculated in paragraph (i)(2) of this section.

        (5) Select the greater of the amounts calculated in either paragraphs (i)(3) and (i)(4) of this section.

        (6) The lesser of the amounts calculated in paragraphs (i)(2) and (i)(5) of this section will be the maximum amount of debt reduction for a 50-year contract term.

        (7) The borrower will receive 60 percent of the amount calculated in paragraph (i)(6) of this section for a 30-year contract term.

        (8) The borrower will receive 20 percent of the amount calculated in paragraph (i)(6) of this section for a 10-year contract term.

        (j)  The borrower must sign the Conservation Contract Agreement establishing the contract's terms and conditions.

        (k)  If the borrower or any subsequent landowner transfers title to the property, the Conservation Contract will remain in effect for the duration of the contract term.

        (l)  Borrower appeals of the Natural Resources Conservation Service's (NRCS) technical decisions made in connection with a Conservation Contract, will be handled in accordance with applicable NRCS regulations. Other aspects of the denial of a conservation contract may be appealed in accordance with 7 CFR parts 11 and 780.

        (m)  For real estate with a Conservation Contract:

        (1) Subordination will be required for all liens that are in a prior lien position to the Conservation Contract.

        (2) The Agency will not subordinate Conservation Contracts to liens of other lenders or other Governmental entities.

        (n)  If the borrower or a subsequent owner of the land under the Conservation Contract fails to comply with any of its provisions, the Agency will declare the Conservation Contract breached. If the Conservation Contract is breached, the borrower or subsequent owner of the land must restore the land to be in compliance with the Conservation Contract and all terms of the conservation management plan within 90 days. If this cure is not completed, the Agency will take the following actions:

        (1) For borrowers who have or had a loan in which debt was exchanged for the Conservation Contract and breach the Conservation Contract, the Agency may reinstate the debt that was cancelled, plus interest to the date of payment at the rate of interest in the promissory note, and assess liquidated damages in the amount of 25 percent of the debt cancelled, plus any actual expenses incurred by the Agency in enforcing the terms of the Conservation Contract. The borrower's account will be considered in non-monetary default; and

        (2) Subsequent landowners who breach the Conservation Contract must pay the Agency the amount of the debt cancelled when the contract was executed, plus interest at the non-program interest rate to the date of payment, plus liquidated damages in the amount of 25 percent of the cancelled debt, plus any actual expenses incurred by the Agency in enforcing the terms of the Conservation Contract.

        § 766.111   Write-down.

#### § § 766.111

        (a)  The Agency will only consider a write-down if the borrower:

        (1) Meets the eligibility criteria in § 766.104;

        (2) Is delinquent;

        (3) Has not previously received debt forgiveness on any FLP direct loan; and

        (4) Complies with the Highly Erodible Land and Wetland Conservation requirements of 7 CFR part 12.

        (b)  The conditions required for approval of write-down are:

        (1) Rescheduling, consolidation, reamortization, deferral or some ombination of these options on all of the borrower's loans would not result in a feasible plan with a 110 percent debt service margin. If a feasible plan is achieved with a debt service margin of 101 percent or more, the Agency will permit a borrower to accept a non-write-down servicing offer and waive the right to a write-down offer when the write-down offer will require additional time and appraisals to fully develop. If after obtaining an appraisal a feasible plan is achieved with and without a write-down and the borrower meets all the eligibility requirements, both options will be offered, and the borrower may choose one option.

        (2) The present value of the restructured loan must be greater than or equal to the net recovery value of Agency security and any non-essential assets.

        (3) The write-down amount, excluding debt reduction received through Conservation Contract, does not exceed $300,000.

        (4) A borrower who owns real estate must execute an SAA in accordance with § 766.201.

        (c)  Loans written down will also be serviced in accordance with §§ 766.107 and 766.108, as appropriate.

        § 766.112   Additional security for restructured loans.

#### § § 766.112

        (a) If the borrower is delinquent prior to restructuring, an additional amount of security will be required, if available, to reach a 125 percent security margin when the Agency is servicing a loan, except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section. Total loan security in excess of what is needed to achieve a security margin of 125 percent will only be taken when it is not practicable to separate the security.

        (b) The Agency will take the best lien obtainable on assets of the borrower and co-borrowers to meet the 125 percent security margin requirement, except that the following assets will not be considered available to meet this requirement:

        (1) When taking a lien on an asset will prevent the borrower from obtaining credit from other sources;

        (2) When an asset could have significant environmental problems or costs as described in part 799 of this chapter;

        (3) When the Agency cannot obtain a valid lien;

        (4) When an asset is subsistence livestock, cash, special collateral accounts the borrower uses for the farming operation, retirement accounts, education savings accounts, personal vehicles necessary for family living, household contents, or small equipment such as hand tools and lawn mowers; or

        (5) When a contractor holds title to a livestock or crop enterprise, or the borrower manages the enterprise under a share lease or share agreement.

        (1) The borrower has not previously received debt forgiveness on any other FLP direct loan;

        (2) The borrower has acted in good faith;

        (3) The borrower does not have non-essential assets for which the net recovery value is sufficient to pay the account current;

        (4) The borrower is unable to develop a feasible plan through primary loan servicing programs or a Conservation Contract, if requested;

        (5) The present value of the restructured loans is less than the net recovery value of Agency security;

        (6) The borrower pays the amount required in a lump sum without guaranteed or direct credit from the Agency; and

        (7) The amount of debt forgiveness does not exceed $300,000.

        (b)  After the Agency offers current market value buyout of the loan, the borrower has 90 days from the date of Agency notification to pay that amount.

#### § § 766.115

        (a) A borrower considered for primary loan servicing who does not agree with the Agency's appraisal of the borrower's assets may:

        (1) Obtain a USPAP compliant technical appraisal review prepared by a State Certified General Appraiser of the Agency's appraisal and provide it to the Agency within 90 days of the request for reconsideration or appeal and prior to reconsideration or the appeal hearing;

        (2) Obtain an independent appraisal within 90 days of the request for reconsideration or appeal request and completed in accordance with § 761.7 as part of the request or reconsideration or appeals process. The borrower must:

        (i) Pay for this appraisal;

        (ii) Choose which appraisal will be used in Agency calculations, if the difference between the two appraisals is five percent or less.

        (3) Use the second appraisal completed under paragraph (a)(2) of this section to negotiate the Agency's appraisal.

        (i) If the difference between the two appraisals is five percent or less, the borrower will choose the appraisal to be used in Agency calculations.

        (ii) If the difference between the two appraisals is greater than five percent, the borrower may request a third appraisal within 30 days from the date the second appraisal is provided to the Agency. The Agency and the borrower will share the cost of the third appraisal equally. The average of the two appraisals closest in value will serve as the final value.

        (iii) A borrower may request a negotiated appraisal only once in connection with an application for primary loan servicing.

        (iv) The borrower may not appeal a negotiated appraisal.

        (b) If the appraised value of the borrower's assets change as a result of the challenge, the Agency will reconsider its previous primary loan servicing decision using the new appraisal value.

        (c) If the appeal process results in a determination that the borrower is eligible for primary loan servicing, the Agency will use the information utilized to make the appeal decision, unless stated otherwise in the appeal decision letter.

        § 766.202   Determining the shared appreciation due.

#### § § 766.202

        (a) The value of the real estate security at the time of maturity of the SAA (market value) will be the appraised value of the security at the highest and best use, less the increase in the value of the security resulting from capital improvements added during the term of the SAA (contributory value). The market value of the real estate security property will be determined based on a current appraisal completed within the previous 18 months in accordance with § 761.7 of this chapter, and subject to the following:

        (1) Prior to completion of the appraisal, the borrower will identify any capital improvements that have been added to the real estate security since the execution of the SAA.

        (2) The appraisal must specifically identify the contributory value of capital improvements made to the real estate security during the term of the SAA to make deductions for that value.

        (3) For calculation of shared appreciation recapture, the contributory value of capital improvements added during the term of the SAA will be deducted from the market value of the property. Such capital improvements must also meet at least one of the following criteria:

        (i) It is the borrower's primary residence. If the new residence is affixed to the real estate security as a replacement for a residence which existed on the security property when the SAA was originally executed, or, the living area square footage of the original residence was expanded, only the value added to the real property by the new or expanded portion of the original residence (if it added value) will be deducted from the market value.

        (ii) It is an improvement to the real estate with a useful life of over one year and is affixed to the property, the following conditions must be met:

        (A) The item must have been capitalized and not taken as an annual operating expense on the borrower's Federal income tax returns. The borrower must provide copies of appropriate tax returns to verify that capital improvements claimed for shared appreciation recapture reduction are capitalized.

        (B) If the new item is affixed to the real estate as a replacement for an item that existed on the real estate at the time the SAA was originally executed, only the value added by the new item will be deducted from the market value.

        (b) In the event of a partial sale, an appraisal of the property being sold may be required to determine the market value at the time the SAA was signed if such value cannot be obtained through another method.

        (2) Fifty percent of such appreciation if the agreement is triggered more than 4 years from the date of the write-down or when the agreement matures.

        (b) If the borrower sells a portion of the security, the borrower must pay shared appreciation only on the portion sold. Shared appreciation on the remaining portion will be due in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section.

        (c) The amount of recapture cannot exceed the amount of the debt written off through debt write-down.

The Agency services existing Net Recovery Buyout Recapture Agreements as described in this section.

        (b)  (1) The term of a Net Recovery Buyout Recapture Agreement is 10 years. Net Recovery Buyout Recapture Agreements are secured by a lien on the former borrower's real estate.

        (2) If the former borrower sells or conveys real estate within the 10-year term, the former borrower must repay the Agency the lesser of:

        (i) The market value of the real estate parcel at the time of sale or conveyance, as determined by an Agency appraisal, minus the portion of the recovery value of the real estate paid to the Agency in the buyout;

        (ii) The market value of the real estate parcel at the time of the sale or conveyance, as determined by an Agency appraisal, minus:

        (A) The unpaid balance of prior liens at the time of the sale or conveyance; and

        (B) The net recovery value of the real estate the borrower paid to the Agency in the buyout if this amount has not been accounted for as a prior lien;

        (iii) The total amount of the FLP debt the Agency wrote off for loans secured by real estate.

        (3) If the former borrower does not pay the amount due, the Agency will liquidate the Net Recovery Buyout account in accordance with subpart H of this part.

        (4) If the former borrower does not sell or convey the real estate within the 10-year term, no recapture is due.

This moratorium applies only to program loans made under subtitle A, B, or C of the Act (for example, CL, FO, OL, EM, SW, or RL). Interest will not accrue and no offsets will be taken on these loans during the moratorium. Interest accrual and offsets will continue on all other loans, including, but not limited to, non-program loans.

        (1) If the Agency prevails on the program discrimination complaint, the interest that would have accrued during the moratorium will be reinstated on the account when the moratorium terminates, and all offsets and servicing actions will resume.

        (2) If the borrower prevails on the program discrimination complaint, the interest that would have accrued during the moratorium will not be reinstated on the account unless specifically required by the settlement agreement or court order.

        (b) The moratorium will begin on:

        (1) May 22, 2008, if the borrower had a pending program discrimination claim that was accepted by USDA as valid and the account was at the point of acceleration or foreclosure on or before that date; or

        (2) The date after May 22, 2008, when the borrower has a program discrimination claim accepted by USDA as valid and the borrower's account is at the point of acceleration or foreclosure.

        (c) The point of acceleration under this section is the earliest of the following:

        (1) The day after all rights offered on the Agency notice of intent to accelerate expire if the borrower does not appeal;

        (2) The day after all appeals resulting from an Agency notice of intent to accelerate are concluded if the borrower appeals and the Agency prevails on the appeal;

        (3) The day after all appeal rights have been concluded relating to a failure to graduate and the Agency prevails on any appeal;

        (4) Any other time when, because of litigation, third party action, or other unforeseen circumstance, acceleration is the next step for the Agency in servicing and liquidating the account.

        (d) A borrower is considered to be in foreclosure status under this section anytime after acceleration of the account.

        (e) The moratorium will end on the earlier of:

        (1) The date the program discrimination claim is resolved by USDA or

        (2) The date that a court of competent jurisdiction renders a final decision on the program discrimination claim if the borrower appeals the decision of USDA.

        § 769.108   Security requirements for HFIL loans and the ultimate recipients.

#### § § 769.108

        (a)  Security for all loans to intermediaries must be such that the repayment of the loan is reasonably assured, taking into consideration the intermediary's financial condition, Intermediary Relending Agreement, and management ability.

        (1) The Agency will only require concurrence in the intermediary lender's security requirement for a specific loan when security for the loan from the intermediary lender to the ultimate recipient will also serve as security for an Agency loan.

        (2) The ultimate recipient will take appropriate action to obtain and provide security for the loan.

        § 769.109   Intermediary lender's application.

#### § § 769.109

        (a) The application will consist of:

        (1) An application form provided by the Agency;

This statement may be submitted at the time of application in lieu of a new Intermediary Relending Agreement.

        (4) Documentation of the intermediary lender's ability to administer HFIL in accordance with this part;

        (5) Submission of a completed Agency application form;

        (b) An intermediary lender that has received one or more HFIL loans may apply for and be considered for subsequent HFIL loans provided:

        (1) The intermediary lender is relending all collections from loans made from its revolving fund in excess of what is needed for required debt service, approved administration costs, and a reserve for debt service;

        (2) The outstanding loans of the intermediary lender's HFIL revolving fund are performing; and

        (3) The intermediary lender is in compliance with all regulations and its loan agreements with the Agency.

After reviewing the conditions and requirements in the letter of conditions, the intermediary lender must complete, sign, and return the form provided by the Agency indicating the intermediary lender's intent to meet the conditions. If certain conditions cannot be met, the intermediary lender may propose alternate conditions in writing to the Agency.

        § 769.120   Loan closing.

#### § § 769.120

        (a)  A loan agreement or supplement to a previous loan agreement must be executed by the intermediary lender and the Agency at loan closing for each loan setting forth, at a minimum,

        (1) The amount of the loan, the interest rate, the term and repayment schedule,

        (2) The requirement to maintain a separate ledger and segregated account for the HFIL revolving fund; and

        (3) It agrees to comply with Agency reporting requirements.

        (b)  Intermediary lenders receiving HFIL loans will be governed by this part, the loan agreement, the approved Intermediary Relending Agreement, security instruments, and any other conditions that the Agency requires on loans made from the “HFIL revolving fund.” The requirement applies to all loans made by an intermediary lender to an ultimate recipient from the intermediary lender's HFIL revolving fund for as long as any portion of the intermediary lender's HFIL loan from the Agency remains unpaid.

        (c)  The intermediary lender must include in their file a certification that:

        (1) The proposed ultimate recipient is eligible for the loan;

Such accounts must be fully covered by Federal deposit insurance or fully collateralized with U.S. Government obligations. All cash of the HFIL revolving fund must be deposited in a separate bank account or accounts so as not to be commingled with other financial assets of the intermediary lender. All money deposited in such bank account or accounts must be security assets of the HFIL revolving fund. Loans to ultimate recipients must be from the HFIL revolving fund.

        (1) The portion of the HFIL revolving fund that consists of Agency HFIL loan funds may only be used for making loans in accordance with § 769.105. The portion of the HFIL revolving fund that consists of repayments from ultimate recipients may be used for debt service, reasonable administrative costs, or for making additional loans;

        (2) An intermediary lender may use revolving funds and HFIL loan funds to make loans to ultimate recipients without obtaining prior Agency concurrence in accordance with the Intermediary Relending Agreement;

        (3) Any funds in the HFIL revolving fund from any source that is not needed for debt service, approved administrative costs, or reasonable reserves must be available for additional loans to ultimate recipients;

        (4) All reserves and other funds in the HFIL revolving loan fund not immediately needed for loans to ultimate recipients or other authorized uses must be deposited in accounts in banks or other financial institutions. Such accounts must be fully covered by Federal deposit insurance or fully collateralized with U.S. Government obligations, and will be interest bearing. Any interest earned thereon remains a part of the HFIL revolving fund;

        (5) If an intermediary lender receives more than one HFIL loan, it does not need to establish and maintain a separate HFIL revolving loan fund for each loan; it may combine them and maintain only one HFIL revolving fund, unless the Agency requires separate HFIL revolving funds because there are significant differences in the loan purposes, Intermediary Relending Agreement, loan agreements, or requirements for the loans; and

        (6) A reasonable amount of revolved funds must be used to create a reserve for bad debts. Reserves should be accumulated over a period of years. The total amount should not exceed maximum expected losses, considering the quality of the intermediary lender's portfolio of loans. Unless the intermediary lender provides loss and delinquency records that, in the opinion of the Agency, justifies different amounts, a reserve for bad debts of 6 percent of outstanding loans must be accumulated over 5 years and then maintained.

        (b)  The intermediary lender must complete loan monitoring reviews, including annual and periodic reviews, and performance monitoring.

        (1) At least annually, the intermediary lender must provide the Agency documents for the purpose of reviewing the financial status of the intermediary Lender, assessing the progress of utilizing loan funds, and identifying any potential problems or concerns. Non-regulated intermediary lenders must furnish audited financial statements at least annually.

        (2) At any time the Agency determines it is necessary, the intermediary lender must allow the Agency or its representative to review the operations and financial condition of the intermediary lender. Upon the Agency requests, the Intermediary must submit financial or other information within 14 days unless the data requested is not available within that time frame.

        (c)  Each intermediary lender will be monitored by the Agency based on progress reports submitted by the intermediary lender, audit findings, disbursement transactions, visitations, and other contact with the intermediary lender as necessary.

        § 769.122   Loan servicing.

#### § § 769.122

        (a)  Payments will be made to the Agency as specified in loan agreements and debt instruments. The funds from any extra payments will be applied entirely to loan principal.

        (b)  The Agency may restructure the intermediary lender's loan debt, if:

        (1) The Government's interest will be protected;

        (2) The restructuring will be performed within the Agency's budget authority; and

        (3) The loan objectives cannot be met unless the HFIL loan is restructured.

        (c)  In the event of monetary or non-monetary default, the Agency will take all appropriate actions to protect its interest, including, but not limited to, declaring the debt fully due and payable and may proceed to enforce its rights under the loan agreement or any other loan instruments relating to the loan under applicable law and regulations, and commencement of legal action to protect the Agency's interest. The Agency will work with the intermediary lender to correct any default, subject to the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section. Violation of any agreement with the Agency or failure to comply with reporting or other program requirements will be considered non-monetary default.

        § 769.123   Transfer and assumption.

#### § § 769.123

        (a) All transfers and assumptions must be approved in advance in writing by the Agency. The assuming entity must meet all eligibility criteria for the HFIL Loan Program.

        (b) Available transfer and assumption options to eligible intermediary lenders include the following:

        (1) The total indebtedness may be transferred to another eligible intermediary lender on the same terms; or

        (2) The total indebtedness may be transferred to another eligible intermediary lender on different terms not to exceed the term for which an initial loan can be made. The assuming entity must meet all eligibility criteria for the HFIL Loan Program.

        (c) The transferor must prepare the transfer document for the Agency review prior to the transfer and assumption.

        (d) The transferee must provide the Agency with information required in the application as specified in § 769.109.

        (e) The Agency prepared assumption agreement will contain the Agency case number of the transferor and transferee.

        (f) The transferee must complete an application as specified in § 769.109(a).

        (g) When the transferee makes a cash down-payment in connection with the transfer and assumption, any proceeds received by the transferor will be credited on the transferor's loan debt in order of maturity date.

        (h) The Administrator or designee will approve or decline all transfers and assumptions.

        § 769.124   Appeals.

#### § § 769.124

        Any appealable adverse decision made by the Agency may be appealed upon written request of the intermediary as specified in 7 CFR part 11.

        § 769.125   Exceptions.

#### § § 769.125

        The Agency may grant an exception to any of the requirements of this part if the proposed change is in the best financial interest of the Government and not inconsistent with the authorizing law or any other applicable law.

        § 769.160   Letter of conditions.

#### § § 769.160

        (a) If the Agency approves a loan application, the Agency will provide the intermediary with a letter of conditions listing all requirements for the loan.

        § 769.162   Security.

#### § § 769.162

        (a)  Security pledged to the Agency by intermediaries must be sufficient to reasonably assure repayment of the loan, while taking into consideration the intermediary's financial condition, the intermediary's relending plan, and the intermediary's management ability. The Agency will require adequate security, as determined by the Agency, to fully secure the loan:

        (1) Primary security for HPRP loan will consist of a pledge by the intermediary of all assets now or hereafter placed in the HPRP revolving loan fund, including cash and investments, notes receivable from ultimate recipients, and the intermediary's security interest in collateral pledged by ultimate recipients. A first lien in the intermediary's HPRP revolving loan fund account(s) will be accomplished by a deposit agreement. The deposit agreement with the depository bank will perfect the Agency's security interest in the intermediary's depository accounts. The deposit agreement must be approved by the Agency. The deposit agreement will not require the Agency's signature for withdrawals. The intermediary must use a depository bank that agrees to waive its offset and recoupment rights against the depository account and subordinate any liens it may have against the HPRP depository account in favor of the Agency;

        (2) Additional security as needed, which includes, but is not limited to:

        (i) Assignments of assessments, taxes, levies, or other sources of revenue as authorized by law;

        (ii) Financial assets of the intermediary and its members; and

        (ii) Capital assets or other property of the intermediary and its members.

        (b)  The intermediary is responsible for obtaining adequate security for all loans made to ultimate recipients from the HPRP revolving loan funds as specified in the HPRP loan agreement and intermediary's relending plan. The Agency will only require concurrence with the intermediary's proposed security for a loan to an ultimate recipient from the HPRP revolving loan fund if the proposed security will also serve as security for an unrelated Agency loan.

#### § § 769.164

        (a)  Whenever this subpart imposes a requirement on loan funds from the HPRP revolving loan fund, the requirement will apply to all loans made by an intermediary to an ultimate recipient from the intermediary's HPRP revolving loan fund for as long as any portion of the intermediary's HPRP loan remains unpaid.

        (b)  Whenever this subpart imposes a requirement on loans made by intermediaries from HPRP loan funds, without specific reference to the HPRP revolving loan fund, such requirement only applies to loans made by an intermediary using HPRP loan funds, and will not apply to loans made from revolved funds.

        (c)  In addition to information normally maintained by lenders in each loan file associated with a relending loan to an ultimate recipient, the intermediary must include a certification and supporting documentation in its file demonstrating that:

        (1) The ultimate recipient is eligible for the loan;

        (2) The loan is for eligible purposes; and

        (3) The loan complies with all applicable laws, regulations, and the intermediary's HPRP loan agreement.

        (d)  For as long as any part of an HPRP loan remains unpaid, the intermediary must maintain the HPRP revolving loan fund in accordance with the requirements in paragraphs (d)(1) through (11) of this section:

        (1) All HPRP loan funds received by an intermediary must be deposited into the HPRP revolving loan fund. The intermediary may transfer additional assets into the HPRP revolving loan fund;

        (2) All cash of the HPRP revolving loan fund must be deposited in a separate bank account or accounts;

        (3) The HPRP revolving loan fund must be segregated from other financial assets of the intermediary, and no other funds of the intermediary will be commingled with the HPRP revolving loan fund;

        (4) All moneys deposited in the HPRP revolving loan fund account or accounts will be money from the HPRP revolving loan fund;

        (5) Loans to ultimate recipients are advanced from the HPRP revolving loan fund;

        (6) The receivables created by making loans to ultimate recipients, the intermediary's security interest in collateral pledged by ultimate recipients, collections on the receivables, interest, fees, and any other income or assets derived from the operation of the HPRP revolving loan fund are a part of the HPRP revolving loan fund;

        (7) The portion of the HPRP revolving loan fund consisting of HPRP loan funds may only be used for making loans in accordance with § 769.154. The portion of the HPRP revolving loan fund that consists of revolved funds may be used for debt service reserve, approved administrative costs, or for making additional loans;

        (8) A reasonable amount of revolved funds must be maintained as a reserve for bad debts. The total amount should not exceed maximum expected losses, considering the credit quality of the intermediary's portfolio of loans. The amount of reserved funds proposed by the intermediary requires written concurrence from the Agency. Unless the intermediary provides loss and delinquency records that, in the opinion of the Agency, justifies different amounts, a reserve for bad debts of 6 percent of outstanding loans must be accumulated over 5 years and then maintained;

        (9) Any funds in the HPRP revolving loan fund from any source that is not needed for debt service reserve, approved administrative costs, or reasonable reserves must be available for additional loans to ultimate recipients:

        (i) Funds may not be used for any investments in securities or certificates of deposit of over 30-day duration without the Agency's concurrence; and

        (ii) Any funds that have not been used within 6 months to make loans to an ultimate recipient must be returned to the Agency unless the Agency provides a written exception based on evidence satisfactory to the Agency that funds will be used within an additional 6 months;

        (10) All reserves and other cash in the HPRP revolving loan fund must be deposited in accounts in banks or other financial institutions. Such accounts must be fully covered by Federal deposit insurance or the HPRP revolving loan fund must be protected by alternative measures approved by the Agency. The account must be interest-bearing, if feasible, and any interest earned on the account remains a part of the HPRP revolving loan fund; and

        (11) If an intermediary receives more than one HPRP loan, it does not need to establish and maintain a separate HPRP revolving loan fund for each loan; it may combine them and maintain only one HPRP revolving loan fund.

        (e)  The intermediary must submit an annual budget of proposed administrative costs for Agency approval. The annual budget should itemize cash income and cash out-flow. Projected cash income should consist of, but is not limited to, collection of principal repayment, interest repayment, interest earnings on deposits, fees, and other income. Projected cash out-flow should consist of, but is not limited to, principal and interest payments, reserve for bad debt, and an itemization of administrative costs to operate the HPRP revolving loan fund.

        (1) Proceeds received from the collection of principal repayment cannot be used for administrative expenses.

        (2) The amount removed from the HPRP revolving loan fund for administrative costs in any year must be reasonable, must not exceed the actual cost of operating the HPRP revolving loan fund, including loan servicing and providing technical assistance, and must not exceed the amount approved by the Agency in the intermediary's annual budget.

        (f)  The Agency may conduct loan monitoring reviews, including annual and periodic reviews, and performance monitoring.

        (1) At least annually, the intermediary must provide the Agency documents for reviewing the financial status of the intermediary, assessing the progress of using loan funds, and identifying any potential problems or concerns. Non-regulated intermediaries must furnish audited financial statements at least annually.

        (2) The intermediary must allow the Agency or its representative to review the operations and financial condition of the intermediary upon the Agency's request. The intermediary and its agents must provide access to all pertinent information to allow the Agency, or any party authorized by the Agency, to conduct such reviews. The intermediary must submit financial or other information within 14 calendar days upon receipt of the Agency's request, unless the data requested is not available within that time frame. Failure to supply the requested information to the satisfaction of the Agency will constitute non-monetary default. The Agency may conduct reviews, including on-site reviews, of the intermediary's operations and the operations of any agent of the intermediary, for the purpose of verifying compliance with Agency regulations and guidelines. These reviews may include, but are not limited to, audits of case files; interviews with owners, managers, and staff; audits of collateral; and inspections of the intermediary's and its agents underwriting, servicing, and liquidation guidelines.

        (g)  Each intermediary will be monitored by the Agency through annual monitoring reports submitted by the intermediary. Annual monitoring reports must include a description of the use of loan funds, information regarding the acreage, the number of heirs both before and after loan was made, audit findings, disbursement transactions, and any other information required by the Agency, as necessary.

        (h)  If any part of the HPRP loan has not been used in accordance with the intermediary's relending plan within 3 years from the date of the HPRP loan agreement, the Agency may cancel the approval of any funds not delivered to the intermediary. The Agency may also direct the intermediary to return any funds delivered to the intermediary that have not been used by that intermediary in accordance with the intermediary's relending plan. The Agency may, at its sole discretion, allow the intermediary additional time to use the HPRP loan funds.

#### § § 772.5

      (a)  Borrowers are responsible for maintaining the collateral that is serving as security for their Minor Program loan in accordance with their lien instruments, security agreement and promissory note.

      (b)  The Agency will inspect real estate that is security for a Minor Program loan at least once every 3 years, and chattel security at least annually. More frequent security inspections may be made as determined necessary by the Agency. Borrowers will allow representatives of the Agency, or any agency of the U.S. Government, in accordance with statutes and regulations, such access to the security property as the agency determines is necessary to document compliance with the requirements of this section.

      (c)  If the Agency determines that the borrower has failed to adequately maintain security, made unapproved dispositions of security, or otherwise has placed the repayment of the Minor Program loan in jeopardy, the Agency will:

      (1) For chattel security, service the account according to part 765 of this chapter. If any normal income security as defined in that subpart secures a Minor Program loan, the reporting, approval and release provisions in that subpart shall apply.

      (2) For real estate security for AMP loans, contact the Regional Office of General Counsel for advice on the appropriate servicing including liquidation if warranted.

      (3) For real estate security for IMP loans, service the account according to part 765 of this chapter.

      § 772.6   Subordination of security.

      (2) The borrower can document the ability to pay all debts including the new loan.

      (3) The action does not change the nature of the borrower's activities to the extent that they would no longer be eligible for a Minor Program loan.

      (5) The borrower is unable, as determined by the Agency, to refinance its loan and graduate in accordance with this subpart.

      (6) The loan funds will not be used in such a way that will contribute to erosion of highly erodible land or conversion of wetlands for the production of an agricultural commodity according to part 799 of this chapter.

      (7) The borrower has not been convicted of planting, cultivating, growing, producing, harvesting or storing a controlled substance under Federal or state law. “Borrower,” for purposes of this subparagraph, specifically includes an individual or entity borrower and any member of an entity borrower. “Controlled substance,” for the purpose of this subparagraph, is defined at 21 CFR part 1308. The borrower will be ineligible for a subordination for the crop year in which the conviction occurred and the four succeeding crop years. An applicant must attest on the Agency application form that it, and its members if an entity, have not been convicted of such a crime.

      (b)  To request a subordination, a Minor Program borrower must make the request in writing and provide the following:

      (1) The specific amount of debt for which a subordination is needed;

      (2) An appraisal prepared in accordance with § 761.7 of this chapter, if the request is for a subordination of more than $10,000, unless a sufficient appraisal report, as determined by the Agency, that is less than one year old, is on file with the Agency; and

      is a projection listing all anticipated cash inflows (including all farm income, nonfarm income and all loan advances) and all cash outflows (including all farm and nonfarm debt service and other expenses) to be incurred by the borrower during the period of the budget. A cash flow budget may be completed either for a 12 month period, a typical production cycle or the life of the loan, as appropriate.

      (a) The loan applicant must be an apple producer;

      (b) The loan applicant must be a citizen of the United States or an alien lawfully admitted to the United States for permanent residence under the Immigration and Nationalization Act. For a business entity applicant, the majority of the business entity must be owned by members meeting the citizenship test or, other entities that are domestically owned.

      § 773.19   Interest rate, terms, security requirements, and repayment.

#### § § 773.19

      (a)  The interest rate will be fixed for the term of the loan. The rate will be established by the Agency and available in each Agency Office, based upon the cost of Government borrowing for loans of similar maturities.

      (b)  The loan term will be for up to 3 years, based upon the useful life of the security offered.

      (c)  The Agency will take a lien on the following security, if available, as necessary to adequately secure the loan:

      (1) Real estate;

      (2) Chattels;

      (3) Crops;

      (4) Other assets owned by the applicant; and

      (5) Assets owned and pledged by a third party.

      (d)  (1) For loans that are for $30,000 or less, collateral value will be based on the best available, verifiable information.

      (2) For loans of greater than $30,000 where the applicant's balance sheet shows a net worth of three times the loan amount or greater, collateral value will be based on tax assessment of real estate and depreciation schedules of chattels, as applicable, less any existing liens.

      (3) For loans of greater than $30,000 where the applicant's balance sheet shows a net worth of less than three times the loan amount, collateral value will be based on an appraisal. Such appraisals must be obtained by the applicant, at the applicant's expense and acceptable to the Agency. Appraisals of real estate must be completed in accordance with USPAP.

      (e)  (1) All loan applicants must demonstrate that the loan can be repaid.

      (2) For loans that are for $30,000 or less where the applicant's balance sheet shows a net worth of three times the loan amount or greater, repayment ability will be considered adequate without further documentation.

      (3) For loans that are for $30,000 or less where the applicant's balance sheet shows a net worth of less than three times the loan amount, repayment ability must be demonstrated using the farm's operating plan, including a projected cash flow budget based on historical performance.

      (f)  All loan applicants must have an acceptable credit history demonstrated by debt repayment. A history of failure to repay past debts as they came due (including debts to the Internal Revenue Service) when the ability to repay was within their control will demonstrate unacceptable credit history. Unacceptable credit history will not include isolated instances of late payments which do not represent a pattern and were clearly beyond the applicant's control or lack of credit history.

#### § § 773.20

      § 781.5   Penalty review procedure.

#### § § 781.5

      (a) Whenever it appears that a foreign person has violated the reporting obligation as described in paragraph (a) of § 781.4, a written notice of apparent liability will be sent to the foreign person's last known address by the Farm Service Agency. This notice will set forth the facts which indicate apparent liability, identify the type of violation listed in paragraph (a) of § 781.4 which is involved, state the amount of the penalty to be imposed, include a statement of fair market value of the foreign person's interest in the subject land, and summarize the courses of action available to the foreign person.

      (b) The foreign person involved shall respond to a notice of apparent liability within 60 days after the notice is mailed. If a foreign person fails to respond to the notice of apparent liability, the proposed penalty shall become final. Any of the following actions by the foreign person shall constitute a response meeting the requirements of this paragraph.

      (1) Payment of the proposed penalty in the amount specified in the notice of apparent liability and filing of a report, if required, in compliance with § 781.3. The amount shall be paid by check or money order drawn to the Treasurer of the United States and shall be mailed to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, P.O. Box 2415, Washington, DC 20013. The Department is not responsible for the loss of currency sent through the mails.

      (2) Submission of a written statement denying liability for the penalty in whole or in part. Allegations made in any such statement must be supported by detailed factual data. The statement should be mailed to the Administrator, Farm Service Agency, U.S. Department of Agriculture, P.O. Box 2415, Washington, DC 20013.

      (3) A request for a hearing on the proposed penalty may be filed in accordance with part 780 of this title.

      (c) After a final decision is issued pursuant to an appeal under part 780 of this title, the Administrator or Administrator's designee shall mail the foreign person a notice of the determination on appeal, stating whether a report must be filed or amended in compliance with § 781.3, the amount of the penalty (if any), and the date by which it must be paid. The foreign person shall file or amend the report as required by the Administrator. The penalty in the amount stated shall be paid by check or money order drawn to the Treasurer of the United States and shall be mailed to the United States Department of Agriculture, P.O. Box 2415, Washington, DC 20013. The Department is not responsible for the loss of currency sent through the mails.

      (d) If the foreign person contests the notice of apparent liability by submitting a written statement or a request for a hearing thereon, the foreign person may elect either to pay the penalty or decline to pay the penalty pending resolution of the matter by the Administrator. If the Administrator determines that the foreign person is not liable for the penalty or is liable for less than the amount paid, the payment will be wholly or proportionally refunded. If the Administrator ultimately determines that the foreign person is liable, the penalty finally imposed shall not exceed the amount imposed in the notice of apparent liability.

      (e) If a foreign person fails to respond to the notice of apparent liability as required by paragraph (b) of this section, or fails to pay the penalty imposed by the Administrator under paragraph (d) of this section, the case will, without further notice, be referred by the Department to the Department of Justice for prosecution in the appropriate District Court to recover the amount of the penalty.

      (f) Any amounts approved by the U.S. Department of Agriculture for disbursement to a foreign person under the programs administered by the Department may be setoff against penalties assessed hereunder against such person, in accordance with the provisions of 7 CFR part 13.

      (b) For the ewe lamb to be eligible, a sheep and lamb operation must certify that the ewe lamb:

      (1) During at least part of the base period was a ewe lamb which was both, at the same time, not older than 18 months of age and had not produced an offspring; and

      (a)  A grant award shall not exceed 70 percent of the budgeted allowable costs of operation and administration of the State's Certified Mediation Program. In no case will the sum granted to a State exceed $500,000 per fiscal year.

      (b)  FSA will consider the following in determining the grant award to a qualifying State:

      (1) Demand for and use of mediation services (historical and projected);

The initial payment to a Certified Mediation Program in a qualifying State eligible for grant funding as of the beginning of a fiscal year will represent at least one-fourth of the State's annual grant award. The initial payment will be made as soon as practicable after certification, or re-certification, after grant funds are appropriated and available.

      (2) Payment of grant funds will be by electronic funds transfer to the designated account of each State's Certified Mediation Program, as approved by FSA.

      (d)  After funds are appropriated, FSA will set aside 5 percent of the annual appropriation for use as an administrative reserve.

      (1) Subject to paragraph (a) of this section and the availability of funds, the Administrator will allocate and disburse sums from the administrative reserve in the following priority order:

      (i) Disbursements to cover additional, unbudgeted demands for mediation services in qualifying States eligible for grant funding as of the beginning of the fiscal year;

      (iii) Any balance remaining in the administrative reserve will be allocated pro rata to Certified Mediation Program based on their initial fiscal year grant awards.

      (2) All funds from the administrative reserve will be made available on or before March 31 of the fiscal year.

      (e)  (1) States receiving Certified Mediation Program grant funds are encouraged to obligate award funds within the Federal fiscal year of the award. A State may, however, carry forward any funds disbursed to its Certified Mediation Program that remain unobligated at the end of the fiscal year of award for use in the next fiscal year for costs resulting from obligations in the subsequent funding period. Any carryover balances plus any additional obligated fiscal year grant will not exceed the lesser of 70 percent of the State's budgeted allowable costs of operation and administration of the State's Certified Mediation Program for the subsequent fiscal year, or $500,000.

      (2) Grant funds not spent in accordance with this part will be subject to de-obligation and must be returned to the USDA.

#### § § 786.100

      (a) Subject to the availability of funds, this part specifies the terms and conditions applicable to the Dairy Disaster Assistance Payment Program (DDAP-III) authorized by section 9007 of Public Law 110-28 (extended by Pub. L. 110-161). Benefits are available to eligible United States producers who have suffered dairy production losses in eligible counties as a result of a natural disaster declared during the period between January 1, 2005, and December 31, 2007, (that is, after January 1, 2005, and before December 31, 2007).

      (b) To be eligible for this program, a producer must have been a milk producer anytime during the period of January 2, 2005, through December 30, 2007, in a county declared a natural disaster by the Secretary of Agriculture, declared a major disaster or emergency designated by the President of the United States. For a county for which there was a timely Presidential declaration, but the declaration did not cover the loss, the county may still be eligible if the county is one for which an appropriate determination of a Farm Service Agency (FSA) Administrator's Physical Loss Notice applies. Counties contiguous to a county that is directly eligible by way of a natural disaster declaration are also eligible. Only losses occurring in eligible counties are eligible for payment in this program.

      (c) Subject to the availability of funds, FSA will provide benefits to eligible dairy producers. Additional terms and conditions may be specified in the payment application that must be completed and submitted by producers to receive a disaster assistance payment for dairy production losses.

      (d) To be eligible for payments, producers must meet the provisions of, and their losses must meet the conditions of, this part and any other conditions imposed by FSA.

      § 786.101   Administration.

#### § § 786.101

      (c) The State committee will take any action required by the regulations of this part that has not been taken by the county committee. The State committee will also:

      (1) Correct, or require the county committee to correct, any action taken by such county committee that is not in accordance with the regulations of this part; and

      (2) Require a county committee to withhold taking any action that is not in accordance with the regulations of this part.

      (d) No provision of delegation in this part to a State or county committee will preclude the Administrator, FSA, or a designee, from determining any question arising under the program or from reversing or modifying any determination made by the State or county committee.

      (e) The Deputy Administrator, Farm Programs, FSA, may authorize State and county committees to waive or modify deadlines in cases where lateness or failure to meet such requirements do not adversely affect the operation of the DDAP-III and does not violate statutory limitations of the program.

      (f) Data furnished by the applicants is used to determine eligibility for program benefits. Although participation in DDAP-III is voluntary, program benefits will not be provided unless the producer furnishes all requested data.

      § 786.104   Eligibility.

#### § § 786.104

      (a) Producers in the United States will be eligible to receive dairy disaster benefits under this part only if they have suffered dairy production losses, previously uncompensated by disaster payments including any previous dairy disaster payment program, during the claim period applicable to a natural disaster declaration in a disaster county. To be eligible to receive payments under this part, producers in a dairy operation must:

      (1) Have produced and commercially marketed milk in the United States and commercially marketed the milk produced anytime during the period of January 2, 2005 through December 30, 2007;

      (2) Be a producer on a dairy farm operation physically located in an eligible county where dairy production losses were incurred as a result of a disaster for which an applicable natural disaster declaration was issued between January 1, 2005 and December 31, 2007, and limit their claims to losses that occurred in those counties, specific to conditions resulting from the declared disaster as described in the natural disaster declaration;

      (3) Provide adequate proof, to the satisfaction of the FSA county committee, of the average number of cows in the dairy herd and annual milk production commercially marketed by all persons in the eligible dairy operation during the years of the base period (2003 and 2004 calendar years) and applicable disaster year that corresponds with the issuance date of the applicable natural disaster declaration, or other period as determined by FSA, to determine the total pounds of eligible losses that will be used for payment; and

      (4) Apply for payments during the application period established by the Deputy Administrator.

      (b) Payments may be made for losses suffered by an otherwise eligible producer who is now deceased or is a dissolved entity if a representative who currently has authority to enter into a contract for the producer or the producer's estate signs the application for payment. Proof of authority to sign for the deceased producer's estate or a dissolved entity must be provided. If a producer is now a dissolved general partnership or joint venture, all members of the general partnership or joint venture at the time of dissolution or their duly-authorized representatives must sign the application for payment.

      (c) Producers associated with a dairy operation must submit a timely application and satisfy the terms and conditions of this part, instructions issued by FSA, and instructions contained in the application to be eligible for benefits under this part.

      (d) As a condition to receive benefits under this part, a producer must have been in compliance with the Highly Erodible Land Conservation and Wetland Conservation provisions of 7 CFR part 12 for the calendar year applicable to the natural disaster declaration and loss claim period, and must not otherwise be barred from receiving benefits under 7 CFR part 12 or any other law or regulation.

      (e) Payments are limited to losses in eligible counties, in eligible disaster years.

      (f) All payments under this part are subject to the availability of funds.

      (g) Eligible losses are determined from the applicable base annual production, as defined in § 786.102, that corresponds to the natural disaster declaration and must have occurred during that same period as follows:

      (1) For disaster declarations for disasters during a calendar year (2005, 2006, or 2007), the disaster claim period is the full calendar year and

      (2) For disaster declarations issued during one calendar year that ends in another calendar year, the producer will be eligible for both disaster years.

      (h) Deductions in eligibility will be made for any disaster payments previously received for the loss including any made under a previous dairy disaster assistance payment program for 2005.

      § 786.105   Proof of production.

#### § § 786.105

      (a) Evidence of production is required to establish the commercial marketing and production history of the dairy operation so that dairy production losses can be computed in accordance with § 786.106.

      (b) A dairy producer must, based on the instructions issued by the Deputy Administrator, provide adequate proof of the dairy operation's commercial production, including any dairy herd inventory records available for the operation, for the years of the base period (2003 and 2004 calendar years) and disaster claim period that corresponds with the issuance date of the applicable natural disaster declaration.

      (1) A producer must certify and provide such proof as requested that losses for which compensation is claimed were related to the disaster declaration issued and occurred in an eligible county during the eligible claim period.

      (2) A producer must certify to the average number of cows in the dairy herd during the base period and applicable disaster claim period when there is insufficient documentation available for verification.

      (3) Additional supporting documentation may be requested by FSA as necessary to verify production losses to the satisfaction of FSA.

      (c) Adequate proof of production history of the dairy operation under paragraph (b) of this section must be based on milk marketing statements obtained from the dairy operation's milk handler or marketing cooperative. Supporting documents may include, but are not limited to: Tank records, milk handler records, daily milk marketings, copies of any payments received from other sources for production losses, or any other documents available to confirm or adjust the production history losses incurred by the dairy operation. All information provided is subject to verification, spot check, and audit by FSA.

      (d) As specified in § 786.106, loss calculations will be based on comparing the expected base annual production consistent with this part and the actual production during the applicable disaster claim year. Such calculations are subject to adjustments as may be appropriate such as a correction for losses not due to the disaster. If adequate proof of normally marketed production and any other production for relevant periods is not presented to the satisfaction of FSA, the request for benefits will be rejected. Special adjustments for new producers may be made as determined necessary by the Administrator.

      § 786.106   Determination of losses incurred.

#### § § 786.106

      (a) Eligible payable losses are calculated on a dairy operation by dairy operation basis and are limited to those occurring during the applicable disaster claim period, as provided by § 786.104(g), that corresponds with the applicable natural disaster declaration. Specifically, dairy production losses incurred by producers under this part are determined on the established history of the dairy operation's average number of cows in the dairy herd and actual commercial production marketed during the base period and applicable disaster claim period that corresponds with the applicable natural disaster declaration, as provided by the dairy operation consistent with § 786.105. Except as otherwise provided in this part, the base annual production, as defined in § 786.102 and established in § 786.104(g) is determined for each applicable disaster year based on the average annual production per cow determined according to the following:

      (1) The average of annual marketed production during the base period calendar years of 2003 and 2004, divided by;

      (2) The average number of cows in the dairy operation's herd during the base period calendar years of 2003 and 2004.

      (b) If relevant information to calculate the average annual production per cow for one or both of the base period calendar years of 2003 and 2004, is not available, an alternative method of determining the average annual production per cow may be established by the FSA Administrator. For example, for new dairies not in operation during 2003 and 2004, information from three similar farms may be obtained by FSA to estimate base annual production.

      (c) The average annual production per cow, as determined according to paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section, is multiplied by the average number of cows in the dairy operation's herd during the applicable disaster year (excluding cow losses resulting from the disaster occurrence), to determine base annual production for the dairy operation for each applicable disaster claim period year.

      (d) The eligible dairy production losses for a dairy operation for each of the authorized disaster claim period years will be:

      (1) The relevant period's base annual production for the dairy operation calculated under paragraph (c) of this section less,

      (2) For each such disaster claim period for each dairy operation the actual commercially-marketed production relevant to that period.

      (e) Spoiled or dumped milk, disposed of for reasons unrelated to the disaster occurrence, must be counted as production for the relevant disaster claim period. Actual production losses may be adjusted to the extent the reduction in production is not certified by the producer to be the result of the disaster identified in the natural disaster declaration or is determined by FSA not to be related to the natural disaster identified in the natural disaster declaration. FSA county committees will determine production losses that are not caused by the disaster associated with the natural disaster declaration. The calculated production loss determined in § 786.106(d) will be adjusted to account for pounds of production losses determined by the FSA county committee to not have been associated with the declared natural disaster for an eligible disaster county. The FSA county committee may convert cow numbers to actual pounds of production used in the adjustment, by multiplying the average annual production per cow determined from base period information, by the applicable number of cows determined to be ineligible to generate claims for benefits. Other appropriate adjustments will be made on such basis as the Deputy Administrator finds to be consistent with the objectives of the program.

      (f) Actual production, as adjusted, that exceeds the base annual production will mean that the dairy operation incurred no eligible production losses for the corresponding claim period as a result of the natural disaster.

      (g) Eligible production losses as otherwise determined under paragraphs (a) through (f) of this section for each authorized year of the program are added together to determine total eligible losses incurred by the dairy operation under DDAP-III subject to all other eligibility requirements as may be included in this part or elsewhere, including the deduction for previous payments including those made under a previous DDAP program.

      (h) Payment on eligible dairy operation losses will be calculated using whole pounds of milk. No double counting is permitted, and only one payment will be made for each pound of milk calculated as an eligible loss after the distribution of the dairy operation's eligible production loss among the producers of the dairy operation according to § 786.107(b). Payments under this part will not be affected by any payments for dumped or spoiled milk that the dairy operation may have received from its milk handler, marketing cooperative, or any other private party; however, produced milk that was dumped or spoiled for reasons unrelated to the disaster occurrence will still count as production.

      § 786.107   Rate of payment and limitations on funding.

#### § § 786.107

      (a) Subject to the availability of funds, the payment rate for eligible production losses determined according to § 786.106 is, depending on the State, the annual average Mailbox milk price for the Marketing Order, applicable to the State where the eligible disaster county is located, as reported by the Agricultural Marketing Service during the relevant period. States not regulated under a Marketing Order will be assigned a payment rate based on contiguous or nearby State's Mailbox milk price. Maximum per pound payment rates for eligible losses for dairy operations located in specific states during the relevant period are as follows:

      (b) Subject to the availability of funds, each eligible dairy operation's payment is calculated by multiplying the applicable payment rate under paragraph (a) of this section by the operation's total eligible losses as adjusted pursuant to this part. Where there are multiple producers in the dairy operation, individual producers' payments are disbursed according to each producer's share of the dairy operation's production as specified in the application.

      (c) If the total value of losses claimed nationwide under paragraph (b) of this section exceeds the $16 million available for the DDAP-III, less any reserve that may be created under paragraph (e) of this section, total eligible losses of individual dairy operations that, as calculated as an overall percentage for each full disaster claim period applicable to the disaster declaration, are greater than 20 percent of the total base annual production will be paid at the maximum rate under paragraph (a) of this section to the extent available funding allows. A loss of over 20 percent in only one or two months during the applicable disaster claim period does not of itself qualify for the maximum per-pound payment. Rather, the priority level must be reached as an average over the whole disaster claim period for the relevant calendar year. Total eligible losses for a producer, as calculated under § 786.106, of less than or equal to 20 percent during the eligible claim period will then be paid at a rate, not to exceed the rate allowed in paragraph (a) of this section, determined by dividing the eligible losses of less than 20 percent by the funds remaining after making payments for all eligible losses above the 20-percent threshold.

      (d) In no event will the payment exceed the value determined by multiplying the producer's total eligible loss times the average price received for commercial milk production in the producer's area as defined in paragraph (a) of this section.

      (e) No participant will receive disaster benefits under this part that in combination with the value of production not lost would result in an amount that exceeds 95 percent of the value of the expected production for the relevant period as estimated by the Secretary. Unless otherwise program funds would not be fully expended, the sum of the value of the production not lost, if any; and the disaster payment received under this part, cannot exceed 95 percent of what the production's value would have been if there had been no loss. In no case, however, may the value of production and the payment exceed the value the milk would have without the loss.

      (f) A reserve may be created to handle pending or disputed claims, but claims will not be payable once the available funding is expended.

      § 786.108   Availability of funds.

#### § § 786.108

      The total available program funds are $16 million as provided by section 9007 of Title IX of Public Law 110-28.

      § 786.109   Appeals.

#### § § 786.109

      Provisions of the appeal regulations set forth at 7 CFR parts 11 and 780 apply to this part. Appeals of determinations of ineligibility or payment amounts are subject to the limitations in §§ 786.107 and 786.108 and other limitations that may apply.

      § 786.110   Misrepresentation, scheme, or device.

#### § § 786.110

      (a) In addition to other penalties, sanctions, or remedies that may apply, a dairy producer is ineligible to receive assistance under this program if the producer is determined by FSA to have:

      (1) Adopted any scheme or device that tends to defeat the purpose of this program,

      (2) Made any fraudulent representation,

      (3) Misrepresented any fact affecting a program determination, or

      (4) Violated 7 CFR 795.17 and thus be ineligible for the year(s) of violation and the subsequent year.

      (b) Any funds disbursed pursuant to this part to any person or dairy operation engaged in a misrepresentation, scheme, or device, must be refunded with interest together with such other sums as may become due. Interest will run from the date of the disbursement to the producer or other recipient of the payment from FSA. Any person or dairy operation engaged in acts prohibited by this section and any person or dairy operation receiving payment under this part is jointly and severally liable with other persons or dairy operations involved in such claim for benefits for any refund due under this section and for related charges. The remedies provided in this part are in addition to other civil, criminal, or administrative remedies that may apply.

      § 786.111   Death, incompetence, or disappearance.

#### § § 786.111

      In the case of death, incompetency, disappearance, or dissolution of an individual or entity that is eligible to receive benefits in accordance with this part, such alternate person or persons specified in 7 CFR part 707 may receive such benefits, as determined appropriate by FSA.

      § 786.112   Maintaining records.

#### § § 786.112

      Persons applying for benefits under this program must maintain records and accounts to document all eligibility requirements specified herein and must keep such records and accounts for 3 years after the date of payment to their dairy operations under this program. Destruction of the records after such date is at the risk of the party required, by this part, to keep the records.

      § 786.113   Refunds; joint and several liability.

#### § § 786.113

      (a) Excess payments, payments provided as the result of erroneous information provided by any person, or payments resulting from a failure to meet any requirement or condition for payment under the application or this part, must be refunded to FSA.

      (b) A refund required under this section is due with interest determined in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section and late payment charges as provided in 7 CFR part 792. Notwithstanding any other regulation, interest will be due from the date of the disbursement to the producer or other recipient of the funds.

      (c) Persons signing a dairy operation's application as having an interest in the operation will be jointly and severally liable for any refund and related charges found to be due under this section.

      (d) In the event FSA determines a participant owes a refund under this part, FSA will charge program interest from the date of disbursement of the erroneous payment. Such interest will accrue at the rate that the United States Department of the Treasury charges FSA for funds plus additional charges as deemed appropriate by the Administrator or provided for by regulation or statute.

      (e) The debt collection provisions of part 792 of this chapter applies to this part except as is otherwise provided in this part.

      § 786.114   Miscellaneous provisions.

#### § § 786.114

      (a) Payments or any portion thereof due under this part must be made without regard to questions of title under State law and without regard to any claim or lien against the livestock, or proceeds thereof, in favor of the owner or any other creditor except agencies and instrumentalities of the U.S. Government.

      (b) Any producer entitled to any payment under this part may assign any payments in accordance with the provisions of 7 CFR part 1404.

      § 786.115   Termination of program.

(The guidance and procedures in this part are consistent with the guidance and procedures provided in other regulations issued under Executive Order 13603. Guidance and procedures for use of the Defense Production Act priorities and allocations authority with respect to other types of resources are as follows: For all forms of energy, refer to the Department of Energy's Energy Priorities and Allocations System (EPAS) regulation in 10 CFR part 217; for all forms of civil transportation, refer to the Department of Transportation's Transportation Priorities and Allocations System (TPAS) regulation in 49 CFR part 33; for water resources, refer to the Department of Defense; for health resources, refer to the Department of Health and Human Services' Health Resources Priorities and Allocations System in 45 CFR part 101; and for all other materials, services, and facilities, including construction materials, refer to the Department of Commerce's Defense Priorities and Allocations System (DPAS) regulation in 15 CFR part 700.)

        § 789.2   Priorities and allocations authority.

#### § § 789.2

        (a) Section 201 of Executive Order 13603 (3 CFR, 2012 Comp., p. 225) delegates the President's authority under section 101 of the Defense Production Act to require acceptance and priority performance of contracts and orders (other than contracts of employment) to promote the national defense over performance of any other contracts or orders, and to allocate materials, services, and facilities as deemed necessary or appropriate to promote the national defense to the following agencies. Essentially, this allows the following agencies to place priority on the performance of contracts for items and materials under their jurisdiction as required for national defense initiatives including emergency preparedness activities:

        (1) The Secretary of Agriculture with respect to food resources, food resource facilities, livestock resources, veterinary resources, plant health resources, and the domestic distribution of farm equipment and commercial fertilizer;

        (2) The Secretary of Energy with respect to all forms of energy;

        (3) The Secretary of Health and Human Services with respect to health resources;

        (4) The Secretary of Transportation with respect to all forms of civil transportation;

        (5) The Secretary of Defense with respect to water resources; and

        (6) The Secretary of Commerce with respect to all other materials, services, and facilities, including construction materials.

        (b) Section 202 of Executive Order 13603 specifies that the priorities and allocations authority may be used only to support programs that have been determined in writing as necessary or appropriate to promote the national defense by:

        (1) The Secretary of Defense with respect to military production and construction, military assistance to foreign nations, military use of civil transportation, stockpiles managed by the Department of Defense, space, and directly related activities;

        (2) The Secretary of Energy with respect to energy production and construction, distribution and use, and directly related activities; or

        (3) The Secretary of Homeland Security with respect to all other national defense programs, including civil defense and continuity of Government.

        § 789.3   Program eligibility.

#### § § 789.3

        Certain programs that promote the national defense are eligible for priorities and allocations support. These include programs for military and energy production or construction, military or critical infrastructure assistance to any foreign nation, homeland security, stockpiling, space, and any directly related activity. Other eligible programs include emergency preparedness activities conducted pursuant to Title VI of the Stafford Act and critical infrastructure protection and restoration.

      Subpart C—Placement of Rated Orders

        § 789.10   Delegations of authority.

#### § § 789.10

        (a) [Reserved]

        (b) Within USDA, authority to administer APAS has been delegated to the Administrator, Farm Service Agency, through the Under Secretary for Farm and Foreign Agricultural Services. (See §§ 2.16(a)(6) and 2.42(a)(5) of this title.) The Farm Service Agency Administrator will coordinate APAS implementation and administration through the Director, USDA Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Coordination, as delegated by the Assistant Secretary for Administration. (See §§ 2.24(a)(8)(ii)(A) and 2.24(a)(8)(v); 2.95(b)(1)(i) and 2.95(b)(4) of this title.)

        § 789.11   Priority ratings.

#### § § 789.11

        (a)  Priority levels designate differences between orders based on national defense including emergency preparedness requirements.

        (1) There are two levels of priority established by APAS, identified by the rating symbols “DO” and “DX.”

        (2) All DO-rated orders have equal priority with each other and take precedence over unrated orders. All DX-rated orders have equal priority with each other and take precedence over DO-rated orders and unrated orders. (For resolution of conflicts among rated orders of equal priority, see § 789.14(c).)

        (3) In addition, a directive regarding priority treatment for a given item issued by the resource agency with priorities jurisdiction for that item takes precedence over any DX-rated order, DO-rated order, or unrated order, as stipulated in the directive. (For more information on directives, see § 789.42.)

        (b)  Program identification symbols indicate which approved program is being supported by a rated order. The list of currently approved programs and their identification symbols are listed in Schedule I. For example, P1 identifies a program involving food and food resources processing and storage. Program identification symbols, in themselves, do not connote any priority. Additional programs may be approved under the procedures of Executive Order 13603 at any time.

        (c)  A priority rating consists of the rating symbol DO or DX followed by the program identification symbol, such as P1 or P2. Thus, a contract for the supply of livestock feed will contain a DO-P1 or DX-P1 priority rating.

        § 789.12   Elements of a rated order.

#### § § 789.12

        (a) Each rated order must include:

        (1) The appropriate priority rating (for example, DO-P1 for food and food resources processing and storage);

        (2) A required delivery date or dates. The words “immediately” or “as soon as possible” do not constitute a delivery date. Some purchase orders, such as a “requirements contract,” “basic ordering agreement,” “prime vendor contract,” or similar procurement document, bearing a priority rating may contain no specific delivery date or dates if it provides for the furnishing of items or services from time-to-time or within a stated period against specific purchase orders, such as calls, requisitions, and delivery orders. Specific purchase orders must specify a required delivery date or dates and are to be considered as rated as of the date of their receipt by the supplier and not as of the date of the original procurement document;

        (3) The written signature on a manually placed order, or the digital signature or name on an electronically placed order, of an individual authorized to sign rated orders for the person placing the order. The signature or use of the name certifies that the rated order is authorized under this part and that the requirements of this part are being followed; and

        (4) A statement as follows:

        (i) A statement that reads:

        (ii) If the rated order is placed in support of emergency preparedness requirements and expedited action is necessary and appropriate to meet these requirements, the following sentences should be added following the statement specified in paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section:

        (b) [Reserved]

        § 789.13   Acceptance and rejection of rated orders.

#### § § 789.13

        (a)  A person must accept a rated order in accordance with the following requirements:

        (1) Except as otherwise specified in this section, a person must accept every rated order received and must fill such orders regardless of any other rated or unrated orders that have been accepted.

        (2) A person must not discriminate against rated orders in any manner such as by charging higher prices or by imposing different terms and conditions than for comparable unrated orders.

        (b)  Unless otherwise directed by USDA for a rated order involving food resources, food resource facilities, livestock resources, veterinary resources, plant health resources, or the domestic distribution of farm equipment and commercial fertilizer:

        (1) A person must not accept a rated order for delivery on a specific date if unable to fill the order by that date. However, the person must inform the customer of the earliest date on which delivery can be made and offer to accept the order on the basis of that date. Scheduling conflicts with previously accepted lower rated or unrated orders are not sufficient reason for rejection in this section.

        (2) A person must not accept a DO-rated order for delivery on a date that would interfere with delivery of any previously accepted DO- or DX-rated orders. However, the person must offer to accept the order based on the earliest delivery date otherwise possible.

        (3) A person must not accept a DX-rated order for delivery on a date that would interfere with delivery of any previously accepted DX-rated orders, but must offer to accept the order based on the earliest delivery date otherwise possible.

        (4) If a person is unable to fill all of the rated orders of equal priority status received on the same day, the person must accept, based upon the earliest delivery dates, only those orders that can be filled, and reject the other orders. For example, a person must accept order A requiring delivery on December 15 before accepting order B requiring delivery on December 31. However, the person must offer to accept the rejected orders based on the earliest delivery dates otherwise possible.

        (5) A person must reject the rated order if the person is prohibited by Federal law from meeting the terms of the order.

        (c)  Unless otherwise directed by USDA for a rated order involving food resources, food resource facilities, livestock resources, veterinary resources, plant health resources, or the domestic distribution of farm equipment and commercial fertilizer, rated orders may be rejected in any of the following cases as long as a supplier does not discriminate among customers:

        (1) If the person placing the order is unwilling or unable to meet regularly established terms of sale or payment;

        (2) If the order is for an item not supplied or for a service not capable of being performed;

        (3) If the order is for an item or service produced, acquired, or provided only for the supplier's own use for which no orders have been filled for 2 years prior to the date of receipt of the rated order. If, however, a supplier has sold some of these items or provided similar services, the supplier is obligated to accept rated orders up to that quantity or portion of production or service, whichever is greater, sold or provided within the past 2 years;

        (4) If the person placing the rated order, other than the Federal Government, makes the item or performs the service being ordered;

        (5) If acceptance of a rated order or performance against a rated order would violate any other regulation, official action, or order of USDA, issued under the authority of the Defense Production Act or another relevant law.

        (d)  A person in receipt of a rated order is required to provide to the customer placing the order written or electronic notification of acceptance or rejection of the order.

        (1) Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, a person must accept or reject a rated order in writing or electronically within fifteen (15) working days after receipt of a DO-rated order and within ten (10) working days after receipt of a DX-rated order. If the order is rejected, the person must give reasons in writing or electronically for the rejection.

        (2) If a person has accepted a rated order and subsequently finds that shipment or performance will be delayed, the person must notify the customer immediately, give the reasons for the delay, and advise of a new shipment or performance date. If notification is given verbally, written or electronic confirmation must be provided within 5 working days.

        (e)  If the rated order is placed for the purpose of emergency preparedness and includes the additional statement as specified in § 789.12(a)(4)(ii), a person must accept or reject a rated order and send the acceptance or rejection in writing or in an electronic format:

        (1) Within 6 hours after receipt of the order if the order is issued in response to a hazard that has occurred; or

        (2) Within the greater of 12 hours or the time specified in the order, if the order is issued to prepare for an imminent hazard.

        § 789.14   Preferential scheduling.

#### § § 789.14

        (a) A person must schedule operations, including the acquisition of all needed production items or services, in a timely manner to satisfy the delivery requirements of each rated order. Modifying production or delivery schedules is necessary only when required delivery dates for rated orders cannot otherwise be met.

        (b) DO-rated orders must be given production preference over unrated orders, if necessary to meet required delivery dates, even if this requires the diversion of items being processed or ready for delivery or services being performed against unrated orders. Similarly, DX-rated orders must be given preference over DO-rated orders and unrated orders. (Examples: If a person receives a DO-rated order with a delivery date of June 3 and if meeting that date would mean delaying production or delivery of an item for an unrated order, the unrated order must be delayed. If a DX-rated order is received calling for delivery on July 15 and a person has a DO-rated order requiring delivery on June 2 and operations can be scheduled to meet both deliveries, there is no need to alter production schedules to give any additional preference to the DX-rated order.)

        (c) For conflicting rated orders:

        (1) If a person finds that delivery or performance against any accepted rated orders conflicts with the delivery or performance against other accepted rated orders of equal priority status, the person must give precedence to the conflicting orders in the sequence in which they are to be delivered or performed (not to the receipt dates). If the conflicting orders are scheduled to be delivered or performed on the same day, the person must give precedence to those orders that have the earliest receipt dates.

        (2) If a person is unable to resolve rated order delivery or performance conflicts as specified in this section, the person should promptly seek special priorities assistance as provided in §§ 789.20 through 789.24. If the person's customer objects to the rescheduling of delivery or performance of a rated order, the customer should promptly seek special priorities assistance as specified in §§ 789.20 through 789.24. For any rated order against which delivery or performance will be delayed, the person must notify the customer as provided in § 789.13(d)(2).

        (d) If a person is unable to purchase needed production items in time to fill a rated order by its required delivery date, the person must fill the rated order by using inventoried production items. A person who uses inventoried items to fill a rated order may replace those items with the use of a rated order as provided in § 789.17(b).

        § 789.15   Extension of priority ratings.

#### § § 789.15

        (a) A person must use rated orders as necessary with suppliers to obtain items or services needed to fill a rated order. The person must use the priority rating indicated on the customer's rated order, except as otherwise provided in this part or as directed by USDA.

        (b) The priority rating must be included as necessary on each successive order placed to obtain items or services needed to fill a customer's rated order. This continues from contractor to subcontractor to supplier throughout the entire procurement chain.

        § 789.16   Changes or cancellations of priority ratings and rated orders.

#### § § 789.16

        (a) The priority rating on a rated order may be changed or canceled by:

        (1) An official action of USDA; or

        (2) Written notification from the person who placed the rated order.

        (b) If an unrated order is amended so as to make it a rated order, or a DO rating is changed to a DX rating, the supplier must give the appropriate preferential treatment to the order as of the date the change is received by the supplier.

        (c) An amendment to a rated order that significantly alters a supplier's original production or delivery schedule constitutes a new rated order as of the date of its receipt. The supplier must accept or reject the amended order according to the provisions of § 789.13.

        (d) The following amendments do not constitute a new rated order:

        (1) A change in shipping destination;

        (2) A reduction in the total amount of the order;

        (3) An increase in the total amount of the order that has a negligible impact upon deliveries;

        (4) A minor variation in size or design; or

        (5) A change that is agreed upon between the supplier and the customer.

        (e) If a person no longer needs items or services to fill a rated order, any rated orders placed with suppliers for the items or services, or the priority rating on those orders, must be canceled.

        (f) When a priority rating is added to an unrated order, or is changed or canceled, all suppliers must be promptly notified in writing.

        § 789.17   Use of rated orders.

#### § § 789.17

        (a) A person must use rated orders as necessary to obtain:

        (1) Items that will be physically incorporated into other items to fill rated orders, including that portion of such items normally consumed or converted into scrap or by-products in the course of processing;

        (2) Containers or other packaging materials required to make delivery of the finished items against rated orders;

        (3) Services, other than contracts of employment, needed to fill rated orders; and

        (4) MRO needed to produce the finished items to fill rated orders.

        (b) A person may use a rated order to replace inventoried items (including finished items) if such items were used to fill rated orders, as follows:

        (1) The order must be placed within 90 days of the date of use of the inventory.

        (2) A DO rating and the program identification symbol indicated on the customer's rated order must be used on the order. A DX rating must not be used even if the inventory was used to fill a DX-rated order.

        (3) If the priority ratings on rated orders from one customer or several customers contain different program identification symbols, the rated orders may be combined. In this case, the program identification symbol P4 must be used (that is DO-P4).

        (c) A person may combine DX- and DO-rated orders from one customer or several customers if the items or services covered by each level of priority are identified separately and clearly. If different program identification symbols are indicated on those rated orders of equal priority, the person must use the program identification symbol P4 (that is DO-P4 or DX-P4).

        (d) For combining rated and unrated orders:

        (1) A person may combine rated and unrated order quantities on one purchase order provided that:

        (i) The rated quantities are separately and clearly identified; and

        (ii) The four elements of a rated order, as required by § 789.12, are included on the order with the statement required in § 789.12(a)(4)(i) modified to read:

        (2) A supplier must accept or reject the rated portion of the purchase order as provided in § 789.13 and give preferential treatment only to the rated quantities as required by this part. This part must not be used to require preferential treatment for the unrated portion of the order.

        (3) Any supplier who believes that rated and unrated orders are being combined in a manner contrary to the intent of this part or in a fashion that causes undue or exceptional hardship may submit a request for adjustment or exception as specified in § 789.60.

        (e) A person may place a rated order for the minimum commercially procurable quantity even if the quantity needed to fill a rated order is less than that minimum. However, a person must combine rated orders as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, if possible, to obtain minimum procurable quantities.

        (f) A person is not required to place a priority rating on an order for less than $75,000 or one-half of the Simplified Acquisition Threshold (as established in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) (see 48 CFR 2.101) or in other authorized acquisition regulatory or management systems) whichever amount is greater, provided that delivery can be obtained in a timely fashion without the use of the priority rating.

        § 789.18   Limitations on placing rated orders.

#### § § 789.18

        (a)  Rated orders may be placed only by persons with the proper authority for items and services that are needed to support approved programs.

        (1) A person must not place a DO- or DX-rated order unless authorized by USDA to do so under this part.

        (2) Rated orders must not be used to obtain:

        (i) Delivery on a date earlier than needed;

        (ii) A greater quantity of the item or services than needed, except to obtain a minimum procurable quantity. Separate rated orders must not be placed solely for the purpose of obtaining minimum procurable quantities on each order;

        (iv) Items that are not needed to fill a rated order, except as specifically authorized by USDA or as otherwise permitted by this part;

        (v) Any of the following items unless specific priority rating authority has been obtained from USDA or the Department of Commerce, as appropriate:

        (A) Items for plant improvement, expansion, or construction, unless they will be physically incorporated into a construction project covered by a rated order; and

        (B) Production or construction equipment or items to be used for the manufacture of production equipment. For information on requesting priority rating authority, see § 789.21; or

        (ii) Health resources (Resource agency with jurisdiction—Department of Health and Human Services);

        (iii) All forms of civil transportation (Resource agency with jurisdiction—Department of Transportation);

        (iv) Water resources (Resource agency with jurisdiction—Department of Defense, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers);

        (v) All materials, services, and facilities, including construction materials for which the authority has not been delegated to other agencies under Executive Order 13603 (Resource agency with jurisdiction—Department of Commerce); and

        (2) The priorities and allocations authority in this part may not be applied to communications services subject to Executive Order 13618 of July 6, 2012 (3 CFR, 2012 Comp., p. 273).

      Subpart D—Special Priorities Assistance

        § 789.20   General provisions.

#### § § 789.20

        (a) APAS is designed to be largely self-executing. However, if production or delivery problems arise, a person should immediately contact the Farm Service Agency Administrator for special priorities assistance pursuant to §§ 789.20 through 789.24 and as directed by § 789.73. If the Farm Service Agency is unable to resolve the problem or to authorize the use of a priority rating and believes additional assistance is warranted, USDA may forward the request to another resource agency, as appropriate, for action. Special priorities assistance is a service provided to alleviate problems.

        (b) Special priorities assistance is available for any reason consistent with this part. Generally, special priorities assistance is provided to expedite deliveries, resolve delivery conflicts, place rated orders, locate suppliers, or verify information supplied by customers and vendors. Special priorities assistance may also be used to request rating authority for items that are not normally eligible for priority treatment.

        (c) A request for special priorities assistance or priority rating authority must be submitted on Form AD-2102 (OMB Control Number 0560-0280) to the Farm Service Agency as provided in paragraph (a) of this section. Form AD-2102 may be obtained from USDA by downloading the form and instructions from  or by contacting the Administrator of the Farm Service Agency as specified in § 789.73. Either mail or fax the form to USDA, using the address or fax number shown on the form.

        § 789.21   Requests for priority rating authority.

#### § § 789.21

        (a)  If a rated order is likely to be delayed because a person is unable to obtain items or services not normally rated under this part, the person may request the authority to use a priority rating in ordering the needed items or services.

        (b)  For a rated order for production or construction equipment not under the resource jurisdiction of USDA, follow the regulation in 15 CFR part 700.

        (1) A request for priority rating authority for production or construction equipment must be submitted to the U.S. Department of Commerce on Form BIS-999 (see 15 CFR 700.51). Form BIS-999 may be obtained from USDA as specified in § 789.20(c) or from the Department of Commerce as specified in 15 CFR 700.50.

        (2) When the use of a priority rating is authorized for the procurement of production or construction equipment, a rated order may be used either to purchase or to lease such equipment. However, in the latter case, the equipment may be leased only from a person engaged in the business of leasing such equipment or from a person willing to lease rather than sell.

        (c) For rating authority in advance of a rated prime contract:

        (1) In certain cases and upon specific request, USDA, in order to promote the national defense, may authorize a person to place a priority rating on an order to a supplier in advance of the issuance of a rated prime contract. In these instances, the person requesting advance rating authority must obtain sponsorship of the request from USDA. The person assumes any business risk associated with the placing of a rated order if the order has to be canceled in the event the rated prime contract is not issued.

        (2) The person must state the following in the request:

        (3) In reviewing requests for rating authority in advance of a rated prime contract, USDA will consider, among other things, the following criteria:

        (i) The probability that the prime contract will be awarded;

        (ii) The impact of the resulting rated orders on suppliers and on other authorized programs;

        (iii) Whether the contractor is the sole source;

        (iv) Whether the item being produced has a long lead time; and

        (v) The time period for which the rating is being requested.

        (4) USDA may require periodic reports on the use of the rating authority granted through paragraph (c) of this section.

        (5) If a rated prime contract is not issued, the person will promptly notify each supplier who has received any rated order related to the advanced rating authority that the priority rating on the order is canceled.

        § 789.22   Examples of assistance.

#### § § 789.22

        (a) While special priorities assistance may be provided for any reason in support of this part, it is usually provided in situations in which:

        (1) A person is experiencing difficulty in obtaining delivery against a rated order by the required delivery date; or

        (2) A person cannot locate a supplier for an item or service needed to fill a rated order.

        (b) Other examples of special priorities assistance include:

        (1) Ensuring that rated orders receive preferential treatment by suppliers;

        (2) The applicant has made a reasonable effort to resolve the problem.

        (b) [Reserved]

        § 789.24   Instances in which assistance must not be provided.

#### § § 789.24

        (a) Special priorities assistance is provided at the discretion of USDA when it is determined that such assistance is warranted to meet the objectives of this part. Examples in which assistance must not be provided include situations in which a person is attempting to:

        (1) Secure a price advantage;

        (2) Obtain delivery prior to the time required to fill a rated order;

        (3) Gain competitive advantage;

        (4) Disrupt an industry apportionment program in a manner designed to provide a person with an unwarranted share of scarce items; or

        (5) Overcome a supplier's regularly established terms of sale or conditions of doing business.

        (1) Only be used when there is insufficient supply of a material, service, or facility to satisfy national defense supply requirements through the use of the priorities authority or when the use of the priorities authority would cause a severe and prolonged disruption in the supply of materials, services, or facilities available to support normal U.S. economic activities; and

        (2) Not be used to ration materials or services at the retail level.

        (b) Allocations orders, when used, will be distributed equitably among the suppliers of the materials, services, or facilities being allocated and not require any person to relinquish a disproportionate share of the civilian market.

        § 789.31   General procedures.

#### § § 789.31

        (a) When USDA plans to execute its allocations authority to address a supply problem within its resource jurisdiction, USDA will develop a plan that includes the following information:

        (1) A copy of the written determination made in accordance with section 202 of Executive Order 13603, that the program or programs that would be supported by the allocations action are necessary or appropriate to promote the national defense;

        (2) A detailed description of the situation to include any unusual events or circumstances that have created the requirement for an allocations action;

        (3) A statement of the specific objective(s) of the allocations action;

        (4) A list of the materials, services, or facilities to be allocated;

        (5) A list of the sources of the materials, services, or facilities that will be subject to the allocations action;

        (a) No allocations by USDA may be used to control the general distribution of a material in the civilian market, unless the Secretary has:

        (1) Made a written finding that:

        (i) Such material is a scarce and critical material essential to the national defense; and

        (ii) The requirements of the national defense for such material cannot otherwise be met without creating a significant dislocation of the normal distribution of such material in the civilian market to such a degree as to create appreciable hardship;

        (2) Submitted the finding for the President's approval through the Assistant to the President and National Security Advisor and the Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism; and

        (3) The President has approved the finding.

An audit or investigation may also include interviews and a systems evaluation to detect problems or failures in the implementation of this part.

        (b) When undertaking an audit, investigation, or other inquiry, USDA will:

        (1)  Define the scope and purpose in the official action given to the person under investigation; and

        (2)  Have ascertained that the information sought or other adequate and authoritative data are not available from any Federal or other responsible agency.

        (d) The production of books, records, documents, other writings, and information will not be required at any place other than where they are usually kept if, prior to the return date specified in the administrative subpoena or demand for information, a duly authorized official of USDA is furnished with copies of such material that are certified under oath to be true copies. As an alternative, a person may enter into a stipulation with a duly authorized official of USDA as to the content of the material.

        (e) An administrative subpoena, demand for information, or inspection authorization will include the name, title, or official position of the person to be served, the evidence sought, and its general relevance to the scope and purpose of the audit, investigation, or other inquiry. If employees or agents are to be interviewed; if books, records, documents, other writings, or information are to be produced; or if property is to be inspected; the administrative subpoena, demand for information, or inspection authorization will describe the requirements.

        (f) Service of documents will be made in the following manner:

        With respect to the 1988 crop year, a husband and wife shall be considered to be one person except that such individuals who, prior to their marriage, were separately engaged in unrelated farming operations will be determined to be separate persons with respect to such farming operations so long as the operations remain separate and distinct from any farming operation conducted by the other spouse if such individuals have executed a Contract to Participate in the 1988 Price Support and Production Adjustment Programs by April 15, 1988. Such individuals must file a form FSA-561 with the county committee for each such farming operation by July 8, 1988, if they desire to be considered as separate persons under this section.

        (a) A minor child and his parents or guardian (or other person responsible for him) shall be considered as one person, except that the minor child may be considered as a separate person if such minor child is a producer on a farm in which the parents or guardian or other person responsible for him (including any entity in which the parents or guardian or other person responsible for him has a substantial interest, , more than a 20-percent interest) takes no part in the operation of the farm (including any activities as a custom farmer) and owns no interest in the farm or allotment or in any portion of the production on the farm, and if such minor child:

        (1) Is represented by a court-appointed guardian who is required by law to make a separate accounting for the minor and ownership of the farm is vested in the minor, or

        (2) Has established and maintains a different household from his parents or guardian and personally carries out the actual farming operations on the farm for which there is a separate accounting, or

        (b) A person shall be considered a minor until he reaches 18 years of age. Court proceedings conferring majority on a person under 18 years of age will not change such person's status as a minor for purposes of applying the regulations.

        § 795.13   Other cases.

#### § § 795.13

        Where the county committee is unable to determine whether certain individuals or legal entities involved in the production of a commodity are to be treated as one person or separate persons, all the facts regarding the arrangement under which the commodity is produced shall be submitted to the State committee for decision. Where the State committee is unable to determine whether such individuals or legal entities are to be treated as one person or separate persons, all the facts regarding the arrangement under which the farming operation is conducted shall be submitted to the Deputy Administrator for decision.

        § 795.14   Changes in farming operations.

#### § § 795.14

        (a) Subject to the provisions of this part, a person may exercise his or her right heretofore existing under law, to divide, sell, transfer, rent, or lease his or her property if such division, sale, transfer, rental arrangement, or lease is legally binding as between the parties thereto. However, any document representing a division, sale, transfer, rental arrangement, or lease which is fictitious or not legally binding as between the parties thereto shall be considered to be for the purpose of evading the payment limitation and shall be disregarded for the purpose of applying the payment limitation. Any change in farming operations that would otherwise serve to increase the number of persons for application of the payment limitation must be bona fide and substantive.

        (b) A substantive change includes, for example, a substantial increase or decrease in the size of the farm by purchase, sale, or lease; a substantial increase or decrease in the size of allotment by purchase, sale, or lease; a change from a cash lease to a share lease or vice versa; and dissolution of an entity such as a corporation or partnership.

In addition, the rental agreement must be customary and reasonable for the area.

#### § § 795.16

        (a) Custom farming is the performance of services on a farm such as land preparation, seeding, cultivating, applying pesticides, and harvesting for hire with remuneration on a unit of work basis, except that, for the purpose of applying the provisions of this section, the harvesting of crops and the application of agricultural chemicals by firms regularly engaged in such businesses shall not be regarded as custom farming. A person performing custom farming shall be considered as being separate from the person for whom the custom farming is performed only if:

        (1) The compensation for the custom farming is paid at a unit of work rate customary in the area and is in no way dependent upon the amount of the crop produced, and (2) the person performing the custom farming (and any other entity in which such person has more than a 20-percent interest) has no interest, directly or indirectly, (i) in the crop on the farm by taking any risk in the production of the crop, sharing in the proceeds of the crop, granting or guaranteeing the financing of the crop, (ii) in the allotment on the farm, or (iii) in the farm as landowner, landlord, mortgage holder, trustee, lienholder, guarantor, agent, manager, tenant, sharecropper, or any other similar capacity.

#### § § 795.17

        All or any part of the payments otherwise due a person under the upland cotton, wheat, feed grain and rice programs on all farms in which the person has an interest may be withheld or required to be refunded if the person adopts or participates in adopting any scheme or device designed to evade or which has the effect of evading the rules of this part. Such acts shall include, but are not limited to, concealing from the county committee any information having a bearing on the application of the rules of this part or submitting false information to the county committee (for example, a set-aside agreement which is entered into that differs from information furnished to the county committee concerning the manner in which program payments are actually shared, concerning the actual facts of a sale, or concerning the transfer of property) or creating fictitious entities for the purpose of concealing the interest of a person in a farming operation.

FSA maintains an index of FSA National Handbooks, CCC Board Dockets, decisions of the Board of Contract Appeals of the Department of Agriculture affecting FSA or CCC, and Marketing Quota Review Committee determinations. In view of the small number of public requests for such index, publication of the index is unnecessary and impractical.

Reasonable requests for material not in existence may also be honored where their compilation will not unduly interfere with FSA operations and programs. Each FSA office in the field and each FSA office and division in Washington (see statement of Organization and Functions of FSA, 40 FR 18815, and of CCC, 35 FR 14951, and any amendments thereto) is designated as an “information center” and shall make space available to inspect and copy records in their custody not exempted from disclosure. Copies of records shall also be made available upon request. The head of each office or division is authorized to receive requests for records and to make determinations regarding requests for records in the office's custody in accordance with 7 CFR 1.4(c). Requests to Washington divisions and offices shall be addressed to USDA, FSA, P.O. Box 2415, Washington, D.C. 20013. The heads of FSA field offices shall be addressed as listed in the local telephone directory under “U.S. Government, Department of Agriculture, FSA”. Names and addresses of heads of field offices may also be obtained from the office indicated in § 798.2.

      § 798.5   Appeals.

        (2) Ensure protection of basic resources, including important farmlands and forestlands, prime rangelands, wetlands, floodplains, and other protected resources. Consistent with Departmental Regulations and related Executive Orders, it is FSA policy not to approve or fund proposed actions that, as a result of their identifiable impacts, direct, indirect, or cumulative, would lead to or accommodate either the conversion of these land uses or encroachment upon them.

        (3) Ensure that the requirements of NEPA and other State and national environmental policies designed to protect and manage impacts on the human environment are addressed:

        (i) As required by 40 CFR 1501.2, at the earliest feasible stage in the planning of any FSA action,

        (ii) Concurrently and in a coordinated manner,

        (iii) During all stages of the decision making process,

        (iv) Using professional and scientific integrity in their discussions and analyses, identifying applicable methodologies, and explaining the use of the best available information, and

        (v) In consultation with all interested parties, including Federal, State, and Tribal governments;

        (4) As appropriate, make environmental review available to the public through various means, which can include, but are not limited to: Posting on the National FSA Web site or a State FSA Web site, publishing in the  or publishing in a newspaper in the area of interest; and

        (5) Ensure that, if an FSA proposed action represents one of several phases of a larger action, the entire action is the subject of an environmental review independent of the phases of funding. If the FSA proposed action is one segment of a larger action, the entire action will be used in determining the appropriate level of FSA environmental review.

        (b) A proposed action that consists of more than one categorically excluded proposed action may be categorically excluded only if all components of the proposed action are included within one or more categorical exclusions and trigger no extraordinary circumstances. The component of a proposed action that requires the highest level of NEPA review will be used to determine the required level of the NEPA review.

If FSA declines such a request to cooperate, that will be documented in writing to the requesting agency and a copy will be provided to CEQ.

        (b) FSA may request to be designated as a cooperating agency if another agency's proposed action falls within FSA's area of expertise.

        § 799.15   Public involvement in environmental review.

#### § § 799.15

        (a) FSA will involve the public in the environmental review process as early as possible and in a manner consistent with 40 CFR 1506.6. To determine the appropriate level of public participation, FSA will consider:

        (1) The scale of the proposed action and its probable effects;

        (2) The likely level of public interest and controversy; and

        (3) Advice received from knowledgeable parties and experts.

        (b) Depending upon the scale of the proposed action, FSA will:

        (1) Coordinate public notices and consultation with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, USDA's Natural Resources Conservation Service, Federal Emergency Management Agency, the National Marine Fisheries Service, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and other agencies, as appropriate, if wetlands, floodplains, ESA-listed species, or other protected resources have the potential to be impacted;

        (2) Make appropriate environmental documents available to interested partiesby request;

        (3) Publish a Notice of Intent (NOI) to prepare an EIS, as specified in subpart F of this part; and

        (4) Publish a Notice of Availability (NOA) of draft and final EISs and RODs, as specified in subpart F of this part.

        (c) If the effects of a proposed action are local in nature and the scale of the proposed action is likely to generate interest and controversy at the local level, then in addition to the proposed actions specified in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, FSA will:

        (1) Notify appropriate State, local, regional, and Tribal governments and clearinghouses, and parties and organizations, including the State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) and Tribal Historic Preservation Officer (THPO), known to have environmental, cultural, and economic interests in the locality affected by the proposed action; and

        (2) Publish notice of the proposed action in the local media.

        (d) Public review for 30 days for a FONSI is necessary if any of the limited circumstances specified in 40 CFR 1501.4(e)(2)(i) or (ii) applies.

        § 799.16   Scoping.

#### § § 799.16

        (a) FSA will determine the appropriate scoping process for the environmental review of a proposed action based on the nature, complexity, potential significance of effects, and level of controversy of the proposed action.

        (b) As part of its scoping process, FSA will:

        (1) Invite appropriate Federal, State, and Tribal governments, and other interested parties to participate in the process, if determined necessary by FSA;

        (2) Identify the significant issues to be analyzed;

        (3) Identify and eliminate from further review issues that were determined not significant or have been adequately addressed in any prior environmental reviews;

        (4) Determine the roles of lead and cooperating agencies, if appropriate;

        (5) Identify any related EAs or EISs;

        (6) Identify other environmental reviews and consultation requirements, including NHPA requirements and State, local, regional, and Tribal requirements, so they are integrated into the NEPA process;

        (7) Identify the relationship between the timing of the environmental review process and FSA's decision making process;

        (8) Determine points of contact within FSA; and

        (9) Establish time limits for the environmental review process.

        (c) FSA may hold public meetings as part of the scoping process, if appropriate and as time permits. The process that FSA will use to determine if a public scoping meeting is needed, and how such meetings will be announced, is specified in § 799.17.

        § 799.17   Public meetings.

#### § § 799.17

        (a) In consultation with the NECM, the SEC will determine if public meetings will be held on a proposed action to:

        (1) Inform the public about the details of a proposed action and its possible environmental effects;

        (2) Gather information about the public concerns; and

        (3) Resolve, address, or respond to issues raised by the public.

        (b) In determining whether to hold a public meeting, FSA will consider and determine whether:

        (1) There is substantial controversy concerning the environmental impact of the proposed action;

        (2) There is substantial interest in holding a public meeting;

        (3) Another Federal agency or Tribal government has requested a public scoping meeting and their request is warranted; or

        (4) The FSA Administrator has determined that a public meeting is needed.

        (c) FSA will publish notice of a public meeting, including the time, date and location of the meeting, in the local media or  as appropriate, at least 15 days before the first meeting. A notice of a public scoping meeting may be included in a Notice of Intent to prepare an EIS.

        (d) If a NEPA document is to be considered at a public meeting, FSA will make the appropriate documentation available to the public at least 15 days before the meeting.

        § 799.18   Overview of FSA NEPA process.

#### § § 799.18

      Subpart C—Environmental Screening Worksheet

        § 799.20   Purpose of the ESW.

#### § § 799.20

        (a) FSA uses the ESW as an initial screening tool to evaluate record the use of a categorical exclusion for a proposed action and to determine the required type of environmental review.

        (b) Review with the ESW is not required for proposed actions that are categorically excluded as specified in § 799.31(b) or § 1b.3 of this title, or for proposed actions where FSA determines at an early stage that there is a need to prepare an EA or EIS.

      Subpart D—Categorical Exclusions

        § 799.30   Purpose of categorical exclusion process.

#### § § 799.30

        (a) FSA has determined that the categories of proposed actions listed in §§ 799.31 and 799.32 do not normally individually or cumulatively have a significant effect on the human environment and do not threaten a violation of applicable statutory, regulatory, or permit requirements for environment, safety, and health, including requirements of Executive Orders and other USDA regulations in this chapter. Based on FSA's previous experience implementing these actions and similar actions through the completion of EAs, these proposed actions are categorically excluded.

        (b) If a proposed action falls within one of the categories of proposed actions listed in § 1b.3 of this title, § 799.31, or § 799.32, and there are no extraordinary circumstances present as specified in § 799.33, then the proposed action is categorically excluded from the requirements to prepare an EA or an EIS.

        (c) Those proposed actions in categories in § 799.31 or § 799.32 will be considered categorical exclusions unless it is determined there are extraordinary circumstances, as specified in § 799.33.

        § 799.31   Categorical exclusions to be recorded on an ESW.

#### § § 799.31

        (a) Proposed actions listed in this section involve no new ground disturbance below the existing plow zone (does not exceed the depth of previous tillage or disturbance) and therefore only need to be recorded on the ESW; no further review will be required. Unless otherwise noted, the proposed actions in this section also do not have the potential to cause effects to historic properties, and will therefore not be reviewed for compliance with section 106 of NHPA (54 U.S.C. 306108) or its implementing regulations, 36 CFR part 800. However, some proposed actions may require other Federal consultation to determine if there are extraordinary circumstances as specified in § 799.33.

        (b) The following proposed actions are categorically excluded. These proposed actions are grouped into broader categories of similar types of proposed actions. Those proposed actions that are similar in scope (purpose, intent, and breadth) and the potential significance of impacts to those listed in this section, but not specifically listed in § 799.31 or § 799.32, will be considered categorical exclusions in this category, unless it is determined that extraordinary circumstances exist, as specified in § 799.33:

        § 799.32   Categorical exclusions requiring review with an ESW.

#### § § 799.32

        (a) Proposed actions listed in this section may be categorically excluded after completion of a review with an ESW to document that a proposed action does not involve extraordinary circumstances as specified in § 799.33.

        (b) This section has two types of categorical exclusions, one without construction and ground disturbance and one with construction and ground disturbance that will require additional environmental review and consultation in most cases.

        (c) Consultations under NHPA, ESA, and other relevant environmental mandates, may be required to document that no extraordinary circumstances exist.

        (d) The following proposed actions are grouped into broader categories of similar types of proposed actions without ground disturbance. Those proposed actions that are similar in scope (purpose, intent, and breadth) and the potential significance of impacts to those listed in this section, but not specifically listed in this section, will be considered categorical exclusions in this category, unless it is determined that extraordinary circumstances exist, as specified in § 799.33:

        (1)  The following list includes categorical exclusions for proposed actions related to FSA loans:

        (i) Farm storage and drying facility loans for added capacity;

        (ii) Loans for livestock purchases;

        (iii) Release of loan security for forestry purposes;

        (iii) Grazing land mechanical treatment; and

        (iv) Inventory property disposal or lease without protective easements or covenants (this proposed action, in particular, has the potential to cause effects to historic properties and therefore requires analysis under section 106 of NHPA (54 U.S.C. 306108), as well as under the ESA and wetland protection requirements).

        (e) The following proposed actions are grouped into broader categories of similar types of proposed actions with ground disturbance, each of the listed proposed actions has the potential for extraordinary circumstances because they include construction or ground disturbance. Therefore, additional environmental review and consultation will be necessary in most cases. Those proposed actions that are similar in scope (purpose, intent, and breadth) and the potential significance of impacts to those listed in this section, but not specifically listed in this section, will be considered categorical exclusions in this category, unless it is determined that extraordinary circumstances exist, as specified in § 799.33:

        § 799.33   Extraordinary circumstances.

#### § § 799.33

        (a) As specified in 40 CFR 1508.4, in the definition of categorical exclusion, procedures are required to provide for extraordinary circumstances in which a normally categorically excluded action may have a significant environmental effect. The presence and impacts of extraordinary circumstances require heightened review of proposed actions that would otherwise be categorically excluded. Extraordinary circumstances include, but are not limited to:

        (1) Scientific controversy about environmental effects of the proposed action;

        (2) Impacts that are potentially adverse, significant, uncertain, or involve unique or unknown risks, including, but not limited to, impacts to protected resources. Protected resources include, but are not limited to:

        (i) Property (for example, sites, buildings, structures, and objects) of historic, archeological, or architectural significance, as designated by Federal, Tribal, State, or local governments, or property eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places;

        (ii) Federally-listed threatened or endangered species or their habitat (including critical habitat), or Federally-proposed or candidate species or their habitat;

        (iii) Important or prime agricultural, forest, or range lands, as specified in part 657 of this chapter and in USDA Departmental Regulation 9500-3;

        (iv) Wetlands, waters of the United States, as regulated under the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1344), highly erodible land, or floodplains;

        (v) Areas having a special designation, such as Federally- and State-designated wilderness areas, national parks, national natural landmarks, wild and scenic rivers, State and Federal wildlife refuges, and marine sanctuaries; and

        (vi) Special sources of water, such as sole-source aquifers, wellhead protection areas, or other water sources that are vital in a region;

        (3) A proposed action that is also “connected” (as specified in 40 CFR 1508.25(a)(1)) to other actions with potential impacts;

        (4) A proposed action that is related to other proposed actions with cumulative impacts (40 CFR 1508.25(a)(2));

        (5) A proposed action that does not comply with 40 CFR 1506.1, “Limitations on actions during NEPA process;” and

        (6) A proposed action that violates any existing Federal, State, or local government law, policy, or requirements (for example, wetland laws, Clean Water Act-related requirements, water rights).

        (b) FSA will use the ESW to review proposed actions that are eligible for categorical exclusion to determine if extraordinary circumstances exist that could impact protected resources. If an extraordinary circumstance exists, and cannot be avoided or appropriately mitigated, an EA or EIS will be prepared, as specified in this part. Specifically, FSA will complete a review with the ESW for proposed actions that fall within the list of categorical exclusions specified in § 799.32 to determine whether extraordinary circumstances are present.

        (c) For any proposed actions that have the potential to cause effects to historic properties, endangered species, waters of the United States, wetlands, and other protected resources, FSA will ensure appropriate analyses is completed to comply with the following mandates:

        (1) For section 106 of the NHPA (54 U.S.C. 306108), the regulations in 36 CFR part 800, “Protection of Historic Properties;” if an authorized technical representative from another Federal agency assists with compliance with 36 CFR part 800, FSA will remain responsible for any consultation with SHPO, THPO, or Tribal governments;

        (2) For section 7 of the ESA that governs the protection of Federally proposed, threatened and endangered species and their designated and proposed critical habitats; and

        (3) For the Clean Water Act and related Executive Order provisions for avoiding impacts to wetlands and waters of the United States, including impaired waters listed under Section 303(d) of the Clean Water Act.

        (d) If technical assistance is provided by another Federal agency, FSA will ensure that the environmental documentation provided is commensurate to or exceeds the requirements of the FSA ESW. If it is not, a review with an ESW is needed to determine if an EA or EIS is warranted.

        § 799.34   Establishing and revising categorical exclusions.

#### § § 799.34

        (a) As part of the process to establish a new categorical exclusion, FSA will consider all relevant information, including the following:

        (1) Completed FSA NEPA documents;

        (2) Other Federal agency NEPA documents on proposed actions that could be considered similar to the categorical exclusion being considered;

        (3) Results of impact demonstration or pilot projects;

        (4) Information from professional staff, expert opinions, and scientific analyses; and

        (5) The experiences of FSA, private, and public parties that have taken similar actions.

        (b) FSA will consult with CEQ and appropriate Federal agencies while developing or modifying a categorical exclusion.

        (c) Before establishing a new final categorical exclusion, FSA will follow the CEQ specified process for establishing Categorical Exclusions, including consultation with CEQ and an opportunity for public review and comment as required by 40 CFR 1507.3.

        (d) FSA will maintain an administrative record that includes the supporting information and findings used in establishing a categorical exclusion.

        (e) FSA will periodically review its categorical exclusions to identify and revise exclusions that no longer effectively reflect environmental circumstances or current FSA program scope.

        (f) FSA will use the same process specified in this section and the results of its periodic reviews to revise a categorical exclusion or remove a categorical exclusion.

      Subpart E—Environmental Assessments

        § 799.40   Purpose of an EA.

#### § § 799.40

        (a) FSA prepares an EA to determine whether a proposed action would significantly affect the environment, and to consider the potential impacts of reasonable alternatives and the potential mitigation measures to the alternatives and proposed action.

        (b) FSA will prepare a PEA to determine if proposed actions that are broad in scope or similar in nature have cumulative significant environmental impacts, although the impacts of the proposed actions may be individually insignificant.

        (c) The result of the EA process will be either a FONSI or a determination that an EIS is required. FSA may also determine that a proposed action will significantly affect the environment without first preparing an EA; in that case, an EIS is required.

        § 799.41   When an EA is required.

#### § § 799.41

        (a) Proposed actions that require the preparation of an EA include the following:

        (1) New Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program (CREP) agreements;

        (2) Development of farm ponds or lakes greater than or equal to 20 acres;

        (3) Restoration of wetlands greater than or equal to 100 acres aggregate;
