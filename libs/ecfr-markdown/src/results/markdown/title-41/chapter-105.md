    Subpart 105-1.1—Regulations System

      § 105-1.100   Scope of subpart.

#### § § 105-1.100

      This subpart establishes the General Services Administration Property Management Regulations (GSPMR) and provides certain introductory material.

      § 105-1.101   General Services Administration Property Management Regulations.

#### § § 105-1.101

      The General Services Administration Property Management Regulations (GSPMR) include the GSA property management policies and procedures which, together with the Federal Property Management Regulations, certain regulations prescribed by other agencies, and various GSA orders govern the management of property and records and certain related activities of GSA. They may contain policies and procedures of interest to other agencies and the general public and are prescribed by the Administrator of General Services in this chapter 105.

      § 105-1.101-50   Exclusions.

#### § § 105-1.101-50

      (a) Certain GSA property management and related policies and procedures which come within the scope of this chapter 105 nevertheless may be excluded therefrom when there is justification. These exclusions may include the following categories:

      (1) Subject matter that bears a security classification;

      (2) Policies and procedures that are expected to be effective for a period of less than 6 months;

      (3) Policies and procedures that are effective on an experimental basis for a reasonable period;

      (4) Policies and procedures pertaining to other functions of GSA as well as property management functions and there is need to make the issuance available simultaneously to all GSA employees involved; and

      (5) Where speed of issuance is essential, numerous changes are required in chapter 105, and all necessary changes cannot be made promptly.

      (b) Property management policies and procedures issued in other than the FPMR system format under paragraphs (a)(4) and (5) of this section, shall be codified into chapter 105 at the earliest practicable date, but in any event not later than 6 months from date of issuance.

      § 105-1.102   Relationship of GSPMR to FPMR.

#### § § 105-1.102

      (a) GSPMR implement and supplement the FPMR and implement certain other regulations. They are part of the General Services Administration Regulations System. Material published in the FPMR (which has Governmentwide applicability) becomes effective throughout GSA upon the effective date of the particular FPMR material. In general, the FPMR that are implemented and supplemented shall not be repeated, paraphrased, or otherwise restated in chapter 105.

      (b) Implementing is the process of expanding upon the FPMR or other Government-wide regulations. Supplementing is the process of prescribing material for which there is no counterpart in the Government-wide regulations.

      (c) GSPMR may deviate from the regulations that are implemented when a deviation (see § 105-1.110) is authorized in and explicitly referenced to such regulations. Where chapter 105 contains no material implementing the FPMR, the FPMR shall govern.

      § 105-1.104   Publication of GSPMR.

#### § § 105-1.104

      (a) Most GSPMR are published in the  This practice helps to ensure that interested business concerns, other agencies, and the public are apprised of GSA policies and procedures pertaining to property and records management and certain related activities.

      (b) Most GSPMR are published in cumulative form in chapter 105 of title 41 of the Code of Federal Regulations. The  and title 41 of the Code of Federal Regulations may be purchased from the Superintendent of Documents, Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C. 20402.

      § 105-1.106   Applicability.

#### § § 105-1.106

      Chapter 105 applies to the management of property and records and to certain other programs and activities of GSA. Unless otherwise specified, chapter 105 applies to activities outside as well as within the United States.

      § 105-1.109   Numbering.

#### § § 105-1.109

      § 105-1.109-50   General plan.

#### § § 105-1.109-50

      Chapter 105 is divided into parts, subparts, and further subdivisions as necessary.

      § 105-1.109-51   Arrangement.

#### § § 105-1.109-51

      (a) Parts 105-2 through 105-49 are used for GSPMR that implement regulations in the corresponding parts of chapter 101. This practice results in comparable grouping by subject area without establishment of subchapters.

      (b) Parts 105-50 and above are used for GSPMR that supplement regulations in the FPMR and implement regulations of other agencies. Part numbers are assigned so as to accomplish a similar subject area grouping. Regulations on advisory committee management are recodified as part 105-54 to place them in the appropriate subject area category. Regulations on standards of conduct remain in part 105-735 because the number 735 identifies regulations of the U.S. Civil Service Commission and various civil agencies on this subject.

      § 105-1.109-52   Cross-references.

#### § § 105-1.109-52

      (a) Within chapter 105, cross-references to the FPMR shall be made in the same manner as used within the FPMR. Illustrations of cross-references to the FPMR are:

      (1) Part 101-3;

      (2) Subpart 101-3.1;

      (3) § 101-3.413-5.

      (b) Within chapter 105, cross-references to parts, subparts, sections, and subsections of chapter 105 shall be made in a manner generally similar to that used in making cross-references to the FPMR. For example, this paragraph would be referenced as § 105-1.109-52(b).

      § 105-1.110   Deviation.

#### § § 105-1.110

      (a) In the interest of establishing and maintaining uniformity to the greatest extent feasible, deviations; i.e., the use of any policy or procedure in any manner that is inconsistent with a policy or procedure prescribed in the Federal Property Management Regulations, are prohibited unless such deviations have been requested from and approved by the Administrator of General Services or his authorized designee. Deviations may be authorized by the Administrator of General Services or his authorized designee when so doing will be in the best interest of the Government. Request for deviations shall clearly state the nature of the deviation and the reasons for such special action.

      (b) Requests for deviations from the FPMR shall be sent to the General Services Administration for consideration in accordance with the following:

      (1) For onetime (individual) deviations, requests shall be sent to the address provided in the applicable regulation. Lacking such direction, requests shall be sent to the Administrator of General Services, Washington, DC 20405.

      (2) For class deviations, requests shall be sent to only the Administrator of General Services.

    (b) Prior to the assignment or reassignment of space to an agency, GSA shall inform the agency of the accessibility, and/or the absence of accessibility features, of the space in which GSA intends to locate the agency. If the agency informs GSA that the use of the space will result in one or more of the agency's programs being inaccessible, GSA shall take one or more of the following actions to make the programs accessible:

    (1) Arrange for alterations, improvements, and repairs to buildings and facilities;

    (2) Locate and provide alternative space that will not result in one or more of the agency's programs being inaccessible; or

    (3) Take any other actions that result in making this agency's programs accessible.

    (c) GSA may not require the agency to accept space that results in one or more of the agency's programs being inaccessible.

    § 105-8.153   Program accessibility: Interagency cooperation.

#### § § 105-8.153

    § 105-8.153-1   General.

#### § § 105-8.153-1

    GSA, upon request from an occupant agency engaged in the development of a transition plan under section 504, shall participate with the occupant agency in the development and implementation of the transition plan and shall provide information and guidance to the occupant agency. Upon request, GSA shall conduct space inspections to assist the agency in determining whether a current assignment of space results in one or more of the occupant agency's programs or activities being inaccessible. GSA shall provide the occupant agency with a written summary of significant findings and recommendations, together with data concerning programmed repairs and alterations planned by GSA and alterations that can be effected by the agency.

    § 105-8.153-2   Requests from occupant agencies.

#### § § 105-8.153-2

    (a) Upon receipt of an occupant agency's request for new space, additional space, relocation to accessible space, alterations, or other actions under GSA's control that are needed to ensure program accessibility in the requesting agency's program(s) as required by the agency's section 504 transition plan, GSA shall assist or advise the requesting agency in providing or arranging for the requested action within the timeframes specified in the requesting agency's transition plan.

    (b) If the requested action cannot be completed within the time frame specified in an agency's transition plan, GSA shall so advise the requesting agency within 30 days of the request by submitting, after consultation with the agency, a revised schedule specifying the date by which the action shall be completed. If the delay in completing the action results in or continues the inaccessibility of the requesting agency's program, GSA and the agency shall, after consultation, take interim measures to make the agency's program accessible.

    (c) If GSA determines that it is unable to take the requested action, GSA shall—

    (1) Within 30 days, set forth in writing to the requesting agency the reasons for denying the agency's request, and

    (2) Within 90 days, propose to the requesting agency other methods for making the agency's program accessible.

    (d) Receipt of a copy of an occupant agency's transition plan under section 504 shall constitute notice to GSA of the requested actions in the transition plan and of the times frames which the actions are required to be completed.

    § 105-8.154   Program accessibility: Exceptions.

#### § § 105-8.154

    Sections 105-8.150, 105-8.152, and 105-8.153 do not require GSA to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where GSA personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the Administrator or his or her designee after considering all resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that individuals with handicaps receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.

    (1) The agency shall furnish appropriate auxiliary aids where necessary to afford an individual with handicaps an equal opportunity to participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, a program or activity conducted by the agency.

    (i) In determining what type of auxiliary aid is necessary, the agency shall give primary consideration to the requests of the individual with handicaps.

    (ii) The agency need not provide individually prescribed devices, readers for personal use or study, or other devices of a personal nature.

    (c) The agency shall provide signage at a primary entrance to each of its inaccessible facilities, directing users to a location at which they can obtain information about accessible facilities. The international symbol for accessibility shall be used at each primary entrance of an accessible facility.

    (d) This section does not require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with § 150.8.160 would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the Administrator or his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action required to comply with § 105-8.160 would result in such an alteration or such burdnes, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that, to the maximum extent possible, individuals with handicaps receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.

  PART 105-54—ADVISORY COMMITTEE MANAGEMENT

### Part 105

**Authority:** Authority: Pub. L. 92-463 dated October 6, 1972, as amended; and 5 U.S.C. 552.

**Source:** Source: 53 FR 40224, Oct. 14, 1988, unless otherwise noted.

    Subpart 105-54.1—General Provisions

      § 105-54.101   Applicability.

#### § § 105-54.101

      This part 105-54 applies to all advisory committees for which GSA has responsibility. This part also applies to any committee that advises GSA officials even if the committee were not established for that purpose. This applicability, however, is limited to the period of the committee's use as an advisory body. This part does not apply to:

      (a) An advisory committee exempted by an Act of Congress;

      (b) A local civic group whose primary function is to render a public service in connection with a Federal program;

      (c) A State or local committee, council, board, commission, or similar group established to advise or make recommendations to State or local officials or agencies;

      (d) A meeting initiated by the President or one or more Federal official(s) for the purpose of obtaining advice or recommendations from one individual;

      (e) A meeting with a group initiated by the President or one or more Federal official(s) for the sole purpose of exchanging facts or information;

      (f) A meeting initiated by a group with the President or one or more Federal official(s) for the purpose of expressing the group's views, provided that the President or Federal official(s) does not use the group recurrently as a preferred source of advice or recommendations;

      (g) A committee that is established to perform primarily operational as opposed to advisory functions. Operational functions are those specifically provided by law, such as making or implementing Government decisions or policy. An operational committee would be covered by the Act if it becomes primarily advisory in nature;

      (h) A meeting initiated by a Federal official(s) with more than one individual for the purpose of obtaining the advice of individual attendees and not for the purpose of utilizing the group to obtain consensus advice or recommendations. However, such a group would be covered by the Act when an agency accepts the group's deliberations as a source of consensus advice or recommendations;

      (i) A meeting of two or more advisory committee or subcommittee members convened solely to gather information or conduct research for a chartered advisory committee, to analyze relevant issues and facts, or to draft proposed position papers for deliberation by the advisory committee or a subcommittee of the advisory committee; and

      (j) A committee composed wholly of full-time officers or employees of the Federal Government.

      § 105-54.102   Definitions.

#### § § 105-54.102

      (a) The term “advisory committee” means any committee, board, commission, council, conference, panel, task force, or other similar group or any subcommittee thereof that is:

      (1) Established by statute,

      (2) Established or utilized by the President, or

      (3) Established or utilized by any agency official to obtain advice or recommendations that are within the scope of his/her responsibilies.

      (b) “Presidential advisory committee” means any committee that advises the President. It may be established by the President or by the Congress, or may be used by the President to obtain advice or recommendations.

      (c) “Independent Presidential advisory committee” means any Presidential advisory committee not assigned by the President, or the President's delegate, or by the Congress in law, to an agency for administrative and other support and for which the Administrator of General Services may provide administrative and other support on a reimbursable basis.

      (d) “Committee member” means an individual who serves by appointment on a committee and has the full right and obligation to participate in the activities of the committee, including voting on committee recommendations.

      (e) “Staff member” means any individual who serves in a support capacity to an advisory committee.

      (f) “Secretariat” means the General Services Administration's Committee Management Secretariat. Established pursuant to the Federal Advisory Committee Act, it is responsible for all matters relating to advisory committees, and carries out the Administrator's responsibilities under the Act and Executive Order 12024.

      (g) “Utilized” (or used), as stated in the definition of “advisory committee” above, refers to a situation in which a GSA official adopts a committee or other group composed in whole or in part of other than full-time Federal officers or employees with an established existence outside GSA as a preferred source from which to obtain advice or recommendations on a specific issue or policy within the scope of his/her responsibilities in the same manner as that official would obtain advice or recommendations from an established advisory committee.

      § 105-54.103   Policy.

#### § § 105-54.103

      The basic GSA policy on committee management is as follows:

      (a) Advisory committees will be formed or used by GSA only when specifically authorized by law, or by the President, or specifically determined as a matter of formal record by the Administrator of General Services to be in the public interest in connection with the performance of duties imposed on GSA by law;

      (b) Advisory committees will not be used to administer a function that is the assigned responsibility of a service or staff office;

      (c) The assigned responsibility of a GSA official may not be delegated to any committee;

      (d) No advisory committee may be used for functions that are not solely advisory unless specifically authorized by statute or Presidential directive. Making policy decisions and determining action to be taken with respect to any matter considered by an advisory committee is solely the responsibility of GSA; and

      (e) In carrying out its responsibilities, GSA will consult with and obtain the advice of interested groups substantially affected by its programs. The use of advisory committees for this purpose is considered to be in the public interest and necessary for the proper performance by GSA of its assigned functions.

      § 105-54.104   Responsibilities.

#### § § 105-54.104

      (a) Responsibility for coordination and control of committee management in GSA is vested in the Associate Administrator for Administration, who serves as the GSA Committee Management Officer (CMO). This Officer carries out the functions prescribed in section 8(b) of the Federal Advisory Committee Act. In doing so, the Officer controls and supervises the establishment, procedures, and accomplishments of GSA-sponsored advisory committees. The Organization and Productivity Improvement Division, Office of Management Services, Office of Administration, provides staff resources and furnishes the Staff Contact Person (SCP) to the CMO.

      (b) The Head of each Service and Staff Office and each Regional Administrator selects a Committee Management Officer (CMO) to coordinate and control committee management within the service, staff office, or regional office and to act as liaison to the GSA Committee Management Officer. The duties of the CMOs are as follows:

      (1) Assemble and maintain the reports, records, and other papers of any GSA-sponsored committee during its existence (Arrangements may be made, however, for the Government chairperson or other GSA representative to retain custody of reports, records, and other papers to facilitate committee operations. After the committee is terminated, all committee records are disposed of following existing regulations.); and

      (2) Under agency regulations in 41 CFR 105-60, carry out the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552 with respect to the reports, records, and other papers of GSA-sponsored advisory committees.

    Subpart 105-54.2—Establishment of Advisory Committees

#### § § 105-54.201

      (a) The Administrator approves the establishment of all GSA Federal Advisory Committees.

      (b) When it is decided that it is necessary to establish a committee, the appropriate Head of the Service or Staff Office (HSSO) must consider the functions of similar committees in GSA to ensure that no duplication of effort will occur.

      (c) The HSSO proposes the establishment of a Central Office or regional advisory committee within the scope of assigned program responsibilities. In doing so, the HSSO assures that advisory committees are established only if they are essential to the conduct of agency business. Advisory committees are established only if there is a compelling need for the committees, the committees have a truly balanced membership, and the committees conduct their business as openly as possible under the law and their mandate. Each proposal is submitted to the GSA Committee Management Officer for review and coordination and includes:

      (1) A letter addressed to the Committee Management Secretariat signed by the HSSO with information copies for the Administrator, Deputy Administrator, the Associate Administrator for Congressional and Industry Relations, and the Special Counsel for Ethics and Civil Rights, describing the nature and purpose of the proposed advisory committee; why it is essential to agency business and in the public interest; why its functions cannot be performed by an existing committee of GSA, by GSA, or other means such as a public hearing; and the plans to ensure balanced membership;

      (2) A notice for publication in the  containing the Administrator's certification that creation of the advisory committee is in the public interest and describing the nature and purpose of the committee; and

      (3) A draft charter for review by the Committee Management Secretariat.

      (d) Subcommittees that do not function independently of the full or parent advisory committee need not follow the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section. However, they are subject to all other requirements of the Federal Advisory Committee Act.

      (e) The requirements of paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section apply to any subcommittee of a chartered committee, whether its members are drawn in whole or in part from the full or parent advisory committee, that functions independently of the parent advisory committee, such as by making recommendations directly to a GSA official rather than for consideration by the chartered advisory committee.

      § 105-54.202   Review and approval of proposals.

#### § § 105-54.202

      (a) The GSA Committee Management Officer reviews each proposal to make sure it conforms with GSA policies and procedures. The Officer sends the letter of justification, including the draft charter, to the Committee Management Secretariat. The Secretariat reviews the proposal and provides its views within 15 calendar days of receipt, if possible. The Administrator retains final authority for establishing a particular advisory committee.

      (b) When the Secretariat notifies the Officer that establishing the committee conforms with the Federal Advisory Committee Act, the Officer obtains the Administrator's approval of the charter and the  notice. The Officer publishes the notice in the  at least 15 calendar days before the filing of the charter under § 105-54.203 with the standing committees of the Senate and the House of Representatives having legislative jurisdiction over GSA. The date of filing constitutes the date of establishment.

      § 105-54.203   Advisory committee charters.

#### § § 105-54.203

      No advisory committee may operate, meet, or take any action until the Administrator approves its charter and the Committee Management Officer sends a copy of it to the standing committees of the Senate and the House of Representatives having legislative jurisdiction over GSA.

      (d) The official to whom the committee reports, including the official's name, title, and organization;

      (e) The agency and office responsible for providing the necessary support for the committee;

      (f) A description of the duties for which the committee is responsible (if the duties are not solely advisory, the statutory or Presidential authority for additional duties shall be specified);

      § 105-54.204   Advisory committee membership.

#### § § 105-54.204

      (a) Advisory committees that GSA establishes represent the points of view of the profession, industry, or other group to which it relates, taking into account the size, function, geographical location, affiliation, and other considerations affecting the character of a committee. To ensure balance, the agency considers for membership a cross-section of interested persons and groups with professional or personal qualifications or experience to contribute to the functions and tasks to be performed. This should be construed neither to limit the participation nor to compel the selection of any particular individual or group to obtain different points of view relevant to committee business. The Administrator designates members, alternates, and observers, as appropriate, of advisory committees. He/she designates a Federal officer or employee to chair or attend each meeting of each advisory committee. The Administrator also designates GSA employees to serve on advisory committees sponsored by other Government agencies. The HSSO or Regional Administrator submits nominations and letters of designation for the Administrator's signature to the GSA Committee Management Officer and to the Special Counsel for Ethics and Civil Rights for review and forwarding to the Administrator.

      (b) Discrimination is prohibited on the basis of race, color, age, national origin, religion, sex, or mental and physical handicap in selecting advisory committee members.

      (c) Nominees for membership must submit a Statement of Employment and Financial Interests (provided to the nominee by the HSSO or Regional Administrator) and may not be appointed until cleared by the Designated Agency Ethics Official.

The transmittal letter identifies the materials being furnished, with a copy of the transmittal provided to the GSA Committee Management Officer.

      § 105-54.303   Fiscal and administrative provisions.

#### § § 105-54.303

      (a) Each HSSO and each Regional Administrator ensures that under established GSA procedures, records are kept that fully disclose the disposition of funds at the disposal of an advisory committee and the nature and extent of the committee's activities.

      (f) When required by law, the pay of the members of GSA advisory committees will be fixed to the daily equivalent of a rate of the General Schedule in 5 U.S.C. 5332 unless the members are appointed as consultants and compensated as provided in paragraph (h) of this section. In determining an appropriate rate of pay for the members, GSA must give consideration to the significance, scope, and technical complexity of the matters with which the advisory committee is concerned and the qualifications required of the members of the advisory committee. GSA may not fix the pay of the members of an advisory committee at a rate higher than the daily equivalent of the maximum rate for a GS-15 under the General Schedule, unless a higher rate is mandated by statute, or the Administrator has personally determined that a higher rate of pay under the General Schedule is justified and necessary. Such a determination must be reviewed by the Administrator annually. Accordingly, the Administrator may not fix the pay of the members of an advisory committee at a rate of pay higher than the daily equivalent of a rate for a GSA 18, as provided in 5 U.S.C. 5332.

      (g) The pay of each staff member of an advisory committee is fixed at a rate of the General Schedule, General Management Schedule, or Senior Executive Service pay rate in which the staff member's position would be placed (5 U.S.C. Chapter 51). GSA cannot fix the pay of a staff member higher than the daily equivalent of the maximum rate for GS-15 unless the Administrator decides that under the General Schedule, General Management Schedule, or Senior Executive Service classification system, the staff member's position should be higher than GS-15. The Administrator must review this decision annually.

      (1) In establishing compensation rates, GSA must comply with applicable statutes, regulations, Executive Orders, and administrative guidelines.

      (2) A staff member who is a Federal employee serves with the knowledge of the Designated Federal Officer and the approval of the employee's direct supervisor. A staff member who is a non-Federal employee is appointed under agency procedures, after consultation with the advisory committee.

      (h) The pay of a consultant to an advisory committee will be fixed after giving consideration to the qualifications required of the consultant and the significance, scope, and technical complexity of the work. The rate of pay will not exceed the maximum rate of pay which the agency may pay experts and consultants under 5 U.S.C. 3109 and must be in accordance with any applicable statutes, regulations, Executive Orders, and administrative guidelines.

      (i) Advisory committee and staff members, while performing their duties away from their homes or regular places of business, may be allowed travel expenses, including per diem instead of subsistence, as authorized by 5 U.S.C. 5703 for persons employed intermittently in the Government service.

      (j) Members of an advisory committee and its staff who are blind or deaf or who otherwise qualify as handicapped persons (under section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794)), and who do not otherwise qualify for assistance under 5 U.S.C. 3102, as an employee of an agency (under section 3102(a)(1) of Title 5), may be provided the services of a personal assistant.

      (k) Under this paragraph, GSA may accept the gratuitous services of a member, consultant, or staff member of an advisory committee who agrees in advance to serve without compensation.

      (l) A person who immediately before his or her service with an advisory committee was a full-time Federal employee may receive compensation at the rate at which he or she was compensated as a Federal employee.

      § 105-54.304   Cost guidelines.

#### § § 105-54.304

      (a) The reporting and estimating of the costs of advisory committees include direct obligations for the following items:

      (1) Pay compensation of committee members; consultants to the committee; all permanent, temporary, or part-time (GM, GS, WB, or other) positions which are a part of or support the committee; and all overtime related to committee functions (Compensation should reflect actual or estimated Federal person-years or parts thereof devoted to a committee's activities. It includes the compensation of Federal employees assigned to committees, on a reimbursable or nonreimbursable basis, from agencies or departments other than to which the committee reports.);

      (2) Personnel benefits associated with the above compensation (13 percent of basic payroll);

      (3) Travel costs (including per diem) of committee members; consultants; and all permanent, temporary, or part-time positions which are a part of or support the committee;

      (4) Transportation of things, communications, and printing and reproduction;

      (5) Rent for additional space acquired for committee use;

      (6) Other services required by the committee, including data processing services, management studies and evaluations, contractual services, and reimbursable services; and

      (7) Supplies, materials, and equipment acquired for committee use.

      (b) The reporting and estimating of the cost of advisory committees does not include indirect or overhead costs; e.g., the costs of the committee management system (committee management officers, etc.).

      § 105-54.305   Renewal of advisory committees.

#### § § 105-54.305

      (a) Each advisory committee being continued is renewed for successive 2-year periods beginning with the date when it was established according to the following, except for statutory advisory committees: (For renewal of statutory advisory committees, see paragraph (b) of this section.)

      (1) Advisory committees are not renewed unless there is a compelling need for them, they have balanced membership, and they conduct their business as openly as possible under the law.

      (2) The renewal of a committee requires that the responsible HSSO submit to the GSA Committee Management Officer the following:

      (i) An updated charter with an explanation of the need for the renewal of the committee. The charter and explanation are furnished 60 calendar days before the 2-year anniversary date of the committee.);

      (ii) A letter signed by the HSSO to the Director, Committee Management Secretariat, with information copies to the Administrator and the Deputy Administrator, setting forth:

      (A) An explanation of why the committee is essential to the conduct of agency business and is in the public interest;

      (B) GSA's plan to attain balanced membership of the committee; and

      (C) An explanation of why the committee's functions cannot be performed by GSA, another existing GSA advisory committee, or other means such as a public hearing;

      (iii) A notice for publication in the  describing the nature and purpose of the committee and containing a certification by the Administrator that renewing the advisory committee is in the public interest.

      (3) On receiving the above documents, the GSA Committee Management Officer submits the renewal letter to the Committee Management Secretariat not more than 60 calendar days nor less than 30 days before the committee expires. Following receipt of the Committee Management Secretariat's views on the committee renewal, the Officer obtains the Administrator's approval of the charter and the  notice. The Officer publishes notice of the renewal in the  and files copies of the updated charter. The 15-day notice requirement does not apply to committee renewals, notices of which may be published concurrently with the filing of the charter.

      (b) Each statutory advisory committee is renewed by the filing of a renewal charter upon the expiration of each successive 2-year period following the date of enactment of the statute establishing the committee according to the following:

      (1) The procedures in paragraph (a)(2) of this section apply to the renewal of a statutory committee except that neither prior consultation with the Committee Management Secretariat nor a  notice is required. Accordingly, the letter that paragraph a(2)(ii) requires is sent to the Administrator rather than the Committee Management Secretariat. Due to the nature of a committee the law established, the explanation of the need to continue the committee's existence is less extensive than the explanation for the continuation of a non-statutory committee; and

      (2) The GSA Committee Management Officer provides the Committee Management Secretariat with a copy of the filed charter.

      (c) An advisory committee required to file a new charter may not take any action other than preparing the charter between the date it is to be filed and the date it is actually filed.

      § 105-54.306   Amendment of advisory committee charters.

#### § § 105-54.306

      (a) A charter is amended when GSA decides that the existing charter no longer accurately reflects the objectives or functions of the committee. Changes may be minor, such as revising the name of the committee or modifying the estimated number or frequency of meetings, or they may be major dealing with the basic objectives or composition of the committee. The Administrator retains final authority for amending the charter of an advisory committee. Amending an existing advisory committee charter does not constitute renewal of the committee.

      (b) To make a minor amendment, the Administrator approves the amended charter and has it filed according to § 105-54.203-1.

      (c) To make a major amendment, the Committee Management Officer submits an amended charter and a letter to the Committee Management Secretariat, signed by the HSSO with the concurrence of the General Counsel or designee, requesting the Secretariat's views on the amended language, along with an explanation of the purpose of the changes and why they are necessary. The Secretariat reviews the proposed changes and notifies the Committee Management Officer of its views within 15 calendar days of receiving it, if possible. The Administrator has the charter filed according to § 105-54.203-1.

      (d) Amending an existing charter does not constitute renewal of the committee.

      § 105-54.307   Termination of advisory committees.

#### § § 105-54.307

      (a) The sponsoring HSSO terminates an advisory committee that has fulfilled the purpose stated in its charter. The official takes action to rescind any existing orders relating to the committee and to notify committee members, the GSA Committee Management Officer, and the Committee Management Secretariat of the termination.

      (b) Failing to continue an advisory committee by the 2-year anniversary date terminates the committee, unless its duration is provided for by law.

      § 105-54.308   Responsibilities of the Administrator.

      (b) Solicit in writing or in a formal meeting at least annually the views of committee members on the effectiveness, activities, and management of the committee, including recommendations for improvement. Review comments to determine whether improvements or corrective action is warranted. Retain recommendations until the committee is terminated or renewed.

      (c) Involve key management personnel of the agency whose interests are affected by the committee in committee meetings, including reviewing reports and establishing agendas.

      (d) Periodically, but not less than annually, review the level of committee staff suport to make sure that expenditures are justified by committee activity and benefit to the Government.

      (e) Monitor the attendance and participation of committee members and consider replacing any member who misses a substantial number of scheduled meetings.

      (f) Establish meeting dates and distribute agendas and other materials well in advance.

    § 105-55.003   Antitrust, fraud, tax, interagency claims, and claims over $100,000 excluded.

#### § § 105-55.003

    (a) The standards in this part relating to compromise, suspension, and termination of collection activity do not apply to any debt based in whole or in part on conduct in violation of the antitrust laws or to any debt involving fraud, the presentation of a false claim, or misrepresentation on the part of the debtor or any party having an interest in the claim. The standards of this part relating to the administrative collection of claims do apply, but only to the extent authorized by the Department of Justice (DOJ) in a particular case. Upon identification of a claim based in whole or in part on conduct in violation of the antitrust laws or any claim involving fraud, the presentation of a false claim, or misrepresentation on the part of the debtor or any party having an interest in the claim, the General Services Administration (GSA) will promptly refer the case to the GSA Office of Inspector General (OIG). The OIG has the responsibility for investigating or referring the matter, where appropriate, to DOJ for action. At its discretion, DOJ may return the claim to GSA for further handling in accordance with the standards of this part.

    (b) This part does not apply to tax debts.

    (c) This part does not apply to claims between GSA and other Federal agencies.

    (d) This part does not apply to claims over $100,000.

    § 105-55.004   Compromise, waiver, or disposition under other statutes not precluded.

#### § § 105-55.004

    Nothing in this part precludes the General Services Administration (GSA) disposition of any claim under statutes and implementing regulations other than subchapter II of chapter 37 of Title 31 of the United States Code (Claims of the United States Government) and the standards in this part. See, e.g., the Federal Medical Care Recovery Act, 42 U.S.C. 2651-2653, and applicable regulations, 28 CFR part 43. In such cases, the laws and regulations specifically applicable to claims collection activities of GSA generally take precedence.

    § 105-55.005   Form of payment.

#### § § 105-55.005

    Claims may be paid in the form of money or, when a contractual basis exists, the General Services Administration may demand the return of specific property or the performance of specific services.

    § 105-55.006   Subdivision of claims not authorized.

#### § § 105-55.006

    Debts will not be subdivided to avoid the monetary ceiling established by 31 U.S.C. 3711(a)(2). A debtor's liability arising from a particular transaction or contract shall be considered a single debt in determining whether the debt is one of less than $100,000 (excluding interest, penalties, and administrative costs) or such higher amount as the Attorney General shall from time to time prescribe for purposes of compromise, suspension or termination of collection activity.

    § 105-55.007   Required administrative proceedings.

#### § § 105-55.007

    The General Services Administration is not required to omit, foreclose, or duplicate administrative proceedings required by contract or other laws or regulations.

    § 105-55.008   No private rights created.

#### § § 105-55.008

    The standards in this part do not create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by a party against the United States, its agencies, its officers, or any other person, nor shall the failure of the General Services Administration to comply with any of the provisions of this part be available to any debtor as a defense.

    § 105-55.009   Aggressive agency collection activity.

#### § § 105-55.009

    (a) The General Services Administration (GSA) will aggressively collect all debts arising out of activities of, or referred or transferred for collection services to, GSA. Collection activities will be undertaken promptly, including letters, telephone calls, electronic mail (e-mail), and Internet inquiries, with follow-up action taken as necessary.

    (b) Debts referred or transferred to Treasury, or Treasury-designated debt collection centers under the authority of 31 U.S.C. 3711(g), will be serviced, collected, or compromised, or the collection action will be suspended or terminated, in accordance with the statutory requirements and authorities applicable to the collection of such debts.

    (c) GSA will cooperate with other agencies in their debt collection activities.

    (d) GSA will consider referring debts that are less than 180 days delinquent to Treasury or to Treasury-designated “debt collection centers” to accomplish efficient, cost effective debt collection. Treasury is a debt collection center, is authorized to designate other Federal agencies as debt collection centers based on their performance in collecting delinquent debts, and may withdraw such designations. Referrals to debt collection centers shall be at the discretion of, and for a time period acceptable to, the Secretary. Referrals may be for servicing, collection, compromise, suspension, or termination of collection action.

    (e) GSA will transfer to the Secretary any debt that has been delinquent for a period of 180 days or more so the Secretary may take appropriate action to collect the debt or terminate collection action. See 31 CFR 285.12 (Transfer of Debts to Treasury for Collection). This requirement does not apply to any debt that—

    (1) Is in litigation or foreclosure;

    (2) Will be disposed of under an approved asset sale program;

    (3) Has been referred to a private collection contractor for a period of time acceptable to the Secretary;

    (4) Is at a debt collection center for a period of time acceptable to the Secretary (see paragraph (d) of this section);

    (5) Will be collected under internal offset procedures within three years after the debt first became delinquent;

    (6) Is exempt from this requirement based on a determination by the Secretary that exemption for a certain class of debt is in the best interest of the United States. GSA may request the Secretary to exempt specific classes of debts;

    (7) Is in bankruptcy (see § 105-55.010(h));

    (8) Involves a deceased debtor;

    (9) Is owed to GSA by a foreign government; or

    (10) Is in an administrative appeals process, until the process is complete and the amount due is set.

    (f) Agencies operating Treasury-designated debt collection centers are authorized to charge a fee for services rendered regarding referred or transferred debts. The fee may be paid out of amounts collected and will be added to the debt as an administrative cost (see § 105-55.016).

    § 105-55.010   Demand for payment.

#### § § 105-55.010

    (a) Written demand, as described in paragraph (b) of this section, will be made promptly upon a debtor of the United States in terms informing the debtor of the consequences of failing to cooperate with the General Services Administration (GSA) to resolve the debt. The specific content, timing, and number of demand letters (usually no more than three, thirty days apart) will depend upon the type and amount of the debt and the debtor's response, if any, to GSA's letters, telephone calls, electronic mail (e-mail) or Internet inquiries. In determining the timing of the demand letter(s), GSA will give due regard to the need to refer debts promptly to the Department of Justice for litigation, in accordance with § 105-55.031. When necessary to protect the Government's interest (for example, to prevent the running of a statute of limitations), written demand may be preceded by other appropriate actions under this part, including immediate referral for litigation.

    (b) Demand letters will inform the debtor—

    (1) The basis and the amount of the indebtedness and the rights, if any, the debtor may have to seek review within GSA (see § 105-55.011(e));

    (2) The applicable standards for imposing any interest, penalties, or administrative costs (see § 105-55.016);

    (3) The date by which payment should be made to avoid late charges (i.e., interest, penalties, and administrative costs) and enforced collection, which generally will not be more than 30 days from the date the demand letter is mailed or hand-delivered; and

    (4) The name, address, and phone number of a contact person or office within GSA.

    (c) GSA will exercise care to ensure that demand letters are mailed or hand-delivered on the same day they are dated. For the purposes of written demand, notification by electronic mail (e-mail) and/or Internet delivery is considered a form of written demand notice. There is no prescribed format for demand letters. GSA will utilize demand letters and procedures that will lead to the earliest practicable determination of whether the debt can be resolved administratively or must be referred for litigation.

    (d) GSA may include in demand letters such items as the willingness to discuss alternative methods of payment; Agency policies with respect to the use of credit bureaus, debt collection centers, and collection agencies; Agency remedies to enforce payment of the debt (including assessment of interest, administrative costs and penalties, administrative garnishment, the use of collection agencies, Federal salary offset, tax refund offset, administrative offset, and litigation); the requirement that any debt delinquent for more than 180 days will be transferred to the Department of the Treasury for collection; and, depending on applicable statutory authority, the debtor's entitlement to consideration of a waiver.

    (e) GSA will respond promptly to communications from debtors, within 30 days whenever feasible, and will advise debtors who dispute debts to furnish available evidence to support their contentions.

    (f) Prior to the initiation of the demand process or at any time during or after completion of the demand process, if GSA determines to pursue, or is required to pursue, offset, the procedures applicable to offset will be followed (see § 105-55.011). The availability of funds or money for debt satisfaction by offset and GSA's determination to pursue collection by offset will release the Agency from the necessity of further compliance with paragraphs (a), (b), (c), and (d) of this section.

    (g) Prior to referring a debt for litigation, GSA will advise each person determined to be liable for the debt that, unless the debt can be collected administratively, litigation may be initiated. This notification will comply with Executive Order 12988 (3 CFR, 1996 Comp. pp. 157-163) and may be given as part of a demand letter under paragraph (b) of this section or in a separate document.

    (h) When GSA learns a bankruptcy petition has been filed with respect to a debtor, before proceeding with further collection action, the Agency will ascertain the impact of the Bankruptcy Code on any pending or contemplated collection activities. Unless the Agency determines the automatic stay imposed at the time of filing pursuant to 11 U.S.C. 362 has been lifted or is no longer in effect, in most cases collection activity against the debtor will stop immediately.

    (1) A proof of claim will be filed in most cases with the bankruptcy court or the Trustee. GSA will refer to the provisions of 11 U.S.C. 106 relating to the consequences on sovereign immunity of filing a proof of claim.

    (2) If GSA is a secured creditor, it may seek relief from the automatic stay regarding its security, subject to the provisions and requirements of 11 U.S.C. 362.

    (3) Offset is stayed in most cases by the automatic stay. However, GSA will determine whether its payments to the debtor and payments of other agencies available for offset may be frozen by the Agency until relief from the automatic stay can be obtained from the bankruptcy court. GSA also will determine whether recoupment is available.

    § 105-55.011   Collection by administrative offset.

#### § § 105-55.011

    (a)  (1) The term “administrative offset” has the meaning provided in 31 U.S.C. 3701(a)(1).

    (2) This section does not apply to—

    (i) Debts arising under the Social Security Act, except as provided in 42 U.S.C. 404;

    (ii) Payments made under the Social Security Act, except as provided for in 31 U.S.C. 3716(c) (see 31 CFR 285.4, Federal Benefit Offset);

    (iii) Debts arising under, or payments made under, the Internal Revenue Code (see 31 CFR 285.2, Tax Refund Offset) or the tariff laws of the United States;

    (iv) Offsets against Federal salaries to the extent these standards are inconsistent with regulations published to implement such offsets under 5 U.S.C. 5514 and 31 U.S.C. 3716 (see 5 CFR part 550, subpart K, and 31 CFR 285.7, Federal Salary Offset);

    (v) Offsets under 31 U.S.C. 3728 against a judgment obtained by a debtor against the United States;

    (vi) Offsets or recoupments under common law, State law, or Federal statutes specifically prohibiting offsets or recoupments of particular types of debts; or

    (vii) Offsets in the course of judicial proceedings, including bankruptcy.

    (3) Unless otherwise provided for by contract or law, debts or payments that are not subject to administrative offset under 31 U.S.C. 3716 may be collected by administrative offset under the common law or other applicable statutory authority.

    (4) Unless otherwise provided by law, administrative offset of payments under the authority of 31 U.S.C. 3716 to collect a debt may not be conducted more than 10 years after the General Services Administration's (GSA's) right to collect the debt first accrued, unless facts material to GSA's right to collect the debt were not known and could not reasonably have been known by the official or officials of GSA who were charged with the responsibility to discover and collect such debts. This limitation does not apply to debts reduced to a judgment.

    (5) In bankruptcy cases, GSA will ascertain the impact of the Bankruptcy Code, particularly 11 U.S.C. 106, 362, and 553, on pending or contemplated collections by offset.

    (b)  (1) GSA is required to refer past due, legally enforceable non-tax debts that are over 180 days delinquent to the Secretary for collection by centralized administrative offset. Debts that are less than 180 days delinquent also may be referred to the Secretary for this purpose. See paragraph (b)(5) of this section for debt certification requirements.

    (2) The names and taxpayer identifying numbers (TINs) of debtors who owe debts referred to the Secretary as described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section will be compared to the names and TINs on payments to be made by Federal disbursing officials. Federal disbursing officials include disbursing officials of the Department of the Treasury, the Department of Defense, the United States Postal Service, other Government corporations, and disbursing officials of the United States designated by the Secretary. When the name and TIN of a debtor match the name and TIN of a payee and all other requirements for offset have been met, the payment will be offset to satisfy the debt.

    (3) Federal disbursing officials will notify the debtor/payee in writing that an offset has occurred to satisfy, in part or in full, a past due, legally enforceable delinquent debt. The notice will include a description of the type and amount of the payment from which the offset was taken, the amount of offset that was taken, the identity of GSA as the creditor agency requesting the offset, and a contact point within GSA who will respond to questions regarding the offset.

    (4)(i) Offsets may be initiated only after the debtor—

    (A) Has been sent written notice of the type and amount of the debt, the intention of GSA to use administrative offset to collect the debt, and an explanation of the debtor's rights under 31 U.S.C. 3716(c)(7); and

    (B) The debtor has been given—

    () The opportunity to inspect and copy Agency records related to the debt;

    () The opportunity for a review within GSA of the determination of indebtedness (see paragraph (e) of this section); and

    () The opportunity to make a written agreement to repay the debt.

    (ii) The procedures set forth in paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section may be omitted when—

    (A) The offset is in the nature of a recoupment;

    (B) The debt arises under a contract as set forth in  v.  995 F.2d 1052 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (notice and other procedural protections set forth in 31 U.S.C. 3716(a) do not supplant or restrict established procedures for contractual offsets accommodated by the Contracts Disputes Act); or

    (C) In the case of non-centralized administrative offsets conducted under paragraph (c) of this section, GSA first learns of the existence of the amount owed by the debtor when there is insufficient time before payment would be made to the debtor/payee to allow for prior notice and an opportunity for review. When prior notice and an opportunity for review are omitted, GSA will give the debtor such notice and an opportunity for review as soon as practicable and will promptly refund any money ultimately found not to have been owed to the Government.

    (iii) When GSA previously has given a debtor any of the required notice and review opportunities with respect to a particular debt (see, e.g., § 105-55.010), the Agency need not duplicate such notice and review opportunities before administrative offset may be initiated.

    (5) When referring delinquent debts to the Secretary, GSA will certify, in a form acceptable to the Secretary, that—

    (i) The debt(s) is (are) past due and legally enforceable; and

    (ii) GSA has complied with all due process requirements under 31 U.S.C. 3716(a) and Agency regulations.

    (6) Payments that are prohibited by law from being offset are exempt from centralized administrative offset. The Secretary shall exempt payments under means-tested programs from centralized administrative offset when requested in writing by the Administrator. Also, the Secretary may exempt other classes of payments from centralized offset upon the written request of the Administrator.

    (7) Benefit payments made under the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 301 ), part B of the Black Lung Benefits Act (30 U.S.C. 921 ), and any law administered by the Railroad Retirement Board (other than tier 2 benefits), may be offset only in accordance with Treasury regulations, issued in consultation with the Social Security Administration, the Railroad Retirement Board, and the Office of Management and Budget. See 31 CFR 285.4.

    (8) In accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3716(f), the Secretary may waive the provisions of the Computer Matching and Privacy Protection Act of 1988 concerning matching agreements and post-match notification and verification (5 U.S.C. 552a(o) and (p)) for centralized administrative offset upon receipt of a certification from GSA that the due process requirements enumerated in 31 U.S.C. 3716(a) have been met. The certification of a debt in accordance with paragraph (b)(5) of this section will satisfy this requirement. If such a waiver is granted, only the Data Integrity Board of the Department of the Treasury is required to oversee any matching activities, in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3716(g). This waiver authority does not apply to offsets conducted under paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section.

    (c)  (1) Generally, non-centralized administrative offsets are ad hoc case-by-case offsets that GSA conducts, at the Agency's discretion, internally or in cooperation with another agency certifying or authorizing payments to the debtor. Unless otherwise prohibited by law, when centralized administrative offset is not available or appropriate, past due, legally enforceable non-tax delinquent debts may be collected through non-centralized administrative offset. In these cases, GSA may make a request directly to a payment authorizing agency to offset a payment due a debtor to collect a delinquent debt. For example, it may be appropriate for GSA to request the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) offset a Federal employee's lump sum payment upon leaving Government service to satisfy an unpaid advance.

    (2) Such offsets will occur only after—

    (i) The debtor has been provided due process as set forth in paragraph (b)(4) of this section; and

    (ii) The payment authorizing agency has received written certification from GSA that the debtor owes the past due, legally enforceable delinquent debt in the amount stated, and that GSA has fully complied with its regulations concerning administrative offset.

    (3) Payment authorizing agencies will comply with offset requests by GSA to collect debts owed to the United States, unless the offset would not be in the best interests of the United States with respect to the program of the payment authorizing agency, or would otherwise be contrary to law.

    (4) When collecting multiple debts by non-centralized administrative offset, GSA will apply the recovered amounts to those debts in accordance with the best interests of the United States, as determined by the facts and circumstances of the particular case, particularly the applicable statute of limitations.

    (d)  Upon providing OPM written certification that a debtor has been afforded the procedures provided in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, GSA may request OPM to offset a debtor's anticipated or future benefit payments under the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund (Fund) in accordance with regulations codified at 5 CFR 831.1801 through 831.1808. Upon receipt of such a request, OPM will identify and “flag” a debtor's account in anticipation of the time when the debtor requests, or becomes eligible to receive, payments from the Fund. This will satisfy any requirement that offset be initiated prior to the expiration of the time limitations referenced in paragraph (a)(4) of this section.

    (e)  (1) A debtor may seek review of a debt by sending a signed and dated petition for review to the official named in the demand letter. A copy of the petition must also be sent to the Civilian Board of Contract Appeals (CBCA) at 1800 F Street NW., Washington, DC 20405.

    (2) For purposes of this section, whenever GSA is required to afford a debtor a review within the Agency, the hearing official will provide the debtor with a reasonable opportunity for an oral hearing when the debtor requests reconsideration of the debt and the hearing official determines that the question of the indebtedness cannot be resolved by review of the documentary evidence; for example, when the validity of the debt turns on an issue of credibility or veracity.

    (3) Witnesses will be asked to testify under oath or affirmation, and a written transcript of the hearing will be kept and made available to either party in the event of an appeal under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 701-706. Arrangements for the taking of the transcript will be made by the hearing official, and all charges associated with the taking of the transcript will be the responsibility of GSA.

    (4) In those cases when an oral hearing is not required by this section, the hearing official will accord the debtor a “paper hearing,” that is, a determination of the request for reconsideration based upon a review of the written record.

    (5) Hearings will be conducted by a Board Judge of the CBCA. GSA must provide proof that a valid non-tax debt exists, and the debtor must provide evidence that no debt exists or that the amount of the debt is incorrect.

    (6) If an oral hearing is provided, the debtor may choose to have it conducted in the hearing official's office located at 1800 M Street NW., 6th Floor, Washington, DC 20036, at another location designated by the hearing official, or may choose a hearing by telephone. All personal and travel expenses incurred by the debtor in connection with an in-person hearing will be borne by the debtor. All telephonic charges incurred during a hearing will be the responsibility of GSA.

    (7) If the debtor is an employee of GSA, the employee may represent himself or herself or may be represented by another person of his or her choice at the hearing. GSA will not compensate the employee for representation expenses, including hourly fees for attorneys, travel expenses, and costs for reproducing documents.

    (8) A written decision will be issued by the hearing official no later than 60 days from the date the petition for review is received by GSA. The decision will state the—

    (i) Facts supporting the nature and origin of the debt;

    (ii) Hearing officials analysis, findings, and conclusions as to the debtor's and/or GSA's grounds;

    (iii) Amount and validity of the debt; and

    (iv) Repayment schedule, if applicable.

    (9) The hearing official's decision will be the final Agency action for the purposes of judicial review under the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 701 ).

    (f)  (1) Under certain circumstances, a waiver of a claim against an employee of GSA arising out of an erroneous payment of pay, allowances, travel, transportation, or relocation expenses and allowances may be granted in whole or in part.

    (2) GSA procedures for waiving a claim of erroneous payment of pay and allowances can be found in GSA Order CFO 4200.1, “Waiver of Claims for Overpayment of Pay and Allowances”.

    (3) GSA will follow the procedures of 5 U.S.C. 5584 when considering a request for waiver of erroneous payment of travel, transportation, or relocation expenses and allowances.

    § 105-55.012   Contracting with private collection contractors and with entities that locate and recover unclaimed assets.

#### § § 105-55.012

    (a) Subject to the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section, the General Services Administration (GSA) may contract with private collection contractors, as defined in 31 U.S.C. 3701(f), to recover delinquent debts provided that—

    (1) GSA retain the authority to resolve disputes, compromise debts, suspend or terminate collection activity, and refer debts for litigation;

    (2) The private collection contractor is not allowed to offer the debtor, as an incentive for payment, the opportunity to pay the debt less the private collection contractor's fee unless GSA has granted such authority prior to the offer;

    (3) The contract provides that the private collection contractor is subject to the Privacy Act of 1974 to the extent specified in 5 U.S.C. 552a(m), and to applicable Federal and state laws and regulations pertaining to debt collection practices, including but not limited to the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, 15 U.S.C. 1692; and

    (4) The private collection contractor is required to account for all amounts collected.

    (b) GSA will use Governmentwide debt collection contracts to obtain debt collection services provided by private collection contractors. However, GSA may refer debts to private collection contractors pursuant to a contract between the Agency and the private collection contractor only if such debts are not subject to the requirement to transfer debts to Treasury for debt collection. See 31 U.S.C. 3711(g); 31 CFR 285.12(e).

    (c) GSA may fund private collection contractor contracts in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3718(b), or as otherwise permitted by law.

    (d) GSA may enter into contracts for locating and recovering assets of the United States, such as unclaimed assets.

    (e) GSA may enter into contracts for debtor asset and income search reports. In accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3718(b), such contracts may provide that the fee a contractor charges the Agency for such services may be payable from the amounts recovered, unless otherwise prohibited by statute.

    § 105-55.013   Suspension or revocation of eligibility for loans and loan guaranties, licenses, permits, or privileges.

#### § § 105-55.013

    (a) Unless waived by the Administrator, the General Services Administration (GSA) will not extend financial assistance in the form of a loan, loan guarantee, or loan insurance to any person delinquent on a non-tax debt owed to a Federal agency. This prohibition does not apply to disaster loans. The authority to waive the application of this section may be delegated to the Chief Financial Officer and re-delegated only to the Deputy Chief Financial Officer of GSA. GSA may extend credit after the delinquency has been resolved. The Secretary may exempt classes of debts from this prohibition and has prescribed standards defining when a “delinquency” is “resolved” for purposes of this prohibition. See 31 CFR 285.13.

    (b) In non-bankruptcy cases, GSA, when seeking the collection of statutory penalties, forfeitures, or other types of claims, will consider the suspension or revocation of licenses, permits, or other privileges for any inexcusable or willful failure of a debtor to pay such a debt in accordance with GSA regulations or governing procedures. The debtor will be advised in GSA's written demand for payment of the Agency's ability to suspend or revoke licenses, permits, or privileges. If GSA makes, guarantees, insures, acquires, or participates in loans, the Agency will consider suspending or disqualifying any lender, contractor, or broker from doing further business with the Agency or engaging in programs sponsored by the Agency if such lender, contractor, or broker fails to pay its debts to the Government within a reasonable time or if such lender, contractor, or broker has been suspended, debarred, or disqualified from participation in a program or activity by another Federal agency. The failure of any surety to honor its obligations in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 9305 will be reported to the Treasury. The Treasury will forward notification to all interested agencies that a surety's certificate of authority to do business with the Government has been revoked by the Treasury.

    (c) The suspension or revocation of licenses, permits, or privileges also may extend to GSA programs or activities administered by the states on behalf of GSA, to the extent they affect GSA's ability to collect money or funds owed by debtors.

    (d) In bankruptcy cases, before advising the debtor of GSA's intention to suspend or revoke licenses, permits, or privileges, the Agency will ascertain the impact of the Bankruptcy Code, particularly 11 U.S.C. 362 and 525, which may restrict such action.

    § 105-55.014   Liquidation of collateral.

#### § § 105-55.014

    (a) The General Services Administration (GSA) will liquidate security or collateral through the exercise of a power of sale in the security instrument or a non-judicial foreclosure, and apply the proceeds to the applicable debt(s), if the debtor fails to pay the debt(s) within a reasonable time after demand and if such action is in the best interest of the United States. Collection from other sources, including liquidation of security or collateral, is not a prerequisite to requiring payment by a surety, insurer, or guarantor unless such action is expressly required by statute or contract.

    (b) When GSA learns a bankruptcy petition has been filed with respect to a debtor, the Agency will ascertain the impact of the Bankruptcy Code, including, but not limited to, 11 U.S.C. 362, to determine the applicability of the automatic stay and the procedures for obtaining relief from such stay prior to proceeding under paragraph (a) of this section.

    § 105-55.015   Collection in installments.

#### § § 105-55.015

    (a) Whenever feasible, the General Services Administration (GSA) will collect the total amount of a debt in one lump sum. If a debtor is financially unable to pay a debt in one lump sum, GSA may accept payment in regular installments. GSA may obtain financial statements from debtors who represent they are unable to pay in one lump sum and independently verify such representations whenever possible (see § 105-55.020(g)). When GSA agrees to accept payments in regular installments, a legally enforceable written agreement from the debtor will be obtained specifying all of the terms of the arrangement and containing a provision accelerating the debt in the event of default. If the debtor's financial statement discloses the ownership of assets which are free and clear of liens or security interests, or assets in which the debtor owns an equity, the debtor may be asked to secure the payment of an installment note by executing a Security Agreement and Financing Statement transferring to the United States a security interest in the asset until the debt is paid.

    (b) The size and frequency of installment payments will bear a reasonable relation to the size of the debt and the debtor's ability to pay. The installment payments will be sufficient in size and frequency to liquidate the debt in three years or less, unless circumstances warrant a longer period.

    (c) Security for deferred payments may be obtained in appropriate cases. GSA may accept installment payments notwithstanding the refusal of the debtor to execute a written agreement or to give security, at the Agency's option.

    § 105-55.016   Interest, penalties, and administrative costs.

#### § § 105-55.016

    (a) Except as provided in paragraphs (g), (h), and (i) of this section, the General Services Administration (GSA) will charge interest, penalties, and administrative costs on debts owed to the United States pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3717. GSA will send by U.S. mail, overnight delivery service, or hand-delivery a written notice to the debtor, at the debtor's most recent address available to the Agency, explaining the Agency's requirements concerning these charges, except where these requirements are included in a contractual or repayment agreement. These charges will continue to accrue until the debt is paid in full or otherwise resolved through compromise, termination, or waiver of the charges.

    (b) GSA will charge interest on debts owed the United States as follows:

    (1) Interest will accrue from the date of delinquency, or as otherwise provided by law.

    (2) Unless otherwise established in a contract, repayment agreement, or by statute, the rate of interest charged will be the rate established annually by the Secretary in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3717(a)(1). Pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3717, GSA may charge a higher rate of interest if it is reasonably determined that a higher rate is necessary to protect the rights of the United States. GSA will document the reason(s) for a determination that the higher rate is necessary.

    (3) The rate of interest, as initially charged, will remain fixed for the duration of the indebtedness. When a debtor defaults on a repayment agreement and seeks to enter into a new agreement, GSA may require payment of interest at a new rate that reflects the Current Value of Funds Rate (CVFR) at the time the new agreement is executed. Interest will not be compounded, that is, interest will not be charged on interest, penalties, or administrative costs required by this section. If a debtor defaults on a previous repayment agreement, charges that accrued but were not collected under the defaulted agreement will be added to the principal under the new repayment agreement.

    (c) GSA will assess administrative costs incurred for processing and handling delinquent debts. The calculation of administrative costs will be based on actual costs incurred or upon estimated costs as determined by the Agency.

    (d) Unless otherwise established in a contract, repayment agreement, or by statute, GSA will charge a penalty, pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3717(e)(2), not to exceed six percent a year on the amount due on a debt that is delinquent for more than 90 days. This charge will accrue from the date of delinquency.

    (e) GSA may increase an “administrative debt” by the cost of living adjustment in lieu of charging interest and penalties under this section. “Administrative debt” includes, but is not limited to, a debt based on fines, penalties, and overpayments, but does not include a debt based on the extension of Government credit, such as those arising from loans and loan guaranties. The cost of living adjustment is the percentage by which the Consumer Price Index for the month of June of the calendar year preceding the adjustment exceeds the Consumer Price Index for the month of June of the calendar year in which the debt was determined or last adjusted. Increases to administrative debts will be computed annually. GSA will use this alternative only when there is a legitimate reason to do so, such as when calculating interest and penalties on a debt would be extremely difficult because of the age of the debt.

    (f) When a debt is paid in partial or installment payments, amounts received by GSA will be applied first to outstanding penalties, second to administrative charges, third to interest, and last to principal.

    (g) GSA will waive the collection of interest, penalty and administrative charges imposed pursuant to this section on the portion of the debt that is paid within 30 days after the date on which interest began to accrue. GSA may extend this 30-day period on a case-by-case basis. In addition, GSA may waive interest, penalties, and administrative costs charged under this section, in whole or in part, without regard to the amount of the debt, either under the criteria set forth in these standards for the compromise of debts, or if the Agency determines that collection of these charges resulted from Agency error, is against equity and good conscience, or is not in the best interest of the United States.

    (h) Unless a statute or regulation specifically prohibits collection, interest, penalties and administrative costs will continue to accrue for periods during which collection activity has been suspended pending Agency review or waiver consideration.

    (i) GSA is authorized to impose interest and related charges on debts not subject to 31 U.S.C. 3717, in accordance with the common law.

    § 105-55.017   Use and disclosure of mailing addresses.

#### § § 105-55.017

    (a) When attempting to locate a debtor in order to collect or compromise a debt under this part or other authority, the General Services Administration (GSA) may send a request to the Secretary (or designee) to obtain a debtor's mailing address from the records of the Internal Revenue Service.

    (b) GSA is authorized to use mailing addresses obtained under paragraph (a) of this section to enforce collection of a delinquent debt and may disclose such mailing addresses to other agencies and to collection agencies for collection purposes.

    § 105-55.018   Exemptions.

#### § § 105-55.018

    (a) The preceding sections of this part, to the extent they reflect remedies or procedures prescribed by the Debt Collection Act of 1982 and the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996, such as administrative offset, use of credit bureaus, contracting for collection agencies, and interest and related charges, do not apply to debts arising under, or payments made under, the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (26 U.S.C. 1 ); the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 301 ), except to the extent provided under 42 U.S.C. 404 and 31 U.S.C. 3716(c); or the tariff laws of the United States. These remedies and procedures, however, may be authorized with respect to debts that are exempt from the Debt Collection Act of 1982 and the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996, to the extent they are authorized under some other statute or the common law.

    (b) Claims arising from the audit of transportation accounts pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3726 will be determined, collected, compromised, terminated or settled in accordance with regulation published under the authority of 31 U.S.C. 3726 (see 41 CFR part 101-41, administered by the Director, Office of Transportation Audits) and are otherwise exempted from this part.

    § 105-55.019   Compromise of claims.

#### § § 105-55.019

    (a) The standards set forth in this section apply to the compromise of debts pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3711. The General Services Administration (GSA) may exercise such compromise authority for debts arising out of activities of, or referred or transferred for collection services to, the Agency when the amount of the debt then due, exclusive of interest, penalties, and administrative costs, does not exceed $100,000 or any higher amount authorized by the Attorney General. The Administrator may designate other GSA officials to exercise the authorities in this section.

    (b) Unless otherwise provided by law, when the principal balance of a debt, exclusive of interest, penalties, and administrative costs, exceeds $100,000 or any higher amount authorized by the Attorney General, the authority to accept the compromise rests with the Department of Justice. GSA will evaluate the compromise offer, using the factors set forth in § 105-55.020. If an offer to compromise any debt in excess of $100,000 is acceptable to the Agency, GSA will refer the debt to the Civil Division or other appropriate litigating division in the Department of Justice using a Claims Collection Litigation Report. The referral will include appropriate financial information and a recommendation for the acceptance of the compromise offer. Justice Department approval is not required if GSA rejects a compromise offer.

    § 105-55.020   Bases for compromise.

#### § § 105-55.020

    (a) The General Services Administration (GSA) may compromise a debt if the full amount cannot be collected because—

    (1) The debtor is unable to pay the full amount in a reasonable time, as verified through credit reports or other financial information.

    (2) GSA is unable to collect the debt in full within a reasonable time by enforced collection proceedings.

    (3) The cost of collecting the debt does not justify the enforced collection of the full amount.

    (4) There is significant doubt concerning the Government's ability to prove its case in court.

    (b) In determining the debtor's inability to pay, GSA will consider relevant factors such as the following:

    (1) Age and health of the debtor.

    (2) Present and potential income.

    (3) Inheritance prospects.

    (4) The possibility that assets have been concealed or improperly transferred by the debtor.

    (5) The availability of assets or income that may be realized by enforced collection proceedings.

    (c) GSA will verify the debtor's claim of inability to pay by using a credit report and other financial information as provided in paragraph (g) of this section. GSA will consider the applicable exemptions available to the debtor under State and Federal law in determining the Government's ability to enforce collection. GSA also may consider uncertainty as to the price that collateral or other property will bring at a forced sale in determining the Government's ability to enforce collection. A compromise effected under this section will be for an amount that bears a reasonable relation to the amount that can be recovered by enforced collection procedures, with regard to the exemptions available to the debtor and the time that collection will take.

    (d) If there is significant doubt concerning the Government's ability to prove its case in court for the full amount claimed, either because of the legal issues involved or because of a bona fide dispute as to the facts, then the amount accepted in compromise of such cases will fairly reflect the probabilities of successful prosecution to judgment, with due regard given to the availability of witnesses and other evidentiary support for the Government's claim. In determining the litigative risks involved, GSA will consider the probable amount of court costs and attorney fees pursuant to the Equal Access to Justice Act, 28 U.S.C. 2412 that may be imposed against the Government if it is unsuccessful in litigation.

    (e) GSA may compromise a debt if the cost of collecting the debt does not justify the enforced collection of the full amount. The amount accepted in compromise in such cases may reflect an appropriate discount for the administrative and litigative costs of collection, with consideration given to the time it will take to effect collection. Collection costs may be a substantial factor in the settlement of small debts. In determining whether the cost of collection justifies enforced collection of the full amount, GSA will consider whether continued collection of the debt, regardless of cost, is necessary to further an enforcement principle, such as the Government's willingness to pursue aggressively defaulting and uncooperative debtors.

    (f) GSA generally will not accept compromises payable in installments. This is not an advantageous form of compromise in terms of time and administrative expense. If, however, payment of a compromise in installments is necessary, GSA will obtain a legally enforceable written agreement providing that, in the event of default, the full original principal balance of the debt prior to compromise, less sums paid thereon, is reinstated. Whenever possible, GSA will obtain security for repayment in the manner set forth in § 105-55.015.

    (g) To assess the merits of a compromise offer based in whole or in part on the debtor's inability to pay the full amount of a debt within a reasonable time, GSA may obtain a current financial statement from the debtor, executed under penalty of perjury, showing the debtor's assets, liabilities, income and expenses. GSA also may obtain credit reports or other financial information to assess compromise offers. GSA may use their own financial information form or may request suitable forms from the Department of Justice or the local United States Attorney's Office.

    § 105-55.021   Enforcement policy.

#### § § 105-55.021

    Pursuant to this section, the General Services Administration may compromise statutory penalties, forfeitures, or claims established as an aid to enforcement and to compel compliance, if the Agency's enforcement policy in terms of deterrence and securing compliance, present and future, will be adequately served by the Agency's acceptance of the sum to be agreed upon.

    § 105-55.022   Joint and several liability.

#### § § 105-55.022

    (a) When two or more debtors are jointly and severally liable, the General Services Administration (GSA) may pursue collection activity against all debtors, as appropriate. GSA will not attempt to allocate the burden of payment between the debtors but will proceed to liquidate the indebtedness as quickly as possible.

    (b) GSA will ensure that a compromise agreement with one debtor does not release the Agency's claim against the remaining debtors. The amount of a compromise with one debtor will not be considered a precedent or binding in determining the amount that will be required from other debtors jointly and severally liable on the claim.

    § 105-55.023   Further review of compromise offers.

#### § § 105-55.023

    If the General Services Administration (GSA) is uncertain whether to accept a firm, written, substantive compromise offer on a debt that is within the Agency's delegated compromise authority, it may refer the offer to the Civil Division or other appropriate litigating division in the Department of Justice (DOJ), using a Claims Collection Litigation Report accompanied by supporting data and particulars concerning the debt. DOJ may act upon such an offer or return it to GSA with instructions or advice.

    § 105-55.024   Consideration of tax consequences to the Government.

#### § § 105-55.024

    In negotiating a compromise, the General Services Administration (GSA) may consider the tax consequences to the Government. In particular, GSA may consider requiring a waiver of tax-loss-carry-forward and tax-loss-carry-back rights of the debtor. For information on discharge of indebtedness reporting requirements see § 105-55.030.

    § 105-55.025   Mutual releases of the debtor and the Government.

#### § § 105-55.025

    In all appropriate instances, a compromise that is accepted by the General Services Administration may be implemented by means of a mutual release, in which the debtor is released from further non-tax liability on the compromised debt in consideration of payment in full of the compromise amount and the Government and its officials, past and present, are released and discharged from any and all claims and causes of action arising from the same transaction that the debtor may have. In the event a mutual release is not executed when a debt is compromised, unless prohibited by law, the debtor is still deemed to have waived any and all claims and causes of action against the Government and its officials related to the transaction giving rise to the compromised debt.

    § 105-55.026   Suspending or terminating collection activity.

#### § § 105-55.026

    (a) The standards set forth in §§ 105-55.027 and 105-55.028 apply to the suspension or termination of collection activity pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3711 on debts that do not exceed $100,000, or such other amount as the Attorney General may direct, exclusive of interest, penalties, and administrative costs, after deducting the amount of partial payments or collections, if any. Prior to referring a debt to the Department of Justice (DOJ) for litigation, the General Services Administration (GSA) may suspend or terminate collection under this part with respect to debts arising out of activities of, or referred or transferred for collection services to, the Agency.

    (b) If, after deducting the amount of any partial payments or collections, the principal amount of a debt exceeds $100,000, or such other amount as the Attorney General may direct, exclusive of interest, penalties, and administrative costs, the authority to suspend or terminate rests solely with DOJ. If GSA believes suspension or termination of any debt in excess of $100,000 may be appropriate, the Agency will refer the debt to the Civil Division or other appropriate litigating division in DOJ, using the Claims Collection Litigation Report. The referral will specify the reasons for the Agency's recommendation. If, prior to referral to DOJ, GSA determines a debt is plainly erroneous or clearly without legal merit, the Agency may terminate collection activity regardless of the amount involved without obtaining DOJ concurrence.

    § 105-55.027   Suspension of collection activity.

#### § § 105-55.027

    (a) The General Services Administration (GSA) may suspend collection activity on a debt when—

    (1) The Agency cannot locate the debtor;

    (2) The debtor's financial condition is expected to improve; or

    (3) The debtor has requested a waiver or review of the debt.

    (b) Based on the current financial condition of the debtor, GSA may suspend collection activity on a debt when the debtor's future prospects justify retention of the debt for periodic review and collection activity and—

    (1) The applicable statute of limitations has not expired; or

    (2) Future collection can be effected by administrative offset, notwithstanding the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations for litigation of claims, with due regard to the 10-year limitation for administrative offset prescribed by 31 U.S.C. 3716(e)(1); or

    (3) The debtor agrees to pay interest on the amount of the debt on which collection will be suspended, and such suspension is likely to enhance the debtor's ability to pay the full amount of the principal of the debt with interest at a later date.

    (c)(1) GSA will suspend collection activity during the time required for consideration of the debtor's request for waiver or administrative review of the debt if the statute under which the request is sought prohibits the Agency from collecting the debt during that time.

    (2) If the statute under which the request is sought does not prohibit collection activity pending consideration of the request, GSA will use discretion, on a case-by-case basis, to suspend collection. Further, GSA ordinarily will suspend collection action upon a request for waiver or review if the Agency is prohibited by statute or regulation from issuing a refund of amounts collected prior to Agency consideration of the debtor's request. However, GSA will not suspend collection when the Agency determines the request for waiver or review is frivolous or was made primarily to delay collection.

    (d) When GSA learns a bankruptcy petition has been filed with respect to a debtor, in most cases the collection activity on a debt will be suspended, pursuant to the provisions of 11 U.S.C. 362, 1201, and 1301, unless the Agency can clearly establish the automatic stay has been lifted or is no longer in effect. GSA will, if legally permitted, take the necessary legal steps to ensure no funds or money are paid by the Agency to the debtor until relief from the automatic stay is obtained.

    § 105-55.028   Termination of collection activity.

#### § § 105-55.028

    (a) The General Services Administration (GSA) may terminate collection activity when—

    (1) The Agency is unable to collect any substantial amount through its own efforts or through the efforts of others;

    (2) The Agency is unable to locate the debtor;

    (3) Costs of collection are anticipated to exceed the amount recoverable;

    (4) The debt is legally without merit or enforcement of the debt is barred by any applicable statute of limitations;

    (5) The debt cannot be substantiated; or

    (6) The debt against the debtor has been discharged in bankruptcy.

    (b) Before terminating collection activity, GSA will pursue all appropriate means of collection and determine, based upon the results of the collection activity, that the debt is uncollectible. Termination of collection activity ceases active collection of the debt. The termination of collection activity does not preclude GSA from retaining a record of the account for purposes of—

    (1) Selling the debt, if the Secretary determines that such sale is in the best interests of the United States;

    (2) Pursuing collection at a subsequent date in the event there is a change in the debtor's status or a new collection tool becomes available;

    (3) Offsetting against future income or assets not available at the time of termination of collection activity; or

    (4) Screening future applicants of loans and loan guaranties, licenses, permits, or privileges for prior indebtedness.

    (c) Generally, GSA will terminate collection activity on a debt that has been discharged in bankruptcy, regardless of the amount. GSA may continue collection activity, however, subject to the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code, for any payments provided under a plan of reorganization. Offset and recoupment rights may survive the discharge of the debtor in bankruptcy and, under some circumstances, claims also may survive the discharge. For example, the claims of GSA that it is a known creditor of a debtor may survive a discharge if the Agency did not receive formal notice of the proceedings.

    § 105-55.029   Exception to termination.

#### § § 105-55.029

    When a significant enforcement policy is involved, or recovery of a judgment is a prerequisite to the imposition of administrative sanctions, the General Services Administration may refer debts for litigation even though termination of collection activity may otherwise be appropriate.

    § 105-55.030   Discharge of indebtedness; reporting requirements.

#### § § 105-55.030

    (a) Before discharging a delinquent debt (also referred to as a close out of the debt), the General Services Administration (GSA) will take all appropriate steps to collect the debt in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3711(g), including, as applicable, administrative offset, tax refund offset, Federal salary offset, referral to Treasury, Treasury-designated debt collection centers or private collection contractors, credit bureau reporting, wage garnishment, litigation, and foreclosure. Discharge of indebtedness is distinct from termination or suspension of collection activity and is governed by the Internal Revenue Code. When collection action on a debt is suspended or terminated, the debt remains delinquent and further collection action may be pursued at a later date in accordance with the standards set forth in this part. When GSA discharges a debt in full or in part, further collection action is prohibited. Therefore, GSA will make the determination that collection action is no longer warranted before discharging a debt. Before discharging a debt, GSA will terminate debt collection action.

    (b) Section 3711(i), Title 31, United States Code, requires GSA to sell a delinquent non-tax debt upon termination of collection action if the Secretary determines such a sale is in the best interests of the United States. Since the discharge of a debt precludes any further collection action (including the sale of a delinquent debt), GSA may not discharge a debt until the requirements of 31 U.S.C. 3711(i) have been met.

    (c) Upon discharge of a debt of more than $600, GSA must report the discharge to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in accordance with the requirements of 26 U.S.C. 6050P and 26 CFR 1.6050P-1. GSA may request Treasury or Treasury-designated debt collection centers to file such a discharge report to the IRS on the Agency's behalf.

    (d) When discharging a debt, GSA will request the GSA Office of General Counsel to release any liens of record securing the debt.

    § 105-55.031   Prompt referral to the Department of Justice.

#### § § 105-55.031

    (a) The General Services Administration (GSA) will promptly refer to the Department of Justice (DOJ) for litigation debts on which aggressive collection activity has been taken in accordance with § 105-55.009 and that cannot be compromised, or on which collection activity cannot be suspended or terminated, in accordance with §§ 105-55.027 and 105-55.028. GSA may refer those debts arising out of activities of, or referred or transferred for collection services to, the Agency. Debts for which the principal amount is over $1,000,000, or such other amount as the Attorney General may direct, exclusive of interest and penalties, will be referred to the Civil Division or other division responsible for litigating such debts at DOJ, Washington, DC. Debts for which the principal amount is $1,000,000, or less, or such other amount as the Attorney General may direct, exclusive of interest or penalties, will be referred to DOJ's Nationwide Central Intake Facility as required by the Claims Collection Litigation Report instructions. Debts will be referred as early as possible, consistent with aggressive GSA collection activity and the observance of the standards contained in this part, and, in any event, well within the period for initiating timely lawsuits against the debtors. GSA will make every effort to refer delinquent debts to DOJ for litigation within one year of the date such debts last became delinquent. In the case of guaranteed or insured loans, GSA will make every effort to refer these delinquent debts to DOJ for litigation within one year from the date the loan was presented to the Agency for payment or re-insurance.

    (b) DOJ has exclusive jurisdiction over the debts referred to it pursuant to this section. GSA, as the referring agency, will immediately terminate the use of any administrative collection activities to collect a debt at the time of the referral of that debt to DOJ. GSA will advise DOJ of the collection activities which have been utilized to date, and their result. GSA will refrain from having any contact with the debtor and will direct all debtor inquiries concerning the debt to DOJ, except as otherwise agreed between GSA and DOJ. GSA will immediately notify DOJ of any payments credited by the Agency to the debtor's account after referral of a debt under this section. DOJ will notify GSA of any payments it receives from the debtor.

    § 105-55.032   Claims Collection Litigation Report.

#### § § 105-55.032

    (a) Unless excepted by the Department of Justice (DOJ), the General Services Administration (GSA) will complete the Claims Collection Litigation Report (CCLR) (see § 105-55.019(b)), accompanied by a signed Certificate of Indebtedness, to refer all administratively uncollectible claims to DOJ for litigation. GSA will complete all sections of the CCLR appropriate to each claim as required by the CCLR instructions and furnish such other information as may be required in specific cases.

    (b) GSA will indicate clearly on the CCLR the actions DOJ should take with respect to the referred claim. The CCLR permits the Agency to indicate specifically any of a number of litigative activities which DOJ may pursue, including enforced collection, judgment lien only, renew judgment lien only, renew judgment lien and enforce collection, program enforcement, foreclosure only, and foreclosure and deficiency judgment.

    (c) GSA also will use the CCLR to refer claims to DOJ to obtain approval of any proposals to compromise the claims or to suspend or terminate Agency collection activity.

    § 105-55.033   Preservation of evidence.

#### § § 105-55.033

    The General Services Administration (GSA) will take care to preserve all files and records that may be needed by the Department of Justice (DOJ) to prove their claims in court. GSA ordinarily will include certified copies of the documents that form the basis for the claim in the packages referring their claims to DOJ for litigation. GSA will provide originals of such documents immediately upon request by DOJ.

    § 105-55.034   Minimum amount of referrals to the Department of Justice.

#### § § 105-55.034

    (a) The General Services Administration (GSA) will not refer for litigation claims of less than $2,500, exclusive of interest, penalties, and administrative costs, or such other amount as the Attorney General shall from time to time prescribe. The Department of Justice (DOJ) will notify GSA if the Attorney General changes this minimum amount.

    (b) GSA will not refer claims of less than the minimum amount unless—

    (1) Litigation to collect such smaller claims is important to ensure compliance with the Agency's policies or programs;

    (2) The claim is being referred solely for the purpose of securing a judgment against the debtor, which will be filed as a lien against the debtor's property pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 3201 and returned to GSA for enforcement; or

    (3) The debtor has the clear ability to pay the claim and the Government effectively can enforce payment, with due regard for the exemptions available to the debtor under State and Federal law and the judicial remedies available to the Government.

    (c) GSA will consult with the Financial Litigation Staff of the Executive Office for United States Attorneys in DOJ prior to referring claims valued at less than the minimum amount.

      § 105-56.001   Scope.

#### § § 105-56.001

      (a) This subpart covers internal GSA collections under 5 U.S.C. 5514. It applies when certain debts to the United States are recovered by administrative offset from the disposable pay of a GSA employee or a cross-serviced agency employee, except in situations where the employee consents to the recovery.

      (b) The collection of any amount under this subpart will be in accordance with the standards promulgated pursuant to the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996 (DCIA), 31 U.S.C. 3701  and the Federal Claims Collection Standards, 31 CFR parts 900 through 904 as amended, or in accordance with any other statutory authority for the collection of claims of the United States or any Federal agency.

      § 105-56.002   Excluded debts or claims.

#### § § 105-56.002

      This subpart does not apply to the following:

      (a) Debts or claims arising under the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 as amended (26 U.S.C. 1 ), the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 301 ), or the tariff laws of the United States.

      (b) Any case where collection of a debt by salary offset is explicitly provided for or prohibited by another statute. Debt collection procedures under other statutory authorities, however, must be consistent with the provisions of the Federal Claims Collection Standards, defined at paragraph (h) of § 105-56.003.

      (c) An employee election of coverage or of a change of coverage under a Federal benefits program that requires periodic deductions from pay if the amount to be recovered was accumulated over four pay periods or less. However, if the amount to be recovered was accumulated over more than four pay periods, the procedures under § 105-56.004 of this subpart will apply.

      (d) Routine adjustment in pay or allowances that is made to correct an overpayment of pay attributable to clerical or administrative errors or delays in processing pay documents, if the overpayment occurred within the four pay periods preceding the adjustment and, at the time of the adjustment, or as soon after as possible, the employee is provided written notice of the nature and amount of the adjustment.

      (e) Any adjustment to collect a debt amounting to $50 or less, if, at the time of the adjustment, or as soon after as possible, the employee is given written notice of the nature and amount of the adjustment and a point of contact for contesting the adjustment.

      (f) Debts or claims arising from the accrual of unpaid Health Benefits Insurance (HBI) premiums as the result of an employee's election to continue health insurance coverage during periods of leave without pay (LWOP), or when pay is insufficient to cover premiums. Debt collection procedures for unpaid HBI are covered under 5 CFR part 890, subpart E.

#### § § 105-56.004

      An employee must be given written notice from the appropriate program official at least 30 days in advance of initiating a deduction from disposable pay informing him or her of—

      (k) The issuance of a final decision on the hearing, if requested, at the earliest practicable date, but no later than 60 days after the request for hearing is filed, unless the employee requests and the hearing official grants a delay in the proceedings;

      (l) The risk that any knowingly false or frivolous statements, representations, or evidence may subject the employee to—

      § 105-56.005   Employee response.

#### § § 105-56.005

      (a)  An employee may submit a request to the appropriate program official who signed the pre-offset notice to enter into a written repayment agreement of the debt in lieu of offset. The request must be made within 7 days of receipt of notice under § 105-56.004 of this subpart. The agreement must be in writing, signed by both the employee and the appropriate program official making the notice, and a signed copy must be sent to the appropriate Finance Center serving the program activity. Acceptance of such an agreement is discretionary with the Agency. An employee who enters into such an agreement may, nevertheless, seek a waiver under paragraph (b) of this section.

      (b)  An employee may submit a signed waiver request of overpayment of pay or allowances (e.g., 5 U.S.C. 5584, 10 U.S.C. 2774, or 32 U.S.C. 716) to the GSA National Payroll Center (NPC). When an employee requests waiver consideration, further collection on the debt may be suspended until a final administrative decision is made on the waiver request. During the period of any suspension, interest, penalties and administrative charges may be held in abeyance. GSA will not duplicate, for purposes of salary offset, any of the notices/procedures already provided the debtor prior to a request for waiver.

      (c)  (1) An employee may seek a reconsideration of GSA's determination regarding the existence and/or amount of the debt. The request must be submitted to the appropriate program official indicated in the pre-offset notice, within 7 days of receipt of notice under § 105-56.004 of this subpart. Within 20 days of receipt of this notice, the employee must submit a detailed statement of reasons for reconsideration that must be accompanied by supporting documentation.

      (2) An employee may request a reconsideration of the proposed offset schedule. The request must be submitted to the appropriate program official indicated in the pre-offset notice, within 7 days of receipt of notice under § 105-56.004 of this subpart. Within 20 days of receipt of this notice, the employee must submit an alternative repayment schedule accompanied by a detailed statement, supported by documentation, evidencing financial hardship resulting from GSA's proposed schedule. Acceptance of the request is at GSA's discretion. GSA will notify the employee in writing of its decision concerning the request to reduce the rate of an involuntary deduction.

      § 105-56.006   Petition for pre-offset hearing.

#### § § 105-56.006

      (a) The employee may request a pre-offset hearing by filing a written petition with the appropriate program official indicated in the pre-offset notice, within 15 days of receipt of the written notice. The petition must state why the employee believes GSA's determination concerning the existence and/or amount of the debt is in error, set forth any objections to the involuntary repayment schedule, and, if the employee is seeking an oral hearing, set forth reasons for an oral hearing. The timely filing of a petition will suspend the commencement of collection proceedings.

      (b) The employee's petition or statement must be signed and dated by the employee.

      (c) Petitions for hearing made after the expiration of the 15-day period may be accepted if the employee can show that the delay was because of circumstances beyond his or her control or because of failure to receive notice of the time limit.

      (d) If the employee timely requests a pre-offset hearing or the timeliness is waived, the appropriate program official must—

      (1) Promptly notify the CBCA and arrange for a hearing official (see § 105-56.003(m) of this subpart). The hearing official will notify the employee whether he or she may have an oral or a “paper hearing,” i.e., a review on the written record (see 31 CFR 901.3(e)); and

      (2) Provide the hearing official with a copy of all records on which the determination of the debt and any involuntary repayment schedule are based.

      (e) If an oral hearing is to be held, the hearing official will notify the appropriate program official and the employee of the date, time, and location of the hearing. The debtor may choose to have the hearing conducted in the hearing official's office located at 1800 M Street NW., 6th Floor, Washington, DC 20036, at another location designated by the hearing official, or by telephone. The debtor and any witnesses are responsible for any personal expenses incurred to arrive at a hearing official's office or other designated location (see § 105-56.007(c)). All telephonic charges incurred during a hearing will be the responsibility of GSA.

      (f) If the employee later elects to have the hearing based only on the written submissions, notification must be given to the hearing official and the appropriate program official at least 3 days before the date of the oral hearing. The hearing official may waive the 3-day requirement for good cause.

      (g) If either party, without good cause as determined by the hearing official, does not appear at a scheduled oral hearing, the hearing official will make a determination on the claim which takes into account that party's position as presented in writing only.

      § 105-56.007   Pre-offset oral hearing.

#### § § 105-56.007

      (a) The Agency, represented by the appropriate program official or a representative of the Office of General Counsel, and the employee, and/or his or her representative, will explain their case in the form of an oral presentation with reference to the documentation submitted. The employee may testify on his or her own behalf, subject to cross-examination. Other witnesses may be called to testify when the hearing official determines the testimony to be relevant and not redundant. All witnesses will testify under oath, with the oath having been administered by the hearing official. A written transcript of the hearing will be kept and made available to either party in the event of an appeal under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 701-706. Arrangements for the taking of the transcript will be made by the hearing official, and all charges associated with the taking of the transcript will be the responsibility of GSA.

      (b) The hearing official will—

      (1) Conduct a fair and impartial hearing; and

      (2) Preside over the course of the hearing, maintain decorum, and avoid delay in the disposition of the hearing.

      (c) The employee may represent himself or herself or may be represented by another person of his or her choice at the hearing. GSA will not compensate the employee for representation expenses, including hourly fees for attorneys, travel expenses, and costs for reproducing documents.

      (d) Oral hearings are open to the public. However, the hearing official may close all or any portion of the hearing when doing so is in the best interests of the employee or the Agency.

      (e) Oral hearings may be conducted by telephone at the request of the employee. All telephonic charges incurred during a hearing will be the responsibility of GSA.

      (f) The hearing official may request written submissions and documentation from the employee and the Agency, in addition to considering evidence offered at the hearing.

      § 105-56.008   Pre-offset paper hearing.

#### § § 105-56.008

      If a hearing is to be held only upon written submissions, the hearing official will issue a decision based upon the record and responses submitted by both the Agency and the employee. See § 105-56.006 of this subpart. If either party, without good cause as determined by the hearing official, does not provide written submissions and documentation requested by the hearing official, the hearing official will make a determination on the claim without reference to such submissions and documentation.

      § 105-56.009   Written decision.

#### § § 105-56.009

      (a) Within 60 days of the employee's filing of a petition for a pre-offset hearing, the hearing official will issue a written decision setting forth—

      (1) The facts supporting the nature and origin of the debt;

      (2) The hearing official's analysis, findings and conclusions as to the employee's or Agency's grounds;

      (3) The amount and validity of the debt; and

      (4) The repayment schedule, if applicable.

      (b) The hearing official's decision will be the final Agency action for the purposes of judicial review under the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 701 ).

      § 105-56.010   Deductions.

#### § § 105-56.010

      (a)  Deductions may begin upon the issuance of an Agency decision on a request for reconsideration or waiver (except as provided in § 105-56.005(b) of this subpart) or the issuance of a decision in a pre-offset hearing. In no event will deductions begin sooner than thirty days from the date of the notice letter. If the employee filed a petition for hearing with the appropriate program official before the expiration of the period provided for in § 105-56.006 of this subpart, then deductions will begin after the hearing official has provided the employee with a hearing and the final written decision. The appropriate program official will coordinate with the National Payroll Center to begin offset in accordance with the final written decision.

      (b)  If the employee retires, resigns, or is terminated before collection of the indebtedness is completed, the remaining indebtedness will be offset from any subsequent payments of any nature. If the debt cannot be satisfied from subsequent payments, then the debt will be collected according to the procedures for administrative offset pursuant to § 105-55.011 of this subpart.

      (c)  A debt may be collected in one lump sum or in installments. Collection will be by lump sum unless the employee is able to demonstrate to the program official who signed the notice letter that he or she is financially unable to pay in one lump sum. In these cases, collection will be by installment deductions. Involuntary deductions from pay may not exceed 15 percent of disposable pay.

      (d)  If the debt cannot be collected in one lump sum, the debt will be collected by deductions at officially established pay intervals from an employee's current pay account, unless the employee and the appropriate program official agree to an alternative repayment schedule. The alternative arrangement must be in writing and signed by both the employee and the appropriate program official.

      (1)  Installment deductions will be made over the shortest period possible. The size and frequency of installment deductions will bear a reasonable relation to the size of the debt and the employee's ability to pay. However, the amount deducted for any period will not exceed 15 percent of the disposable pay from which the deduction is made, unless the employee has agreed in writing to the deduction of a greater amount. The installment payment normally will be sufficient in size and frequency to liquidate the debt in three (3) years or less, unless circumstances warrant a longer period. Installment payments of less than $100 per pay period will be accepted only in the most unusual circumstances.

      (2)  GSA will make salary deductions only from basic pay, special pay, incentive pay, retired pay, retainer pay, or in the case of an employee not entitled to basic pay, other authorized pay.

      (e)  The receipt of collections from salary offsets does not preclude GSA from pursuing other debt collection remedies, including the offset of other Federal payments to satisfy delinquent non-tax debt owed to the United States. GSA will pursue, when appropriate, such debt collection remedies separately or in conjunction with salary offset.

      (f)  Interest, penalties and administrative costs on debts under this subpart will be assessed according to the provisions of § 105-55.016 of this subpart.

      § 105-56.011   Non-waiver of rights.

#### § § 105-56.011

      An employee's involuntary payment of all or any portion of a debt being collected under 5 U.S.C. 5514 will not be construed as a waiver of any rights which the employee may have under 5 U.S.C. 5514 or any other provision of contract or law unless there are statutory or contractual provisions to the contrary.

      § 105-56.012   Refunds.

#### § § 105-56.012

      (a) GSA will promptly refund to the employee any amounts offset under these regulations when a debt is waived or otherwise found not owing the United States (unless expressly prohibited by statute or regulation), or GSA is directed by an administrative or judicial order to refund amounts deducted from the employee's current pay or withheld from non-salary payments.

      (b) Unless required by Federal law or contract, refunds under this subpart will not bear interest.

      § 105-56.013   Coordinating offset with another Federal agency.

#### § § 105-56.013

      GSA participates in the Centralized Salary Offset (CSO) program (see subparts B and C of this part). In those instances when CSO cannot be utilized (i.e., when another agency does not participate in the program), the following procedures apply:

      (a)  When GSA is owed a debt by an employee of another agency, GSA will provide the paying agency with a written certification that the debtor owes GSA a debt and that GSA has complied with these regulations. This certification will include the amount and basis of the debt, the due date of the payment, or the beginning date of installment payments, if any.

      (b)  (1) GSA may use salary offset against one of its employees or cross-serviced agency employees who is indebted to another agency if requested to do so by that agency. Any such request must be accompanied by a certification from the requesting agency that the person owes the debt, the amount of the debt and that the employee has been given the procedural rights required by 5 U.S.C. 5514 and 5 CFR part 550, subpart K.

      (2) The creditor agency must advise GSA of the number of installments to be collected, the amount of each installment, and the beginning date of the first installment if it is not the next established pay period.

      (3) If GSA receives an improperly completed request, the creditor agency will be requested to supply the required information before any salary offset begins.

      (4) If the claim procedures in paragraph (b)(1) of this section have been properly completed, deductions will begin on the next established pay period unless a different period is requested by the creditor agency.

      (5) GSA will not review the merits of the creditor agency's determinations with respect to the amount and/or validity of the debt as stated in the debt claim certification.

      (6) If the employee begins separation action before GSA collects the total debt due the creditor agency, the following actions will be taken:

      (i) When possible, the balance owed the creditor agency will be liquidated from subsequent payments of any nature due the employee from GSA in accordance with 41 CFR part 105-55.011;

      (ii) If the total amount of the debt cannot be recovered, GSA will certify the total amount collected to the creditor agency and the employee;

      (iii) If GSA is aware that the employee is entitled to payments from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund, or other similar payments, such information will be provided to the creditor agency so a certified claim can be made against the payments.

      (7) If the employee transfers to another Federal agency before GSA collects the total amount due the creditor agency, GSA will certify the total amount collected to the creditor agency and the employee. It is the responsibility of the creditor agency to ensure that collection action is resumed by the new employing agency.

    Subpart B—Centralized Salary Offset (CSO) Procedures—GSA as Creditor Agency

      § 105-56.014   Purpose and scope.

#### § § 105-56.014

      (a) This subpart establishes procedures for the offset of Federal salary payments, through the Financial Management Service's (FMS) administrative offset program, to collect delinquent debts owed to the Federal Government. This process is known as centralized salary offset. Rules issued by the Office of Personnel Management contain the requirements Federal agencies must follow prior to conducting salary offset and the procedures for requesting offsets directly from a paying agency. See 5 CFR parts 550.1101 through 550.1108.

      (b) This subpart implements the requirement under 5 U.S.C. 5514 (a)(1) that all Federal agencies, using a process known as centralized salary offset computer matching, identify Federal employees who owe delinquent non-tax debt to the United States. Centralized salary offset computer matching is the computerized comparison of delinquent debt records with records of Federal employees. The purpose of centralized salary offset computer matching is to identify those debtors whose Federal salaries should be offset to collect delinquent debts owed to the Federal Government.

      (c) This subpart specifies the delinquent debt records and Federal employee records that must be included in the salary offset matching process. For purposes of this subpart, delinquent debt records consist of the debt information submitted to FMS for purposes of administrative offset as required under 31 U.S.C. 3716(c)(6). Since GSA submits debts to FMS for purposes of administrative offset, the Agency is not required to submit duplicate information for purposes of centralized salary offset computer matching under 5 U.S.C. 5514(a)(1) and this subpart.

      (d) An interagency consortium was established to implement centralized salary offset computer matching on a Governmentwide basis as required under 5 U.S.C. 5514(a)(1). Federal employee records consist of records of Federal salary payments disbursed by members of the consortium.

      (e) The receipt of collections from salary offsets does not preclude GSA from pursuing other debt collection remedies, including the offset of other Federal payments to satisfy delinquent non-tax debt owed to the United States. GSA will pursue, when appropriate, such debt collection remedies separately or in conjunction with salary offset.

      § 105-56.015   Definitions.

#### § § 105-56.015

      The following definitions apply to this subpart:

For purposes of this subpart, the term “debt” does not include debts arising under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. 1 ).

      (g)  means information about a past-due, legally enforceable debt, submitted by GSA to FMS for purposes of administrative offset (including salary offset) in accordance with the provisions of 31 U.S.C. 3716(c)(6) and applicable regulations. Debt information includes the amount and type of debt and the debtor's name, address, and taxpayer identifying number.

This includes all disbursing officials of Federal salary payments, including but not limited to, disbursing officials of the Department of the Treasury, the Department of Defense, the United States Postal Service, any government corporation, and any disbursing official of the United States designated by the Secretary.

      (i)  means the amount that remains from an employee's Federal pay after required deductions for Federal, State and local income taxes; Social Security taxes, including Medicare taxes; Federal retirement programs, including contributions to the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP); premiums for life (excluding amounts deducted for supplemental coverage) and health insurance benefits; Internal Revenue Service (IRS) tax levies; and such other deductions that are required by law to be withheld.

      (j)  means a current employee of an agency, including a current member of the Armed Forces or a Reserve of the Armed Forces (Reserves), employees of the United States Postal Service, and seasonal and temporary employees.

      (k)  means records of Federal salary payments that a paying agency has certified to a disbursing official for disbursement.

      (l)  means the Financial Management Service, a bureau of the Department of the Treasury.

      (o)  means basic pay, special pay, incentive pay, retired pay, retainer pay, or in the case of an individual not entitled to basic pay, other authorized pay.

      (p)  means the agency that employs the Federal employee who owes the debt and authorizes the payment of his or her current pay. A paying agency also includes an agency that performs payroll services on behalf of the employing agency.

      (q)  means administrative offset to collect a debt owed by a Federal employee from the current pay account of the employee.

      (r)  means the _Secretary_ of the Treasury or his or her delegate.

      § 105-56.016   GSA participation.

#### § § 105-56.016

      (a) As required under 5 U.S.C. 5514(a)(1), GSA must participate at least annually in centralized salary offset computer matching. To meet this requirement, GSA will notify FMS of all past-due, legally enforceable debts delinquent for more than 180 days for purposes of administrative offset, as required under 31 U.S.C. 3716(c)(6). Additionally, GSA may notify FMS of past-due, legally enforceable debts delinquent for less than 180 days for purposes of administrative offset.

      (b) Prior to submitting a debt to FMS for purposes of collection by administrative offset, including salary offset, GSA will provide written certification to FMS that—

      (1) The debt is past-due and legally enforceable in the amount submitted to FMS and that GSA will ensure that collections (other than collections through offset) are properly credited to the debt;

      (2) Except in the case of a judgment debt or as otherwise allowed by law, the debt is referred for offset within ten years after GSA's right of action accrues;

      (3) GSA has complied with the provisions of 31 U.S.C. 3716 (administrative offset) and related regulations including, but not limited to, the provisions requiring that GSA provide the debtor with applicable notices and opportunities for a review of the debt; and

      (4) GSA has complied with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 5514 (salary offset) and related regulations including, but not limited to, the provisions requiring that GSA provide the debtor with applicable notices and opportunities for a hearing.

      (c) FMS may waive the certification requirement set forth in paragraph (b)(4) of this section as a prerequisite to submitting the debt to FMS. If FMS waives the certification requirement, before an offset occurs, GSA will provide the Federal employee with the notices and opportunities for a hearing as required by 5 U.S.C. 5514 and applicable regulations, and will certify to FMS that the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 5514 and applicable regulations have been met.

      (d) GSA will notify FMS immediately of any payments credited by GSA to the debtor's account, other than credits for amounts collected by offset, after submission of the debt to FMS. GSA will notify FMS once the debt is paid in its entirety. GSA will also notify FMS immediately of any change in the status of the legal enforceability of the debt, for example, if the Agency receives notice that the debtor has filed for bankruptcy protection.

      § 105-56.017   Centralized salary offset computer match.

#### § § 105-56.017

      (a) Delinquent debt records will be compared with Federal employee records maintained by members of the consortium or paying agencies. The records will be compared to identify Federal employees who owe delinquent debts for purposes of collecting the debt by administrative offset. A match will occur when the taxpayer identifying number and name of a Federal employee are the same as the taxpayer identifying number and name of a debtor.

      (b) As authorized by the provisions of 31 U.S.C. 3716(f), FMS, under a delegation of authority from the Secretary, has waived certain requirements of the Computer Matching and Privacy Protection Act of 1988, 5 U.S.C. 552a, as amended, for administrative offset, including salary offset, upon written certification by the Administrator, or the Administrator's delegate, that the requirements of 31 U.S.C. 3716(a) have been met. Specifically, FMS has waived the requirements for a computer matching agreement contained in 5 U.S.C. 552a(o) and for post-match notice and verification contained in 5 U.S.C. 552a(p). GSA will provide certification in accordance with the provisions of § 105-56.016(b)(3) of this subpart.

      § 105-56.018   Salary offset.

#### § § 105-56.018

      When a match occurs and all other requirements for offset have been met, as required by the provisions of 31 U.S.C. 3716(c), the disbursing official will offset the Federal employee's salary payment to satisfy, in whole or part, the debt owed by the employee. Alternatively, the paying agency, on behalf of the disbursing official, may deduct the amount of the offset from an employee's disposable pay before the employee's salary payment is certified to a disbursing official for disbursement.

      § 105-56.019   Offset amount.

#### § § 105-56.019

      (a) The minimum dollar amount referred for offset under this subpart is $100.

      (b) The amount offset from a salary payment under this subpart will be the lesser of—

      (1) The amount of the debt, including any interest, penalties and administrative costs; or

      (2) Up to 15 percent of the debtor's disposable pay.

      (c) Alternatively, the amount offset may be an amount agreed upon, in writing, by the debtor and GSA.

      (d) Offsets will continue until the debt, including any interest, penalties, and administrative costs, is paid in full or otherwise resolved to the satisfaction of GSA.

      § 105-56.020   Priorities.

#### § § 105-56.020

      (a) A levy pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. 1 ) takes precedence over other deductions under this subpart.

      (b) When a salary payment may be reduced to collect more than one debt, amounts offset under this subpart will be applied to a debt only after amounts offset have been applied to satisfy past due child support debts assigned to a State pursuant to the Social Security Act under 42 U.S.C. 602(a)(26) or 671(a)(17).

      § 105-56.021   Notice.

#### § § 105-56.021

      (a) Before offsetting a salary payment, the disbursing official, or the paying agency on behalf of the disbursing official, will notify the Federal employee in writing of the date deductions from salary will commence and of the amount of such deductions.

      (b)(1) When an offset occurs under this subpart, the disbursing official, or the paying agency on behalf of the disbursing official, will notify the Federal employee in writing that an offset has occurred including—

      (i) A description of the payment and the amount of offset taken;

      (ii) The identity of GSA as the creditor agency requesting the offset; and

      (iii) A contact point within GSA that will handle concerns regarding the offset.

      (2) The information described in paragraphs (b)(1)(ii) and (b)(1)(iii) of this section does not need to be provided to the Federal employee when the offset occurs if such information was included in a prior notice from the disbursing official or paying agency.

      (c) The disbursing official will advise GSA of the names, mailing addresses, and taxpayer identifying numbers of the debtors from whom amounts of past-due, legally enforceable debt were collected and of the amounts collected from each debtor for GSA. The disbursing official will not advise GSA of the source of payment from which the amounts were collected.

      § 105-56.022   Fees.

#### § § 105-56.022

      Agencies that perform centralized salary offset computer matching services may charge a fee sufficient to cover the full cost for such services. In addition, FMS, or a paying agency acting on behalf of FMS, may charge a fee sufficient to cover the full cost of implementing the administrative offset program. FMS may deduct the fees from amounts collected by offset or may bill GSA. Fees charged for offset will be based on actual administrative offsets completed and may be added to the debt as an administrative cost.

      § 105-56.023   Disposition of amounts collected.

#### § § 105-56.023

      (a) The disbursing official conducting the offset will transmit amounts collected for debts, less fees charged under § 105-56.022 of this subpart, to GSA.

      (b) If an erroneous offset payment is made to GSA, the disbursing official will notify GSA that an erroneous offset payment has been made.

      (1) The disbursing official may deduct the amount of the erroneous offset payment from future amounts payable to GSA; or

      (2) Alternatively, upon the disbursing official's request, GSA will promptly return to the disbursing official or the affected payee an amount equal to the amount of the erroneous payment (without regard to whether any other amounts payable to GSA have been paid).

      (i) The disbursing official and GSA will adjust the debtor records appropriately.

      (ii) Unless required by Federal law or contract, refunds under this subpart will not bear interest.

    Subpart C—Centralized Salary Offset (CSO) Procedures—GSA as Paying Agency

      § 105-56.024   Purpose and scope.

#### § § 105-56.024

      (a) This subpart establishes procedures for the offset of Federal salary payments, through the Financial Management Service's (FMS) administrative offset program, to collect delinquent debts owed to the Federal Government. This process is known as salary offset. Rules issued by the Office of Personnel Management contain the requirements Federal agencies must follow prior to conducting salary offset and the procedures for requesting offsets directly from a paying agency. See 5 CFR parts 550.1101 through 550.1108.

      (b) This subpart implements the requirement under 5 U.S.C. 5514(a)(1) that all Federal agencies, using a process known as centralized salary offset computer matching, identify Federal employees who owe delinquent non-tax debt to the United States. Centralized salary offset computer matching is the computerized comparison of delinquent debt records with records of Federal employees. The purpose of centralized salary offset computer matching is to identify those debtors whose Federal salaries should be offset to collect delinquent debts owed to the Federal Government.

      (c) This subpart specifies the delinquent debt records and Federal employee records that must be included in the salary offset matching process. For purposes of this subpart, delinquent debt records consist of the debt information submitted to FMS for purposes of administrative offset as required under 31 U.S.C. 3716(c)(6).

      (d) An interagency consortium was established to implement centralized salary offset computer matching on a Governmentwide basis as required under 5 U.S.C. 5514(a)(1). Federal employee records consist of records of Federal salary payments disbursed by members of the consortium.

#### § § 105-56.026

      (a) As required under 5 U.S.C. 5514(a)(1), creditor agencies must participate at least annually in centralized salary offset computer matching. To meet this requirement, creditor agencies will notify FMS of all past-due, legally enforceable debts delinquent for more than 180 days for purposes of administrative offset, as required under 31 U.S.C. 3716(c)(6). Additionally, creditor agencies may notify FMS of past-due, legally enforceable debts delinquent for less than 180 days for purposes of administrative offset.

      (b) Prior to submitting a debt to FMS for purposes of collection by administrative offset, including salary offset, creditor agencies will provide written certification to FMS that—

      (1) The debt is past-due and legally enforceable in the amount submitted to FMS and that the creditor agency will ensure that collections (other than collections through offset) are properly credited to the debt;

      (2) Except in the case of a judgment debt or as otherwise allowed by law, the debt is referred for offset within ten years after the creditor agency's right of action accrues;

      (3) The creditor agency has complied with the provisions of 31 U.S.C. 3716 (administrative offset) and related regulations including, but not limited to, the provisions requiring the creditor agency to provide the debtor with applicable notices and opportunities for a review of the debt; and

      (4) The creditor agency has complied with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 5514 (salary offset) and related regulations including, but not limited to, the provisions requiring the creditor agency to provide the debtor with applicable notices and opportunities for a hearing.

      (c) FMS may waive the certification requirement set forth in paragraph (b)(4) of this section as a prerequisite to submitting the debt to FMS. If FMS waives the certification requirement, before an offset occurs, the creditor agency will provide the Federal employee with the notices and opportunities for a hearing as required by 5 U.S.C. 5514 and applicable regulations, and will certify to FMS that the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 5514 and applicable regulations have been met.

      (d) The creditor agency will notify FMS immediately of any payments credited by the agency to the debtor's account, other than credits for amounts collected by offset, after submission of the debt to FMS. The creditor agency will notify FMS once the debt is paid in its entirety. The creditor agency will also notify FMS immediately of any change in the status of the legal enforceability of the debt, for example, if the agency receives notice that the debtor has filed for bankruptcy protection.

      § 105-56.027   Centralized salary offset computer match.

#### § § 105-56.027

      (a) Delinquent debt records will be compared with Federal employee records maintained by members of the consortium or paying agencies. The records will be compared to identify Federal employees who owe delinquent debts for purposes of collecting the debt by administrative offset. A match will occur when the taxpayer identifying number and name of a Federal employee are the same as the taxpayer identifying number and name of a debtor.

      (b) As authorized by the provisions of 31 U.S.C. 3716(f), FMS, under a delegation of authority from the Secretary, has waived certain requirements of the Computer Matching and Privacy Protection Act of 1988, 5 U.S.C. 552a, as amended, for administrative offset, including salary offset, upon written certification by the creditor agency, that the requirements of 31 U.S.C. 3716(a) have been met. Specifically, FMS has waived the requirements for a computer matching agreement contained in 5 U.S.C. 552a(o) and for post-match notice and verification contained in 5 U.S.C. 552a(p).

      § 105-56.028   Salary offset.

#### § § 105-56.028

      When a match occurs and all other requirements for offset have been met, as required by the provisions of 31 U.S.C. 3716(c), the disbursing official will offset the GSA employee's or cross-serviced agency employee's salary payment to satisfy, in whole or part, the debt owed by the employee. Alternatively, the GSA National Payroll Center, serving as the paying agency, on behalf of the disbursing official, may deduct the amount of the offset from an employee's disposable pay before the employee's salary payment is certified to a disbursing official for disbursement.

      § 105-56.029   Offset amount.

#### § § 105-56.029

      (a) The minimum dollar amount of salary offset under this subpart is $100.

      (b) The amount offset from a salary payment under this subpart will be the lesser of—

      (1) The amount of the debt, including any interest, penalties and administrative costs; or

      (2) Up to 15 percent of the debtor's disposable pay.

      (c) Alternatively, the amount offset may be an amount agreed upon, in writing, by the debtor and the creditor agency.

      (d) Offsets will continue until the debt, including any interest, penalties, and administrative costs, is paid in full or otherwise resolved to the satisfaction of the creditor agency.

      § 105-56.030   Priorities.

#### § § 105-56.030

      GSA, acting as the paying agency, on behalf of the disbursing official, will apply the order of precedence when processing debts identified by the centralized salary offset computer match program as follows:

      (a) A levy pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. 1 ) takes precedence over other deductions under this subpart.

      (b) When a salary payment may be reduced to collect more than one debt, amounts offset under this subpart will be applied to a debt only after amounts offset have been applied to satisfy past due child support debts assigned to a State pursuant to the Social Security Act under 42 U.S.C. 602(a)(26) or 671(a)(17).

      § 105-56.031   Notice.

#### § § 105-56.031

      (a) The disbursing official will provide GSA an electronic list of the names, mailing addresses, and taxpayer identifying numbers of the debtors from whom amounts of past-due, legally enforceable debt are due other Federal agencies. The disbursing official will identify the creditor agency name and a point of contact that will handle concerns regarding the debt.

      (b) Before offsetting a salary payment, the GSA National Payroll Center, acting as the paying agency on behalf of the disbursing official, will notify the debtor in writing of the date deductions from salary will commence and of the amount of such deductions.

      (c)(1) When an offset occurs under this subpart, the disbursing official, or the GSA National Payroll Center on behalf of the disbursing official, will notify the debtor in writing that an offset has occurred including—

      (i) A description of the payment and the amount of offset taken;

      (ii) The identity of the creditor agency identified by the disbursing official requesting the offset; and

      (iii) A contact point at the creditor agency identified by the disbursing official that will handle concerns regarding the offset.

      (2) The information described in paragraphs (c)(1)(ii) and (c)(1)(iii) of this section does not need to be provided to the debtor when the offset occurs if such information was included in a prior notice from the disbursing official or the creditor agency.

      § 105-56.032   Fees.

#### § § 105-56.032

      GSA, while performing centralized salary offset computer matching services, may charge a fee sufficient to cover the full cost for such services. In addition, FMS, or GSA acting as the paying agency on behalf of FMS, may charge a fee sufficient to cover the full cost of implementing the administrative offset program. FMS may deduct the fees from amounts collected by offset or may bill the creditor agency. Fees charged for offset will be based on actual administrative offsets completed.

      § 105-56.033   Disposition of amounts collected.

#### § § 105-56.033

      (a) The disbursing official conducting the offset will transmit amounts collected for debts, less fees charged under § 105-56.032 of this subpart, to the creditor agency.

      (b) If an erroneous offset payment is made to the creditor agency, the disbursing official will notify the creditor agency that an erroneous offset payment has been made.

      (1) The disbursing official may deduct the amount of the erroneous offset payment from future amounts payable to the creditor agency; or

      (2) Alternatively, upon the disbursing official's request, the creditor agency will promptly return to the disbursing official or the affected payee an amount equal to the amount of the erroneous payment (without regard to whether any other amounts payable to the creditor agency have been paid). The disbursing official and the creditor agency will adjust the debtor records appropriately.

    § 105-57.001   Purpose, authority and scope.

#### § § 105-57.001

    (a) This part provides standards and procedures for GSA to collect money from a debtor's disposable pay by means of administrative wage garnishment to satisfy delinquent non-tax debt owed to the United States.

    (b) These standards and procedures are authorized under the wage garnishment provisions of the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996, codified at 31 U.S.C. 3720D, and Department of the Treasury Wage Garnishment Regulations at 31 CFR 285.11.

    (c)  (1) This part applies to any GSA program that gives rise to a delinquent non-tax debt owed to the United States and that pursues recovery of such debt.

    (2) This part will apply notwithstanding any provision of State law.

    (3) Nothing in this part precludes the compromise of a debt or the suspension or termination of collection action in accordance with applicable law. See, for example, the Federal Claims Collection Standards (FCCS), 31 CFR parts 900 through 904.

    (4) The receipt of payments pursuant to this part does not preclude GSA from pursuing other debt collection remedies, including the offset of Federal payments to satisfy delinquent non-tax debt owed to the United States.

    GSA may pursue such debt collection remedies separately or in conjunction with administrative wage garnishment.

    (5) This part does not apply to the collection of delinquent non-tax debt owed to the United States from the wages of Federal employees from their Federal employment. Federal pay is subject to the Federal salary offset procedures set forth in 5 U.S.C. 5514 and other applicable laws. GSA standards and procedures for offsetting Federal wage payments are stated in 41 CFR part 105-56.

    (6) Nothing in this part requires GSA to duplicate notices or administrative proceedings required by contract or other laws or regulations.

    § 105-57.002   Definitions.

#### § § 105-57.002

    (a)  as defined in 31 U.S.C. 3701(a)(1), means withholding funds payable by the United States (including funds payable by the United States on behalf of a State government) to, or held by the United States for, a person to satisfy a claim.

    (b)  means Monday through Friday, excluding Federal legal holidays. For purposes of computation, the last day of the period will be included unless it is a Federal legal holiday.

    (f)  means that part of the debtor's compensation (including, but not limited to, salary, bonuses, commissions, and vacation pay) from an employer remaining after the deduction of health insurance premiums and any amounts required by law to be withheld. For purposes of this part, “amounts required by law to be withheld” include amounts for deductions such as social security taxes and withholding taxes, but do not include any amount withheld pursuant to a court order.

    (g)  means a person or entity that employs the services of others and that pays their wages or salaries. The term employer includes, but is not limited to, State and local Governments, but does not include an agency of the Federal Government as defined by 31 CFR 285.11(c).

    (h)  means information retained by GSA indicating the nature of the document to which it pertains, the date of submission of the document, and to whom the document is being submitted. _Evidence of service_ may be retained electronically or otherwise, so long as the manner of retention is sufficient for evidentiary purposes.

For the purposes of administrative offset under 31 U.S.C. 3716, the terms “claim” and “debt” include an amount of money, funds, or property owed by a person to a State (including past-due support being enforced by a State), the District of Columbia, American Samoa, Guam, the United States Virgin Islands, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.

    (l) For the purposes of the standards in this part, unless otherwise stated, the terms “GSA” and “Agency” are synonymous and interchangeable.

    (m) For the purposes of the standards in this part, unless otherwise stated, “Secretary” means the Secretary of the Treasury or the Secretary's delegate.

    (o)  means a review of the documentary evidence concerning the existence and/or amount of a debt, and/or the terms of a repayment schedule, provided such repayment schedule is established other than by a written agreement entered into pursuant to this part. If the hearing official determines that the issues in dispute cannot be resolved solely by review of the written record, such as when the validity of the debt turns on the issue of credibility or veracity, an oral hearing may be provided.

    (p)  means a Board Judge of the Civilian Board of Contract Appeals (CBCA).

    (q)  means “Wage Garnishment Order (SF 329B)”, issued by GSA. For purposes of this part, the terms “wage garnishment order” and “garnishment order” have the same meaning as “withholding order.”

    (r) In this part, words in the plural form shall include the singular and vice versa, and words signifying the masculine gender shall include the feminine and vice versa. The terms “includes” and “including” do not exclude matters not listed but do include matters that are in the same general class.

    § 105-57.003   General rule.

#### § § 105-57.003

    Whenever GSA determines a delinquent debt is owed by an individual, the Agency may initiate administrative proceedings to garnish the wages of the delinquent debtor.

    § 105-57.004   Notice requirements.

#### § § 105-57.004

    (a) At least 30 days before the initiation of garnishment proceedings, GSA will send, by first class mail, overnight delivery service, or hand delivery to the debtor's last known address a written notice informing the debtor of—

    (1) The nature and amount of the debt;

    (2) The intention of GSA to initiate proceedings to collect the debt through deductions from pay until the debt and all accumulated interest, penalties and administrative costs are paid in full; and

    (3) The debtor's rights, including those set forth in paragraph (b) of this section, and the time frame within which the debtor may exercise his or her rights.

    (b) The debtor will be afforded the opportunity—

    (1) To inspect and copy Agency records related to the debt;

    (2) To enter into a written repayment agreement with GSA under terms agreeable to the Agency; and

    (3) To request a hearing in accordance with § 105-57.005 of this part concerning the existence and/or amount of the debt, and/or the terms of the proposed repayment schedule under the garnishment order. However, the debtor is not entitled to a hearing concerning the terms of the proposed repayment schedule if these terms have been established by written agreement under paragraph (b)(2) of this section.

    (c) The notice required by this section may be included with GSA's demand letter required by 41 CFR 105-55.010.

    (d) GSA will keep a copy of the evidence of service indicating the date of submission of the notice. The evidence of service may be retained electronically so long as the manner of retention is sufficient for evidentiary purposes.

    § 105-57.005   Hearing.

#### § § 105-57.005

    (a) GSA will provide a hearing, which at the hearing official's option may be oral or written, if within fifteen (15) business days of submission of the notice by GSA, the debtor submits a signed and dated written request for a hearing, to the official named in the notice, concerning the existence and/or amount of the debt, and/or the terms of the repayment schedule (for repayment schedules established other than by written agreement under § 105-57.004(b)(2) of this part). A copy of the request for a hearing must also be sent to the Civilian Board of Contract Appeals (CBCA) at 1800 F Street NW., Washington, DC 20405.

    (b)  (1) For purposes of this section, whenever GSA is required to afford a debtor a hearing, the hearing official will provide the debtor with a reasonable opportunity for an oral hearing when he/she determines that the issues in dispute cannot be resolved by review of the documentary evidence, for example, when the validity of the claim turns on the issue of credibility or veracity.

    (2) If the hearing official determines that an oral hearing is appropriate, he/she will establish the time and location of the hearing. An oral hearing may, at the debtor's option, be conducted either in-person or by telephone conference. In-person hearings will be conducted in the hearing official's office located at 1800 M Street NW., 6th Floor, Washington, DC 20036, or at another location designated by the hearing official. All personal and travel expenses incurred by the debtor in connection with an in-person hearing will be borne by the debtor. All telephonic charges incurred during a hearing will be the responsibility of GSA.

    (3) The debtor may represent himself or herself or may be represented by another person of his or her choice at the hearing. GSA will not compensate the debtor for representation expenses, including hourly fees for attorneys, travel expenses, or costs for reproducing documents.

    (4) In those cases when an oral hearing is not required by this section, the hearing official will nevertheless conduct a “paper hearing”, that is, the hearing official will decide the issues in dispute based upon a review of the written record. The hearing official will establish a reasonable deadline for the submission of evidence.

    (c) Subject to paragraph (k) of this section, if the debtor's written request is received by GSA on or before the 15th business day after the submission of the notice described in § 105-57.004(a) of this part, the Agency will not issue a withholding order under § 105-57.006 of this part until the debtor has been provided the requested hearing and a decision in accordance with paragraphs (h) and (i) of this section has been rendered.

    (d) If the debtor's written request for a hearing is received by GSA after the 15th business day following the mailing of the notice described in § 105-57.004(a) of this part, GSA may consider the request timely filed and provide a hearing if the debtor can show that the delay was because of circumstances beyond his or her control. However, GSA will not delay issuance of a withholding order unless the Agency determines that the delay in filing the request was caused by factors over which the debtor had no control, or GSA receives information that the Agency believes justifies a delay or cancellation of the withholding order.

    (e) After the debtor requests a hearing, the hearing official will notify the debtor of—

    (1) The date and time of a telephonic hearing;

    (2) The date, time, and location of an in-person oral hearing; or

    (3) The deadline for the submission of evidence for a written hearing.

    (f)  (1) GSA will have the burden of establishing the existence and/or amount of the debt.

    (2) Thereafter, if the debtor disputes the existence and/or amount of the debt, the debtor must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that no debt exists or that the amount of the debt is incorrect. In addition, the debtor may present evidence that the terms of the repayment schedule are unlawful, would cause a financial hardship to the debtor, or that collection of the debt may not be pursued due to operation of law.

    (g) The hearing official will arrange and maintain a written transcript of any hearing provided under this section. The transcript will be made available to either party in the event of an appeal under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 701 through 706. All charges associated with the taking of the transcript will be the responsibility of GSA. A hearing is not required to be a formal evidentiary-type hearing; however, witnesses who testify in oral hearings will do so under oath or affirmation.

    (h) The hearing official will issue a written opinion stating his or her decision, as soon as practicable, but not later than sixty (60) days after the date on which the request for such hearing was received by GSA. If the hearing official is unable to provide the debtor with a hearing and render a decision within 60 days after the receipt of the request for such hearing—

    (1) GSA will not issue a withholding order until the hearing is held and a decision rendered; or

    (2) If GSA had previously issued a withholding order to the debtor's employer, the Agency will suspend the withholding order beginning on the 61st day after the receipt of the hearing request and continuing until a hearing is held and a decision is rendered.

    (i) The written decision will include—

    (1) A summary of the facts presented;

    (2) The hearing official's findings, analysis and conclusions; and

    (3) The terms of any repayment schedules, if applicable.

    (j) The hearing official's decision will be the final Agency action for the purposes of judicial review under the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 701 ).

    (k) In the absence of good cause shown, a debtor who fails to appear at a hearing scheduled pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section, or to provide written submissions within the time set by the hearing official, will be deemed to have waived his or her right to appear and present evidence.

    § 105-57.006   Wage garnishment order.

#### § § 105-57.006

    (a) Unless GSA receives information it believes justifies a delay or cancellation of the withholding order, the Agency will send, by first class mail, overnight delivery service or hand delivery, a SF 329A (Letter to Employer & Important Notice to Employer), a SF 329B (Wage Garnishment Order), a SF 329C (Wage Garnishment Worksheet), and a SF 329D (Employer Certification), to the debtor's employer—

    (1) Within 30 days after the debtor fails to make a timely request for a hearing (i.e., within 15 business days after the mailing of the notice described in § 105-57.004(a) of this part); or

    (2) If a timely request for a hearing is made by the debtor, within 30 days after a final decision is made by the hearing official to proceed with garnishment.

    (b) The withholding order sent to the employer under paragraph (a) of this section will contain the signature of, or the image of the signature of, the Administrator or his or her delegate. The order will contain only the information necessary for the employer to comply with the withholding order. Such information includes the debtor's name, address, and social security number, as well as instructions for withholding and information as to where payments are to be sent.

    (c) GSA will retain a copy of the evidence of service indicating the date of submission of the order. The evidence of service may be retained electronically so long as the manner of retention is sufficient for evidentiary purposes.

    § 105-57.007   Certification by employer.

#### § § 105-57.007

    The employer must complete and return the SF 329D (Employer Certification) to GSA within the time frame prescribed in the instructions to the form. The certification will address matters such as information about the debtor's employment status and disposable pay available for withholding.

    § 105-57.008   Amounts withheld.

#### § § 105-57.008

    (a) After receipt of the garnishment order issued under this part, the employer shall deduct from all disposable pay paid to the applicable debtor during each pay period the amount of garnishment described in paragraph (b) of this section. The employer may use the SF 329C (Wage Garnishment Worksheet) to calculate the amount to be deducted from the debtor's disposable pay.

    (b) Subject to the provisions of paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, the amount of garnishment will be the lesser of—

    (1) The amount indicated on the garnishment order up to 15 percent of the debtor's disposable pay; or

    (2) The amount set forth in 15 U.S.C. 1673(a)(2) (Restriction on Garnishment), which is the amount by which a debtor's disposable pay exceeds an amount equivalent to thirty times the minimum wage. See 29 CFR 870.10.

    (c) When a debtor's pay is subject to withholding orders with priority, the following will apply:

    (1) Unless otherwise provided by Federal law, withholding orders issued under this part will be paid in the amounts set forth under paragraph (b) of this section and will have priority over other withholding orders which are served later in time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, withholding orders for family support will have priority over withholding orders issued under this part.

    (2) If amounts are being withheld from a debtor's pay pursuant to a withholding order served on an employer before a withholding order issued pursuant to this part, or if a withholding order for family support is served on an employer at any time, the amounts withheld pursuant to the withholding order issued under this part will be the lesser of—

    (i) The amount calculated under paragraph (b) of this section; or

    (ii) An amount equal to 25 percent of the debtor's disposable pay less the amount(s) withheld under the withholding order(s) with priority.

    (3) If a debtor owes more than one debt to GSA, the Agency may issue multiple withholding orders provided the total amount garnished from the debtor's pay for such orders does not exceed the amount set forth in paragraph (b) of this section.

    (d) An amount greater than that set forth in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section may be withheld upon the written consent of the debtor.

    (e) The employer shall promptly pay to GSA all amounts withheld in accordance with the withholding order issued pursuant to this part.

    (f) An employer will not be required to vary its normal pay and disbursement cycles in order to comply with the withholding order.

    (g) Any assignment or allotment by an employee of his or her earnings will be void to the extent it interferes with or prohibits execution of the withholding order issued under this part, except for any assignment or allotment made pursuant to a family support judgment or order.

    (h) The employer will withhold the appropriate amount from the debtor's wages for each pay period until the employer receives notification from GSA to discontinue wage withholding. The garnishment order will indicate a reasonable period of time within which the employer is required to commence wage withholding, usually the first payday after the employer receives the order. However, if the first payday is within ten (10) days after the receipt of the garnishment order, the employer may begin deductions on the second payday.

    (i) Payments received through a wage garnishment order will be applied in the following order:

    (1) To outstanding penalties.

    (2) To administrative costs incurred by GSA to collect the debt.

    (3) To interest accrued on the debt at the rate established by the terms of the obligation under which it arose or by applicable law.

    (4) To outstanding principal.

    § 105-57.009   Exclusions from garnishment.

#### § § 105-57.009

    GSA will not garnish the wages of a debtor who it knows has been involuntarily separated from employment until the debtor has been reemployed continuously for at least 12 months. The debtor has the burden of informing GSA of the circumstances surrounding an involuntary separation from employment.

    § 105-57.010   Financial hardship.

#### § § 105-57.010

    (a) A debtor whose wages are subject to a wage withholding order under this part, may, at any time, request a review by GSA of the amount garnished, based on materially changed circumstances such as disability, divorce, or catastrophic illness which result in financial hardship.

    (b) A debtor requesting a review under paragraph (a) of this section shall submit the basis for claiming the current amount of garnishment results in a financial hardship to the debtor, along with supporting documentation.

    (c) If a financial hardship is found, GSA will downwardly adjust, by an amount and for a period of time agreeable to the Agency, the amount garnished to reflect the debtor's financial condition. GSA will notify the employer of any adjustments to the amounts to be withheld.

    § 105-57.011   Ending garnishment.

#### § § 105-57.011

    (a) Once GSA has fully recovered the amounts owed by the debtor, including interest, penalties, and administrative costs consistent with the FCCS, the Agency will send the debtor's employer notification to discontinue wage withholding.

    (b) At least annually, GSA will review its debtors' accounts to ensure that garnishment has been terminated for accounts that have been paid in full.

    § 105-57.012   Actions prohibited by the employer.

#### § § 105-57.012

    An employer may not discharge, refuse to employ, or take disciplinary action against the debtor due to the issuance of a withholding order under this part. See 31 U.S.C. 3720D(e).

    § 105-57.013   Refunds.

#### § § 105-57.013

    (a) If a hearing official, at a hearing held pursuant to § 105-57.005 of this part, determines that a debt is not legally due and owing to the United States, GSA will promptly refund any amount collected by means of administrative wage garnishment.

    (b) Unless required by Federal law or contract, refunds under this part will not bear interest.

    § 105-57.014   Right of action.

#### § § 105-57.014

    GSA may sue any employer for any amount that the employer fails to withhold from wages owed and payable to an employee in accordance with §§ 105-057.006 and 105-57.008 of this part, plus attorney's fees, costs, and if applicable, punitive damages. However, a suit may not be filed before the termination of the collection action involving a particular debtor, unless earlier filing is necessary to avoid expiration of any applicable statute of limitations period. For purposes of this part, “termination of the collection action” occurs when GSA has terminated collection action in accordance with the FCCS or other applicable standards. In any event, termination of the collection action will have been deemed to occur if GSA has not received any payments to satisfy the debt from the particular debtor whose wages were subject to garnishment, in whole or in part, for a period of one (1) year.

      § 105.60.001   General policy.

#### § § 105.60.001

      (a) In compliance with the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), as amended 5 U.S.C. 552, a positive and continuing obligation exists for GSA to make available to the fullest extent practicable upon request by members of the public, all records and informational materials that are generated, maintained, and controlled by GSA.

      (b) This subpart also covers exemptions from disclosure of these records; procedures for the public to inspect or obtain copies of GSA records.

      (c) The regulations promulgated in this subpart are consistent with amendments to 5 U.S.C. 552a as well as other applicable Federal laws germane to disclosure of information to the public.

      (d) This subpart applies to all GSA organizations, portfolios, business lines, regional offices and components. The aforementioned units may establish additional rules for processing FOIA requests due to unique program requirements; however, such rules shall be consistent with these rules and have the concurrence of the GSA Administrator and GSA Chief FOIA Officer.

      (e) Any internal GSA policies or procedures inconsistent with the policies and procedures promulgated in this subpart are superseded by this subpart to the extent of that inconsistency.

      (f) This subpart does not entitle any person to any service or to the disclosure of any GSA records that are not required to be disclosed under the FOIA.

    Subpart B—Proactive Disclosures

      § 105-60.100   Public availability of information.

#### § § 105-60.100

      Records that FOIA in 5 U.S. Code section 552(a)(2) requires GSA to make available for public inspection in an electronic format can be accessed via GSA's website at . Additionally, the GSA FOIA Reading Room, and the FOIA Online System. GSA is responsible for determining which of its records shall be made publicly available, for identifying additional records of interest to the public that are appropriate for public disclosure, and for posting and indexing such records. These records shall be made available electronically via the GSA FOIA Reading Room. GSA shall ensure that its online FOIA Library of posted records and indices is reviewed and updated on an ongoing basis. GSA maintains a FOIA Requester Service Center, the office that oversees FOIA requests for all of GSA, and a FOIA Public Liaison to assist individuals in locating records particular to an agency. A list of agency FOIA Public Liaisons is available at: .

    Subpart C—Requirements for Making Requests

      § 105-60.200   Making a request.

#### § § 105-60.200

      (a) To make a request for GSA records, a requester shall file their request to the GSA FOIA Requester Service Center via one of the following, via the FOIAonline website: (). From FOIAonline you can submit FOIA requests to GSA and other participating FOIAonline agencies, track the status of requests, search for requests submitted by others, access previously released records, and generate agency-specific FOIA processing reports.

      (b) If it is not reasonably possible for a requester to submit an electronic request via FOIAonline, the requester shall submit their request via U.S. Mail to the following address: GSA FOIA Requester Service Center (H3), Room 7308, 1800 F Street NW, Washington, DC 20405. Fax: 202-501-2727. Alternatively, a FOIA requester may email its FOIA request to  (Subject: FOIA Request via Email).

      (c) FOIA request description

      (1) The requester shall provide the following items of contact information when submitting a request to GSA:

      (i) Full name with honorific (Mr., Ms., Mrs., Dr., etc.);

      (ii) Complete mailing address; and

      (iii) Telephone number.

      (2) This requirement is applicable to both FOIA requests submitted electronically and via U.S. mail, respectively.

      (3) Although it is not a mandatory requirement, GSA also recommends the requester provide a personal/business email address for remittance as well.

      (d) A requester who is making a request for records about himself or herself shall comply with the verification of identity requirements as specified in paragraph (e) of this section.

      (e) Where a request for records pertains to another individual, a requester may receive access to the requested records by submitting: Either a notarized authorization signed by the individual permitting that he or she explicitly grants access to the requested records pursuant to the requirements set forth in 28 U.S.C. 1746 or by submitting proof that the individual is deceased ( a copy of a death certificate or an obituary). As an exercise of administrative discretion, GSA can require a requester to supply additional information such as a Certification of Identity Form in order to sufficiently verify the individual submitting the request and/or also verify that a particular individual has consented to disclosure.

      § 105-60.201   Description of records sought.

#### § § 105-60.201

      (a) Requesters shall describe the records sought in sufficient detail to enable GSA personnel to locate them with a reasonable amount of effort. To the extent possible, requesters should include the following information in their FOIA request, which may help GSA identify the requested records the date/timeframe the requested information was created or occurred, title or name, author, recipient, subject matter of the record, case number, file designation, contract number, leasing identification number, or reference number and if known, the component of GSA housing the records.

      (b) Before submitting a FOIA request, requesters may contact the GSA FOIA Requester Service Center or GSA FOIA Public Liaison to discuss the records they seek and to receive assistance in describing the records. If after receiving a request, GSA determines that it does not reasonably describe the records sought, GSA shall inform the requester what additional information is needed or why the request is otherwise insufficient. Requesters who are attempting to reformulate or modify such a request may discuss their request with their assigned Government Information Specialist or FOIA Public Liaison. If a request does not reasonably describe the records sought, GSA's response to the request may be delayed.

      (c) In order to efficiently respond to FOIA requests within the required 20-business-day timeframe per 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(A), GSA may close an unperfected request 10 business days after GSA notifies the requester of the information needed to perfect the request. If the request does not reasonably describe the records sought, it is unperfected. A perfected FOIA request is a FOIA request for records that adequately describes the records sought, is made in accordance with GSA's regulations, has been received by the GSA FOIA Requester Service center, and for which there is no remaining question about the payment or amount of applicable fees.

      (d) Requesters may specify whether they prefer to receive paper copies of the records or receive the records electronically. GSA shall accommodate the request if the record is readily reproducible in the requested form.

    Subpart D—Responding to Requests

      § 105-60.300   Responsibility for responding to FOIA requests.

#### § § 105-60.300

      (a) The GSA FOIA Requester Service Center is responsible for managing all requests for records submitted to GSA from initial receipt of the FOIA request through the agency's final decision to release in whole or in part, or withhold the requested records.

      (b) Upon receiving a request for records, the GSA FOIA Requester Service Center shall determine whether the requested records reside within GSA. If GSA does not have ownership of the requested records, the GSA FOIA Requester Service Center shall make a good faith effort to redirect the requester to the appropriate record location or/entity that has control and ownership of the requested record, if known.

      (c) If GSA has possession of the requested records, the FOIA Requester Service Center shall work in coordination with the appropriate GSA component/or program office to fulfill the FOIA request in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552.

      § 105-60.301   Acknowledging FOIA requests.

#### § § 105-60.301

      (a) To the extent practicable, GSA shall communicate with requesters electronically via the FOIAonline web portal and/or email.

      (b) Upon receipt of a request, GSA shall send requesters an acknowledgement letter within 2 business days containing a brief description of the records sought so requesters may more easily keep track of their requests.

      (c) When a request is submitted via FOIAonline, the system automatically generates a tracking number, which allows for easy identification of each request. This tracking number shall be included in the acknowledgement letter.

      (d) When GSA receives a request not directly entered by the requester into FOIAonline ( email, fax, standard mail, etc.) the FOIA Requester Service Center shall immediately upload the request into the FOIAonline system and it shall be assigned a tracking number that shall be communicated to the requester.

      § 105-60.302   Responding to FOIA requests.

#### § § 105-60.302

      (a) GSA shall provide an estimated date by which the agency expects to provide a response to the requester. If a request involves a voluminous amount of material or searches in multiple locations, GSA may provide an interim response, meaning the agency releases the records on a rolling basis as the records are located and verified.

      (b) In determining which records are responsive to a request, the agency shall include only the records in its possession as of the date the agency receives the perfected FOIA request. If any other date is used, GSA shall inform the requester accordingly. A record that is excluded from the requirements of the FOIA pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552(c) is not considered responsive to a request.

      (c) Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552, GSA is not required to perform the following in response to a FOIA request:

      (1) Answer questions or interrogatories posed as FOIA requests;

      (2) Issue guidance/or opinions;

      (3) Analyze and/or interpret documents for a requester;

      (4) Create records;

      (5) Conduct research; or

      (6) Initiate investigations.

      (d) The GSA Administrator and GSA Chief FOIA Officer and/or their assigned delegates are authorized to grant or deny any requests for records or portions thereof that are generated, maintained, or controlled by GSA.

      § 105-60.303   Consultation, referral, and coordination.

#### § § 105-60.303

      (a) All consultations and referrals received by GSA shall be handled according to the date the other agency received the perfected FOIA request.

      (b) GSA may establish agreements with other agencies to eliminate the need for consultations or referrals with respect to particular types of records.

      (c) When GSA is reviewing records located in response to a FOIA request, GSA shall determine whether another agency of the Federal Government is better able to determine if the records are releasable under the FOIA. As to any such record, GSA shall proceed in one of the following ways:

      (1)  When GSA receives a request for records that either originated with another agency or is a GSA record that includes information that originated with another agency, GSA should typically consult with that other agency prior to making a release determination.

      (2)  (i) Whenever GSA receives a request for records that are known to be the primary responsibility of another agency, GSA shall refer the responsibility for responding to the request regarding records to that agency. Ordinarily, the agency that created the records is presumed to be the best agency to make the disclosure determination. However, if GSA and the originating agency jointly agree that GSA is in the best position to respond regarding the record, then the responsive record(s) may be handled as a consultation.

      (ii) Whenever GSA refers any part of the responsibility for responding to a record request to another agency, GSA shall maintain documentation that the referral to the other agency has occurred, and shall notify the requester of the referral. The notification to the requester shall include both the name of the agency to which the record request was referred and the contact information for the agency's FOIA office/or personnel.

      (iii) This referral procedure is not appropriate where disclosure of the identity of the agency to which the referral would be made could reasonably harm an interest protected by an applicable exemption, such as the exemptions that protect personal privacy or national security interests. If a non-law enforcement agency responding to a request for records on a living third party locates within its files records originating with a law enforcement agency, and if the existence of that law enforcement interest in the third party was not publicly known, then to disclose that law enforcement interest could cause an unwarranted invasion of the personal privacy of the third party. Similarly, if GSA locates a record that originates with an intelligence community agency, and the involvement of that agency in the matter is classified and not publicly acknowledged, then to disclose or give attribution to the involvement of that Intelligence Community agency could cause national security harms. Records meeting these criteria shall be treated as a consultation.

      (iv) In such instances, in order to avoid a harm to an interest protected by an FOIA applicable exemption, GSA should coordinate with the originating agency to seek its views on the disclosability of the record. The release determination for the record that is the subject of the coordination should then be conveyed to the requester by GSA.

      (4)  (i) On receipt of any request involving classified information, GSA shall determine whether the information is currently and properly classified in accordance with applicable classification rules. Whenever a request involves a record containing information that has been classified or may be appropriate for classification by another agency under any applicable executive order concerning the classification of records, GSA shall refer request for records to the agency that classified the information or that should consider the information for classification.

      (ii) Whenever GSA's records contain information that has been derivatively classified ( it contains information classified by another agency), GSA shall refer the responsibility for responding to that portion of the request to the agency that classified the information.

      § 105-60.304   Time requirements to respond to FOIA requests.

#### § § 105-60.304

      (a) Upon receipt of perfected request via U.S. mail, email, or facsimile, the GSA FOIA Requester Service Center shall begin processing the request for records. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(A)(i), GSA has 20 business days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and Federal holidays) to inform the requester of the agency's determination with respect to the request for records, unless in the alternative, the agency has negotiated a different timeframe based on scope and level of effort to prepare the FOIA request response. If a requester does not receive a response to their perfected FOIA request within the statutory timeframe requester may seek judicial review in the U.S. District Court in the district in which the requester resides or has a principal place of business, or where the records are situated, or in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.

      (b) GSA shall to the greatest extent practicable respond to FOIA requests by order of receipt of the requests.

      (c) GSA shall designate a specific track for requests that are granted expedited processing, in accordance with the standards set forth in this subpart. GSA may also designate additional processing tracks that distinguish between simple and more complex requests based on the estimated amount of work or time needed to process the request. Among the factors GSA may consider are the number of records requested, the number of pages involved in processing the request, and the need for consultations or referrals. GSA shall advise requesters of the track into which their request falls upon request, and when appropriate, offer the requester an opportunity to narrow the scope and/or modify their requests.

      (d) GSA may aggregate requests in cases where it reasonably appears that multiple requests for records were submitted either by a requester or by a group of requesters acting in concert for the same, or similar information to ensure it is fulfilled in a timely manner. GSA cannot aggregate multiple requests for unrelated subject matters.

      § 105-60.305   Unusual circumstances.

#### § § 105-60.305

      Whenever GSA cannot meet the statutory time limit for processing a request because of “unusual circumstances,” as defined at 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(A)(iii), GSA shall, before expiration of the 20-day statutory time period to respond to a request for records, notify the requester in writing of the unusual circumstances involved and of the date by which GSA estimates the processing of the request shall be completed. Where the extension of time is anticipated to exceed 10 business days, GSA shall provide the requester with an opportunity to modify the request or arrange an alternative time period for processing the original or modified request. GSA shall make available its FOIA Public Liaison for this purpose. GSA shall also alert requesters to the availability of the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) to provide dispute resolution services.

      § 105-60.306   Expedited processing.

#### § § 105-60.306

      (a) A request for expedited processing may be made at any time. In order to qualify for consideration for expedited processing, the request shall reasonably describe the records sought. Expedited requests should be described in sufficient detail to facilitate expedited processing.

      (b) A requester who seeks expedited processing shall submit a statement with their FOIA request, certified to be true and correct, explaining in detail the basis for making the request for expedited processing as described in paragraphs (c)(1) through (4) of this section. As a matter of administrative discretion, GSA may waive the formal certification requirement.

      (c) GSA may process requests and appeals on an expedited basis whenever it is determined that they involve:

      (1) Circumstances in which the lack of expedited processing could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual;

      (2) An urgency to inform the public about an actual or alleged Federal Government activity, if made by a person who is primarily engaged in disseminating information; or

      (3) The loss of substantial due process rights; or

      (4) A matter of widespread and exceptional media interest in which there exist possible questions about the Government's integrity that affect public confidence.

      (d) GSA shall notify the requester within 10 calendar days of its receipt of a request for expedited processing and of its decision whether to grant or deny expedited processing. If expedited processing is granted, the request shall be given priority, placed in the processing track for expedited requests, and processed as soon as practicable. If a request for expedited processing is denied, GSA shall act on any appeal of that decision within 3 business days.

    Subpart E—Acknowledging the FOIA Request

      § 105-60.400   Applying FOIA exemptions.

#### § § 105-60.400

      (a) 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(1)-(9) of the Freedom of Information Act provides that the disclosure requirements of FOIA do not apply to matters that are:

      (1) Specifically authorized under the criteria established by an executive order to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or foreign policy and are in fact properly classified pursuant to such executive order (see Executive Order No. 13,526);

      (2) Related solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of an agency;

      (3) Specifically exempted from disclosure by statute other than 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(1)-(9), provided that such statute:

      (ii) Establishes particular criteria for withholding or refers to particular types of matters to be withheld;

      (4) Trade secrets and commercial or financial information that could harm the competitive posture or business interests of a company;

      (5) Interagency or intra-agency memorandums or letters that would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency, provided that the deliberative process privilege shall not apply to records created 25 years or more before the date on which the records were requested;

      (6) Personnel and medical files and similar files the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy;

      (7) Records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes, but only to the extent that the production of such law enforcement records or information:

      (i) Could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings;

      (ii) Would deprive a person of a right to a fair trial or an impartial adjudication;

      (iii) Could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy;

      (iv) Reasonably be expected to disclose the identity of a confidential source, including a State, local, or foreign agency or authority or any private institution that furnished information on a confidential basis, and, in the case of a record or information compiled by a criminal law enforcement authority in the course of a criminal investigation or by an agency conducting a lawful national security intelligence investigation, information furnished by a confidential source;

      (v) Would disclose techniques and procedures for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions, or would disclose guidelines for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions if such disclosure could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law; or

      (vi) Could reasonably be expected to endanger the life or physical safety of any individual;

      (8) Contained in or related to examination, operating, or condition reports prepared by, on behalf of, or for the use of an agency responsible for the regulation or supervision of financial institutions; or

      (9) Geological and geophysical information and data, including maps, concerning wells.

    Subpart F—Final Responses to the FOIA Request

      § 105-60.500   Final response procedures and rules.

#### § § 105-60.500

      (a) Once GSA determines that it shall grant a request in full or in part, the requester shall be notified of the decision in writing as well. GSA shall also inform the requester of any fees charged under § 105-60.804 of this part and shall disclose the requested records to the requester promptly upon payment of any applicable fees. The agency shall inform the requester of the availability of its FOIA Public Liaison to offer assistance.

      (b) If GSA makes an adverse determination on any part of the FOIA request, it shall notify the requester of that determination in writing. Adverse determinations, or denials of requests, include determinations that:

      (1) The requested record is exempt from disclosure, in whole or in part;

      (2) The FOIA request does not reasonably describe the records sought;

      (3) The information requested is not subject to FOIA;

      (4) The requested record does not exist, cannot be located, or has been destroyed; or

      (5) The requested record is not readily reproducible in the form or format sought by the requester.

      (c) Records disclosed in part in response to a FOIA request shall be marked clearly to show the exemption under which the applicable portions of the responsive records were redacted unless doing so would harm an interest protected by an applicable exemption.

      (d) Adverse determinations also include denials involving fee waiver requests, denials for expedited processing, and the administrative closure of FOIA requests due to nonpayment of search and review fees for processing the FOIA request.

      (e) Any adverse determination of a FOIA request, in full or in part, shall be signed by the Chief FOIA Officer or his or her designee and shall include:

      (1) The name and title or position of the person responsible for the adverse determination;

      (2) A brief statement of the reasons for the adverse determination, including any FOIA exemption that is the basis for GSA's decision;

      (3) An estimate of the volume of any records or information withheld, such as the number of pages or some other reasonable form of estimation, although such an estimate is not required if the volume is otherwise indicated by deletions marked on records that are disclosed in part or if providing an estimate would harm an interest protected by an applicable exemption; and

      (4) A statement that the denial may be appealed under subpart I of this part, and a description of the appeal requirements.

      (5) A statement notifying the requester of the assistance available from the agency's FOIA Public Liaison and the dispute resolution services offered by OGIS.

      (f) Use of record exclusions pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552(c):

      (1) In the event that GSA identifies records that may be subject to exclusion from the requirements of the FOIA pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552(c), GSA shall confer with Department of Justice, Office of Information Policy (OIP), to obtain approval to apply the exclusion.

      (2) If GSA invokes an exclusion, it shall maintain an administrative record of the process of invocation and approval of the exclusion by OIP.

    Subpart G—Handling Confidential Commercial Information

      § 105-60.600   Procedural and lawful considerations.

#### § § 105-60.600

      (a) Confidential commercial information means commercial or financial information obtained by GSA from a submitter that may be protected from disclosure under Exemption 4 of the FOIA, 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4).

      (b) Submitter means any person or entity, including a corporation, State, or foreign government, but not including another Federal Government entity, that provides confidential commercial information, either directly or indirectly to the Federal Government.

      (c) A submitter of confidential commercial information shall use good faith efforts to designate by appropriate markings/or redact any portion of its submission that it considers to be protected from disclosure under Exemption 4. These designations expire 10 years after the date of the submission unless the submitter requests and provides justification for a longer designation period.

      (d) When notice to submitters is required:

      (1) GSA shall promptly provide written notice to the submitter of confidential commercial information whenever records containing such information are requested under the FOIA if GSA determines that it may be required to disclose the records, provided:

      (i) The requested information has been designated in good faith by the submitter as information considered protected from disclosure under Exemption 4; or

      (ii) GSA has a reason to believe that the requested information may be protected from disclosure under Exemption 4, but has not yet determined whether the information is protected from disclosure.

      (2) The notice shall either describe the commercial information requested or include a copy of the requested records or portions of records containing the information. In cases involving a voluminous number of submitters, GSA may post or publish a notice in a place or manner reasonably likely to inform the submitters of the proposed disclosure, instead of sending individual notifications.

      (e) The notice requirements of this section do not apply if:

      (1) GSA determines that the information is exempt under the FOIA, and therefore shall not be disclosed;

      (2) The information has been lawfully published or has been officially made available to the public;

      (3) Disclosure of the information is required by a statute other than FOIA or by a regulation issued in accordance with the requirements of Executive Order 12,600 of June 23, 1987; or

      (4) The designation made by the submitter under paragraph (c) of this section appears obviously frivolous. In such a case, GSA shall give the submitter written notice of any final decision to disclose the information within reasonable time prior to a specified disclosure date.

      § 105-60.601   Submitter's opportunity to object to disclosure.

#### § § 105-60.601

      (a) GSA shall provide a submitter with 10 business days, within which the submitter shall respond to the notice referenced in § 105-60.600.

      (b) If a submitter has any objections to disclosure, it should provide GSA a detailed written statement that specifies all grounds for withholding the particular information under any exemption of the FOIA. In order to rely on Exemption 4 as the basis for nondisclosure, the submitter shall explain why the information constitutes a trade secret or commercial or financial information that is privileged or confidential and the harm of the release of the information to the submitter.

      (c) A submitter who fails to respond within the time period specified in the notice shall be considered to have no objection to disclosure of the information.

      (d) GSA is not required to consider any information received after the date of any disclosure decision. Any information provided by a submitter under this subpart may itself be subject to disclosure under the FOIA.

      (e) GSA shall consider a submitter's objections and specific grounds for nondisclosure in deciding whether to disclose the requested information.

      (f) Whenever GSA decides to disclose information over the objection of a submitter, the agency shall provide the submitter written notice, which shall include:

      (1) A statement of the reasons why each of the submitter's disclosure objections was not sustained;

      (2) A description of the information to be disclosed or copies of the records as the agency intends to release them; and

      (3) The specified disclosure date.

      (g) Whenever a requester files a lawsuit seeking to compel the disclosure of confidential commercial information, GSA shall promptly notify the submitter.

      (h) GSA shall notify the requester whenever it provides the submitter with notice and an opportunity to object to disclosure; whenever it notifies the submitter of its intent to disclose the requested information; and whenever a submitter files a lawsuit to prevent the disclosure of the information.

    Subpart I—Appeals

      § 105-60.700   Submitting an appeal.

#### § § 105-60.700

      (a) A requester may appeal any adverse determination (denial of access to records, denial of fee waiver, or denial of expedited processing, etc.) to the GSA FOIA Requester Service Center which is designated as the agency's FOIA Appeals Office.

      (b) The appeal shall include:

      (1) The FOIAonline tracking number;

      (2) The basis for disagreement with GSA's adverse determination that is being appealed; and

      (3) A brief statement of the reasons he or she thinks GSA should release the records or provide expedited processing and enclose copies of the initial request and denial.

      (c) The requester may submit the appeal electronically to . The requester should mark the subject line of the electronic transmission, “Freedom of Information Act Appeal.” In the alternative, the requester may submit an appeal via facsimile to 202-501-2727, or via US mail to U.S. General Services Administration, FOIA Requester Service Center (H3), 1800 F Street NW, 7308, Washington, DC 20405-0001. If the appeal is submitted via US mail, the appeal letter must include the words “Freedom of Information Act Appeal” on both the face of the appeal letter and on the envelope. Failure to follow these procedures will delay processing of the appeal.

      (d) The GSA FOIA Officer must receive the requester's appeal no later than 90 calendar days after receipt by the requester of any adverse determination by GSA with respect to the FOIA request. GSA has 20 business days after receipt of a proper appeal to issue a response to the requester's appeal. The 20-workday time limit shall not begin until the GSA FOIA Officer receives the appeal. As noted in § 105.60.305 of this part, the GSA FOIA Officer may extend this time limit in unusual circumstances. GSA will process appeals of denials of expedited processing as soon as possible after receiving them. The GSA FOIA Officer may also extend the time limit in the event of unusual circumstances occur during the processing of appeals as well.

      § 105-60.701   Adjudication of appeals.

#### § § 105-60.701

      (a) The GSA Chief FOIA Officer or his or her designee shall act on behalf of GSA on all appeals under this section.

      (b) An appeal ordinarily shall not be adjudicated if the request that is the subject of the appeal becomes a matter of FOIA litigation. GSA shall administratively close the appeal if it becomes the subject of litigation and provide this notice to the requester in writing that the request has been administratively closed.

      (c) On receipt of any appeal involving classified information, GSA shall take appropriate action to ensure compliance with applicable classification rules.

      (d) GSA shall provide its review and decision on any appeal in writing. Any decision that either upholds GSA's original determination in whole or in part shall contain a statement that identifies the reasons for the affirmance, including any FOIA exemptions applied.

      (e) If GSA's decision is remanded or modified on appeal, GSA shall notify the requester of that determination in writing. GSA shall then further process the request in accordance with that appeal determination and shall respond directly to the requester. If GSA affirms its original decision after timely receipt of an appeal, GSA shall inform the requester via writing as well. GSA shall inform the requester of their right to seek judicial review in the U.S. District Court in the district in which the requester resides or has a principal place of business, or where the records are situated, or in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. GSA shall also inform the requester of the mediation services offered by the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) of the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation.

      (f) Engaging in dispute resolution or mediation services provided by OGIS is a voluntary process. Mediation is a voluntary process. If GSA agrees to participate in the mediation services provided by OGIS, it will actively engage as a partner to the process in an attempt to resolve the dispute.

      § 105-60.702   Requirements to preserve FOIA records.

#### § § 105-60.702

      GSA shall preserve all correspondence pertaining to the requests that it receives under this subpart, as well as copies of all requested records, until disposition or destruction is authorized pursuant to title 44 of the United States Code or the General Records Schedule 4.2 of the NARA. GSA shall not dispose of or destroy records while they are the subject of a pending request, appeal, or lawsuit under FOIA.

    Subpart J—Fees

      § 105-60.800   General provisions.

#### § § 105-60.800

      (a) GSA shall charge for processing requests under the FOIA in accordance with the provisions of this section and with OMB Guidelines. For purposes of assessing fees, FOIA establishes three categories of requesters:

      (1) Commercial use requesters;

      (2) Noncommercial scientific or educational institutions or news media requesters; and

      (3) All other requesters.

      (b) Fees are assessed depending on the category GSA determines the requester falls under in subpart A of this part. Requesters may seek a fee waiver. GSA shall consider requests for fee waiver in accordance with the requirements in § 105-60.807 of this subpart. To resolve any fee issues that arise under this section, GSA may contact a requester for additional information. GSA shall ensure that searches, review, and duplication of FOIA records are conducted in the most efficient and the least expensive manner.

      (c) GSA shall collect all applicable fees before sending copies of records to a requester. Requesters pay fees by check, credit card, or money order made payable to the U.S. General Services Administration, or by another method as determined by GSA.

      § 105-60.801   Definitions pertaining to fee assessments.

#### § § 105-60.801

      (a) A commercial use request is a request that asks for information that furthers a commercial, trade, or profit interest, which can include furthering those interests through litigation. GSA's decision to place a requester in the commercial use category shall be made on a case-by-case basis and is based on the requester's intended use of the information. GSA shall notify requesters of their placement in this category.

      (b) Direct costs are those expenses that GSA incurs in searching for and duplicating (and, in the case of commercial use requests, reviewing) records in order to respond to a FOIA request. For example, direct costs include the salary of the employee performing the work ( the basic rate of pay for the employee, plus sixteen (16) percent of that rate to cover benefits) and the cost of operating computers and other electronic equipment, such as photocopiers and scanners. Direct costs do not include overhead expenses such as the costs of space or the heating or lighting of a facility.

      (c) Duplication is reproducing a record to respond to a FOIA request. Duplicating records can occur via paper, audiovisual materials or electronic records.

      (d) An educational institution is any school that operates a program of scholarly research. A requester in this fee category shall show that the request is made in connection with his or her role at the educational institution. Agencies may seek verification from the requester that the request is in furtherance of scholarly research.

      (e) A noncommercial scientific institution is an institution that is not operated on a commercial basis. The term `commercial' for purposes of this subpart is that which is defined in paragraph (a) of this section and that is operated solely for the purpose of conducting scientific research the results of which are not intended to promote any particular product or industry. A requester in this category shall show that the request is authorized by a qualifying noncommercial institution, or educational institution of vocational and higher learning and where the records are sought to further scientific, or academic scholarly research, and are not for a commercial use. GSA shall advise requesters of their placement in this category.

      (f) Representative of the news media is any person or entity that gathers information of potential interest to a segment of the public, uses its editorial skills to turn the raw materials into a distinct work, and distributes that work to an audience. The term “news” means information that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the public. Examples of news media entities include television or radio stations that broadcast “news” to the public at large and publishers of periodicals that disseminate “news” and make their products available through a variety of means to the general public, including news organizations that disseminate solely on the internet. A request for records supporting the news-dissemination function of the requester shall not be considered to be for a commercial use. “Freelance” journalists who demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication through a news media entity shall be considered as a representative of the news media. A publishing contract would provide the clearest evidence that publication is expected; however, GSA can also consider a requester's past publication record in making this determination. GSA shall advise requesters of their placement in this category.

      (g) Review is the examination of a record located in response to a request in order to determine whether any portion of it is exempt from disclosure. Review time includes the process of reviewing each individual record for possible redactions and marking the appropriate exemptions. Review costs are properly charged even if a record ultimately is not disclosed. Review time also includes time spent both obtaining and considering any formal objection to disclosure made by a confidential commercial information submitter under § 105-60.601 of this part. It does not include time spent resolving general legal or policy issues regarding the application of exemptions.

      (h) Search is the process of looking for and retrieving records or information responsive to a request. Search time includes page-by-page or line-by-line identification of information within records and the reasonable efforts expended to locate and retrieve information from electronic records.

      § 105-60.802   Fees to be charged.

#### § § 105-60.802

      In responding to FOIA requests, GSA shall charge the following fees unless a waiver or reduction of fees has been granted under § 105-60.807 of this subpart. Because the fee amounts provided below already account for the direct costs associated with a given fee type, GSA shall not add any additional costs to charges calculated under this section.

      (a)  (1) Requests made by educational institutions, noncommercial scientific institutions, or representatives of the news media are not subject to search fees. GSA shall charge search fees for all other requesters, subject to the rules and restrictions enumerated in this subpart. GSA may properly charge for time spent searching even if the GSA FOIA Requester Service Center does not locate any responsive records or if they determine that the records are entirely exempt from disclosure.

      (2) For each half hour (30 minutes) spent by GSA personnel searching for requested records, including electronic searches that do not require new programming, a $24.50 fee shall be assessed per the guidelines of the fee schedule enumerated in § 105-60.804 of this subpart.

      (3) GSA shall charge the direct costs associated with conducting any search that requires the creation of a new computer program to locate the requested records. GSA shall notify the requester of the costs associated with creating such a program, and the requester shall agree to pay the associated costs before the costs may be incurred.

      (4) For requests that require the retrieval of records stored by GSA at a Federal records center operated by the NARA, GSA shall charge additional costs in accordance with the Transactional Billing Rate Schedule established by NARA.

      (b)  (1) GSA shall charge duplication fees to all requesters, subject to the restrictions of § 105-60.803 of this subpart. GSA shall honor a requester's preference for receiving a record in a particular form or format where the agency can readily reproduce it in the form or format requested. Where photocopies are supplied, GSA shall provide one copy per request at the cost of $0.10 per copy. For copies of records produced on tapes, disks, or other media, GSA shall charge the direct costs of producing the copy, including operator time.

      (2) Where paper documents shall be scanned in order to comply with a requester's preference to receive the records in an electronic format, the requester shall also pay the direct costs associated with scanning those materials. For other forms of duplication, GSA shall charge the direct costs.

      (3) GSA determines the standard fee for duplication of records as follows:

      (i) Per copy of each page (not larger than 8.5 x 14 inches) reproduced by photocopy or similar means (includes costs of personnel and equipment)—U.S. $0.10.

      (ii) Per copy prepared by any other method of duplication—actual direct cost of production.

      (c)  GSA shall charge review fees to requesters who make commercial use requests. Review fees shall be assessed based upon the initial review of the record ( the review conducted by GSA to determine whether an exemption applies to a particular record or portion of a record). No charge shall be made for review during the administrative appeal stage of exemptions applied at the initial review stage. However, if a particular exemption is deemed to no longer apply, any costs associated with GSA or another agency's secondary review of the records in order to consider the use of other exemptions may be assessed as review fees. Review fees shall be charged at the same rates as those enumerated in the fee schedule of this section.

      § 105-60.803   Restrictions on charging fees.

#### § § 105-60.803

      (a) When GSA determines that a requester is an educational institution, noncommercial scientific institution, or representative of the news media, and that the records are not sought for commercial use, GSA shall not charge search fees.

      (b) If GSA fails to comply with the time limits in which to respond to a request for agency records under FOIA, it will not charge search fees, or in the instances of requests from requesters described in paragraph (a) of this section, may not charge duplication fees, except as described in paragraphs (b)(1) through (3) of this section. GSA will charge duplication fees in accordance with § 105-60.802(b)(1) through (3) of this subpart.

      (1) If GSA has determined that unusual circumstances, as defined by FOIA, apply and the agency provided timely written notice to the requester in accordance with FOIA, a failure to comply with the time limit shall be excused for an additional 10 business days.

      (2) If GSA has determined that unusual circumstances, as defined by the FOIA, apply and that more than 5,000 pages are necessary to respond to the request, GSA may charge search fees, or, in the case of requesters described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, may charge duplication fees, if the following steps are taken. GSA shall have provided timely written notice of unusual circumstances to the requester in accordance with FOIA and GSA shall have discussed with the requester via written mail, email, or telephone (or made not less than three good-faith attempts to do so) how the requester could effectively limit the scope of the request in accordance with 5. U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(B)(ii). If this exception is satisfied, the component may charge all applicable fees incurred in the processing of the request.

      (3) If a court has determined that exceptional circumstances exist, as defined by FOIA, a failure to comply with the time limits shall be excused for the length of time provided by the court order.

      (c) No search or review fees shall be charged for a half-hour period unless more than half of that period is required for search or review.

      (d) Except for requesters seeking records for a commercial use, GSA shall provide without charge:

      (1) The first 100 pages of duplication (or the cost equivalent for other media); and

      (2) The first 2 hours of search time.

      (e) No fee shall be charged when the total fee, after deducting the 100 free pages (or its cost equivalent) and the first 2 hours of search, is equal to or less than $49.00.

      § 105-60.804   Fee schedule.

#### § § 105-60.804

      Table 1 to § 105-60.804 outlines the basic fee categories and applicable fees:

      § 105-60.805   Anticipated fees.

#### § § 105-60.805

      (a) When GSA determines or estimates that the fees to be assessed in accordance with this section shall exceed $49.00, the agency shall notify the requester of the actual or estimated amount of the fees, including a breakdown of the fees for search, review or duplication, unless the requester has indicated a willingness to pay fees as high as those anticipated via writing. If only a portion of the fee can be estimated readily, GSA shall advise the requester accordingly. If the request is not for noncommercial use, the notice shall specify that the requester is entitled to the statutory entitlements of 100 pages of duplication at no charge and, if the requester is charged search fees, 2 hours of search time at no charge, and shall advise the requester whether those entitlements have been provided.

      (b) If GSA notifies the requester that the actual or estimated fees are in excess of $49.00, the request shall not be considered received and further work shall not be completed until the requester commits in writing to pay the actual or estimated total fee, or designates some amount of fees the requester is willing to pay. Or in the case of a noncommercial use requester who has not yet been provided with the requester's statutory entitlements, designates that the requester seeks only that which can be provided by the statutory entitlements. The requester shall provide the commitment/or designate an exact dollar amount in writing the requester is willing to pay. GSA is not required to accept payments in installments.

      (c) If the requester has indicated a willingness to pay some designated amount of fees, but the agency estimates that the total fee shall exceed that amount, GSA shall toll the processing of the request when it notifies the requester of the estimated fees in excess of the amount the requester has indicated a willingness to pay. GSA shall inquire whether the requester wishes to revise the amount of fees the requester is willing to pay or modify the request. Once the requester submits the new estimated fee, the time to respond shall resume from where it was at the date of the notification.

      (d) GSA's FOIA Public Liaison and other FOIA professionals shall be available to assist any requester in reformulating a request to meet the requester's needs at a lower cost.

      (e) Although not required to provide special services, if GSA chooses to do so as a matter of administrative discretion, the direct costs of providing the service shall be charged. Examples of such services include certifying that records are true copies, providing multiple copies of the same document, or sending records by means other than first class mail.

      (f) GSA may charge interest on any unpaid bill starting on the 31st day following the date the requester is first billed. Interest charges shall be assessed at the rate provided in 31 U.S.C. 3717 and shall accrue from the billing date until payment is received by the agency. GSA shall follow the provisions of the Debt Collection Act of 1982 (Public Law 97-365, 96 Stat. 1749), as amended, and its administrative procedures, including the use of consumer reporting agencies, collection agencies, and offset.

      (g) When GSA reasonably believes that a requester or a group of requesters acting in concert are attempting to divide a single request into a series of requests for the purpose of avoiding fees, GSA may aggregate those requests and charge accordingly. GSA may presume that multiple requests of this type made within a 30-day period have been made in order to avoid fees. For requests separated by a longer period, GSA shall aggregate them only where there is a reasonable basis for determining that aggregation is warranted in view of all the circumstances involved. Multiple requests involving unrelated matters cannot be aggregated.

      § 105-60.806   Advanced payments.

#### § § 105-60.806

      (a) For requests other than those described in this subpart, GSA cannot require the requester to make an advance payment before work is commenced or continued on a request. Payment owed for work already completed ( payment before copies are sent to a requester) is not an advance payment.

      (b) When GSA determines or estimates that a total fee to be charged under this section shall exceed $250.00, it may require that the requester make an advance payment up to the amount of the entire anticipated fee before beginning to process the request. GSA may elect to process the request prior to collecting fees when it receives a satisfactory assurance of full payment from a requester with a history of prompt payment.

      (c) Where a requester has previously failed to pay a properly charged FOIA fee to GSA within 30 calendar days of the billing date, GSA may require that the delinquent requester pay the full amount due, plus any applicable interest on that prior request, and require that the requester make an advance payment of the full amount of any anticipated fee before the agency begins to process a new request or continues to process a pending request or any pending appeal. If GSA has a reasonable basis to believe that a requester has misrepresented the requester's identity in order to avoid paying outstanding fees, it may require that the requester provide proof of identity.

      (d) In cases in which GSA requires advance payment, the request shall not be considered received and further work shall not be completed until the required payment is received. If the requester does not pay the advance payment within 10 business days after the date of GSA's fee determination, the request shall be closed.

      § 105-60.807   Fee waivers and fee reductions.

#### § § 105-60.807

      (a) Requests for a fee waiver shall be made when the FOIA request is first submitted to the agency and should address the criteria referenced above. A requester may submit a fee waiver request at a later time so long as the underlying record request is pending or being reviewed per an appeal. When a requester who has committed to pay fees subsequently asks for a waiver of those fees and that waiver is denied, the requester shall pay any costs incurred up to the date the fee waiver request was received.

      (b) Requirements for waiver or reduction of fees:

      (1) Requesters may seek a waiver of fees by submitting a written rationale as to how disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the Government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester; and

      (2) GSA shall furnish records responsive to a request without charge or at a reduced rate when it determines, based on all available information, that the factors described in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) through (iii) of this section are satisfied:

      (i) Disclosure of the requested information would shed light on the operations or activities of the Government. The subject of the request shall concern identifiable operations or activities of the Federal Government with a connection that is direct and clear, not remote or attenuated; and

      (ii) Disclosure of the requested information is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of those operations or activities. This factor is satisfied when the following criteria are met; and

      (A) Disclosure of the requested records shall be meaningfully informative about Government operations or activities. The disclosure of information that already is in the public domain, in either the same or a substantially identical form, would not be meaningfully informative if nothing new would be added to the public's understanding.

      (B) The disclosure shall contribute to the understanding of a reasonably broad audience of persons interested in the subject, as opposed to the individual understanding of the requester. A requester's expertise in the subject area as well as the requester's ability and intention to effectively convey information to the public shall be considered. GSA shall presume that a representative of the news media shall satisfy this consideration;

      (iii) The disclosure shall not be primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. To determine whether disclosure of the requested information is primarily in the commercial interest of the requester, GSA shall consider the following criteria:

      (A) GSA shall identify whether the requester has any commercial interest that would be furthered by the requested disclosure. A commercial interest includes any commercial, trade, or profit interest. Requesters shall be given an opportunity to provide explanatory information regarding this consideration.

      (B) If there is an identified commercial interest, GSA shall determine whether that is the primary interest furthered by the request. A waiver or reduction of fees is justified when the requirements of paragraphs (b)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section are satisfied and any commercial interest is not the primary interest furthered by the request. GSA ordinarily shall presume that, when a news media requester has satisfied factors in paragraph (b)(1) of this section and this paragraph (b)(2), the request is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. Disclosure to data brokers or others who merely compile and market Government information for direct economic return shall not be presumed to primarily serve the public interest.

      (c) Where only some of the records to be released satisfy the requirements for a fee waiver, a waiver shall be granted for those records.

    Subpart K—Other Rights and Services

      § 105-60.900   Coda.

#### § § 105-60.900

      Nothing in this subpart shall be construed to entitle any person, as of right, to any service or to the disclosure of any record to which such person is not entitled under the FOIA.

    Subpart L—Production or Disclosure by Present or Former General Services Administration Employees in Response to Subpoenas or Similar Demands in Judicial or Administrative Proceedings

**Source:** Source: 85 FR 52050, Aug. 24, 2020, unless otherwise noted.

      § 105-60.1001   Purpose and scope of subpart.

#### § § 105-60.1001

      (a) By virtue of the authority vested in the Administrator of General Services by 5 U.S.C. 301 and 41 U.S.C. 121(c) this subpart establishes instructions and procedures to be followed by current and former employees of the General Services Administration in response to subpoenas or similar demands issued in judicial or administrative proceedings for production or disclosure of material or information obtained as part of the performance of a person's official duties or because of the person's official status. Nothing in these instructions applies to responses to subpoenas or demands issued by the Congress or in Federal grand jury proceedings.

      (b) This subpart provides instructions regarding the internal operations of GSA and the conduct of its employees, and is not intended and does not, and may not, be relied upon to create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law by a party against GSA.

      § 105-60.1002   Definitions.

    Subpart 105-62.1—Classified Materials

      § 105-62.101   Security classification categories.

#### § § 105-62.101

      As set forth in Executive Order 12065, official information or material which requires protection against unauthorized disclosure in the interests of the national defense or foreign relations of the United States (hereinafter collectively termed “national security”) shall be classified in one of three categories: Namely, Top Secret, Secret, or Confidential, depending on its degree of significance to the national security. No other categories shall be used to identify official information or material as requiring protection in the interests of national security except as otherwise expressly provided by statute. The three classification categories are defined as follows:

      (a)  Top Secret refers to that national security information which requires the highest degree of protection, and shall be applied only to such information as the unauthorized disclosure of which could reasonably be expected to cause exceptionally grave damage to the national security. Examples of exceptionally grave damage include armed hostilities against the United States or its allies, disruption of foreign relations vitally affecting the national security, intelligence sources and methods, and the compromise of vital national defense plans or complex cryptologic and communications systems. This classification shall be used with the utmost restraint.

      (b)  Secret refers to that national security information or material which requires a substantial degree of protection, and shall be applied only to such information as the unauthorized disclosure of which could reasonably be expected to cause serious damage to the national security. Examples of serious damage include disruption of foreign relations significantly affecting the national security, significant impairment of a program or policy directly related to the national security, and revelation of significant military plans or intelligence operations. This classification shall be used sparingly.

      (c)  Confidential refers to other national security information which requires protection, and shall be applied only to such information as the unauthorized disclosure of which could reasonably be expected to cause identifiable damage to the national security.

      § 105-62.102   Authority to originally classify.

#### § § 105-62.102

      (a)  The authority to originally classify information as Top Secret, Secret, or Confidential may be exercised only by the Administrator and is delegable only to the Director, Information Security Oversight Office.

      (b)  Delegations of original classification authority are limited to the minimum number absolutely required for efficient administration. Delegated original classification authority may not be redelegated.

> [47 FR 5416, Feb. 5, 1982]

      § 105-62.103   Access to GSA-originated materials.

#### § § 105-62.103

      Classified information shall not be disseminated outside the executive branch of the Government without the express permission of the GSA Security Officer except as otherwise provided in this § 105-62.103.

      (a)  Persons outside the executive branch who are engaged in historical research projects, may be authorized access to classified information or material, provided that:

      (1) A written determination is made by the Administrator of General Services that such access is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.

      (2) Access is limited to that information over which GSA has classification jurisdiction.

      (3) The material requested is reasonably accessible and can be located with a reasonable amount of effort.

      (4) The person agrees to safeguard the information and to authorize a review of his or her notes and manuscript for determination that no classified information is contained therein by signing a statement entitled “Conditions Governing Access to Official Records for Historical Research Purposes.”

      (5) An authorization for access shall be valid for a period of 2 years from the date of issuance and may be renewed under the provisions of this § 105-62.103(a).

      (b)  Persons who previously occupied policymaking positions to which they were appointed by the President may not remove classified information or material upon departure from office as all such material must remain under the security control of the U.S. Government. Such persons may be authorized access to classified information or material which they originated, received, reviewed, signed, or which was addressed to them while in public office, provided that the GSA element having classification jurisdiction for such information or material makes a written determination that access is consistent with the interests of national security, approval is granted by the GSA Security Officer, and the individual seeking access agrees:

      (1) To safeguard the information,

      (2) To authorize a review of his or her notes for determination that no classified information is contained therein, and

      (3) To ensure that no classified information will be further disseminated or published.

      (c)  Classified information will not normally be released in the course of any civilian judicial proceeding. In special circumstances however, and upon the receipt of an order or subpoena issued by a Federal court, the Administrator may authorize the limited release of classified information if he or she determines that the interests of justice cannot otherwise be served. Appropriate safeguards will be established to protect such classified material released for use in judicial proceedings.

      (d)  The Archivist of the United States prepares procedures governing access to materials transferred to NARS custody. These procedures are issued by the Administrator of General Services in 41 CFR part 105-61.

      (e)  Classified information may be released to the General Accounting Office (GAO) and congressional committees when specifically authorized by the GSA Security Officer except as otherwise provided by law.

    Subpart 105-62.2—Declassification and Downgrading

      § 105-62.201   Declassification and downgrading.

#### § § 105-62.201

      (a)  The authority to downgrade and declassify national security information or material shall be exercised as follows:

      (1) Information or material may be downgraded or declassified by the GSA official authorizing the original classification, by a successor in capacity, by a supervisory official of either, or by the Information Security Oversight Committee on appeal.

      (2) Downgrading and declassification authority may also be exercised by an official specifically authorized by the Administrator.

      (3) In the case of classified information or material officially transferred to GSA by or under statute or Executive order in conjunction with a transfer of functions and not merely for storage purposes, GSA shall be deemed the originating agency for all purposes under these procedures including downgrading and declassification.

      (4) In the case of classified information or material held in GSA not officially transferred under paragraph (a)(3) of this section but originated in an agency which has since ceased to exist, GSA is deemed the originating agency. Such information or material may be downgraded and declassified 30 calendar days after consulting with any other agencies having an interest in the subject matter.

      (5) Classified information or material under the final declassification jurisdiction of GSA which has been transferred to NARS for accession into the Archives of the United States may be downgraded and declassified by the Archivist of the United States in accordance with Executive Order 12065, directives of the Information Security Oversight Office, and the systematic review guidelines issued by the Administrator of General Services.

      (6) It is presumed that information which continues to meet classification requirements requires continued protection. In some cases, however, the need to protect such information may be outweighed by the public interest in disclosure of the information, and in these cases the information should be declassified. When such questions arise they shall be referred to the Administrator, the Director of the Information Security Oversight Office, or in accordance with the procedures for mandatory review described in § 105-62.202(b).

      (b)  Declassification of information shall be given emphasis comparable to that accorded classification. Information classified under Executive Order 12065 and prior orders shall be declassified as early as national security considerations permit. Decisions concerning declassification shall be based on the loss of sensitivity of the information with the passage of time or on the occurrence of an event which permits declassification. When information is reviewed for declassification it shall be declassified unless the declassification authority established in § 105-62.202 determines that the information continues to meet the classification requirements prescribed despite the passage of time.

      (c)  Classified information that is marked for automatic downgrading is downgraded accordingly without notification to holders. Classified information that is not marked for automatic downgrading may be assigned a lower classification designation by the originator or by an official authorized to declassify the same information. Notice of downgrading shall be provided to known holders of the information.

      § 105-62.202   Review of classified materials for declassification purposes.

#### § § 105-62.202

      (a)  Except for foreign government information, classified information constituting permanently valuable records of GSA as defined by 44 U.S.C. 2103, and information in the possession and under control of NARA, under 44 U.S.C. 2107 or 2107 note, shall be reviewed for declassification as it becomes 20 years old. Transition to systematic review at 20 years shall be implemented as rapidly as practicable and shall be completed by December 1, 1988. Foreign government information shall be reviewed for declassification as it becomes 30 years old.

      (b)  All classified information upon request by a member of the public or a Government employee or agency to declassify and release such information under the provisions of Executive Order 12065 shall be reviewed by the responsible GSA element for possible declassification in accordance with the procedures set forth in paragraphs (c) through (g) of this section.

      (c)  Requests for mandatory review of classified information shall be submitted in accordance with the following:

      (1) Requests originating within GSA shall in all cases be submitted directly to the service or staff office that originated the information.

      (2) For expeditious action, requests from other governmental agencies or from members of the public should be submitted directly to the service or staff office that originated the material, or, if the originating element is not known, or no longer exists, the requester shall submit the request to the GSA Security Officer who shall cause such request to be reviewed.

      (d)  Requests for declassification review and release of information shall be processed in accordance with the provisions set forth in paragraphs (e) through (h) of this section subject to the following conditions:

      (1) The request is in writing and reasonably describes the information sought with sufficient particularity to enable the element to identify it.

      (2) The requester shall be asked to correct a request that does not comply with paragraph (d)(1) of this section, to provide additional information.

      (3) If within 30 days the requester does not correct the request, describe the information sought with sufficient particularity or narrow the scope of the request, the element that received the request shall notify the requester and state the reason why no action will be taken on the request.

      (e)  Requests that meet the foregoing requirements for processing will be acted upon as follows:

      (1) GSA action upon the initial request shall be completed within 60 days.

      (2) Receipt of the request shall be acknowledged within 7 days.

      (3) The designated service or staff office shall determine if the requested information may be declassified and shall make such information available to the requester, unless withholding it is otherwise warranted under applicable law. If the information may not be released in whole or in part, the requester shall be given a brief statement as to the reasons for denial, a notice of the right to appeal the determination to the Deputy Administrator (the notice shall include the Deputy Administrator's name, title, and address), and a notice that such an appeal must be filed with the Deputy Administrator within 60 days in order to be considered.

      (f)  Except as provided hereinafter, requests for mandatory review for the declassification of classified documents that contain foreign government information shall be processed and acted upon in accordance with the provisions of paragraphs (c) through (e) of this section. If the request involves information that was initially received or classified by GSA, then the corresponding service or staff office shall be designated by the GSA Security Officer to determine whether the foreign government information in the document may be declassified and released in accordance with GSA policy or guidelines, after consulting with other agencies that have subject matter interest as necessary. If GSA is not the agency that received or classified the foreign government information, it shall refer the request to the appropriate agency. In those cases where agency policy or guidelines do not apply, consultation with the foreign originator, through the GSA Security Officer, may be made prior to final action on the request.

      (g)  When a service or staff office receives a request for declassification of information in a document which is in the custody of the service or staff office but was classified by another service or staff office or by another Government agency, the service or staff office shall refer the request to the classifying service or staff office or Government agency, together with a copy of the document containing the information requested when practicable, and shall notify the requester of the referral, unless the agency that classified the information objects on the grounds that its association with the information requires protection. When a GSA service or staff office receives such a referral, it shall process the request in accordance with the requirements of this paragraph and, if so requested, shall notify the referring service, staff office, or agency of the determination made on the request.

      (h)  The following procedures shall be followed when denials of requests for declassification are appealed:

      (1) The Deputy Administrator shall, within 15 days of the date of the appeal, convene a meeting of the GSA Information Security Oversight Committee (ISOC) that shall include the GSA Security Officer, or his or her representative, and the GSA official who denied the original request (and, at the option of that official, any subordinates or personnel from other agencies that participated in the decision for denial).

      (2) The ISOC shall learn from the official the reasons for denying the request, concentrating in particular upon which requirement continued classification is based and the identifiable damage that would result if the information were declassified. The ISOC shall also learn from the official the part or parts of the information that is classified and if by deleting minor segments of the information it might not then be declassified.

      (3) The ISOC's decision to uphold or deny the appeal, in whole or in part, shall be based upon the unanimous opinion of its membership. In the event that unanimity cannot be attained, the matter shall be referred to the Administrator, whose decision shall be final.

      (4) Based upon the outcome of the appeal, a reply shall be made to the person making the appeal that either encloses the requested information or part of the information, or explains why the continued classification of the information is required. A copy of the reply shall be sent to the GSA official who originally denied the request for declassification, to the GSA Security Officer, and to any other agency expressing an interest in the decision.

      (5) Final action on appeals shall be completed within 30 days of the date of the appeal.

      (i)  No service of staff office in possession of a classified document may refuse to confirm the existence of the document in response to a request for the document under the provisions for mandatory review, unless the fact of its existence would itself be classifiable.

      (j)  Information less than 10 years old which was originated by the President, by the White House staff, or by committees or commissions appointed by the President, or by others acting on behalf of the President, is exempted from mandatory review for declassification. Such information 10 years old or older is subject to mandatory review for declassification in accordance with procedures developed by the Archivist of the United States which provide for consultation with GSA on matters of primary subject interest to this agency.

    § 105-62.000   Scope of part.

#### § § 105-62.000

    This part prescribes procedures for safeguarding national security information and material within GSA.

  PART 105-64—GSA PRIVACY ACT RULES

### Part 105

**Authority:** Authority: 5 U.S.C. 552a.

**Source:** Source: 74 FR 66246, Dec. 15, 2009, unless otherwise noted.

    Subpart 105-64.1—Policies and Responsibilities

      § 105-64.101   Who is responsible for enforcing these rules?

#### § § 105-64.101

      GSA Heads of Services and Staff Offices and Regional Administrators are responsible for ensuring that all systems of records under their jurisdiction meet the provisions of the Privacy Act and these rules. System managers are responsible for the system(s) of records assigned to them. The GSA Privacy Act Officer oversees the GSA Privacy Program and establishes privacy-related policy and procedures for the agency under the direction of the GSA Senior Agency Official for Privacy.

      § 105-64.102   What is GSA's policy on disclosure of information in a system of records?

#### § § 105-64.102

      No information contained in a Privacy Act system of records will be disclosed to third parties without the written consent of you, the individual of record, except under the conditions cited in § 105-64.501.

      § 105-64.103   What is GSA's policy on collecting and using information in a system of records?

#### § § 105-64.103

      System managers must collect information that is used to determine your rights, benefits, or privileges under GSA programs directly from you whenever practical, and use the information only for the intended purpose(s).

      § 105-64.104   What must the system manager tell me when soliciting personal information?

#### § § 105-64.104

      When soliciting information from you or a third party for a system of records, system managers must: Cite the authority for collecting the information; say whether providing the information is mandatory or voluntary; give the purpose for which the information will be used; state the routine uses of the information; and describe the effect on you, if any, of not providing the information. This information is found in the Privacy Act Statement. Any form that asks for personal information will contain this statement.

      § 105-64.105   When may Social Security Numbers (SSNs) be collected?

#### § § 105-64.105

      (a) Statutory or regulatory authority must exist for collecting Social Security Numbers for record systems that use the SSNs as a method of identification. Systems without statutory or regulatory authority implemented after January 1, 1975, will not collect Social Security Numbers.

      (b) In compliance with OMB M-07-16 (Safeguarding Against and Responding to the Breach of Personally Identifiable Information) collection and storage of SSN will be limited to systems where no other identifier is currently available. While GSA will strive to reduce the collection and storage of SSN and other PII we recognize that some systems continue to need to collect this information.

      § 105-64.106   What is GSA's policy on information accuracy in a system of records?

#### § § 105-64.106

      System managers will ensure that all Privacy Act records are accurate, relevant, necessary, timely, and complete. All GSA systems are reviewed annually. Those systems that contain Personally Identifiable Information (PII) are reviewed to ensure they are relevant, necessary, accurate, up-to-date, and covered by the appropriate legal or regulatory authority. A listing of GSA Privacy Act Systems can be found at the following link ().

      § 105-64.107   What standards of conduct apply to employees with privacy-related responsibilities?

#### § § 105-64.107

      (a) Employees who design, develop, operate, or maintain Privacy Act record systems will protect system security, avoid unauthorized disclosure of information, both verbal and written, and ensure that no system of records is maintained without public notice. All such employees will follow the standards of conduct in 5 CFR part 2635, 5 CFR part 6701, 5 CFR part 735, and 5 CFR part 2634 to protect personal information.

      (b) Employees who have access to privacy act records will avoid unauthorized disclosure of personal information, both written and verbal, and ensure they have met privacy training requirements. All such employees will follow GSA orders HCO 9297.1 GSA Data Release Policy, HCO 9297.2A GSA Information Breach Notification Policy, HCO 2180.1 GSA Rules of Behavior for Handling Personally Identifiable Information (PII), CIO P 2100.1E CIO P GSA Information Technology (IT) Security Policy, and CIO 2104.1 GSA Information Technology (IT) General Rules of Behavior.

      (c)(1) The following conditions must be met for the inclusion of an unredacted (full) SSN or partially redacted (truncated) SSN on any document sent by mail on behalf of the agency:

      (i) The inclusion of the full SSN or truncated SSN of an individual must be required or authorized by law; and

      (ii) The document must be listed on the USMDL.

#### § § 105-68.120

      (a) The Administrator of General Services may grant an exception permitting an excluded person to participate in a particular covered transaction. If the Administrator of General Services grants an exception, the exception must be in writing and state the reason(s) for deviating from the governmentwide policy in Executive Order 12549.

      (b) An exception granted by one agency for an excluded person does not extend to the covered transactions of another agency.

      § 105-68.125   Does an exclusion under the nonprocurement system affect a person's eligibility for Federal procurement contracts?

#### § § 105-68.125

      If any Federal agency excludes a person under its nonprocurement common rule on or after August 25, 1995, the excluded person is also ineligible to participate in Federal procurement transactions under the FAR. Therefore, an exclusion under this part has reciprocal effect in Federal procurement transactions.

      § 105-68.130   Does exclusion under the Federal procurement system affect a person's eligibility to participate in nonprocurement transactions?

#### § § 105-68.130

      If any Federal agency excludes a person under the FAR on or after August 25, 1995, the excluded person is also ineligible to participate in nonprocurement covered transactions under this part. Therefore, an exclusion under the FAR has reciprocal effect in Federal nonprocurement transactions.

      § 105-68.135   May the General Services Administration exclude a person who is not currently participating in a nonprocurement transaction?

#### § § 105-68.135

      Given a cause that justifies an exclusion under this part, we may exclude any person who has been involved, is currently involved, or may reasonably be expected to be involved in a covered transaction.

      § 105-68.140   How do I know if a person is excluded?

#### § § 105-68.140

      Check the  to determine whether a person is excluded. The General Services Administration (GSA) maintains the  and makes it available, as detailed in subpart E of this part. When a Federal agency takes an action to exclude a person under the nonprocurement or procurement debarment and suspension system, the agency enters the information about the excluded person into the

      § 105-68.145   Does this part address persons who are disqualified, as well as those who are excluded from nonprocurement transactions?

#### § § 105-68.145

      Except if provided for in Subpart J of this part, this part—

      (a) Addresses disqualified persons only to—

      (1) Provide for their inclusion in the  and

      (2) State responsibilities of Federal agencies and participants to check for disqualified persons before entering into covered transactions.

      (b) Does not specify the—

      (1) GSA transactions for which a disqualified person is ineligible. Those transactions vary on a case-by-case basis, because they depend on the language of the specific statute, Executive order, or regulation that caused the disqualification;

      (2) Entities to which the disqualification applies; or

      (3) Process that the agency uses to disqualify a person. Unlike exclusion, disqualification is frequently not a discretionary action that a Federal agency takes.

    Subpart B—Covered Transactions

      § 105-68.200   What is a covered transaction?

#### § § 105-68.200

      A covered transaction is a nonprocurement or procurement transaction that is subject to the prohibitions of this part. It may be a transaction at—

      (a) The primary tier, between a Federal agency and a person (see appendix to this part); or

      (b) A lower tier, between a participant in a covered transaction and another person.

      § 105-68.205   Why is it important if a particular transaction is a covered transaction?

#### § § 105-68.205

      The importance of a covered transaction depends upon who you are.

      (a) As a participant in the transaction, you have the responsibilities laid out in subpart C of this part. Those include responsibilities to the person or Federal agency at the next higher tier from whom you received the transaction, if any. They also include responsibilities if you subsequently enter into other covered transactions with persons at the next lower tier.

      (b) As a Federal official who enters into a primary tier transaction, you have the responsibilities laid out in subpart D of this part.

      (c) As an excluded person, you may not be a participant or principal in the transaction unless—

      (1) The person who entered into the transaction with you allows you to continue your involvement in a transaction that predates your exclusion, as permitted under § 105-68.310 or § 105-68.415; or

      (2) A(n) GSA official obtains an exception from the Administrator of General Services to allow you to be involved in the transaction, as permitted under § 105-68.120.

      § 105-68.210   Which nonprocurement transactions are covered transactions?

#### § § 105-68.210

      All nonprocurement transactions, as defined in § 105-68.970, are covered transactions unless listed in § 105-68.215. (See appendix to this part.)

      § 105-68.215   Which nonprocurement transactions are not covered transactions?

#### § § 105-68.215

      The following types of nonprocurement transactions are not covered transactions:

      (a) A direct award to—

      (1) A foreign government or foreign governmental entity;

      (2) A public international organization;

      (3) An entity owned (in whole or in part) or controlled by a foreign government; or

      (4) Any other entity consisting wholly or partially of one or more foreign governments or foreign governmental entities.

      (b) A benefit to an individual as a personal entitlement without regard to the individual's present responsibility (but benefits received in an individual's business capacity are not excepted). For example, if a person receives social security benefits under the Supplemental Security Income provisions of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. 1301  those benefits are not covered transactions and, therefore, are not affected if the person is excluded.

      (c) Federal employment.

      (d) A transaction that the General Services Administration needs to respond to a national or agency-recognized emergency or disaster.

      (e) A permit, license, certificate, or similar instrument issued as a means to regulate public health, safety, or the environment, unless the General Services Administration specifically designates it to be a covered transaction.

      (f) An incidental benefit that results from ordinary governmental operations.

      (g) Any other transaction if the application of an exclusion to the transaction is prohibited by law.

      § 105-68.220   Are any procurement contracts included as covered transactions?

#### § § 105-68.220

      (a) Covered transactions under this part—

      (1) Do not include any procurement contracts awarded directly by a Federal agency; but

      (2) Do include some procurement contracts awarded by non-Federal participants in nonprocurement covered transactions (see appendix to this part).

      (b) Specifically, a contract for goods or services is a covered transaction if any of the following applies:

      (1) The contract is awarded by a participant in a nonprocurement transaction that is covered under § 105-68.210, and the amount of the contract is expected to equal or exceed $25,000.

      (2) The contract requires the consent of a(n) GSA official. In that case, the contract, regardless of the amount, always is a covered transaction, and it does not matter who awarded it. For example, it could be a subcontract awarded by a contractor at a tier below a nonprocurement transaction, as shown in the appendix to this part.

      (3) The contract is for federally-required audit services.

      § 105-68.225   How do I know if a transaction in which I may participate is a covered transaction?

#### § § 105-68.225

      As a participant in a transaction, you will know that it is a covered transaction because the agency regulations governing the transaction, the appropriate agency official, or participant at the next higher tier who enters into the transaction with you, will tell you that you must comply with applicable portions of this part.

    Subpart C—Responsibilities of Participants Regarding Transactions

      Doing Business With Other Persons

        § 105-68.300   What must I do before I enter into a covered transaction with another person at the next lower tier?

#### § § 105-68.300

        When you enter into a covered transaction with another person at the next lower tier, you must verify that the person with whom you intend to do business is not excluded or disqualified. You do this by:

        (a) Checking the  or

        (b) Collecting a certification from that person if allowed by this rule; or

#### § § 105-68.310

        (a) You as a participant may continue covered transactions with an excluded person if the transactions were in existence when the agency excluded the person. However, you are not required to continue the transactions, and you may consider termination. You should make a decision about whether to terminate and the type of termination action, if any, only after a thorough review to ensure that the action is proper and appropriate.

        (b) You may not renew or extend covered transactions (other than no-cost time extensions) with any excluded person, unless the General Services Administration grants an exception under § 105-68.120.

        § 105-68.315   May I use the services of an excluded person as a principal under a covered transaction?

#### § § 105-68.315

        (a) You as a participant may continue to use the services of an excluded person as a principal under a covered transaction if you were using the services of that person in the transaction before the person was excluded. However, you are not required to continue using that person's services as a principal. You should make a decision about whether to discontinue that person's services only after a thorough review to ensure that the action is proper and appropriate.

        (b) You may not begin to use the services of an excluded person as a principal under a covered transaction unless the General Services Administration grants an exception under § 105-68.120.

        § 105-68.320   Must I verify that principals of my covered transactions are eligible to participate?

#### § § 105-68.320

        Yes, you as a participant are responsible for determining whether any of your principals of your covered transactions is excluded or disqualified from participating in the transaction. You may decide the method and frequency by which you do so. You may, but you are not required to, check the

        § 105-68.325   What happens if I do business with an excluded person in a covered transaction?

#### § § 105-68.325

        If as a participant you knowingly do business with an excluded person, we may disallow costs, annul or terminate the transaction, issue a stop work order, debar or suspend you, or take other remedies as appropriate.

        § 105-68.330   What requirements must I pass down to persons at lower tiers with whom I intend to do business?

#### § § 105-68.330

        Before entering into a covered transaction with a participant at the next lower tier, you must require that participant to—

        (a) Comply with this subpart as a condition of participation in the transaction. You may do so using any method(s), unless § 105-68.440 requires you to use specific methods.

        (b) Pass the requirement to comply with this subpart to each person with whom the participant enters into a covered transaction at the next lower tier.

        (a) Are presently excluded or disqualified;

        (b) Have been convicted within the preceding three years of any of the offenses listed in § 105-68.800(a) or had a civil judgment rendered against you for one of those offenses within that time period;

        (c) Are presently indicted for or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity (Federal, State or local) with commission of any of the offenses listed in § 105-68.800(a); or

        (d) Have had one or more public transactions (Federal, State, or local) terminated within the preceding three years for cause or default.

        § 105-68.340   If I disclose unfavorable information required under § 105-68.335, will I be prevented from participating in the transaction?

#### § § 105-68.340

        As a primary tier participant, your disclosure of unfavorable information about yourself or a principal under § 105-68.335 will not necessarily cause us to deny your participation in the covered transaction. We will consider the information when we determine whether to enter into the covered transaction. We also will consider any additional information or explanation that you elect to submit with the disclosed information.

        § 105-68.345   What happens if I fail to disclose information required under § 105-68.335?

#### § § 105-68.345

        If we later determine that you failed to disclose information under § 105-68.335 that you knew at the time you entered into the covered transaction, we may—

        (a) Terminate the transaction for material failure to comply with the terms and conditions of the transaction; or

        (b) Pursue any other available remedies, including suspension and debarment.

        § 105-68.350   What must I do if I learn of information required under § 105-68.335 after entering into a covered transaction with the General Services Administration?

      (a) You as an agency official may continue covered transactions with an excluded person, or under which an excluded person is a principal, if the transactions were in existence when the person was excluded. You are not required to continue the transactions, however, and you may consider termination. You should make a decision about whether to terminate and the type of termination action, if any, only after a thorough review to ensure that the action is proper.

      In deciding whether to suspend or debar you, we handle the actions as informally as practicable, consistent with principles of fundamental fairness.

      (a) For suspension actions, we use the procedures in this subpart and subpart G of this part.

      (b) For debarment actions, we use the procedures in this subpart and subpart H of this part.

      § 105-68.615   How does the General Services Administration notify a person of a suspension or debarment action?

      § 105-68.620   Do Federal agencies coordinate suspension and debarment actions?

#### § § 105-68.620

      Yes, when more than one Federal agency has an interest in a suspension or debarment, the agencies may consider designating one agency as the lead agency for making the decision. Agencies are encouraged to establish methods and procedures for coordinating their suspension and debarment actions.

      § 105-68.625   What is the scope of a suspension or debarment?

#### § § 105-68.625

      If you are suspended or debarred, the suspension or debarment is effective as follows:

      (a) Your suspension or debarment constitutes suspension or debarment of all of your divisions and other organizational elements from all covered transactions, unless the suspension or debarment decision is limited—

      (1) By its terms to one or more specifically identified individuals, divisions, or other organizational elements; or

      (2) To specific types of transactions.

      (b) Any affiliate of a participant may be included in a suspension or debarment action if the suspending or debarring official—

      (1) Officially names the affiliate in the notice; and

      (2) Gives the affiliate an opportunity to contest the action.

      § 105-68.630   May the General Services Administration impute conduct of one person to another?

#### § § 105-68.630

      For purposes of actions taken under this rule, we may impute conduct as follows:

      (a)  We may impute the fraudulent, criminal, or other improper conduct of any officer, director, shareholder, partner, employee, or other individual associated with an organization, to that organization when the improper conduct occurred in connection with the individual's performance of duties for or on behalf of that organization, or with the organization's knowledge, approval or acquiescence. The organization's acceptance of the benefits derived from the conduct is evidence of knowledge, approval or acquiescence.

      (b)  We may impute the fraudulent, criminal, or other improper conduct of any organization to an individual, or from one individual to another individual, if the individual to whom the improper conduct is imputed either participated in, had knowledge of, or reason to know of the improper conduct.

      (c)  We may impute the fraudulent, criminal, or other improper conduct of one organization to another organization when the improper conduct occurred in connection with a partnership, joint venture, joint application, association or similar arrangement, or when the organization to whom the improper conduct is imputed has the power to direct, manage, control or influence the activities of the organization responsible for the improper conduct. Acceptance of the benefits derived from the conduct is evidence of knowledge, approval or acquiescence.

      § 105-68.635   May the General Services Administration settle a debarment or suspension action?

#### § § 105-68.635

      Yes, we may settle a debarment or suspension action at any time if it is in the best interest of the Federal Government.

      § 105-68.640   May a settlement include a voluntary exclusion?

#### § § 105-68.640

      Yes, if we enter into a settlement with you in which you agree to be excluded, it is called a voluntary exclusion and has governmentwide effect.

#### § § 105-68.645

      (a) Yes, we enter information regarding a voluntary exclusion into the

      (b) Also, any agency or person may contact us to find out the details of a voluntary exclusion.

    Subpart G—Suspension

      § 105-68.700   When may the suspending official issue a suspension?

#### § § 105-68.700

      Suspension is a serious action. Using the procedures of this subpart and subpart F of this part, the suspending official may impose suspension only when that official determines that—

      (a) There exists an indictment for, or other adequate evidence to suspect, an offense listed under § 105-68.800(a), or

      (b) There exists adequate evidence to suspect any other cause for debarment listed under § 105-68.800(b) through (d); and

      (c) Immediate action is necessary to protect the public interest.

      § 105-68.705   What does the suspending official consider in issuing a suspension?

#### § § 105-68.705

      (a) In determining the adequacy of the evidence to support the suspension, the suspending official considers how much information is available, how credible it is given the circumstances, whether or not important allegations are corroborated, and what inferences can reasonably be drawn as a result. During this assessment, the suspending official may examine the basic documents, including grants, cooperative agreements, loan authorizations, contracts, and other relevant documents.

      (b) An indictment, conviction, civil judgment, or other official findings by Federal, State, or local bodies that determine factual and/or legal matters, constitutes adequate evidence for purposes of suspension actions.

      (c) In deciding whether immediate action is needed to protect the public interest, the suspending official has wide discretion. For example, the suspending official may infer the necessity for immediate action to protect the public interest either from the nature of the circumstances giving rise to a cause for suspension or from potential business relationships or involvement with a program of the Federal Government.

      § 105-68.710   When does a suspension take effect?

#### § § 105-68.710

      A suspension is effective when the suspending official signs the decision to suspend.

      § 105-68.715   What notice does the suspending official give me if I am suspended?

#### § § 105-68.715

      After deciding to suspend you, the suspending official promptly sends you a Notice of Suspension advising you—

      (a) That you have been suspended;

      (b) That your suspension is based on—

      (1) An indictment;

      (2) A conviction;

      (3) Other adequate evidence that you have committed irregularities which seriously reflect on the propriety of further Federal Government dealings with you; or

      (4) Conduct of another person that has been imputed to you, or your affiliation with a suspended or debarred person;

      (c) Of any other irregularities in terms sufficient to put you on notice without disclosing the Federal Government's evidence;

      (d) Of the cause(s) upon which we relied under § 105-68.700 for imposing suspension;

      (e) That your suspension is for a temporary period pending the completion of an investigation or resulting legal or debarment proceedings;

      (f) Of the applicable provisions of this subpart, subpart F of this part, and any other GSA procedures governing suspension decision making; and

      (g) Of the governmentwide effect of your suspension from procurement and nonprocurement programs and activities.

      § 105-68.720   How may I contest a suspension?

#### § § 105-68.720

      If you as a respondent wish to contest a suspension, you or your representative must provide the suspending official with information in opposition to the suspension. You may do this orally or in writing, but any information provided orally that you consider important must also be submitted in writing for the official record.

      § 105-68.725   How much time do I have to contest a suspension?

#### § § 105-68.725

      (b) We consider the notice to be received by you—

      (1) When delivered, if we mail the notice to the last known street address, or five days after we send it if the letter is undeliverable;

      (2) When sent, if we send the notice by facsimile or five days after we send it if the facsimile is undeliverable; or

      (3) When delivered, if we send the notice by e-mail or five days after we send it if the e-mail is undeliverable.

      § 105-68.730   What information must I provide to the suspending official if I contest a suspension?

      (a) In addition to any information and argument in opposition, as a respondent your submission to the suspending official must identify—

      (1) Specific facts that contradict the statements contained in the Notice of Suspension. A general denial is insufficient to raise a genuine dispute over facts material to the suspension;

      (2) All existing, proposed, or prior exclusions under regulations implementing E.O. 12549 and all similar actions taken by Federal, state, or local agencies, including administrative agreements that affect only those agencies;

      (3) All criminal and civil proceedings not included in the Notice of Suspension that grew out of facts relevant to the cause(s) stated in the notice; and

      (4) All of your affiliates.

      § 105-68.735   Under what conditions do I get an additional opportunity to challenge the facts on which the suspension is based?

#### § § 105-68.735

      (a) You as a respondent will not have an additional opportunity to challenge the facts if the suspending official determines that—

      (1) Your suspension is based upon an indictment, conviction, civil judgment, or other finding by a Federal, State, or local body for which an opportunity to contest the facts was provided;

      (2) Your presentation in opposition contains only general denials to information contained in the Notice of Suspension;

      (3) The issues raised in your presentation in opposition to the suspension are not factual in nature, or are not material to the suspending official's initial decision to suspend, or the official's decision whether to continue the suspension; or

      (4) On the basis of advice from the Department of Justice, an office of the United States Attorney, a State attorney general's office, or a State or local prosecutor's office, that substantial interests of the government in pending or contemplated legal proceedings based on the same facts as the suspension would be prejudiced by conducting fact-finding.

      (b) You will have an opportunity to challenge the facts if the suspending official determines that—

      (1) The conditions in paragraph (a) of this section do not exist; and

      (2) Your presentation in opposition raises a genuine dispute over facts material to the suspension.

      (c) If you have an opportunity to challenge disputed material facts under this section, the suspending official or designee must conduct additional proceedings to resolve those facts.

      § 105-68.740   Are suspension proceedings formal?

#### § § 105-68.740

      (a) Suspension proceedings are conducted in a fair and informal manner. The suspending official may use flexible procedures to allow you to present matters in opposition.

      § 105-68.750   What does the suspending official consider in deciding whether to continue or terminate my suspension?

#### § § 105-68.750

      (a) The suspending official bases the decision on all information contained in the official record. The record includes—

      (1) All information in support of the suspending official's initial decision to suspend you;

      (2) Any further information and argument presented in support of, or opposition to, the suspension; and

      (3) Any transcribed record of fact-finding proceedings.

      (b) The suspending official may refer disputed material facts to another official for findings of fact. The suspending official may reject any resulting findings, in whole or in part, only after specifically determining them to be arbitrary, capricious, or clearly erroneous.

      § 105-68.755   When will I know whether the suspension is continued or terminated?

#### § § 105-68.755

      The suspending official must make a written decision whether to continue, modify, or terminate your suspension within 45 days of closing the official record. The official record closes upon the suspending official's receipt of final submissions, information and findings of fact, if any. The suspending official may extend that period for good cause.

      § 105-68.760   How long may my suspension last?

#### § § 105-68.760

      (a) If legal or debarment proceedings are initiated at the time of, or during your suspension, the suspension may continue until the conclusion of those proceedings. However, if proceedings are not initiated, a suspension may not exceed 12 months.

      (b) The suspending official may extend the 12 month limit under paragraph (a) of this section for an additional 6 months if an office of a U.S. Assistant Attorney General, U.S. Attorney, or other responsible prosecuting official requests an extension in writing. In no event may a suspension exceed 18 months without initiating proceedings under paragraph (a) of this section.

      (c) The suspending official must notify the appropriate officials under paragraph (b) of this section of an impending termination of a suspension at least 30 days before the 12 month period expires to allow the officials an opportunity to request an extension.

      § 105-68.860   What factors may influence the debarring official's decision?

#### § § 105-68.860

      This section lists the mitigating and aggravating factors that the debarring official may consider in determining whether to debar you and the length of your debarment period. The debarring official may consider other factors if appropriate in light of the circumstances of a particular case. The existence or nonexistence of any factor, such as one of those set forth in this section, is not necessarily determinative of your present responsibility. In making a debarment decision, the debarring official may consider the following factors:

      (a) The actual or potential harm or impact that results or may result from the wrongdoing.

      (b) The frequency of incidents and/or duration of the wrongdoing.

      (c) Whether there is a pattern or prior history of wrongdoing. For example, if you have been found by another Federal agency or a State agency to have engaged in wrongdoing similar to that found in the debarment action, the existence of this fact may be used by the debarring official in determining that you have a pattern or prior history of wrongdoing.

      (d) Whether you are or have been excluded or disqualified by an agency of the Federal Government or have not been allowed to participate in State or local contracts or assistance agreements on a basis of conduct similar to one or more of the causes for debarment specified in this part.

      (e) Whether you have entered into an administrative agreement with a Federal agency or a State or local government that is not governmentwide but is based on conduct similar to one or more of the causes for debarment specified in this part.

      (f) Whether and to what extent you planned, initiated, or carried out the wrongdoing.

      (g) Whether you have accepted responsibility for the wrongdoing and recognize the seriousness of the misconduct that led to the cause for debarment.

      (h) Whether you have paid or agreed to pay all criminal, civil and administrative liabilities for the improper activity, including any investigative or administrative costs incurred by the government, and have made or agreed to make full restitution.

      (i) Whether you have cooperated fully with the government agencies during the investigation and any court or administrative action. In determining the extent of cooperation, the debarring official may consider when the cooperation began and whether you disclosed all pertinent information known to you.

      (j) Whether the wrongdoing was pervasive within your organization.

      (k) The kind of positions held by the individuals involved in the wrongdoing.

      (l) Whether your organization took appropriate corrective action or remedial measures, such as establishing ethics training and implementing programs to prevent recurrence.

      (m) Whether your principals tolerated the offense.

      (n) Whether you brought the activity cited as a basis for the debarment to the attention of the appropriate government agency in a timely manner.

      (o) Whether you have fully investigated the circumstances surrounding the cause for debarment and, if so, made the result of the investigation available to the debarring official.

      (p) Whether you had effective standards of conduct and internal control systems in place at the time the questioned conduct occurred.

      (q) Whether you have taken appropriate disciplinary action against the individuals responsible for the activity which constitutes the cause for debarment.

      (r) Whether you have had adequate time to eliminate the circumstances within your organization that led to the cause for the debarment.

      (s) Other factors that are appropriate to the circumstances of a particular case.

      § 105-68.865   How long may my debarment last?

#### § § 105-68.865

      (a) If the debarring official decides to debar you, your period of debarment will be based on the seriousness of the cause(s) upon which your debarment is based. Generally, debarment should not exceed three years. However, if circumstances warrant, the debarring official may impose a longer period of debarment.

      (b) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, “professional and technical services” shall be limited to advice and analysis directly applying any professional or technical discipline. For example, drafting of a legal document accompanying a bid or proposal by a lawyer is allowable. Similarly, technical advice provided by an engineer on the performance or operational capability of a piece of equipment rendered directly in the negotiation of a contract is allowable. However, communications with the intent to influence made by a professional (such as a licensed lawyer) or a technical person (such as a licensed accountant) are not allowable under this section unless they provide advice and analysis directly applying their professional or technical expertise and unless the advice or analysis is rendered directly and solely in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered Federal action. Thus, for example, communications with the intent to influence made by a lawyer that do not provide legal advice or analysis directly and solely related to the legal aspects of his or her client's proposal, but generally advocate one proposal over another are not allowable under this section because the lawyer is not providing professional legal services. Similarly, communications with the intent to influence made by an engineer providing an engineering analysis prior to the preparation or submission of a bid or proposal are not allowable under this section since the engineer is providing technical services but not directly in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered Federal action.

      (c) Requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for receiving a covered Federal award include those required by law or regulation, or reasonably expected to be required by law or regulation, and any other requirements in the actual award documents.

      (d) Only those services expressly authorized by this section are allowable under this section.

      § 105-69.210   Reporting.

#### § § 105-69.210

      No reporting is required with respect to payments of reasonable compensation made to regularly employed officers or employees of a person.

    Subpart C—Activities by Other Than Own Employees

      § 105-69.300   Professional and technical services.

#### § § 105-69.300

      (a) The prohibition on the use of appropriated funds, in § 105-69.100 (a), does not apply in the case of any reasonable payment to a person, other than an officer or employee of a person requesting or receiving a covered Federal action, if the payment is for professional or technical services rendered directly in the preparation, submission, or negotiation of any bid, proposal, or application for that Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement or for meeting requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for receiving that Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement.

      (b) The reporting requirements in § 105-69.110 (a) and (b) regarding filing a disclosure form by each person, if required, shall not apply with respect to professional or technical services rendered directly in the preparation, submission, or negotiation of any commitment providing for the United States to insure or guarantee a loan.

      (c) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, “professional and technical services” shall be limited to advice and analysis directly applying any professional or technical discipline. For example, drafting or a legal document accompanying a bid or proposal by a lawyer is allowable. Similarly, technical advice provided by an engineer on the performance or operational capability of a piece of equipment rendered directly in the negotiation of a contract is allowable. However, communications with the intent to influence made by a professional (such as a licensed lawyer) or a technical person (such as a licensed accountant) are not allowable under this section unless they provide advice and analysis directly applying their professional or technical expertise and unless the advice or analysis is rendered directly and solely in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered Federal action. Thus, for example, communications with the intent to influence made by a lawyer that do not provide legal advice or analysis directly and solely related to the legal aspects of his or her client's proposal, but generally advocate one proposal over another are not allowable under this section because the lawyer is not providing professional legal services. Similarly, communications with the intent to influence made by an engineer providing an engineering analysis prior to the preparation or submission of a bid or proposal are not allowable under this section since the engineer is providing technical services but not directly in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered Federal action.

      (d) Requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for receiving a covered Federal award include those required by law or regulation, or reasonably expected to be required by law or regulation, and any other requirements in the actual award documents.

      (e) Persons other than officers or employees of a person requesting or receiving a covered Federal action include consultants and trade associations.

      (f) Only those services expressly authorized by this section are allowable under this section.

    Subpart D—Penalties and Enforcement

      § 105-69.400   Penalties.

#### § § 105-69.400

      (a) Any person who makes an expenditure prohibited herein shall be subject to a civil penalty of not less than $10,000 and not more than $100,000 for each such expenditure.

      (b) Any person who fails to file or amend the disclosure form (see appendix B) to be filed or amended if required herein, shall be subject to a civil penalty of not less than $10,000 and not more than $100,000 for each such failure.

      (c) A filing or amended filing on or after the date on which an administrative action for the imposition of a civil penalty is commenced does not prevent the imposition of such civil penalty for a failure occurring before that date. An administrative action is commenced with respect to a failure when an investigating official determines in writing to commence an investigation of an allegation of such failure.

      (d) In determining whether to impose a civil penalty, and the amount of any such penalty, by reason of a violation by any person, the agency shall consider the nature, circumstances, extent, and gravity of the violation, the effect on the ability of such person to continue in business, any prior violations by such person, the degree of culpability of such person, the ability of the person to pay the penalty, and such other matters as may be appropriate.

      (e) First offenders under paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section shall be subject to a civil penalty of $10,000, absent aggravating circumstances. Second and subsequent offenses by persons shall be subject to an appropriate civil penalty between $10,000 and $100,000, as determined by the agency head or his or her designee.

      (f) An imposition of a civil penalty under this section does not prevent the United States from seeking any other remedy that may apply to the same conduct that is the basis for the imposition of such civil penalty.

      § 105-69.405   Penalty procedures.

#### § § 105-69.405

      Agencies shall impose and collect civil penalties pursuant to the provisions of the Program Fraud and Civil Remedies Act, 31 U.S.C. sections 3803 (except subsection (c)), 3804, 3805, 3806, 3807, 3808, and 3812, insofar as these provisions are not inconsistent with the requirements herein.

The Secretary shall transmit a copy of each such written exemption to Congress immediately after making such a determination.

      (b) The Department of Defense may issue supplemental regulations to implement paragraph (a) of this section.

Such information shall not be available for public inspection.

      (d) Information that is classified under Executive Order 12356 or any successor order shall be reported only to the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate and the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives or the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of Representatives (whichever such committees have jurisdiction of matters involving such information) and to the Committees on Appropriations of the Senate and the House of Representatives in accordance with procedures agreed to by such committees. Such information shall not be available for public inspection.

Other charges such as the cost of installation, transportation, taxes, duty or protective in-transit insurance, shall be included or excluded from the unit acquisition cost in accordance with the grantee's regular accounting practices.

      requirements mean those matters common to grants in general, such as financial management, kinds and frequency of reports, and retention of records. These are distinguished from  requirements, which concern matters that can be treated only on a program-by-program or grant-by-grant basis, such as kinds of activities that can be supported by grants under a particular program.

      means (1) with respect to a grant, the Federal agency, and (2) with respect to a subgrant, the party that awarded the subgrant.

      means the grantee's cash outlay, including the outlay of money contributed to the grantee or subgrantee by other public agencies and institutions, and private organizations and individuals. When authorized by Federal legislation, Federal funds received from other assistance agreements may be considered as grantee or subgrantee cash constributions.

      means a State or local government or a federally recognized Indian tribal government.

      means an award of financial assistance, including cooperative agreements, in the form of money, or property in lieu of money, by the Federal Government to an eligible grantee.

Also, the term does not include assistance, such as a fellowship or other lump sum award, which the grantee is not required to account for.

For reports prepared on a cash basis, outlays are the sum of actual cash disbursement for direct charges for goods and services, the amount of indirect expense incurred, the value of in-kind contributions applied, and the amount of cash advances and payments made to contractors and subgrantees. For reports prepared on an accrued expenditure basis, outlays are the sum of actual cash disbursements, the amount of indirect expense incurred, the value of in-kind contributions applied, and the new increase (or decrease) in the amounts owed by the grantee for goods and other property received, for services performed by employees, contractors, subgrantees, subcontractors, and other payees, and other amounts becoming owed under programs for which no current services or performance are required, such as annuities, insurance claims, and other benefit payments.

      when referring to the awarding agency's portion of real property, equipment or supplies, means the same percentage as the awarding agency's portion of the acquiring party's total costs under the grant to which the acquisition costs under the grant to which the acquisition cost of the property was charged. Only costs are to be counted—not the value of the third-party in-kind contributions.

      means any of the several _State_s of the United States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, any territory or possession of the United States, or any agency or instrumentality of a State exclusive of local governments.

      means depending on the context, either (1) temporary withdrawal of the authority to obligate grant funds pending corrective action by the grantee or subgrantee or a decision to terminate the grant, or (2) an action taken by a suspending official in accordance with agency regulations implementing E.O. 12549 to immediately exclude a person from participating in grant transactions for a period, pending completion of an investigation and such legal or debarment proceedings as may ensue.

      means permanent withdrawal of the authority to obligate previously-awarded grant funds before that authority would otherwise expire. It also means the voluntary relinquishment of that authority by the grantee or subgrantee.

      does not include: (1) Withdrawal of funds awarded on the basis of the grantee's underestimate of the unobligated balance in a prior period; (2) Withdrawal of the unobligated balance as of the expiration of a grant; (3) Refusal to extend a grant or award additional funds, to make a competing or noncompeting continuation, renewal, extension, or supplemental award; or (4) voiding of a grant upon determination that the award was obtained fraudulently, or was otherwise illegal or invalid from inception.

      mean all requirements of the grant or subgrant whether in statute, regulations, or the award document.

      mean property or services which benefit a federally assisted project or program and which are contributed by non-Federal third parties without charge to the grantee, or a cost-type contractor under the grant agreement.

      for reports prepared on a cash basis mean the amount of obligations incurred by the grantee that has not been paid. For reports prepared on an accrued expenditure basis, they represent the amount of obligations incurred by the grantee for which an outlay has not been recorded.

Financial information must be related to performance or productivity data, including the development of unit cost information whenever appropriate or specifically required in the grant or subgrant agreement. If unit cost data are required, estimates based on available documentation will be accepted whenever possible.

      (5)  Applicable OMB cost principles, agency program regulations, and the terms of grant and subgrant agreements will be followed in determining the reasonableness, allowability and allocability of costs.

      (6)  Accounting records must be supported by such source documentation as cancelled checks, paid bills, payrolls, time and attendance records, contract and subgrant award documents, etc.

      (7)  Procedures for minimizing the time elapsing between the transfer of funds from the U.S. Treasury and disbursement by grantees and subgrantees must be followed whenever advance payment procedures are used. Grantees must establish reasonable procedures to ensure the receipt of reports on subgrantees' cash balances and cash disbursements in sufficient time to enable them to prepare complete and accurate cash transactions reports to the awarding agency. When advances are made by letter-of-credit or electronic transfer of funds methods, the grantee must make drawdowns as close as possible to the time of making disbursements. Grantees must monitor cash drawdowns by their subgrantees to assure that they conform substantially to the same standards of timing and amount as apply to advances to the grantees.

      (c) An awarding agency may review the adequacy of the financial management system of any applicant for financial assistance as part of a preaward review or at any time subsequent to award.

      § 105-71.121   Payment.

#### § § 105-71.121

      (a)  This section prescribes the basic standard and the methods under which a Federal agency will make payments to grantees, and grantees will make payments to subgrantees and contractors.

      (b)  Methods and procedures for payment shall minimize the time elapsing between the transfer of funds and disbursement by the grantee or subgrantee, in accordance with Treasury regulations at 31 CFR part 205.

      (c)  Grantees and subgrantees shall be paid in advance, provided they maintain or demonstrate the willingness and ability to maintain procedures to minimize the time elapsing between the transfer of the funds and their disbursement by the grantee or subgrantee.

      (d)  Reimbursement shall be the preferred method when the requirements in paragraph (c) of this section are not met. Grantees and subgrantees may also be paid by reimbursement for any construction grant. Except as otherwise specified in regulation, Federal agencies shall not use the percentage of completion method to pay construction grants. The grantee or subgrantee may use that method to pay its construction contractor, and if it does, awarding agency's payments to the grantee or subgrantee will be based on the grantee's or subgrantee's actual rate of disbursement.

      (e)  If a grantee cannot meet the criteria for advance payments described in paragraph (c) of this section, and the Federal agency has determined that reimbursement is not feasible because the grantee lacks sufficient working capital the awarding agency may provide cash or a working capital, advance basis. Under this procedure the awarding agency shall advance cash to the grantee to cover its estimated disbursement needs for an initial period generally geared to the grantee's disbursing cycle. Thereafter, the awarding agency shall reimburse the grantee for its actual cash disbursements. The working capital advance method of payment shall not be used by grantees or subgrantees if the reason for using such method is the unwillingness or inability of the grantee to provide timely advances to the subgrantee to meet the subgrantee's actual cash disbursements.

      (f)  (1) Grantees and subgrantees shall disburse repayments to and interest earned on a revolving fund before requesting additional cash payments for the same activity.

      (2) Except as provided in paragraph (f)(1) of this section, grantees and subgrantees shall disburse program income, rebates, refunds, contract settlements, audit recoveries and interest earned on such funds before requesting additional cash payments.

      (g)  (1) Unless otherwise required by Federal statute, awarding agencies shall not withhold payments for proper charges incurred by grantees or subgrantees unless—

      (i) The grantee or subgrantee has failed to comply with grant award conditions or

      (ii) The grantee or subgrantee is indebted to the United States.

      (2) Cash withheld for failure to comply with grant award conditions, but without suspension of the grant, shall be released to the grantee upon subsequent compliance. When a grant is suspended, payment adjustments will be made in accordance with § 105-71.143(c).

      (3) A Federal agency shall not make payment to grantees for amounts that are withheld by grantees or subgrantees from payment to contractors to assure satisfactory completion of work. Payments shall be made by the Federal agency when the grantees or subgrantees actually disburse the withheld funds to the contractors or to escrow accounts established to assure satisfactory completion of work.

      (h)  (1) Consistent with the national goal of expanding the opportunities for minority business enterprises, grantees and subgrantees are encouraged to use minority banks (a bank which is owned at least 50 percent by minority group members). A list of minority owned banks can be obtained from the Minority Business Development Agency, Department of Commerce, Washington, DC 20230.

      (2) A grantee or subgrantee shall maintain a separate bank account only when required by Federal-State agreement.

      (i)  Except for interest earned on advances of funds exempt under the Intergovernmental Cooperation Act (31 U.S.C. 6501 ) and the Indian Self-Determination Act (23 U.S.C. 450), grantees and subgrantees shall promptly, but at least quarterly, remit interest earned on advances to the Federal agency. The grantee or subgrantee may keep interest amounts up to $100 per year for administrative expenses.

      § 105-71.122   Allowable costs.

#### § § 105-71.122

      (a)  Grant funds may be used only for:

      (1) The allowable costs of the grantees, subgrantees and cost-type contractors, including allowable costs in the form of payments to fixed-price contractors; and

      (2) Reasonable fees or profit to cost-type contractors but not any fee or profit (or other increment above allowable costs) to the grantee or subgrantee.

      (b)  For each kind of organization, there is a set of Federal principles for determining allowable costs. Allowable costs will be determined in accordance with the cost principles applicable to the organization incurring the costs. The following chart lists the kinds of organizations and the applicable cost principles:

      § 105-71.123   Period of availability of funds.

#### § § 105-71.123

      (a)  Where a funding period is specified, a grantee may charge to the award only costs resulting from obligations of the funding period unless carryover or unobligated balances are permitted, in which case the carryover balances may be charged for costs resulting from obligations of the subsequent funding period.

      (b)  A grantee must liquidate all obligations incurred under the award not later than 90 days after the end of the funding period (or as specified in a program regulation) to coincide with the submission of the annual Financial Status Report (SF-269). The Federal agency may extend this deadline at the request of the grantee.

      § 105-71.124   Matching or cost sharing.

#### § § 105-71.124

      (a)  With the qualifications and exceptions listed in paragraph (b) of this section, a matching or cost sharing requirement may be satisfied by either or both of the following:

      (1) Allowable costs incurred by the grantee, subgrantee or cost-type contractor under the assistance agreement. This includes allowable costs borne by non-Federal grants or by other cash donations from non-Federal third parties.

      (2) The value of third party in-kind contributions applicable to the period to which the cost sharing or matching requirements apply.

      (b) —(1)  Except as provided by Federal statute, a cost sharing or matching requirement may not be met by costs borne by another Federal grant. This prohibition does not apply to income earned by a grantee or subgrantee from a contract awarded under another Federal grant.

      (2)  For the purpose of this section, general revenue sharing funds distributed under 31 U.S.C. 6702 are not considered Federal grant funds.

      (3)  Neither costs nor the values of third party in-kind contributions may count towards satisfying a cost sharing or matching requirement of a grant agreement if they have been or will be counted towards satisfying a cost sharing or matching requirement of another Federal grant agreement, a Federal procurement contract or any other award of Federal funds.

      (4)  Costs financed by program income, as defined in § 105-71.125, shall not count towards satisfying a cost sharing or matching requirement unless they are expressly permitted in the terms of the assistance agreement. (This use of general program income is described in § 105-71.125(g).)

      (5)  Contractors under a grant may earn income from the activities carried out under the contract in addition to the amounts earned from the party awarding the contract. No costs of services or property supported by this income may count toward satisfying a cost sharing or matching requirement unless other provisions of the grant agreement expressly permit this kind of income to be used to meet the requirement.

      (6)  Costs and third party in-kind contributions counting towards satisfying a cost sharing or matching requirement must be verifiable from the records of grantees and subgrantee or cost-type contractors. These records must show how the value placed on third party in-kind contributions was derived. To the extent feasible, volunteer services will be supported by the same methods that the organization uses to support the allocability of regular personnel costs.

      (7)  (i) Third party in-kind contributions count towards satisfying a cost sharing or matching requirement only where, if the party receiving the contributions were to pay for them, the payments would be allowable costs.

      (ii) Some third party in-kind contributions are goods and services that, if the grantee, subgrantee, or contractor receiving the contribution had to pay for them, the payments would have been an indirect cost. Costs sharing or matching credit for such contributions shall be given only if the grantee, subgrantee, or contractor has established, along with its regular indirect cost rate, a special rate for allocating to individual projects or programs the value of contributions.

      (iii) A third party in-kind contribution to a fixed price contract may count towards satisfying a cost sharing or matching requirement only if it results in:

      (A) An increase in the services or property provided under the contract (without additional cost to the grantee or subgrantee) or

      (B) A cost savings to the grantee or subgrantee.

      (iv) The values placed on third party in-kind contributions for cost sharing or matching purposes will conform to the rules in the succeeding sections of this part. If a third party in-kind contribution is a type not treated in those sections, the value placed upon it shall be fair and reasonable.

      (c) —(1)  Unpaid services provided to a grantee or subgrantee by individuals will be valued at rates consistent with those ordinarily paid for similar work in the grantee's or subgrantee's organization. If the grantee or subgrantee does not have employees performing similar work, the rates will be consistent with those ordinarily paid by other employers for similar work in the same labor market. In either case, a reasonable amount for fringe benefits may be included in the valuation.

      (2)  When an employer other than a grantee, subgrantee, or cost-type contractor furnishes free of charge the services of an employee in the employee's normal line of work, the services will be valued at the employee's regular rate of pay exclusive of the employee's fringe benefits and overhead costs. If the services are in a different line of work, paragraph (c)(1) of this section applies.

      (d)  (1) If a third party donates supplies, the contribution will be valued at the market value of the supplies at the time of donation.

      (2) If a third party donates the use of equipment or space in a building but retains title, the contribution will be valued at the fair rental rate of the equipment or space.

      (e)  If a third party donates equipment, buildings, or land, and the title passes to a grantee or subgrantee, the treatment of the donated property will depend upon the purpose of the grant or subgrant as follows:

      (1)  If the purpose of the grant or subgrant is to assist the grantee or subgrantee in the acquisition of property, the market value of that property at the time of donation may be counted as cost sharing or matching.

      (2)  If assisting in the acquisition of property is not the purpose of the grant or subgrant, paragraphs (e)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section apply.

      (i) If approval is obtained from the awarding agency, the market value at the time of donation of the donated equipment or buildings and the fair rental rate of the donated land may be counted as cost sharing or matching. In the case of a subgrant, the terms of the grant agreement may require that the approval be obtained from the Federal agency as well as the grantee. In all cases, the approval may be given only if a purchase of the equipment or rental of the land would be approved as an allowable direct cost. If any part of the donated property was acquired with Federal funds, only the non-Federal share of the property may be counted as cost sharing or matching.

      (ii) If approval is not obtained under paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section, no amount may be counted for donated land, and only depreciation or use allowances may be counted for donated equipment and buildings. The depreciation or use allowances for this property are not treated as third party in-kind contributions. Instead, they are treated as costs incurred by the grantee or subgrantee. They are computed and allocated (usually as indirect costs) in accordance with the cost principles specified in § 105-71.122, in the same way as depreciation or use allowances for purchased equipment and buildings. The amount of depreciation or use allowances for donated equipment and buildings is based on the property's market value at the time it was donated.

      (f)  If a grantee or subgrantee donates real property for a construction or facilities acquisition project, the current market value of that property may be counted as cost sharing or matching. If any part of the donated property was acquired with Federal funds, only the non-Federal share of the property may be counted as cost sharing or matching.

      (g)  In some cases under paragraphs (d), (e) and (f) of this section, it will be necessary to establish the market value of land or a building or the fair rental rate of land or of space in the building. In these cases, the Federal agency may require the market value or fair rental value be set by an independent appraiser, and that the value or rate be certified by the grantee. This requirement will also be imposed by the grantee on subgrantees.

      § 105-71.125   Program income.

#### § § 105-71.125

      (a)  Grantees are encouraged to earn income to defray program costs. Program income includes income from fees for services performed, from the use or rental of real or personal property acquired with grant funds, from the sale of commodities or items fabricated under a grant agreement, and from payments of principal and interest on loans made with grant funds. Except as otherwise provided in regulations of the Federal agency, program income does not include interest on grant funds, rebates, credits, discounts, refunds, etc. and interest earned on any of them.

      (b)  Program income means gross income received by the grantee or subgrantee directly generated by a grant supported activity, or earned only as a result of the grant agreement during the grant period. “During the grant period” is the time between the effective date of the award and the ending date of the award reflected in the final financial report.

      (c)  If authorized by Federal regulations or the grant agreement, costs incident to the generation of program income may be deducted from gross income to determine program income.

      (d)  Taxes, special assessments, levies, fines, and other such revenues raised by a grantee or subgrantee are not program income unless the revenues are specifically identified in the grant agreement or Federal agency regulations as program income.

      (e)  Income from royalties and license fees for copyrighted material, patents, and inventions developed by a grantee or subgrantee is program income only if the revenues are specifically identified in the grant agreement or Federal agency regulations as program income. (See § 105-71.134.)

      (f)  Proceeds from the sale of real property or equipment will be handled in accordance with the requirements of §§ 105-71.131 and 105-71.132.

      (g)  Program income shall be deducted from outlays which may be both Federal and non-Federal as described below, unless the Federal agency regulations or the grant agreement specify another alternative (or a combination of the alternatives). In specifying alternatives, the Federal agency may distinguish between income earned by the grantee and income earned by subgrantees and between the sources, kinds, or amounts of income. When Federal agencies authorize the alternatives in paragraphs (g) (2) and (3) of this section, program income in excess of any limits stipulated shall also be deducted from outlays.

      (1)  Ordinarily program income shall be deducted from total allowable costs to determine the net allowable costs. Program income shall be used for current costs unless the Federal agency authorizes otherwise. Program income which the grantee did not anticipate at the time of the award shall be used to reduce the Federal agency and grantee contributions rather than to increase the funds committed to the project.

      (2)  When authorized, program income may be added to the funds committed to the grant agreement by the Federal agency and the grantee. The program income shall be used for the purposes and under the conditions of the grant agreement.

      (3)  When authorized, program income may be used to meet the cost sharing or matching requirement of the grant agreement. The amount of the Federal grant award remains the same.

      (h)  There are no Federal requirements governing the disposition of program income earned after the end of the award period (i.e., until the ending date of the final financial report, see paragraph (a) of this section), unless the terms of the agreement or the Federal agency regulations provide otherwise.

      § 105-71.126   Non-Federal audit.

#### § § 105-71.126

      (a)  Grantees and subgrantees are responsible for obtaining audits in accordance with the Single Audit Act Amendments of 1996 (31 U.S.C. 7501-7507) and revised OMB Circular A-133, “Audits of States, Local Governments, and Non-Profit Organizations.” The audits shall be made by an independent auditor in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards covering financial audits.

      (b)  State or local governments, as those terms are defined for purposes of the Single Audit Act Amendments of 1996, that provide Federal awards to a subgrantee, which expends $300,000 or more (or other amount as specified by OMB) in Federal awards in a fiscal year, shall:

      (1) Determine whether State or local subgrantees have met the audit requirements of the Act and whether subgrantees covered by OMB Circular A-110, “Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants and Agreements with Institutions of Higher Education, Hospitals, and Other Non-Profit Organizations,” have met the audit requirements of the Act. Commercial contractors (private for-profit and private and governmental organizations) providing goods and services to State and local governments are not required to have a single audit performed. State and local governments should use their own procedures to ensure that the contractor has complied with laws and regulations affecting the expenditure of Federal funds;

      (2) Determine whether the subgrantee spent Federal assistance funds provided in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. This may be accomplished by reviewing an audit of the subgrantee made in accordance with the Act, Circular A-110, or through other means (e.g., program reviews) if the subgrantee has not had such an audit;

      (3) Ensure the appropriate corrective action is taken within six months after receipt of the audit report in instance of noncompliance with Federal laws and regulations;

      (4) Consider whether subgrantee audits necessitate adjustment of the grantee's own records; and

      (5) Require each subgrantee to permit independent auditors to have access to the records and financial statements.

      (c)  In arranging for audit services, § 105-71.136 shall be followed.

    Subpart 105-71.13—Post-Award Requirements/Changes, Property, and Subawards

      § 105-71.130   Changes.

#### § § 105-71.130

      (a)  Grantees and subgrantees are permitted to rebudget within the approved direct cost budget to meet unanticipated requirements and may make limited program changes to the approved project. However, unless waived by the awarding agency, certain types of post-award changes in budgets and projects shall require the prior written approval of the awarding agency.

      (b)  The applicable cost principles (see § 105-71.122) contain requirements for prior approval of certain types of costs. Except where waived, those requirements apply to all grants and subgrants even if paragraphs (c) through (f) of this section do not.

      (c) —(1)  Except as stated in other regulations or an award document, grantees or subgrantees shall obtain the prior approval of the awarding agency whenever any of the following changes is anticipated under a non-construction award:

      (i) Any revision which would result in the need for additional funding.

      (ii) Unless waived by the awarding agency, cumulative transfers among direct cost categories, or, if applicable, among separately budgeted programs, projects, functions, or activities which exceed or are expected to exceed ten percent of the current total approved budget, whenever the awarding agency's share exceeds $100,000.

      (iii) Transfer of funds allotted for training allowances (i.e., from direct payments to trainees to other expense categories).

      (2)  Grantees and subgrantees shall obtain prior written approval for any budget revision which would result in the need for additional funds.

      (3)  When a grant or subgrant provides funding for both construction and non-construction activities, the grantee or subgrantee must obtain prior written approval from the awarding agency before making any fund or budget transfer from non-construction to construction or vice versa.

      (d)  Grantees or subgrantees must obtain the prior approval of the awarding agency whenever any of the following actions is anticipated:

      (1) Any revision of the scope or objectives of the project (regardless of whether there is an associated budget revision requiring prior approval).

      (2) Need to extend the period of availability of funds.

      (3) Changes in key persons in cases where specified in an application or a grant award. In research projects, a change in the project director or principal investigator shall always require approval unless waived by the awarding agency.

      (4) Under non-construction projects, contracting out, subgranting (if authorized by law) or otherwise obtaining the services of a third party to perform activities which are central to the purposes of the award. This approval requirement is in addition to the approval requirements of § 105-71.136 but does not apply to the procurement of equipment, supplies, and general support services.

      (e)  The awarding agency may not require prior approval for any budget revision which is not described in paragraph (c) of this section.

      (f)  (1) A request for prior approval of any budget revision will be in the same budget format the grantee used in its application and shall be accomplished by a narrative justification for the proposed revision.

      (2) A request for a prior approval under the applicable Federal cost principles (see § 105-71.122) may be made by letter.

      (3) A request by a subgrantee for prior approval will be addressed in writing to the grantee. The grantee will promptly review such request and shall approve or disapprove the request in writing. A grantee will not approve any budget or project revision which is inconsistent with the purpose or terms and conditions of the Federal grant to the grantee. If the revision, requested by the subgrantee would result in a change to the grantee's approved project which requires Federal prior approval, the grantee will obtain the Federal agency's approval before approving the subgrantee's request.

      § 105-71.131   Real property.

#### § § 105-71.131

      (a)  Subject to the obligations and conditions set forth in this section, title to real property acquired under a grant or subgrant will vest upon acquisition in the grantee or subgrantee respectively.

      (b)  Except as otherwise provided by Federal statutes, real property will be used for the originally authorized purposes as long as needed for that purpose, and the grantee or subgrantee shall not dispose of or encumber its title or other interests.

      (c)  When real property is no longer needed for the originally authorized purpose, the grantee or subgrantee will request disposition instructions from the awarding agency. The instructions will provide for one of the following alternatives.

      (1)  Retain title after compensating the awarding agency. The amount paid to the awarding agency will be computed by applying the awarding agency's percentage of participation in the cost of the original purchase to the fair market value of the property. However, in those situations where a grantee or subgrantee is disposing of real property acquired with grant funds and acquiring replacement real property under the same program, the net proceeds from the disposition may be used as an offset to the cost of the replacement property.

      (2)  Sell the property and compensate the awarding agency. The amount due to the awarding agency will be calculated by applying the awarding agency's percentage of participation in the cost of the original purchase to the proceeds of the sale after deduction of any actual and reasonable selling and fixing-up expenses. If the grant is still active, the net proceeds from the sale may be offset against the original cost of the property. When a grantee or subgrantee is directed to sell property, sales procedures shall be followed that provide for competition to the extent practicable and result in the highest possible return.

      (3)  Transfer title to the awarding agency or to a third-party designated/approved by the awarding agency. The grantee or subgrantee shall be paid an amount calculated by applying the grantee or subgrantee's percentage of participation in the purchase of the real property to the current fair market value of the property.

      § 105-71.132   Equipment.

#### § § 105-71.132

      (a)  Subject to the obligations and conditions set forth in this section, title to equipment acquired under a grant or subgrant will vest upon acquisition in the grantee or subgrantee respectively.

      (b)  A State will use, manage, and dispose of equipment acquired under a grant by the State in accordance with State laws and procedures. Other grantees and subgrantees will follow paragraphs (c) through (e) of this section.

      (c)  (1) Equipment shall be used by the grantee or subgrantee in the program or project for which it was acquired as long as needed, whether or not the project or program continues to be supported by Federal funds. When no longer needed for the original program or project, the equipment may be used in other activities currently or previously supported by a Federal agency.

      (2) The grantee or subgrantee shall also make equipment available for use on other projects or programs currently or previously supported by the Federal Government, providing such use will not interfere with the work on the projects or program for which it was originally acquired. First preference for other use shall be given to other programs or projects supported by the awarding agency. User fees should be considered if appropriate.

      (3) Notwithstanding the encouragement in § 105-71.125(a) to earn program income, the grantee or subgrantee must not use equipment acquired with grant funds to provide services for a fee to compete unfairly with private companies that provide equivalent services, unless specifically permitted or contemplated by Federal statute.

      (4) When acquiring replacement equipment, the grantee or subgrantee may use the equipment to be replaced as a trade-in or sell the property and use the proceeds to offset the cost of the replacement property, subject to the approval of the awarding agency.

      (d)  Procedures for managing equipment (including replacement equipment), whether acquired in whole or in part with grant funds, until disposition takes place will, as a minimum, meet the following requirements:

      (1) Property records must be maintained that include a description of the property, a serial number or other identification number, the source of property, who holds the title, the acquisition date, and cost of the property, percentage of Federal participation in the cost of the property, the location, use and condition of the property, and any ultimate disposition data including the data of disposal and sale price of the property.

      (2) A physical inventory of the property must be taken and the results reconciled with the property records at least once every two years.

      (3) A control system must be developed to ensure adequate safeguards to prevent loss, damage or theft of the property. Any loss, damage or theft shall be investigated.

      (4) Adequate maintenance procedures must be developed to keep the property in good condition.

      (5) If the grantee or subgrantee is authorized or required to sell the property, proper sales procedures must be established to ensure the highest possible return.

      (e)  When original or replacement equipment acquired under a grant or subgrant is no longer needed for the original project or program or for other activities currently or previously supported by a Federal agency, disposition of the equipment will be made as follows:

      (1) Items of equipment with a current per-unit fair market value of less than $5,000 may be retained, sold or otherwise disposed of with no further obligation to the awarding agency.

      (2) Items of equipment with a current per unit fair market value in excess of $5,000 may be retained or sold and the awarding agency shall have a right to an amount calculated by multiplying the current market value or proceeds from sale by the awarding agency's share of the equipment.

      (3) In cases where a grantee or subgrantee fails to take appropriate disposition actions, the awarding agency may direct the grantee or subgrantee to take excess and disposition actions.

      (f)  In the event grantee or subgrantee is provided federally-owned equipment:

      (1) Title will remain vested in the Federal Government.

      (2) Grantees or subgrantees will manage the equipment in accordance with Federal agency rules and procedures, and submit an annual inventory listing.

      (3) When the equipment is no longer needed, the grantee or subgrantee will request disposition instructions from the Federal agency.

      (g)  The Federal awarding agency may reserve the right to transfer title to the Federal Government or a third party named by the awarding agency when such a third party is otherwise eligible under existing statutes. Such transfers shall be subject to the following standards:

      (1) The property shall be identified in the grant or otherwise made known to the grantee in writing.

      (2) The Federal awarding agency shall issue disposition instruction within 120 calendar days after the end of the Federal support of the project for which it was acquired. If the Federal awarding agency fails to issue disposition instructions within the 120 calendar-day period the grantee shall follow § 105-71.132(e).

      (3) When title to equipment is transferred, the grantee shall be paid an amount calculated by applying the percentage of participation in the purchase to the current fair market value of the property.

      § 105-71.133   Supplies.

#### § § 105-71.133

      (a)  Title to supplies acquired under a grant or subgrant will vest, upon acquisition, in the grantee or subgrantee respectively.

      (b)  If there is a residual inventory of unused supplies exceeding $5,000 in total aggregate fair market value upon termination or completion of the award, and if the supplies are not needed for any other federally sponsored programs or projects, the grantee or subgrantee shall compensate the awarding agency for its share.

      § 105-71.135   Subawards to debarred and suspended parties.

#### § § 105-71.135

      Grantees and subgrantees must not make any award or permit any award (subgrant or contract) at any tier to any party which is debarred or suspended or is otherwise excluded from or ineligible for participation in Federal assistance programs under Executive Order 12549, “Debarment and Suspension”.

      § 105-71.136   Procurement.

#### § § 105-71.136

      (a)  When procuring property and services under a grant, a State will allow the same policies and procedures it uses for procurements from its non-Federal funds. The State will ensure that every purchase order or other contract includes any clauses required by Federal statutes and executive orders and their implementing regulations. Other grantees and subgrantees will follow paragraphs (b) through (i) in this section.

      (b)  (1) Grantees and subgrantees will use their own procurement procedures which reflect applicable State and local laws and regulations, provided that the procurements conform to applicable Federal law and the standards identified in this section.

      (2) Grantees and subgrantees will maintain a contract administration system which ensures that contractors perform in accordance with the terms, conditions and specifications of their contracts or purchase orders.

      (3) Grantees and subgrantees will maintain a written code of standards of conduct governing the performance of their employees engaged in the award and administration of contracts. No employee, officer or agent of the grantee or subgrantee shall participate in selection, or in the award or administration of a contract supported by Federal funds if a conflict of interest, real or apparent, would be involved. Such a conflict would arise when:

      (i) The employee, officer or agent,

      (ii) Any member of his immediate family,

      (iii) His or her partner, or

      (iv) An organization which employs, or is about to employ, any of the above, has a financial or other interest in the firm selected for award. The grantee's or subgrantee's officers, employees or agent will neither solicit nor accept gratuities, favors or anything of monetary value from contractors, potential contractors, or parties to subagreements. Grantees and subgrantees may set minimum rules where the financial interest is not substantial or the gift is an unsolicited item of nominal intrinsic value. To the extent permitted by State or local law or regulations, such standards of conduct will provide for penalties, sanctions, or other disciplinary actions for violations of such standards by the grantee's officers, employees, or agents, or by contractors or their agents. The awarding agency may in regulation provide additional prohibitions relative to real, apparent, or potential conflicts of interest.

      (4) Grantee and subgrantee procedures will provide for a review of proposed procurements to avoid purchase of unnecessary or duplicative items. Consideration should be given to consolidating or breaking out procurements to obtain a more economical purchase. Where appropriate, an analysis will be made of lease versus purchase alternatives, and any other appropriate analysis to determine the most economical approach.

      (5) To foster greater economy and efficiency, grantees and subgrantees are encouraged to enter into State and local intergovernmental agreements for procurement or use of common goods and services.

      (6) Grantees and subgrantees are encouraged to use Federal excess and surplus property in lieu of purchasing new equipment and property whenever such use is feasible and reduces project costs.

      (7) Grantees and subgrantees are encouraged to use value engineering clauses in contracts for construction projects of sufficient size to offer reasonable opportunities for cost reductions. Value engineering is a systematic and creative analysis of each contract item or task to ensure that its essential function is provided at the overall lower cost.

      (8) Grantees and subgrantees will make awards only to responsible contractors possessing the ability to perform successfully under the terms and conditions of a proposed procurement. Consideration will be given to such matters as contractor integrity, compliance with public policy, record of past performance, and financial and technical resources.

      (9) Grantees and subgrantees will maintain records sufficient to detail the significant history of a procurement. These records will include, but are not necessarily limited to the following: Rationale for the method of procurement, selection of contract type, contractor selection or rejection, and the basis for the contract price.

      (10) Grantees and subgrantees will use time and material type contracts only—

      (i) After a determination that no other contract is suitable, and

      (ii) If the contract includes a ceiling price that the contractor exceeds at its own risk.

      (11) Grantees and subgrantees alone will be responsible, in accordance with good administrative practice and sound business judgment, for the settlement of all contractual and administrative issues arising out of procurements. These issues include, but are not limited to source evaluation, protests, disputes and claims. These standards do not relieve the grantee or subgrantee of any contractual responsibilities under its contracts. Federal agencies will not substitute their judgment for that of the grantee or subgrantee unless the matter is primarily a Federal concern. Violations of law will be referred to the local, State or Federal authority having proper jurisdiction.

      (12) Grantees and subgrantees will have protest procedures to handle and resolve disputes relating to their procurements and shall in all instances disclose information regarding the protests to the awarding agency. A protestor must exhaust all administrative remedies with the grantee and subgrantee before pursuing a protest with the Federal agency. Reviews of protests by the Federal agency will be limited to:

      (i) Violations of Federal law or regulations and the standards of this section (violations of State or local law will be under the jurisdiction of State or local authorities) and

      (ii) Violations of grantee's or subgrantee's protest procedures for failure to review a complaint or protest. Protests received by the Federal agency other than those specified above will be referred to the grantee or subgrantee.

      (c)  (1) All procurement transactions will be conducted in a manner providing full and open competition consistent with the standards of § 105-71.136. Some of the situations considered to be restrictive of competition include but are not limited to:

      (i) Placing unreasonable requirements on firms in order for them to qualify to do business,

      (ii) Requiring unnecessary experience and excessive bonding,

      (iii) Noncompetitive pricing practices between firms or between affiliated companies,

      (iv) Noncompetitive awards to consultants that are on retainer contracts,

      (v) Organizational conflicts of interest,

      (vi) Specifying only a “brand name” product instead of allowing “an equal” product to be offered and describing the performance of other relevant requirements of the procurement, and

      (vii) Any arbitrary action in the procurement process.

      (2) Grantees and subgrantees will conduct procurements in a manner that prohibits the use of statutorily or administratively imposed in-State or local geographical preferences in the evaluation of bids or proposals, except in those cases where applicable Federal statutes expressly mandate or encourage geographic preference. Nothing in this section preempts State licensing laws. When contracting for architectural and engineering (A/E) services, geographic location may be a selection criteria provided its application leaves an appropriate number of qualified firms, given the nature and size of the project, to compete for the contract.

      (3) Grantees will have written selection procedures for procurement transactions. These procedures will ensure that all solicitations:

      (i) Incorporate a clear and accurate description of the technical requirements for the material, product, or service to be procured. Such description shall not, in competitive procurements, contain features which unduly restrict competition. The description may include a statement of the qualitative nature of the material, product or service to be procured, and when necessary, shall set forth those minimum essential characteristics and standards to which it must conform if it is to satisfy its intended use. Detailed product specifications should be avoided if at all possible. When it is impractical or uneconomical to make a clear and accurate description of the technical requirements, a “brand name or equal” description may be used as a means to define the performance or other salient requirements of a procurement. The specific features of the named brand which must be met by offerors shall be clearly stated; and

      (ii) Identify all requirements which the offerors must fulfill and all other factors to be used in evaluating bids or proposals.

      (4) Grantees and subgrantees will ensure that all prequalified lists of persons, firms, or products which are used in acquiring goods and services are current and include enough qualified sources to ensure maximum open and free competition. Also, grantees and subgrantees will not preclude potential bidders from qualifying during the solicitation period.

      (d) —(1)  Small purchase procedures are those relatively simple and informal procurement methods for securing services, supplies, or other property that do not cost more than the simplified acquisition threshold fixed at 41 U.S.C. 403(11) (currently set at $100,000). If small purchase procedures are used, price or rate quotations shall be obtained from an adequate number of qualified sources.

      (2) Procurement by  (formal advertising). Bids are publicly solicited and a firm-fixed-price contract (lump sum or unit price) is awarded to the responsible bidder whose bid, conforming with all the material terms and conditions of the invitation for bids, is the lowest in price. The sealed bid method is the preferred method for procuring construction, if the conditions in § 105-71.136(d)(2)(i) apply.

      (i) In order for sealed bidding to be feasible, the following conditions should be present:

      (A) A complete, adequate, and realistic specification or purchase description is available;

      (B) Two or more responsible bidders are willing and able to compete effectively and for the business; and

      (C) The procurement lends itself to a firm fixed price contract and the selection of the successful bidder can be made principally on the basis of price.

      (ii) If sealed bids are used, the following requirements apply:

      (A) The invitation for bids will be publicly advertised and bids shall be solicited from an adequate number of known suppliers, providing them sufficient time prior to the date set for opening the bids;

      (B) The invitation for bids, which will include any specifications and pertinent attachments, shall define the items or services in order for the bidder to properly respond;

      (C) All bids will be publicly opened at the time and place prescribed in the invitation for bids;

      (D) A firm fixed-price contract award will be made in writing to the lowest responsive and responsible bidder. Where specified in bidding documents, factors such as discounts, transportation cost, and life cycle costs shall be considered in determining which bid is lowest. Payment discounts will only be used to determine the low bid when prior experience indicates that such discounts are usually taken advantage of; and

      (E) Any or all bids may be rejected if there is a sound documented reason.

      (3) Procurement by  The technique of competitive proposals is normally conducted with more than one source submitting an offer, and either a fixed-price or cost-reimbursement type contract is awarded. It is generally used when conditions are not appropriate for the use of sealed bids. If this method is used, the following requirements apply:

      (i) Requests for proposals will be publicized and identify all evaluation factors and their relative importance. Any response to publicized requests for proposals shall be honored to the maximum extent practical;

      (ii) Proposals will be solicited from an adequate number of qualified sources;

      (iii) Grantees and subgrantees will have a method for conducting technical evaluations of the proposals received and for selecting awardees;

      (iv) Awards will be made to the responsible firm whose proposal is most advantageous to the program, with price and other factors considered; and

      (v) Grantees and subgrantees may use competitive proposal procedures for qualifications-based procurement of architectural/engineering (A/E) professional services whereby competitors' qualifications are evaluated and the most qualified competitor is selected, subject to negotiation of fair and reasonable compensation. The method, where price is not used as a selection factor, can only be used in procurement of A/E professional services. It cannot be used to purchase other types of services though A/E firms are a potential source to perform the proposed effort.

      (4) Procurement by  is procurement through solicitation of a proposal from only one source, or after solicitation of a number of sources, competition is determined inadequate.

      (i) Procurement by noncompetitive proposals may be used only when the award of a contract is infeasible under small purchase procedures, sealed bids or competitive proposals and one of the following circumstances applies:

      (A) The item is available only from a single source;

      (B) The public exigency or emergency for the requirement will not permit a delay resulting from competitive solicitation;

      (C) The awarding agency authorizes noncompetitive proposals; or

      (D) After solicitation of a number of sources, competition is determined inadequate.

      (ii) Cost analysis, i.e., verifying the proposed cost data, the projections of the data, and the evaluation of the specific elements of costs and profits, is required.

      (iii) Grantees and subgrantees may be required to submit the proposed procurement to the awarding agency for pre-award review in accordance with paragraph (g) of this section.

      (e)  (1) The grantee and subgrantee will take all necessary affirmative steps to assure that minority firms, women's business enterprises, and labor surplus area firms are used when possible.

      (2) Affirmative steps shall include:

      (i) Placing qualified small and minority businesses and women's business enterprises on solicitation lists;

      (ii) Assuring that small and minority businesses, and women's business enterprises are solicited whenever they are potential sources;

      (iii) Dividing total requirements, when economically feasible, into smaller tasks or quantities to permit maximum participation by small and minority business, and women's business enterprises;

      (iv) Establishing delivery schedules, where the requirement permits, which encourage participation by small and minority business, and women's business enterprises;

      (v) Using the services and assistance of the Small Business Administration, and the Minority Business Development Agency of the Department of Commerce; and

      (vi) Requiring the prime contractor, if subcontracts are to be let, to take the affirmative steps listed in paragraphs (e)(2) (i) through (v) of this section.

      (f)  (1) Grantees and subgrantees must perform a cost or price analysis in connection with every procurement action including contract modifications. The method and degree of analysis is dependent on the facts surrounding the particular procurement situation, but as a starting point, grantees must make independent estimates before receiving bids or proposals. A cost analysis must be performed when the offeror is required to submit the elements of his estimated cost, e.g., under professional, consulting, and architectural engineering services contracts. A cost analysis will be necessary when adequate price competition is lacking, and for sole source procurements, including contract modifications or change orders, unless price reasonableness can be established on the basis of a catalog or market price of a commercial product sold in substantial quantities to the general public or based on prices set by law or regulation. A price analysis will be used in all other instances to determine the reasonableness of the proposed contract price.

      (2) Grantees and subgrantees will negotiate profit as a separate element of the price for each contract in which there is no price competition and in all cases where cost analysis is performed. To establish a fair and reasonable profit, consideration will be given to the complexity of the work to be performed, the risk borne by the contractor, the contractor's investment, the amount of subcontracting, the quality of its record of past performance, and industry profit rates in the surrounding geographical area for similar work.

      (3) Costs or prices based on estimated costs for contracts under grants will be allowable only to the extent that costs incurred or cost estimates included in negotiated prices are consistent with Federal cost principles (see § 105-71.122). Grantees may reference their own cost principles that comply with the applicable Federal cost principles.

      (4) The cost plus a percentage of cost and percentage of construction cost methods of contracting shall not be used.

      (g)  (1) Grantees and subgrantees must make available, upon request of the awarding agency, technical specifications on proposed procurements where the awarding agency believes such review is needed to ensure that the item and/or service specified is the one being proposed for purchase. This review generally will take place prior to the time the specification is incorporated into a solicitation document. However, if the grantee or subgrantee desires to have the review accomplished after a solicitation has been developed, the awarding agency may still review the specifications, with such review usually limited to the technical aspects of the proposed purchase.

      (2) Grantees and subgrantees must on request make available for awarding agency pre-award review procurement documents, such as requests for proposals or invitations for bids, independent cost estimates, etc. when:

      (i) A grantee's or subgrantee's procurement procedures or operation fails to comply with the procurement standards in this section; or

      (ii) The procurement is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold and is to be awarded without competition or only one bid or offer is received in response to a solicitation; or

      (iii) The procurement, which is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold, specifies a “brand name” product; or

      (iv) The proposed award is more than the simplified acquisition threshold and is to be awarded to other than the apparent low bidder under a sealed bid procurement; or

      (v) A proposed contract modification changes the scope of a contract or increases the contract amount by more than the simplified acquisition threshold.

      (3) A grantee or subgrantee will be exempt from the pre-award review in paragraph (g)(2) of this section if the awarding agency determines that its procurement systems comply with the standards of this section.

      (i) A grantee or subgrantee may request that its procurement system be reviewed by the awarding agency to determine whether its system meets these standards in order for its system to be certified. Generally, these reviews shall occur where there is a continuous high-dollar funding, and third-party contracts are awarded on a regular basis.

      (ii) A grantee or subgrantee may self-certify its procurement system. Such self-certification shall not limit the awarding agency's right to survey the system. Under a self-certification procedure, awarding agencies may wish to rely on written assurances from the grantee or subgrantee that it is complying with these standards. A grantee or subgrantee will cite specific procedures, regulations, standards, etc., as being in compliance with these requirements and have its system available for review.

      (h)  For construction or facility improvement contracts or subcontracts exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, the awarding agency may accept the bonding policy and requirements of the grantee or subgrantee provided the awarding agency has made a determination that the awarding agency's interest is adequately protected. If such a determination has not been made, the minimum requirements shall be as follows:

      (1)  The “bid guarantee” shall consist of a firm commitment such as a bid bond, certified check, or other negotiable instrument accompanying a bid as assurance that the bidder will, upon acceptance of his bid, execute such contractual documents as may be required within the time specified.

      (2)  A “performance bond” is one executed in connection with a contract to secure fulfillment of all the contractor's obligations under such contract.

      (3)  A “payment bond” is one executed in connection with a contract to assure payment as required by law of all persons supplying labor and material in the execution of the work provided for in the contract.

      (i)  A grantee's and subgrantee's contracts must contain provisions in paragraph (i) of this section. Federal agencies are permitted to require changes, remedies, changed conditions, access and records retention, suspension of work, and other clauses approved by the Office of Federal Procurement Policy.

      (1) Administrative, contractual, or legal remedies in instances where contractors violate or breach contract terms, and provide for such sanctions and penalties as may be appropriate. (Contracts more than the simplified acquisition threshold)

      (2) Termination for cause and for convenience by the grantee or subgrantee including the manner by which it will be effected and the basis for settlement. (All contracts in excess of $10,000)

      (3) Compliance with Executive Order 11246 of September 24, 1965, entitled “Equal Employment Opportunity,” as amended by Executive Order 11375 of October 13, 1967, and as supplemented in Department of Labor regulations (41 CFR chapter 60). (All construction contracts awarded in excess of $10,000 by grantees and their contractors or subgrantees)

      (4) Compliance with the Copeland “Anti-Kickback” Act (18 U.S.C. 874) as supplemented in Department of Labor regulations (29 CFR part 3). (All contracts and subgrants for construction or repair)

      (5) Compliance with the Davis-Bacon Act (40 U.S.C. 276a to 276a-7) as supplemented by Department of Labor regulations (29 CFR part 5). (Construction contracts in excess of $2000 awarded by grantees and subgrantees when required by Federal grant program legislation)

      (6) Compliance with sections 103 and 107 of the Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act (40 U.S.C. 327-330) as supplemented by Department of Labor regulations (29 CFR part 5). (Construction contracts awarded by grantees and subgrantees in excess of $2000, and in excess of $2500 for other contracts which involve the employment of mechanics or laborers)

      (7) Notice of awarding agency requirements and regulations pertaining to reporting.

      (8) Notice of awarding agency requirements and regulations pertaining to patent rights with respect to any discovery or invention which arises or is developed in the course of or under such contract.

      (9) Awarding agency requirements and regulations pertaining to copyrights and rights in data.

      (10) Access by the grantee, the subgrantee, the Federal grantor agency, the Comptroller General of the United States, or any of their duly authorized representatives to any books, documents, papers, and records of the contractor which are directly pertinent to that specific contract for the purpose of making audit, examination, excerpts, and transcriptions.

      (11) Retention of all required records for three years after grantees or subgrantees make final payments and all other pending matters are closed.

      (12) Compliance with all applicable standards, orders, or requirements issued under section 306 of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 1857(h)), section 508 of the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1368), Executive Order 11738, and Environmental Protection Agency regulations (40 CFR part 15). (Contracts, subcontracts, and subgrants of amounts in excess of $100,000)

      § 105-71.137   Subgrants.

#### § § 105-71.137

      (a)  States shall follow State law and procedures when awarding and administering subgrants (whether on a cost reimbursement or fixed amount basis) of financial assistance to local and Indian tribal governments. States shall:

      (1) Ensure that every subgrant includes any clauses required by Federal statute and executive orders and their implementing regulations;

      (2) Ensure that subgrantees are aware of requirements imposed upon them by Federal statute and regulation;

      (3) Ensure that a provision for compliance with § 105-71.142 is placed in every cost reimbursement subgrant; and

      (4) Conform any advances of grant funds to subgrantees substantially to the same standards of timing and amount that apply to cash advances by Federal agencies.

      (b)  All other grantees shall follow the provisions of this part which are applicable to awarding agencies when awarding and administering subgrants (whether on a cost reimbursement or fixed amount basis) of financial assistance to local and Indian tribal governments. Grantees shall:

      (1) Ensure that every subgrant includes a provision for compliance with this part;

      (2) Ensure that every subgrant includes any clauses required by Federal statute and executive orders and their implementing regulations; and

      (3) Ensure that subgrantees are aware of requirements imposed upon them by Federal statutes and regulations.

      (c)  By their own terms, certain provisions of this part do not apply to the award and administration of subgrants:

      (1) Section 105-71.110;

      (2) Section 105-71.111;

      (3) The letter-of-credit procedures specified in Treasury Regulations at 31 CFR part 205, cited in § 105-71.121; and

      (4) Section 105-71.150.

    Subpart 105-71.14—Post-Award Requirements/Reports, Records, Retention, and Enforcement

      § 105-71.140   Monitoring and reporting program performance.

#### § § 105-71.140

      (a)  Grantees are responsible for managing the day-to-day operations of grant and subgrant supported activities. Grantees must monitor grant and subgrant supported activities to assure compliance with applicable Federal requirements and that performance goals are being achieved. Grantee monitoring must cover each program, function or activity.

      (b)  The Federal agency may, if it decides that performance information available from subsequent applications contains sufficient information to meet its programmatic needs, require the grantee to submit a performance report only upon expiration or termination of grant support. Unless waived by the Federal agency this report will be due on the same date as the final Financial Status Report.

      (1) Grantees shall submit annual performance reports unless the awarding agency requires quarterly or semiannual reports. However, performance reports will not be required more frequently than quarterly. Annual reports shall be due 90 days after the grant year, quarterly or semiannual reports shall be due 30 days after the reporting period. The final performance report will be due 90 days after the expiration or termination of grant support. If a justified request is submitted by a grantee, the Federal agency may extend the due date for any performance report. Additionally, requirements for unnecessary performance reports may be waived by the Federal agency.

      (2) Performance reports will contain, for each grant, brief information on the following:

      (i) A comparison of actual accomplishments to the objectives established for the period. Where the output of the project can be quantified, a computation of the cost per unit of output may be required if that information will be useful.

      (ii) The reasons for slippage if established objectives were not met.

      (iii) Additional pertinent information including, when appropriate, analysis and explanation of cost overruns or high unit costs.

      (3) Grantees will not be required to submit more than the original and two copies of performance reports.

      (4) Grantees will adhere to the standards in this section in prescribing performance reporting requirements for subgrantees.

      (c)  For the most part, on-site technical inspections and certified percentage-of-completion data are relied on heavily by Federal agencies to monitor progress under construction grants and subgrants. The Federal agency will require additional formal performance reports only when considered necessary, and never more frequently than quarterly.

      (d)  Events may occur between the scheduled performance reporting dates which have significant impact upon the grant or subgrant supported activity. In such cases, the grantee must inform the Federal agency as soon as the following types of conditions become known:

      (1) Problems, delays, or adverse conditions which will materially impair the ability to meet the objective of the award. This disclosure must include a statement of the action taken, or contemplated, and any assistance needed to resolve the situation.

      (2) Favorable developments which enable meeting time schedules and objectives sooner or at less cost than anticipated or producing more beneficial results than originally planned.

      (e) Federal agencies may make site visits as warranted by program needs.

      (f)  (1) Federal agencies may waive any performance report required by this part if not needed.

      (2) The grantee may waive any performance report from a subgrantee when not needed. The grantee may exend the due date for any performance report from a subgrantee if the grantee will still be able to meet its performance reporting obligations to the Federal agency.

      § 105-71.141   Financial reporting.

#### § § 105-71.141

      (a)  (1) Except as provided in paragraphs (a) (2) and (5) of this section, grantees will use only the forms specified in paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section, and such supplementary or other forms as may from time to time be authorized by OMB, for:

      (i) Submitting financial reports to Federal agencies, or

      (ii) Requesting advances or reimbursements when letters of credit are not used.

      (2) Grantees need not apply the forms prescribed in this section in dealing with their subgrantees. However, grantees shall not impose more burdensome requirements on subgrantees.

      (3) Grantees shall follow all applicable standard and supplemental Federal agency instructions approved by OMB to the extent required under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 for use in connection with forms specified in paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section. Federal agencies may issue substantive supplementary instructions only with the approval of OMB. Federal agencies may shade out or instruct the grantee to disregard any line item that the Federal agency finds unnecessary for its decision making purposes.

      (4) Grantees will not be required to submit more than the original and two copies of forms required under this part.

      (5) Federal agencies may provide computer outputs to grantees to expedite or contribute to the accuracy of reporting. Federal agencies may accept the required information from grantees in machine usable format or computer printouts instead of prescribed forms.

      (6) Federal agencies may waive any report required by this section if not needed.

      (7) Federal agencies may extend the due date on any financial report upon receiving a justified request from a grantee.

      (b) —(1)  Grantees will use Standard Form 269 or 269A, _Financial Status Report_, to report the status of funds for all non-construction grants and for construction grants when required in accordance with paragraph (e)(2)(iii) of this section.

      (2)  Each grantee will report program outlays and program income on a cash or accrual basis as prescribed by the awarding agency. If the Federal agency requires accrual information and the grantee's accounting records are not normally kept on the accrual basis, the grantee shall not be required to convert its accounting system but shall develop such accrual information through an analysis of the documentation on hand.

      (3)  The Federal agency may prescribe the frequency of the report for each project or program. However, the report will not be required more frequently than quarterly. If the Federal agency does not specify the frequency of the report, it will be submitted annually. A final report will be required upon expiration or termination of grant support.

      (4)  When reports are required on a quarterly or semiannual basis, they will be due 30 days after the reporting period. When required on an annual basis, they will be due 90 days after the grant year. Final reports will be due 90 days after the expiration or termination of grant support.

      (c) —(1)  (i) For grants paid by letter of credit, Treasury check advances or electronic transfer of funds, the grantee will submit the Standard Form 272, _Federal Cash Transactions Report_, and when necessary, its continuation sheet, Standard Form 272A, unless the terms of the award exempt the grantee from this requirement.

      (ii) These reports will be used by the Federal agency to monitor cash advanced to grantees and to obtain disbursement or outlay information for each grant from grantees. The format of the report may be adapted as appropriated when reporting is to be accomplished with the assistance of automatic data processing equipment provided that the information to be submitted is not changed in substance.

      (2)  Forecasts of Federal cash requirements may be required in the “Remarks” section of the report.

      (3)  When considered necessary and feasible by the Federal agency, grantees may be required to report the amount of cash advances in excess of three days' needs in the hands of their subgrantees or contractors and to provide short narrative explanations of actions taken by the grantee to reduce the excess balances.

      (4)  Grantees must submit the report no later than 15 working days following the end of each quarter. However, where an advance either by letter of credit or electronic transfer of funds is authorized at an annualized rate of one million dollars or more, the Federal agency may require the report to be submitted within 15 working days following the end of each month.

      (d) —(1)  Requests for Treasury check advance payments will be submitted on Standard Form 270, Request for Advance or Reimbursement. (This form will not be used for drawdowns under a letter of credit, electronic funds transfer or when Treasury check advance payments are made to the grantee automatically on a predetermined basis.)

      (2)  Requests for reimbursement under non-construction grants will also be submitted on Standard Form 270. (For reimbursement requests under construction grants, see paragraph (e)(1) of this section.)

      (3) The frequency for submitting payment requests is treated in § 105-71.141(b)(3).

      (e)  (1) Grants that support construction activities paid by reimbursement method.

      (i) Requests for reimbursement under construction grants will be submitted on Standard Form 271, Outlay Report and Request for Reimbursement for Construction Programs. Federal agencies may, however, prescribe the Request for Advance or Reimbursement form, specified in § 105-71.141(d), instead of this form.

      (ii) The frequency for submitting reimbursement requests is treated in § 105-71.141(b)(3).

      (2) Grants that support construction activities paid by letter of credit, electronic funds transfer or Treasury check advance.

      (i) When a construction grant is paid by letter of credit, electronic funds transfer or Treasury check advances, the grantee will report its outlays to the Federal agency using Standard Form 271, Outlay Report and Request for Reimbursement for Construction Programs. The Federal agency will provide any necessary special instruction. However, frequency and due date shall be governed by § 105-71.141(b) (3) and (4).

      (ii) When a construction grant is paid by Treasury check advances based on periodic requests from the grantee, the advances will be requested on the form specified in § 105-71.141(d).

      (iii) The Federal agency may substitute the Financial Status Report specified in § 105-71.141(b) for the Outlay Report and Request for Reimbursement for Construction Programs.

      (3)  The accounting basis for the Outlay Report and Request for Reimbursement for Construction Programs shall be governed by § 105-71.141(b)(2).

      § 105-71.142   Retention and access requirements for records.

#### § § 105-71.142

      (a)  (1) This section applies to all financial and programmatic records, supporting documents, statistical records, and other records of grantees of subgrantees or subgrantees which are:

      (i) Required to be maintained by the terms of this part, program regulations or the grant agreement, or

      (ii) Otherwise reasonably considered as pertinent to program regulations or the grant agreement.

      (2) This section does not apply to records maintained by contractors or subcontractors. For a requirement to place a provision concerning records in certain kinds of contracts, see § 105-71.136(i)(10).

      (b)  (1) Except as otherwise provided, records must be retained for three years from the starting date specified in paragraph (c) of this section.

      (2) If any litigation, claim, negotiation, audit or other action involving the records has been started before the expiration of the 3-year period, the records must be retained until completion of the action and resolution of all issues which arise from it, or until the end of the regular 3-year period, whichever is later.

      (3) To avoid duplicate recordkeeping, awarding agencies may make special arrangements with grantees and subgrantees to retain any records which are continuously needed for joint use. The awarding agency will request transfer of records to its custody when it determines that the records possess long-term retention value. When the records are transferred to or maintained by the Federal agency, the 3-year retention requirement is not applicable to the grantee or subgrantee.

      (c) —(1)  When grant support is continued or renewed at annual or other intervals, the retention period for the records of each funding period starts on the day the grantee or subgrantee submits to the awarding agency its single or last expenditure report for that period. However, if grant support is continued or renewed quarterly, the retention period for each year's records starts on the day the grantee submits its expenditure report for the last quarter of the Federal fiscal year. In all other cases, the retention period starts on the day the grantee submits its final expenditure report. If an expenditure report has been waived, the retention period starts on the day the report would have been due.

      (2)  The retention period for real property and equipment records starts from the date of the disposition or replacement or transfer at the direction of the awarding agency.

      (3)  In some cases grantees must report income after the period of grant support. Where there is such a requirement, the retention period for the records pertaining to the earning of the income starts from the end of the grantee's fiscal year in which the income is earned.

      (4)  This paragraph applies to the following types of documents, and their supporting records: indirect cost rate computations or proposals, cost allocation plans, and any similar accounting computations of the rates at which a particular group of costs is chargeable (such as computer usage chargeback rates or composite fringe benefit rates).

      (i)  If the proposal, plan, or other computation is required to be submitted to the Federal Government (or to the grantee) to form the basis for negotiation of the rate, then the 3-year retention period for its supporting records starts from the date of such submission.

      (ii)  If the proposal, plan, or other computations are not required to be submitted to the Federal Government (or to the grantee) for negotiation purposes, then the 3-year retention period for the proposal plan, or computation and its supporting records starts from end of the fiscal year (or other accounting period) covered by the proposal, plan, or other computation.

      (d)  Copies made by microfilming, photocopying, or similar methods may be substituted for the original records.

      (e) —(1)  The awarding agency and the Comptroller General of the United States, or any of their authorized representatives, shall have the right of access to any pertinent books, documents, papers, or other records of grantees and subgrantees which are pertinent to the grant, in order to make audits, examinations, excerpts, and transcripts.

      (2)  The rights of access in this section must not be limited to the required retention period but shall last as long as the records are retained.

      (f)  The Federal Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) does not apply to records. Unless required by Federal, State, or local law, grantees and subgrantees are not required to permit public access to their records.

      § 105-71.143   Enforcement.

#### § § 105-71.143

      (a)  If a grantee or subgrantee materially fails to comply with any term of an award, whether stated in a Federal statute or regulation, an assurance, in a State plan or application, a notice of award, or elsewhere, the awarding agency may take one or more of the following actions, as appropriate in the circumstances:

      (1) Temporary withhold cash payments pending correction of the deficiency by the grantee or subgrantee or more severe enforcement action by the awarding agency,

      (2) Disallow (that is, deny both use of funds and matching credit for) all or part of the cost of the activity or action not in compliance,

      (3) Wholly or partly suspend or terminate the current award for the grantee's or subgrantee's program,

      (4) Without further awards for the program, or

      (5) Take other remedies that may be legally available,

      (b)  In taking an enforcement action, the awarding agency will provide the grantee or subgrantee an opportunity for such hearing, appeal, or other administrative proceeding to which the grantee or subgrantee is entitled under any statute or regulation applicable to the action involved.

      (c)  Costs of grantee or subgrantee resulting from obligations incurred by the grantee or subgrantee during a suspension or after termination of an award are not allowable unless the awarding agency expressly authorizes them in the notice of suspension or termination or subsequently. Other grantee or subgrantee costs during suspension or after termination which are necessary and not reasonably avoidable are allowable if:

      (1) The costs result from obligations which were properly incurred by the grantee or subgrantee before the effective date of suspension or termination, are not in anticipation of it, and, in case of a termination, are noncancellable, and,

      (2) The cost would be allowable if the award were not suspended or expired normally at the end of the funding period in which the termination takes effect.

      (d)  The enforcement remedies identified in this section, including suspension and termination, do not preclude grantee or subgrantee from being subject to “Debarment and Suspension” under E.O. 12549 (see § 105-71.135).

      § 105-71.144   Termination for convenience.

#### § § 105-71.144

      Except as provided in § 105-71.143 awards may be terminated in whole or in part only as follows:

      (a) By the awarding agency with the consent of the grantee or subgrantee in which case the two parties shall agree upon the termination conditions, including the effective date and in the case of partial termination, the portion to be terminated, or

      (b) By the grantee or subgrantee upon written notification to the awarding agency, setting forth the reasons for such termination, the effective date, and in the case of partial termination, the portion to be terminated. However, if, in the case of a partial termination, the awarding agency determines that the remaining portion of the award will not accomplish the purposes for which the award was made, the awarding agency may terminate the award in its entirety under either § 105-71.143 or paragraph (a) of this section.

    Subpart 105-71.15—After-the-Grant Requirements

      § 105-71.150   Closeout.

#### § § 105-71.150

      (a)  The Federal agency will close out the award when it determines that all applicable administrative actions and all required work of the grant has been completed.

      (b)  Within 90 days after the expiration or termination of the grant, the grantee must submit all financial, performance, and other reports required as a condition of the grant. Upon request by the grantee, Federal agencies may extend this timeframe. These may include but are not limited to:

      (1) Final performance or progress report.

      (2) Financial Status Report (SF 269) or Outlay Report and Request for Reimbursement for Construction Programs (SF-271) (as applicable).

      (3) Final request for payment (SF-270) (if applicable).

      (4) Invention disclosure (if applicable).

      (5) Federally-owned property report: In accordance with § 105-71.132(f), a grantee must submit an inventory of all federally owned property (as distinct from property acquired with grant funds) for which it is accountable and request disposition instructions from the Federal agency of property no longer needed.

      (c)  The Federal agency will, within 90 days after receipt of reports in paragraph (b) of this section, make upward or downward adjustments to the allowable costs.

      (d)  (1) The Federal agency will make prompt payment to the grantee for allowable reimbursable costs.

      (2) The grantee must immediately refund to the Federal agency any balance of unobligated (unencumbered) cash advanced that is not authorized to be retained for use on other grants.

      § 105-71.151   Later disallowances and adjustments.

#### § § 105-71.151

      The closeout of a grant does not affect:

      (a) The Federal agency's right to disallow costs and recover funds on the basis of a later audit or other review;

      (b) The grantee's obligation to return any funds due as a result of later refunds, corrections, or other transactions;

      (c) Records retention as required in § 105-71.142;

      (d) Property management requirements in §§ 105-71.131 and 105-71.132; and

      (e) Audit requirements in § 105-71.126.

      § 105-71.152   Collection of amounts due.

#### § § 105-71.152

      (a) Any funds paid to a grantee in excess of the amount to which the grantee is finally determined to be entitled under the terms of the award constitute a debt to the Federal Government. If not paid within a reasonable period after demand, the Federal agency may reduce the debt by:

      (1) Making an administrative offset against other requests for reimbursement,

      (2) Withholding advance payments otherwise due to the grantee, or

      (3) Other action permitted by law.

      (b) Except where otherwise provided by statutes or regulations, the Federal agency will charge interest on an overdue debt in accordance with the Federal Claims Collection Standards (4 CFR Ch. II). The date from which interest is computed is not extended by litigation or the filing of any form of appeal.

      (a)  means the charges incurred by the recipient during a given period requiring the provision of funds for:

      (1) Goods and other tangible property received;

      (n)  means tangible personal property acquired in whole or in part with Federal funds, where the Federal awarding agency has statutory authority to vest title in the recipient without further obligation to the Federal Government. An example of exempt property authority is contained in the Federal Grant and Cooperative Agreement Act (31 U.S.C. 6306), for property acquired under an award to conduct basic or applied research by a non-profit institution of higher education or non-profit organization whose principal purpose is conducting scientific research.

For reports prepared on a cash basis, outlays are the sum of cash disbursements for direct charges for goods and services, the amount of indirect expense charged, the value of third party in-kind contributions applied and the amount of cash advances and payments made to subrecipients. For reports prepared on an accrual basis, outlays are the sum of cash disbursements for direct charges for goods and services, the amount of indirect expense incurred, the value of in-kind contributions applied, and the net increase (or decrease) in the amounts owed by the recipient for goods and other property received, for services performed by employees, contractors, subrecipients and other payees and other amounts becoming owed under programs for which no current services or performance are required.

      (v)  means property of any kind except real property. It may be tangible, having physical existence, or intangible, having no physical existence, such as copyrights, patents, or securities.

      (bb)  means land, including land improvements, structures and appurtenances thereto, but excludes movable machinery and equipment.

      (cc)  means an organization receiving financial assistance directly from Federal awarding agencies to carry out a project or program. The term includes public and private institutions of higher education, public and private hospitals, and other quasi-public and private non-profit organizations such as, but not limited to, community action agencies, research institutes, educational associations, and health centers. The term may include commercial organizations, foreign or international organizations (such as agencies of the United Nations) which are recipients, subrecipients, or contractors or subcontractors of recipients or subrecipients at the discretion of the Federal awarding agency.

      (dd)  means all research activities, both basic and applied, and all development activities that are supported at universities, colleges, and other non-profit institutions. “Research” is defined as a systematic study directed toward fuller scientific knowledge or understanding of the subject studied. “Development” is the systematic use of knowledge and understanding gained from research directed toward the production of useful materials, devices, systems, or methods, including design and development of prototypes and processes. The term research also includes activities involving the training of individuals in research techniques where such activities utilize the same facilities as other research and development activities and where such activities are not included in the instruction function.

      (ee)  means a grant or cooperative agreement not exceeding the small purchase threshold fixed at 41 U.S.C. 403(11) (currently $25,000).

      (ff)  means an award of financial assistance in the form of money, or property in lieu of money, made under an award by a recipient to an eligible subrecipient or by a subrecipient to a lower tier subrecipient. The term includes financial assistance when provided by any legal agreement, even if the agreement is called a contract, but does not include procurement of goods and services nor does it include any form of assistance which is excluded from the definition of “award” in paragraph 105-72.101(e).

      (ii)  means an action by a Federal awarding agency that temporarily withdraws Federal sponsorship under an award, pending corrective action by the recipient or pending a decision to terminate the award by the Federal awarding agency. _Suspension_ of an award is a separate action from suspension under Federal agency regulations implementing E.O.s 12549 and 12689, “Debarment and Suspension.”

      (jj)  means the cancellation of Federal sponsorship, in whole or in part, under an agreement at any time prior to the date of completion.

      (nn)  means the difference between the amount awarded and the amount which could have been awarded under the recipient's approved negotiated indirect cost rate.

      (oo)  means a procedure where by funds are advanced to the recipient to cover its estimated disbursement needs for a given initial period.

      § 105-72.102   Effect on other issuances.

#### § § 105-72.102

      For awards subject to this regulation, all administrative requirements of codified program regulations, program manuals, handbooks and other nonregulatory materials which are inconsistent with the requirements of this regulation shall be superseded, except to the extent they are required by statute, or authorized in accordance with the deviations provision in § 105-72.103.

      § 105-72.103   Deviations.

#### § § 105-72.103

      The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) may grant exceptions for classes of grants or recipients subject to the requirements of this regulation when exceptions are not prohibited by statute. However, in the interest of maximum uniformity, exceptions from the requirements of this regulation shall be permitted only in unusual circumstances. Federal awarding agencies may apply more restrictive requirements to a class of recipients when approved by OMB. Federal awarding agencies may apply less restrictive requirements when awarding small awards, except for those requirements which are statutory. Exceptions on a case-by-case basis may also be made by Federal awarding agencies.

      § 105-72.104   Subawards.

#### § § 105-72.104

      Unless sections of this regulation specifically exclude subrecipients from coverage, the provisions of this regulation shall be applied to subrecipients performing work under awards if such subrecipients are institutions of higher education, hospitals or other non-profit organizations. State and local government subrecipients are subject to the provisions of regulations implementing the grants management common rule, “Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants and Cooperative Agreements to State and Local Governments,” 41 CFR 105-71.

    Subpart 105-72.2—Pre-Award Requirements

      § 105-72.200   Purpose.

#### § § 105-72.200

      Sections 105-72.201 through 105-72.207 prescribes forms and instructions and other pre-award matters to be used in applying for Federal awards.

      § 105-72.201   Pre-award policies.

#### § § 105-72.201

      (a)  In each instance, the Federal awarding agency shall decide on the appropriate award instrument (i.e., grant, cooperative agreement, or contract). The Federal Grant and Cooperative Agreement Act (31 U.S.C. 6301-08) governs the use of grants, cooperative agreements and contracts. A grant or cooperative agreement shall be used only when the principal purpose of a transaction is to accomplish a public purpose of support or stimulation authorized by Federal statute. The statutory criterion for choosing between grants and cooperative agreements is that for the latter, “substantial involvement is expected between the executive agency and the State, local government, or other recipient when carrying out the activity contemplated in the agreement.” Contracts shall be used when the principal purpose is acquisition of property or services for the direct benefit or use of the Federal Government.

      (b)  Federal awarding agencies shall notify the public of its intended funding priorities for discretionary grant programs, unless funding priorities are established by Federal statute.

      § 105-72.202   Forms for applying for Federal assistance.

#### § § 105-72.202

      (a) Federal awarding agencies shall comply with the applicable report clearance requirements of 5 CFR part 1320, “Controlling Paperwork Burdens on the Public,” with regard to all forms used by the Federal awarding agency in place of or as a supplement to the Standard Form 424 (SF-424) series.

      (b) Applicants shall use the SF-424 series or those forms and instructions prescribed by the Federal awarding agency.

      (c) For Federal programs covered by E.O. 12372, “Intergovernmental Review of Federal Programs,” the applicant shall complete the appropriate sections of the SF-424 (Application for Federal Assistance) indicating whether the application was subject to review by the State Single Point of Contact (SPOC). The name and address of the SPOC for a particular State can be obtained from the Federal awarding agency or the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance. The SPOC shall advise the applicant whether the program for which application is made has been selected by that State for review.

      (d) Federal awarding agencies that do not use the SF-424 form should indicate whether the application is subject to review by the State under E.O. 12372.

      § 105-72.203   Debarment and suspension.

#### § § 105-72.203

      Federal awarding agencies and recipients shall comply with the nonprocurement debarment and suspension common rule implementing E.O.s 12549 and 12689, “Debarment and Suspension.” This common rule restricts subawards and contracts with certain parties that are debarred, suspended or otherwise excluded from or ineligible for participation in Federal assistance programs or activities.

      § 105-72.204   Special award conditions.

#### § § 105-72.204

      If an applicant or recipient:

      (a) Has a history of poor performance,

      (b) Is not financially stable,

      (c) Has a management system that does not meet the standards prescribed in this regulation,

      (d) Has not conformed to the terms and conditions of a previous award, or

      (e) Is not otherwise responsible;

      § 105-72.205   Metric system of measurement.

#### § § 105-72.205

      The Metric Conversion Act, as amended by the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act (15 U.S.C. 205) declares that the metric system is the preferred measurement system for U.S. trade and commerce. The Act requires each Federal agency to establish a date or dates in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce, when the metric system of measurement will be used in the agency's procurements, grants, and other business-related activities. Metric implementation may take longer where the use of the system is initially impractical or likely to cause significant inefficiencies in the accomplishment of federally-funded activities. Federal awarding agencies shall follow the provisions of E.O. 12770, “Metric Usage in Federal Government Programs.”

      § 105-72.206   Resource Conservation and Recovery Act.

#### § § 105-72.206

      Under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) (Pub. L. 94-580 codified at 42 U.S.C. 6962), any State agency or agency of a political subdivision of a State which is using appropriated Federal funds must comply with section 6002. Section 6002 requires that preference be given in procurement programs to the purchase of specific products containing recycled materials identified in guidelines developed by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) (40 CFR parts 247 through 254). Accordingly, State and local institutions of higher education, hospitals, and non-profit organizations that receive direct Federal awards or other Federal funds shall give preference in their procurement programs funded with Federal funds to the purchase of recycled products pursuant to the EPA guidelines.

      § 105-72.207   Certifications and representations.

#### § § 105-72.207

      Unless prohibited by statute or codified regulation, each Federal awarding agency is authorized and encouraged to allow recipients to submit certifications and representations required by statute, executive order, or regulation on an annual basis, if the recipients have ongoing and continuing relationships with the agency. Annual certifications and representations shall be signed by responsible officials with the authority to ensure recipients' compliance with the pertinent requirements.

    Subpart 105-72.30—Post-Award Requirements/Financial and Program Management

      § 105-72.300   Purpose of financial and program management.

#### § § 105-72.300

      Sections 105-72.301 through 105-72.308 prescribe standards for financial management systems, methods for making payments and rules for: satisfying cost sharing and matching requirements, accounting for program income, budget revision approvals, making audits, determining allowability of cost, and establishing fund availability.

      § 105-72.301   Standards for financial management systems.

#### § § 105-72.301

      (a) Federal awarding agencies shall require recipients to relate financial data to performance data and develop unit cost information whenever practical.

      (b) Recipients' financial management systems shall provide for the following.

      (1) Accurate, current and complete disclosure of the financial results of each federally-sponsored project or program in accordance with the reporting requirements set forth in § 105-72.602. If a Federal awarding agency requires reporting on an accrual basis from a recipient that maintains its records on other than an accrual basis, the recipient shall not be required to establish an accrual accounting system. These recipients may develop such accrual data for its reports on the basis of an analysis of the documentation on hand.

      (2) Records that identify adequately the source and application of funds for federally-sponsored activities. These records shall contain information pertaining to Federal awards, authorizations, obligations, unobligated balances, assets, outlays, income and interest.

      (3) Effective control over and accountability for all funds, property and other assets. Recipients shall adequately safeguard all such assets and assure they are used solely for authorized purposes.

      (4) Comparison of outlays with budget amounts for each award. Whenever appropriate, financial information should be related to performance and unit cost data.

      (5) Written procedures to minimize the time elapsing between the transfer of funds to the recipient from the U.S. Treasury and the issuance or redemption of checks, warrants or payments by other means for program purposes by the recipient. To the extent that the provisions of the Cash Management Improvement Act (CMIA) (Pub. L. 101-453) govern, payment methods of State agencies, instrumentalities, and fiscal agents shall be consistent with CMIA Treasury-State Agreements or the CMIA default procedures codified at 31 CFR part 205, “Withdrawal of Cash from the Treasury for Advances under Federal Grant and Other Programs.”

      (6) Written procedures for determining the reasonableness, allocability and allowability of costs in accordance with the provisions of the applicable Federal cost principles and the terms and conditions of the award.

      (7) Accounting records including cost accounting records that are supported by source documentation.

      (c) Where the Federal Government guarantees or insures the repayment of money borrowed by the recipient, the Federal awarding agency, at its discretion, may require adequate bonding and insurance if the bonding and insurance requirements of the recipient are not deemed adequate to protect the interest of the Federal Government.

      (d) The Federal awarding agency may require adequate fidelity bond coverage where the recipient lacks sufficient coverage to protect the Federal Government's interest.

      (e) Where bonds are required in the situations described above, the bonds shall be obtained from companies holding certificates of authority as acceptable sureties, as prescribed in 31 CFR part 223, “Surety Companies Doing Business with the United States.”

      § 105-72.302   Payment.

#### § § 105-72.302

      (a) Payment methods shall minimize the time elapsing between the transfer of funds from the United States Treasury and the issuance or redemption of checks, warrants, or payment by other means by the recipients. Payment methods of State agencies or instrumentalities shall be consistent with Treasury-State CMIA agreements or default procedures codified at 31 CFR part 205.

      (b)(1) Recipients are to be paid in advance, provided they maintain or demonstrate the willingness to maintain:

      (i) Written procedures that minimize the time elapsing between the transfer of funds and disbursement by the recipient, and

      (ii) Financial management systems that meet the standards for fund control and accountability as established in § 105-72.301.

      (2) Cash advances to a recipient organization shall be limited to the minimum amounts needed and be timed to be in accordance with the actual, immediate cash requirements of the recipient organization in carrying out the purpose of the approved program or project. The timing and amount of cash advances shall be as close as is administratively feasible to the actual disbursements by the recipient organization for direct program or project costs and the proportionate share of any allowable indirect costs.

      (c) Whenever possible, advances shall be consolidated to cover anticipated cash needs for all awards made by the Federal awarding agency to the recipient.

      (1) Advance payment mechanisms include, but are not limited to, Treasury check and electronic funds transfer.

      (2) Advance payment mechanisms are subject to 31 CFR part 205.

      (3) Recipients shall be authorized to submit requests for advances and reimbursements at least monthly when electronic fund transfers are not used.

      (d) Requests for Treasury check advance payment shall be submitted on SF-270, “Request for Advance or Reimbursement,” or other forms as may be authorized by OMB. This form is not to be used when Treasury check advance payments are made to the recipient automatically through the use of a predetermined payment schedule or if precluded by special Federal awarding agency instructions for electronic funds transfer.

      (e) Reimbursement is the preferred method when the requirements in paragraph (b) cannot be met. Federal awarding agencies may also use this method on any construction agreement, or if the major portion of the construction project is accomplished through private market financing or Federal loans, and the Federal assistance constitutes a minor portion of the project.

      (1) When the reimbursement method is used, the Federal awarding agency shall make payment within 30 days after receipt of the billing, unless the billing is improper.

      (2) Recipients shall be authorized to submit request for reimbursement at least monthly when electronic funds transfers are not used.

      (f) If a recipient cannot meet the criteria for advance payments and the Federal awarding agency has determined that reimbursement is not feasible because the recipient lacks sufficient working capital, the Federal awarding agency may provide cash on a working capital advance basis. Under this procedure, the Federal awarding agency shall advance cash to the recipient to cover its estimated disbursement needs for an initial period generally geared to the awardee's disbursing cycle. Thereafter, the Federal awarding agency shall reimburse the recipient for its actual cash disbursements. The working capital advance method of payment shall not be used for recipients unwilling or unable to provide timely advances to their subrecipient to meet the subrecipient's actual cash disbursements.

      (g) To the extent available, recipients shall disburse funds available from repayments to and interest earned on a revolving fund, program income, rebates, refunds, contract settlements, audit recoveries and interest earned on such funds before requesting additional cash payments.

      (h) Unless otherwise required by statute, Federal awarding agencies shall not withhold payments for proper charges made by recipients at any time during the project period unless paragraphs (h)(1) or (2) of this section apply.

      (1) A recipient has failed to comply with the project objectives, the terms and conditions of the award, or Federal reporting requirements.

      (2) The recipient or subrecipient is delinquent in a debt to the United States as defined in OMB Circular A-129, “Managing Federal Credit Programs.” Under such conditions, the Federal awarding agency may, upon reasonable notice, inform the recipient that payments shall not be made for obligations incurred after a specified date until the conditions are corrected or the indebtedness to the Federal Government is liquidated.

      (i) Standards governing the use of banks and other institutions as depositories of funds advanced under awards are as follows:

      (1) Except for situations described in paragraph (i)(2), Federal awarding agencies shall not require separate depository accounts for funds provided to a recipient or establish any eligibility requirements for depositories for funds provided to a recipient. However, recipients must be able to account for the receipt, obligation and expenditure of funds.

      (2) Advances of Federal funds shall be deposited and maintained in insured accounts whenever possible.

      (j) Consistent with the national goal of expanding the opportunities for women-owned and minority-owned business enterprises, recipients shall be encouraged to use womenowned and minority-owned banks (a bank which is owned at least 50 percent by women or minority group members).

      (k) Recipients shall maintain advances of Federal funds in interest bearing accounts, unless paragraph (k)(1), (2) or (3) of this section apply.

      (1) The recipient receives less than $120,000 in Federal awards per year.

      (2) The best reasonably available interest bearing account would not be expected to earn interest in excess of $250 per year on Federal cash balances.

      (3) The depository would require an average or minimum balance so high that it would not be feasible within the expected Federal and non-Federal cash resources.

      (l) For those entities where CMIA and its implementing regulations do not apply, interest earned on Federal advances deposited in interest bearing accounts shall be remitted annually to Department of Health and Human Services, Payment Management System, P.O. Box 6021, Rockville, MD 20852. Interest amounts up to $250 per year may be retained by the recipient for administrative expense. State universities and hospitals shall comply with CMIA, as it pertains to interest. If an entity subject to CMIA uses its own funds to pay pre-award costs for discretionary awards without prior written approval from the Federal awarding agency, it waives its right to recover the interest under CMIA.

      (m) Except as noted elsewhere in this regulation, only the following forms shall be authorized for the recipients in requesting advances and reimbursements. Federal agencies shall not require more than an original and two copies of these forms.

      (1)  Each Federal awarding agency shall adopt the SF-270 as a standard form for all nonconstruction programs when electronic funds transfer or predetermined advance methods are not used. Federal awarding agencies, however, have the option of using this form for construction programs in lieu of the SF-271, “Outlay Report and Request for Reimbursement for Construction Programs.”

      (2)  Each Federal awarding agency shall adopt the SF-271 as the standard form to be used for requesting reimbursement for construction programs. However, a Federal awarding agency may substitute the SF-270 when the Federal awarding agency determines that it provides adequate information to meet Federal needs.

      § 105-72.303   Cost sharing or matching.

#### § § 105-72.303

      (a) All contributions, including cash and third party in-kind, shall be accepted as part of the recipient's cost sharing or matching when such contributions meet all of the following criteria.

      (1) Are verifiable from the recipient's records.

      (2) Are not included as contributions for any other federally-assisted project or program.

      (3) Are necessary and reasonable for proper and efficient accomplishment of project or program objectives.

      (4) Are allowable under the applicable cost principles.

      (5) Are not paid by the Federal Government under another award, except where authorized by Federal statute to be used for cost sharing or matching.

      (6) Are provided for in the approved budget when required by the Federal awarding agency.

      (7) Conform to other provisions of this regulation, as applicable.

      (b) Unrecovered indirect costs may be included as part of cost sharing or matching only with the prior approval of the Federal awarding agency.

      (c) Values for recipient contributions of services and property shall be established in accordance with the applicable cost principles. If a Federal awarding agency authorizes recipients to donate buildings or land for construction/facilities acquisition projects or long-term use, the value of the donated property for cost sharing or matching shall be the lesser of paragraph (c)(1) or (2) of this section.

      (1) The certified value of the remaining life of the property recorded in the recipient's accounting records at the time of donation.

      (2) The current fair market value. However, when there is sufficient justification, the Federal awarding agency may approve the use of the current fair market value of the donated property, even if it exceeds the certified value at the time of donation to the project.

      (d) Volunteer services furnished by professional and technical personnel, consultants, and other skilled and unskilled labor may be counted as cost sharing or matching if the service is an integral and necessary part of an approved project or program. Rates for volunteer services shall be consistent with those paid for similar work in the recipient's organization. In those instances in which the required skills are not found in the recipient organization, rates shall be consistent with those paid for similar work in the labor market in which the recipient competes for the kind of services involved. In either case, paid fringe benefits that are reasonable, allowable, and allocable may be included in the valuation.

      (e) When an employer other than the recipient furnishes the services of an employee, these services shall be valued at the employee's regular rate of pay (plus an amount of fringe benefits that are reasonable, allowable, and allocable, but exclusive of overhead costs), provided these services are in the same skill for which the employee is normally paid.

      (f) Donated supplies may include such items as expendable equipment, office supplies, laboratory supplies or workshop and classroom supplies. Value assessed to donated supplies included in the cost sharing or matching share shall be reasonable and shall not exceed the fair market value of the property at the time of the donation.

      (g) The method used for determining cost sharing or matching for donated equipment, buildings and land for which title passes to the recipient may differ according to the purpose of the award, if paragraph (g)(1) or (2) of this section apply.

      (1) If the purpose of the award is to assist the recipient in the acquisition of equipment, buildings or land, the total value of the donated property may be claimed as cost sharing or matching.

      (2) If the purpose of the award is to support activities that require the use of equipment, buildings or land, normally only depreciation or use charges for equipment and buildings may be made. However, the full value of equipment or other capital assets and fair rental charges for land may be allowed, provided that the Federal awarding agency has approved the charges.

      (h) The value of donated property shall be determined in accordance with the usual accounting policies of the recipient, with the following qualifications.

      (1) The value of donated land and buildings shall not exceed its fair market value at the time of donation to the recipient as established by an independent appraiser (e.g., certified real property appraiser or General Services Administration representative) and certified by a responsible official of the recipient.

      (2) The value of donated equipment shall not exceed the fair market value of equipment of the same age and condition at the time of donation.

      (3) The value of donated space shall not exceed the fair rental value of comparable space as established by an independent appraisal of comparable space and facilities in a privately-owned building in the same locality.

      (4) The value of loaned equipment shall not exceed its fair rental value.

      (5) The following requirements pertain to the recipient's supporting records for in-kind contributions from third parties.

      (i) Volunteer services shall be documented and, to the extent feasible, supported by the same methods used by the recipient for its own employees.

      (ii) The basis for determining the valuation for personal service, material, equipment, buildings and land shall be documented.

      § 105-72.304   Program income.

#### § § 105-72.304

      (a) Federal awarding agencies shall apply the standards set forth in this section in requiring recipient organizations to account for program income related to projects financed in whole or in part with Federal funds.

      (b) Except as provided in paragraph (h) of this section, program income earned during the project period shall be retained by the recipient and, in accordance with Federal awarding agency regulations or the terms and conditions of the award, shall be used in one or more of the ways listed in the following.

      (1) Added to funds committed to the project by the Federal awarding agency and recipient and used to further eligible project or program objectives.

      (2) Used to finance the non-Federal share of the project or program.

      (3) Deducted from the total project or program allowable cost in determining the net allowable costs on which the Federal share of costs is based.

      (c) When an agency authorizes the disposition of program income as described in paragraphs (b)(1) or (b)(2), program income in excess of any limits stipulated shall be used in accordance with paragraph (b)(3).

      (d) In the event that the Federal awarding agency does not specify in its regulations or the terms and conditions of the award how program income is to be used, paragraph (b)(3) shall apply automatically to all projects or programs except research. For awards that support research, paragraph (b)(1) shall apply automatically unless the awarding agency indicates in the terms and conditions another alternative on the award or the recipient is subject to special award conditions, as indicated in § 105-72.204.

      (e) Unless Federal awarding agency regulations or the terms and conditions of the award provide otherwise, recipients shall have no obligation to the Federal Government regarding program income earned after the end of the project period.

      (f) If authorized by Federal awarding agency regulations or the terms and conditions of the award, costs incident to the generation of program income may be deducted from gross income to determine program income, provided these costs have not been charged to the award.

      (g) Proceeds from the sale of property shall be handled in accordance with the requirements of the Property Standards (See §§ 105-72.400 through 105-72.407).

      (h) Unless Federal awarding agency regulations or the terms and condition of the award provide otherwise, recipients shall have no obligation to the Federal Government with respect to program income earned from license fees and royalties for copyrighted material, patents, patent applications, trademarks, and inventions produced under an award. However, Patent and Trademark Amendments (35 U.S.C. 18) apply to inventions made under an experimental, developmental, or research award.

      § 105-72.305   Revision of budget and program plans.

#### § § 105-72.305

      (a) The budget plan is the financial expression of the project or program as approved during the award process. It may include either the Federal and non-Federal share, or only the Federal share, depending upon Federal awarding agency requirements. It shall be related to performance for program evaluation purposes whenever appropriate.

      (b) Recipients are required to report deviations from budget and program plans, and request prior approvals for budget and program plan revisions, in accordance with this section.

      (c) For nonconstruction awards, recipients shall request prior approvals from Federal awarding agencies for one or more of the following program or budget related reasons.

      (1) Change in the scope or the objective of the project or program (even if there is no associated budget revision requiring prior written approval).

      (2) Change in a key person specified in the application or award document.

      (3) The absence for more than three months, or a 25 percent reduction in time devoted to the project, by the approved project director or principal investigator.

      (4) The need for additional Federal funding.

      (5) The transfer of amounts budgeted for indirect costs to absorb increases in direct costs, or vice versa, if approval is required by the Federal awarding agency.

      (6) The inclusion, unless waived by the Federal awarding agency, of costs that require prior approval in accordance with OMB Circular A-21, “Cost Principles for Institutions of Higher Education,” OMB Circular A-122, “Cost Principles for Non-Profit Organizations,” or 45 CFR part 74 appendix E, “Principles for Determining Costs Applicable to Research and Development under Grants and Contracts with Hospitals,” or 48 CFR part 31, “Contract Cost Principles and Procedures,” as applicable.

      (7) The transfer of funds allotted for training allowances (direct payment to trainees) to other categories of expense.

      (8) Unless described in the application and funded in the approved awards, the subaward, transfer or contracting out of any work under an award. This provision does not apply to the purchase of supplies, material, equipment or general support services.

      (d) No other prior approval requirements for specific items may be imposed unless a deviation has been approved by OMB.

      (e) Except for requirements listed in paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(4) of this section, Federal awarding agencies are authorized, at their option, to waive cost-related and administrative prior written approvals required by this regulation and OMB Circulars A-21 and A-122. Such waivers may include authorizing recipients to do any one or more of the following.

      (1) Incur pre-award costs 90 calendar days prior to award or more than 90 calendar days with the prior approval of the Federal awarding agency. All pre-award costs are incurred at the recipient's risk (i.e., the Federal awarding agency is under no obligation to reimburse such costs if for any reason the recipient does not receive an award or if the award is less than anticipated and inadequate to cover such costs).

      (2) Initiate a one-time extension of the expiration date of the award of up to 12 months unless one or more of the following conditions apply. For one-time extensions, the recipient must notify the Federal awarding agency in writing with the supporting reasons and revised expiration date at least 10 days before the expiration date specified in the award. This one-time extension may not be exercised merely for the purpose of using unobligated balances.

      (i) The terms and conditions of award prohibit the extension.

      (ii) The extension requires additional Federal funds.

      (iii) The extension involves any change in the approved objectives or scope of the project.

      (3) Carry forward unobligated balances to subsequent funding periods.

      (4) For awards that support research, unless the Federal awarding agency provides otherwise in the award or in the agency's regulations, the prior approval requirements described in paragraph (e) are automatically waived (i.e., recipients need not obtain such prior approvals) unless one of the conditions included in paragraph (e)(2) applies.

      (f) The Federal awarding agency may, at its option, restrict the transfer of funds among direct cost categories or programs, functions and activities for awards in which the Federal share of the project exceeds $100,000 and the cumulative amount of such transfers exceeds or is expected to exceed 10 percent of the total budget as last approved by the Federal awarding agency. No Federal awarding agency shall permit a transfer that would cause any Federal appropriation or part thereof to be used for purposes other than those consistent with the original intent of the appropriation.

      (g) All other changes to nonconstruction budgets, except for the changes described in paragraph (j), do not require prior approval.

      (h) For construction awards, recipients shall request prior written approval promptly from Federal awarding agencies for budget revisions whenever paragraphs (h)(1), (2) or (3) of this section apply.

      (1) The revision results from changes in the scope or the objective of the project or program.

      (2) The need arises for additional Federal funds to complete the project.

      (3) A revision is desired which involves specific costs for which prior written approval requirements may be imposed consistent with applicable OMB cost principles listed in § 105-72.307.

      (i) No other prior approval requirements for specific items may be imposed unless a deviation has been approved by OMB.

      (j) When a Federal awarding agency makes an award that provides support for both construction and nonconstruction work, the Federal awarding agency may require the recipient to request prior approval from the Federal awarding agency before making any fund or budget transfers between the two types of work supported.

      (k) For both construction and nonconstruction awards, Federal awarding agencies shall require recipients to notify the Federal awarding agency in writing promptly whenever the amount of Federal authorized funds is expected to exceed the needs of the recipient for the project period by more than $5000 or five percent of the Federal award, whichever is greater. This notification shall not be required if an application for additional funding is submitted for a continuation award.

      (l) When requesting approval for budget revisions, recipients shall use the budget forms that were used in the application unless the Federal awarding agency indicates a letter of request suffices.

      (m) Within 30 calendar days from the date of receipt of the request for budget revisions, Federal awarding agencies shall review the request and notify the recipient whether the budget revisions have been approved. If the revision is still under consideration at the end of 30 calendar days, the Federal awarding agency shall inform the recipient in writing of the date when the recipient may expect the decision.

      § 105-72.306   Non-Federal audits.

#### § § 105-72.306

      (a) Recipients and subrecipients that are institutions of higher education or other non-profit organizations (including hospitals) shall be subject to the audit requirements contained in the Single Audit Act Amendments of 1996 (31 U.S.C. 7501-7507) and revised OMB Circular A-133, “Audits of States, Local Governments, and Non-Profit Organizations.”

      (b) State and local governments shall be subject to the audit requirements contained in the Single Audit Act Amendments of 1996 (31 U.S.C. 7501-7507) and revised OMB Circular A-133, “Audits of States, Local Governments, and Non-Profit Organizations.”

      (c) For-profit hospitals not covered by the audit provisions of revised OMB Circular A-133 shall be subject to the audit requirements of the Federal awarding agencies.

      (d) Commercial organizations shall be subject to the audit requirements of the Federal awarding agency or the prime recipient as incorporated into the award document.

      § 105-72.307   Allowable costs.

#### § § 105-72.307

      For each kind of recipient, there is a set of Federal principles for determining allowable costs. Allowability of costs shall be determined in accordance with the cost principles applicable to the entity incurring the costs. Thus, allowability of costs incurred by State, local or federally-recognized Indian tribal governments is determined in accordance with the provisions of OMB Circular A-87, “Cost Principles for State and Local Governments.” The allowability of costs incurred by non-profit organizations is determined in accordance with the provisions of OMB Circular A-122, “Cost Principles for Non-Profit Organizations.” The allowability of costs incurred by institutions of higher education is determined in accordance with the provisions of OMB Circular A-21, “Cost Principles for Educational Institutions.” The allowability of costs incurred by hospitals is determined in accordance with the provisions of appendix E of 45 CFR part 74, “Principles for Determining Costs Applicable to Research and Development Under Grants and Contracts with Hospitals.” The allowability of costs incurred by commercial organizations and those non-profit organizations listed in Attachment C to Circular A-122 is determined in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) at 48 CFR part 31.

      § 105-72.308   Period of availability of funds.

#### § § 105-72.308

      Where a funding period is specified, a recipient may charge to the grant only allowable costs resulting from obligations incurred during the funding period and any pre-award costs authorized by the Federal awarding agency.

    Subpart 105-72.40—Post-Award Requirements/Property Standards

      § 105-72.400   Purpose of property standards.

#### § § 105-72.400

      Sections 105-72.401 through 105-72.407 set forth uniform standards governing management and disposition of property furnished by the Federal Government whose cost was charged to a project supported by a Federal award. Federal awarding agencies shall require recipients to observe these standards under awards and shall not impose additional requirements, unless specifically required by Federal statute. The recipient may use its own property management standards and procedures provided it observes the provisions of § 105-72.401 through § 105-72.407.

      § 105-72.401   Insurance coverage.

#### § § 105-72.401

      Recipients shall, at a minimum, provide the equivalent insurance coverage for real property and equipment acquired with Federal funds as provided to property owned by the recipient. Federally-owned property need not be insured unless required by the terms and conditions of the award.

      § 105-72.402   Real property.

#### § § 105-72.402

      Each Federal awarding agency shall prescribe requirements for recipients concerning the use and disposition of real property acquired in whole or in part under awards. Unless otherwise provided by statute, such requirements, at a minimum, shall contain the following.

      (a) Title to real property shall vest in the recipient subject to the condition that the recipient shall use the real property for the authorized purpose of the project as long as it is needed and shall not encumber the property without approval of the Federal awarding agency.

      (b) The recipient shall obtain written approval by the Federal awarding agency for the use of real property in other federally-sponsored projects when the recipient determines that the property is no longer needed for the purpose of the original project. Use in other projects shall be limited to those under federally-sponsored projects (i.e., awards) or programs that have purposes consistent with those authorized for support by the Federal awarding agency.

      (c) When the real property is no longer needed as provided in paragraphs (a) and (b), the recipient shall request disposition instructions from the Federal awarding agency or its successor Federal awarding agency. The Federal awarding agency shall observe one or more of the following disposition instructions.

      (1) The recipient may be permitted to retain title without further obligation to the Federal Government after it compensates the Federal Government for that percentage of the current fair market value of the property attributable to the Federal participation in the project.

      (2) The recipient may be directed to sell the property under guidelines provided by the Federal awarding agency and pay the Federal Government for that percentage of the current fair market value of the property attributable to the Federal participation in the project (after deducting actual and reasonable selling and fix-up expenses, if any, from the sales proceeds). When the recipient is authorized or required to sell the property, proper sales procedures shall be established that provide for competition to the extent practicable and result in the highest possible return.

      (3) The recipient may be directed to transfer title to the property to the Federal Government or to an eligible third party provided that, in such cases, the recipient shall be entitled to compensation for its attributable percentage of the current fair market value of the property.

      § 105-72.403   Federally-owned and exempt property.

#### § § 105-72.403

      (a)  (1) Title to federally-owned property remains vested in the Federal Government. Recipients shall submit annually an inventory listing of federally-owned property in their custody to the Federal awarding agency. Upon completion of the award or when the property is no longer needed, the recipient shall report the property to the Federal awarding agency for further Federal agency utilization.

      (2) If the Federal awarding agency has no further need for the property, it shall be declared excess and reported to the General Services Administration, unless the Federal awarding agency has statutory authority to dispose of the property by alternative methods (e.g., the authority provided by the Federal Technology Transfer Act (15 U.S.C. 3710 (I)) to donate research equipment to educational and non-profit organizations in accordance with E.O. 12821, “Improving Mathematics and Science Education in Support of the National Education Goals.”) Appropriate instructions shall be issued to the recipient by the Federal awarding agency.

      (b)  When statutory authority exists, the Federal awarding agency has the option to vest title to property acquired with Federal funds in the recipient without further obligation to the Federal Government and under conditions the Federal awarding agency considers appropriate. Such property is “exempt property.” Should a Federal awarding agency not establish conditions, title to exempt property upon acquisition shall vest in the recipient without further obligation to the Federal Government.

      § 105-72.404   Equipment.

#### § § 105-72.404

      (a) Title to equipment acquired by a recipient with Federal funds shall vest in the recipient, subject to conditions of this section.

      (b) The recipient shall not use equipment acquired with Federal funds to provide services to non-Federal outside organizations for a fee that is less than private companies charge for equivalent services, unless specifically authorized by Federal statute, for as long as the Federal Government retains an interest in the equipment.

      (c) The recipient shall use the equipment in the project or program for which it was acquired as long as needed, whether or not the project or program continues to be supported by Federal funds and shall not encumber the property without approval of the Federal awarding agency. When no longer needed for the original project or program, the recipient shall use the equipment in connection with its other federally-sponsored activities, in the following order of priority:

      (1) Activities sponsored by the Federal awarding agency which funded the original project, then

      (2) Activities sponsored by other Federal awarding agencies.

      (d) During the time that equipment is used on the project or program for which it was acquired, the recipient shall make it available for use on other projects or programs if such other use will not interfere with the work on the project or program for which the equipment was originally acquired. First preference for such other use shall be given to other projects or programs sponsored by the Federal awarding agency that financed the equipment; second preference shall be given to projects or programs sponsored by other Federal awarding agencies. If the equipment is owned by the Federal Government, use on other activities not sponsored by the Federal Government shall be permissible if authorized by the Federal awarding agency. User charges shall be treated as program income.

      (e) When acquiring replacement equipment, the recipient may use the equipment to be replaced as trade-in or sell the equipment and use the proceeds to offset the costs of the replacement equipment subject to the approval of the Federal awarding agency.

      (f) The recipient's property management standards for equipment acquired with Federal funds and federally-owned equipment shall include all of the following.

      (1) Equipment records shall be maintained accurately and shall include the following information.

      (i) A description of the equipment.

      (ii) Manufacturer's serial number, model number, Federal stock number, national stock number, or other identification number.

      (iii) Source of the equipment, including the award number.

      (iv) Whether title vests in the recipient or the Federal Government.

      (v) Acquisition date (or date received, if the equipment was furnished by the Federal Government) and cost.

      (vi) Information from which one can calculate the percentage of Federal participation in the cost of the equipment (not applicable to equipment furnished by the Federal Government).

      (vii) Location and condition of the equipment and the date the information was reported.

      (viii) Unit acquisition cost.

      (ix) Ultimate disposition data, including date of disposal and sales price or the method used to determine current fair market value where a recipient compensates the Federal awarding agency for its share.

      (2) Equipment owned by the Federal Government shall be identified to indicate Federal ownership.

      (3) A physical inventory of equipment shall be taken and the results reconciled with the equipment records at least once every two years. Any differences between quantities determined by the physical inspection and those shown in the accounting records shall be investigated to determine the causes of the difference. The recipient shall, in connection with the inventory, verify the existence, current utilization, and continued need for the equipment.

      (4) A control system shall be in effect to insure adequate safeguards to prevent loss, damage, or theft of the equipment. Any loss, damage, or theft of equipment shall be investigated and fully documented; if the equipment was owned by the Federal Government, the recipient shall promptly notify the Federal awarding agency.

      (5) Adequate maintenance procedures shall be implemented to keep the equipment in good condition.

      (6) Where the recipient is authorized or required to sell the equipment, proper sales procedures shall be established which provide for competition to the extent practicable and result in the highest possible return.

      (g) When the recipient no longer needs the equipment, the equipment may be used for other activities in accordance with the following standards. For equipment with a current per unit fair market value of $5000 or more, the recipient may retain the equipment for other uses provided that compensation is made to the original Federal awarding agency or its successor. The amount of compensation shall be computed by applying the percentage of Federal participation in the cost of the original project or program to the current fair market value of the equipment. If the recipient has no need for the equipment, the recipient shall request disposition instructions from the Federal awarding agency. The Federal awarding agency shall determine whether the equipment can be used to meet the agency's requirements. If no requirement exists within that agency, the availability of the equipment shall be reported to the General Services Administration by the Federal awarding agency to determine whether a requirement for the equipment exists in other Federal agencies. The Federal awarding agency shall issue instructions to the recipient no later than 120 calendar days after the recipient's request and the following procedures shall govern.

      (1) If so instructed or if disposition instructions are not issued within 120 calendar days after the recipient's request, the recipient shall sell the equipment and reimburse the Federal awarding agency an amount computed by applying to the sales proceeds the percentage of Federal participation in the cost of the original project or program. However, the recipient shall be permitted to deduct and retain from the Federal share $500 or ten percent of the proceeds, whichever is less, for the recipient's selling and handling expenses.

      (2) If the recipient is instructed to ship the equipment elsewhere, the recipient shall be reimbursed by the Federal Government by an amount which is computed by applying the percentage of the recipient's participation in the cost of the original project or program to the current fair market value of the equipment, plus any reasonable shipping or interim storage costs incurred.

      (3) If the recipient is instructed to otherwise dispose of the equipment, the recipient shall be reimbursed by the Federal awarding agency for such costs incurred in its disposition.

      (4) The Federal awarding agency may reserve the right to transfer the title to the Federal Government or to a third party named by the Federal Government when such third party is otherwise eligible under existing statutes. Such transfer shall be subject to the following standards.

      (i) The equipment shall be appropriately identified in the award or otherwise made known to the recipient in writing.

      (ii) The Federal awarding agency shall issue disposition instructions within 120 calendar days after receipt of a final inventory. The final inventory shall list all equipment acquired with grant funds and federally-owned equipment. If the Federal awarding agency fails to issue disposition instructions within the 120 calendar day period, the recipient shall apply the standards of this section, as appropriate.

      (iii) When the Federal awarding agency exercises its right to take title, the equipment shall be subject to the provisions for federally-owned equipment.

      § 105-72.405   Supplies and other expendable property.

#### § § 105-72.405

      (a) Title to supplies and other expendable property shall vest in the recipient upon acquisition. If there is a residual inventory of unused supplies exceeding $5000 in total aggregate value upon termination or completion of the project or program and the supplies are not needed for any other federally-sponsored project or program, the recipient shall retain the supplies for use on non-Federal sponsored activities or sell them, but shall, in either case, compensate the Federal Government for its share. The amount of compensation shall be computed in the same manner as for equipment.

      (b) The recipient shall not use supplies acquired with Federal funds to provide services to non-Federal outside organizations for a fee that is less than private companies charge for equivalent services, unless specifically authorized by Federal statute as long as the Federal Government retains an interest in the supplies.

      § 105-72.406   Intangible property.

#### § § 105-72.406

      (a) The recipient may copyright any work that is subject to copyright and was developed, or for which ownership was purchased, under an award. The Federal awarding agency(ies) reserve a royalty-free, nonexclusive and irrevocable right to reproduce, publish, or otherwise use the work for Federal purposes, and to authorize others to do so.

      (b) Recipients are subject to applicable regulations governing patents and inventions, including governmentwide regulations issued by the Department of Commerce at 37 CFR part 401, “Rights to Inventions Made by Nonprofit Organizations and Small Business Firms Under Government Grants, Contracts and Cooperative Agreements.”

      (c) Unless waived by the Federal awarding agency, the Federal Government has the right to paragraph (c)(1) and (2) of this section.

      (1) Obtain, reproduce, publish or otherwise use the data first produced under an award.

      (2) Authorize others to receive, reproduce, publish, or otherwise use such data for Federal purposes.

      (d) Title to intangible property and debt instruments acquired under an award or subaward vests upon acquisition in the recipient. The recipient shall use that property for the originally-authorized purpose, and the recipient shall not encumber the property without approval of the Federal awarding agency. When no longer needed for the originally authorized purpose, disposition of the intangible property shall occur in accordance with the provisions of § 105-72.404(g).

      § 105-72.407   Property trust relationship.

#### § § 105-72.407

      Real property, equipment, intangible property and debt instruments that are acquired or improved with Federal funds shall be held in trust by the recipient as trustee for the beneficiaries of the project or program under which the property was acquired or improved. Agencies may require recipients to record liens or other appropriate notices of record to indicate that personal or real property has been acquired or improved with Federal funds and that use and disposition conditions apply to the property.

    Subpart 105-72.50—Post-Award Requirements/Procurement Standards

      § 105-72.500   Purpose of procurement standards.

#### § § 105-72.500

      Sections 105-72.501 through 105-72.508 set forth standards for use by recipients in establishing procedures for the procurement of supplies and other expendable property, equipment, real property and other services with Federal funds. These standards are furnished to ensure that such materials and services are obtained in an effective manner and in compliance with the provisions of applicable Federal statutes and executive orders. No additional procurement standards or requirements shall be imposed by the Federal awarding agencies upon recipients, unless specifically required by Federal statute or executive order or approved by OMB.

      § 105-72.501   Recipient responsibilities.

#### § § 105-72.501

      The standards contained in this section do not relieve the recipient of the contractual responsibilities arising under its contract(s). The recipient is the responsible authority, without recourse to the Federal awarding agency, regarding the settlement and satisfaction of all contractual and administrative issues arising out of procurements entered into in support of an award or other agreement. This includes disputes, claims, protests of award, source evaluation or other matters of a contractual nature. Matters concerning violation of statute are to be referred to such Federal, State or local authority as may have proper jurisdiction.

      § 105-72.502   Codes of conduct.

#### § § 105-72.502

      The recipient shall maintain written standards of conduct governing the performance of its employees engaged in the award and administration of contracts. No employee, officer, or agent shall participate in the selection, award, or administration of a contract supported by Federal funds if a real or apparent conflict of interest would be involved. Such a conflict would arise when the employee, officer, or agent, any member of his or her immediate family, his or her partner, or an organization which employs or is about to employ any of the parties indicated herein, has a financial or other interest in the firm selected for an award. The officers, employees, and agents of the recipient shall neither solicit nor accept gratuities, favors, or anything of monetary value from contractors, or parties to subagreements. However, recipients may set standards for situations in which the financial interest is not substantial or the gift is an unsolicited item of nominal value. The standards of conduct shall provide for disciplinary actions to be applied for violations of such standards by officers, employees, or agents of the recipient.

      § 105-72.503   Competition.

#### § § 105-72.503

      All procurement transactions shall be conducted in a manner to provide, to the maximum extent practical, open and free competition. The recipient shall be alert to organizational conflicts of interest as well as noncompetitive practices among contractors that may restrict or eliminate competition or otherwise restrain trade. In order to ensure objective contractor performance and eliminate unfair competitive advantage, contractors that develop or draft specifications, requirements, statements of work, invitations for bids and/or requests for proposals shall be excluded from competing for such procurements. Awards shall be made to the bidder or offeror whose bid or offer is responsive to the solicitation and is most advantageous to the recipient, price, quality and other factors considered. Solicitations shall clearly set forth all requirements that the bidder or offeror shall fulfill in order for the bid or offer to be evaluated by the recipient. Any and all bids or offers may be rejected when it is in the recipient's interest to do so.

      § 105-72.504   Procurement procedures.

#### § § 105-72.504

      (a) All recipients shall establish written procurement procedures. These procedures shall provide for, at a minimum, that paragraphs (a)(1), (2) and (3) of this section apply.

      (1) Recipients avoid purchasing unnecessary items.

      (2) Where appropriate, an analysis is made of lease and purchase alternatives to determine which would be the most economical and practical procurement for the Federal Government.

      (3) Solicitations for goods and services provide for all of the following.

      (i) A clear and accurate description of the technical requirements for the material, product or service to be procured. In competitive procurements, such a description shall not contain features which unduly restrict competition.

      (ii) Requirements which the bidder/offeror must fulfill and all other factors to be used in evaluating bids or proposals.

      (iii) A description, whenever practicable, of technical requirements in terms of functions to be performed or performance required, including the range of acceptable characteristics or minimum acceptable standards.

      (iv) The specific features of “brand name or equal” descriptions that bidders are required to meet when such items are included in the solicitation.

      (v) The acceptance, to the extent practicable and economically feasible, of products and services dimensioned in the metric system of measurement.

      (vi) Preference, to the extent practicable and economically feasible, for products and services that conserve natural resources and protect the environment and are energy efficient.

      (b) Positive efforts shall be made by recipients to utilize small businesses, minority-owned firms, and women's business enterprises, whenever possible. Recipients of Federal awards shall take all of the following steps to further this goal.

      (1) Ensure that small businesses, minority-owned firms, and women's business enterprises are used to the fullest extent practicable.

      (2) Make information on forthcoming opportunities available and arrange timeframes for purchases and contracts to encourage and facilitate participation by small businesses, minority-owned firms, and women's business enterprises.

      (3) Consider in the contract process whether firms competing for larger contracts intend to subcontract with small businesses, minority-owned firms, and women's business enterprises.

      (4) Encourage contracting with consortiums of small businesses, minority-owned firms and women's business enterprises when a contract is too large for one of these firms to handle individually.

      (5) Use the services and assistance, as appropriate, of such organizations as the Small Business Administration and the Department of Commerce's Minority Business Development Agency in the solicitation and utilization of small businesses, minority-owned firms and women's business enterprises.

      (c) The type of procuring instruments used (e.g., fixed price contracts, cost reimbursable contracts, purchase orders, and incentive contracts) shall be determined by the recipient but shall be appropriate for the particular procurement and for promoting the best interest of the program or project involved. The “cost-plus-a-percentage-of-cost” or “percentage of construction cost” methods of contracting shall not be used.

      (d) Contracts shall be made only with responsible contractors who possess the potential ability to perform successfully under the terms and conditions of the proposed procurement. Consideration shall be given to such matters as contractor integrity, record of past performance, financial and technical resources or accessibility to other necessary resources. In certain circumstances, contracts with certain parties are restricted by agencies' implementation of E.O.s 12549 and 12689, “Debarment and Suspension.”

      (e) Recipients shall, on request, make available for the Federal awarding agency, pre-award review and procurement documents, such as request for proposals or invitations for bids, independent cost estimates, etc., when any of the following conditions apply.

      (1) A recipient's procurement procedures or operation fails to comply with the procurement standards in the Federal awarding agency's implementation of this regulation.

      (2) The procurement is expected to exceed the small purchase threshold fixed at 41 U.S.C. 403 (11) (currently $25,000) and is to be awarded without competition or only one bid or offer is received in response to a solicitation.

      (3) The procurement, which is expected to exceed the small purchase threshold, specifies a “brand name” product.

      (4) The proposed award over the small purchase threshold is to be awarded to other than the apparent low bidder under a sealed bid procurement.

      (5) A proposed contract modification changes the scope of a contract or increases the contract amount by more than the amount of the small purchase threshold.

      § 105-72.505   Cost and price analysis.

#### § § 105-72.505

      Some form of cost or price analysis shall be made and documented in the procurement files in connection with every procurement action. Price analysis may be accomplished in various ways, including the comparison of price quotations submitted, market prices and similar indicia, together with discounts. Cost analysis is the review and evaluation of each element of cost to determine reasonableness, allocability and allowability.

      § 105-72.506   Procurement records.

#### § § 105-72.506

      Procurement records and files for purchases in excess of the small purchase threshold shall include the following at a minimum:

      (a) Basis for contractor selection,

      (b) Justification for lack of competition when competitive bids or offers are not obtained, and

      (c) Basis for award cost or price.

      § 105-72.507   Contract administration.

#### § § 105-72.507

      A system for contract administration shall be maintained to ensure contractor conformance with the terms, conditions and specifications of the contract and to ensure adequate and timely follow up of all purchases. Recipients shall evaluate contractor performance and document, as appropriate, whether contractors have met the terms, conditions and specifications of the contract.

      § 105-72.508   Contract provisions.

#### § § 105-72.508

      The recipient shall include, in addition to provisions to define a sound and complete agreement, the following provisions in all contracts. The following provisions shall also be applied to subcontracts.

      (a) Contracts in excess of the small purchase threshold shall contain contractual provisions or conditions that allow for administrative, contractual, or legal remedies in instances in which a contractor violates or breaches the contract terms, and provide for such remedial actions as may be appropriate.

      (b) All contracts in excess of the small purchase threshold shall contain suitable provisions for termination by the recipient, including the manner by which termination shall be effected and the basis for settlement. In addition, such contracts shall describe conditions under which the contract may be terminated for default as well as conditions where the contract may be terminated because of circumstances beyond the control of the contractor.

      (c) Except as otherwise required by statute, an award that requires the contracting (or subcontracting) for construction or facility improvements shall provide for the recipient to follow its own requirements relating to bid guarantees, performance bonds, and payment bonds unless the construction contract or subcontract exceeds $100,000. For those contracts or subcontracts exceeding $100,000, the Federal awarding agency may accept the bonding policy and requirements of the recipient, provided the Federal awarding agency has made a determination that the Federal Government's interest is adequately protected. If such a determination has not been made, the minimum requirements shall be as follows.

      (1) A bid guarantee from each bidder equivalent to five percent of the bid price. The “bid guarantee” shall consist of a firm commitment such as a bid bond, certified check, or other negotiable instrument accompanying a bid as assurance that the bidder shall, upon acceptance of his bid, execute such contractual documents as may be required within the time specified.

      (2) A performance bond on the part of the contractor for 100 percent of the contract price. A “performance bond” is one executed in connection with a contract to secure fulfillment of all the contractor's obligations under such contract.

      (3) A payment bond on the part of the contractor for 100 percent of the contract price. A “payment bond” is one executed in connection with a contract to assure payment as required by statute of all persons supplying labor and material in the execution of the work provided for in the contract.

      (4) Where bonds are required in the situations described herein, the bonds shall be obtained from companies holding certificates of authority as acceptable sureties pursuant to 31 CFR part 223, “Surety Companies Doing Business with the United States.”

      (d) All negotiated contracts (except those for less than the small purchase threshold) awarded by recipients shall include a provision to the effect that the recipient, the Federal awarding agency, the Comptroller General of the United States, or any of their duly authorized representatives, shall have access to any books, documents, papers and records of the contractor which are directly pertinent to a specific program for the purpose of making audits, examinations, excerpts and transcriptions.

      (e) All contracts, including small purchases, awarded by recipients and their contractors shall contain the procurement provisions of appendix A to this part, as applicable.

    Subpart 105-72.60—Post-Award Requirements/Reports and Records

      § 105-72.600   Purpose of reports and records.

#### § § 105-72.600

      Sections 105-72.601 through 105-72.603 set forth the procedures for monitoring and reporting on the recipient's financial and program performance and the necessary standard reporting forms. They also set forth record retention requirements.

      § 105-72.601   Monitoring and reporting program performance.

#### § § 105-72.601

      (a) Recipients are responsible for managing and monitoring each project, program, subaward, function or activity supported by the award. Recipients shall monitor subawards to ensure subrecipients have met the audit requirements as delineated in § 105-72.306.

      (b) The Federal awarding agency shall prescribe the frequency with which the performance reports shall be submitted. Except as provided in paragraph (f) of this section, performance reports shall not be required more frequently than quarterly or, less frequently than annually. Annual reports shall be due 90 calendar days after the grant year; quarterly or semiannual reports shall be due 30 days after the reporting period. The Federal awarding agency may require annual reports before the anniversary dates of multiple year awards in lieu of these requirements. The final performance reports are due 90 calendar days after the expiration or termination of the award.

      (c) If inappropriate, a final technical or performance report shall not be required after completion of the project.

      (d) When required, performance reports shall generally contain, for each award, brief information on each of the following.

      (1) A comparison of actual accomplishments with the goals and objectives established for the period, the findings of the investigator, or both. Whenever appropriate and the output of programs or projects can be readily quantified, such quantitative data should be related to cost data for computation of unit costs.

      (2) Reasons why established goals were not met, if appropriate.

      (3) Other pertinent information including, when appropriate, analysis and explanation of cost overruns or high unit costs.

      (e) Recipients shall not be required to submit more than the original and two copies of performance reports.

      (f) Recipients shall immediately notify the Federal awarding agency of developments that have a significant impact on the award-supported activities. Also, notification shall be given in the case of problems, delays, or adverse conditions which materially impair the ability to meet the objectives of the award. This notification shall include a statement of the action taken or contemplated, and any assistance needed to resolve the situation.

      (g) Federal awarding agencies may make site visits, as needed.

      (h) Federal awarding agencies shall comply with clearance requirements of 5 CFR part 1320 when requesting performance data from recipients.

      § 105-72.602   Financial reporting.

#### § § 105-72.602

      (a) The following forms or such other forms as may be approved by OMB are authorized for obtaining financial information from recipients.

      (1)  (i) Each Federal awarding agency shall require recipients to use the SF-269 or SF-269A to report the status of funds for all nonconstruction projects or programs. A Federal awarding agency may, however, have the option of not requiring the SF-269 or SF-269A when the SF-270, Request for Advance or Reimbursement, or SF-272, Report of Federal Cash Transactions, is determined to provide adequate information to meet its needs, except that a final SF-269 or SF-269A shall be required at the completion of the project when the SF-270 is used only for advances.

      (ii) The Federal awarding agency shall prescribe whether the report shall be on a cash or accrual basis. If the Federal awarding agency requires accrual information and the recipient's accounting records are not normally kept on the accrual basis, the recipient shall not be required to convert its accounting system, but shall develop such accrual information through best estimates based on an analysis of the documentation on hand.

      (iii) The Federal awarding agency shall determine the frequency of the Financial Status Report for each project or program, considering the size and complexity of the particular project or program. However, the report shall not be required more frequently than quarterly or less frequently than annually. A final report shall be required at the completion of the agreement.

      (iv) The Federal awarding agency shall require recipients to submit the SF-269 or SF-269A (an original and no more than two copies) no later than 30 days after the end of each specified reporting period for quarterly and semiannual reports, and 90 calendar days for annual and final reports. Extensions of reporting due dates may be approved by the Federal awarding agency upon request of the recipient.

      (2)  (i) When funds are advanced to recipients the Federal awarding agency shall require each recipient to submit the SF-272 and, when necessary, its continuation sheet, SF-272a. The Federal awarding agency shall use this report to monitor cash advanced to recipients and to obtain disbursement information for each agreement with the recipients.

      (ii) Federal awarding agencies may require forecasts of Federal cash requirements in the “Remarks” section of the report.

      (iii) When practical and deemed necessary, Federal awarding agencies may require recipients to report in the “Remarks” section the amount of cash advances received in excess of three days. Recipients shall provide short narrative explanations of actions taken to reduce the excess balances.

      (iv) Recipients shall be required to submit not more than the original and two copies of the SF-272, 15 calendar days following the end of each quarter. The Federal awarding agencies may require a monthly report from those recipients receiving advances totaling $1 million or more per year.

      (v) Federal awarding agencies may waive the requirement for submission of the SF-272 for any one of the following reasons:

      (A) When monthly advances do not exceed $25,000 per recipient, provided that such advances are monitored through other forms contained in this section;

      (B) If, in the Federal awarding agency's opinion, the recipient's accounting controls are adequate to minimize excessive Federal advances; or,

      (C) When the electronic payment mechanisms provide adequate data.

      (b) When the Federal awarding agency needs additional information or more frequent reports, the following shall be observed.

      (1) When additional information is needed to comply with legislative requirements, Federal awarding agencies shall issue instructions to require recipients to submit such information under the “Remarks” section of the reports.

      (2) When a Federal awarding agency determines that a recipient's accounting system does not meet the standards in § 105-72.301, additional pertinent information to further monitor awards may be obtained upon written notice to the recipient until such time as the system is brought up to standard. The Federal awarding agency, in obtaining this information, shall comply with report clearance requirements of 5 CFR part 1320.

      (3) Federal awarding agencies are encouraged to shade out any line item on any report if not necessary.

      (4) Federal awarding agencies may accept the identical information from the recipients in machine readable format or computer printouts or electronic outputs in lieu of prescribed formats.

      (5) Federal awarding agencies may provide computer or electronic outputs to recipients when such expedites or contributes to the accuracy of reporting.

      § 105-72.603   Retention and access requirements for records.

#### § § 105-72.603

      (a) This section sets forth requirements for record retention and access to records for awards to recipients. Federal awarding agencies shall not impose any other record retention or access requirements upon recipients.

      (b) Financial records, supporting documents, statistical records, and all other records pertinent to an award shall be retained for a period of three years from the date of submission of the final expenditure report or, for awards that are renewed quarterly or annually, from the date of the submission of the quarterly or annual financial report, as authorized by the Federal awarding agency. The only exceptions are the following.

      (1) If any litigation, claim, or audit is started before the expiration of the 3-year period, the records shall be retained until all litigation, claims or audit findings involving the records have been resolved and final action taken.

      (2) Records for real property and equipment acquired with Federal funds shall be retained for 3 years after final disposition.

      (3) When records are transferred to or maintained by the Federal awarding agency, the 3-year retention requirement is not applicable to the recipient.

      (4) Indirect cost rate proposals, cost allocations plans, etc., as specified in paragraph (g) of this section.

      (c) Copies of original records may be substituted for the original records if authorized by the Federal awarding agency.

      (d) The Federal awarding agency shall request transfer of certain records to its custody from recipients when it determines that the records possess long term retention value. However, in order to avoid duplicate recordkeeping, a Federal awarding agency may make arrangements for recipients to retain any records that are continuously needed for joint use.

      (e) The Federal awarding agency, the Inspector General, Comptroller General of the United States, or any of their duly authorized representatives, have the right of timely and unrestricted access to any books, documents, papers, or other records of recipients that are pertinent to the awards, in order to make audits, examinations, excerpts, transcripts and copies of such documents. This right also includes timely and reasonable access to a recipient's personnel for the purpose of interview and discussion related to such documents. The rights of access in this paragraph are not limited to the required retention period, but shall last as long as records are retained.

      (f) Unless required by statute, no Federal awarding agency shall place restrictions on recipients that limit public access to the records of recipients that are pertinent to an award, except when the Federal awarding agency can demonstrate that such records shall be kept confidential and would have been exempted from disclosure pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) if the records had belonged to the Federal awarding agency.

      (g) Indirect cost rate proposals, cost allocations plans, etc. Paragraphs (g)(1) and (g)(2) apply to the following types of documents, and their supporting records: indirect cost rate computations or proposals, cost allocation plans, and any similar accounting computations of the rate at which a particular group of costs is chargeable (such as computer usage chargeback rates or composite fringe benefit rates).

      (1) If submitted for negotiation. If the recipient submits to the Federal awarding agency or the subrecipient submits to the recipient the proposal, plan, or other computation to form the basis for negotiation of the rate, then the 3-year retention period for its supporting records starts on the date of such submission.

      (2) If not submitted for negotiation. If the recipient is not required to submit to the Federal awarding agency or the subrecipient is not required to submit to the recipient the proposal, plan, or other computation for negotiation purposes, then the 3-year retention period for the proposal, plan, or other computation and its supporting records starts at the end of the fiscal year (or other accounting period) covered by the proposal, plan, or other computation.

    Subpart 105-72.70—Post-Award Requirements/Termination and Enforcement

      § 105-72.700   Purpose of termination and enforcement.

#### § § 105-72.700

      Section 105-72.701 and § 105-72.702 set forth uniform suspension, termination and enforcement procedures.

      § 105-72.701   Termination.

#### § § 105-72.701

      (a) Awards may be terminated in whole or in part only if paragraph (a)(1), (2) or (3) of this section apply.

      (1) By the Federal awarding agency, if a recipient materially fails to comply with the terms and conditions of an award.

      (2) By the Federal awarding agency with the consent of the recipient, in which case the two parties shall agree upon the termination conditions, including the effective date and, in the case of partial termination, the portion to be terminated.

      (3) By the recipient upon sending to the Federal awarding agency written notification setting forth the reasons for such termination, the effective date, and, in the case of partial termination, the portion to be terminated. However, if the Federal awarding agency determines in the case of partial termination that the reduced or modified portion of the grant will not accomplish the purposes for which the grant was made, it may terminate the grant in its entirety under either paragraphs (a) (1) or (2).

      (b) If costs are allowed under an award, the responsibilities of the recipient referred to in § 105-72.801(a), including those for property management as applicable, shall be considered in the termination of the award, and provision shall be made for continuing responsibilities of the recipient after termination, as appropriate.

      § 105-72.702   Enforcement.

#### § § 105-72.702

      (a)  If a recipient materially fails to comply with the terms and conditions of an award, whether stated in a Federal statute, regulation, assurance, application, or notice of award, the Federal awarding agency may, in addition to imposing any of the special conditions outlined in § 105-72.204, take one or more of the following actions, as appropriate in the circumstances.

      (1) Temporarily withhold cash payments pending correction of the deficiency by the recipient or more severe enforcement action by the Federal awarding agency.

      (2) Disallow (that is, deny both use of funds and any applicable matching credit for) all or part of the cost of the activity or action not in compliance.

      (3) Wholly or partly suspend or terminate the current award.

      (4) Withhold further awards for the project or program.

      (5) Take other remedies that may be legally available.

      (b)  In taking an enforcement action, the awarding agency shall provide the recipient an opportunity for hearing, appeal, or other administrative proceeding to which the recipient is entitled under any statute or regulation applicable to the action involved.

      (c)  Costs of a recipient resulting from obligations incurred by the recipient during a suspension or after termination of an award are not allowable unless the awarding agency expressly authorizes them in the notice of suspension or termination or subsequently. Other recipient costs during suspension or after termination which are necessary and not reasonably avoidable are allowable if paragraph (c) (1) and (2) of this section apply.

      (1) The costs result from obligations which were properly incurred by the recipient before the effective date of suspension or termination, are not in anticipation of it, and in the case of a termination, are noncancellable.

      (2) The costs would be allowable if the award were not suspended or expired normally at the end of the funding period in which the termination takes effect.

      (d)  The enforcement remedies identified in this section, including suspension and termination, do not preclude a recipient from being subject to debarment and suspension under E.O.s 12549 and 12689 and the Federal awarding agency implementing regulations (see § 105-72.203).

    Subpart 105-72.80—After-the-Award Requirements

#### § § 105-72.801

      (a) Recipients shall submit, within 90 calendar days after the date of completion of the award, all financial, performance, and other reports as required by the terms and conditions of the award. The Federal awarding agency may approve extensions when requested by the recipient.

      (b) Unless the Federal awarding agency authorizes an extension, a recipient shall liquidate all obligations incurred under the award not later than 90 calendar days after the funding period or the date of completion as specified in the terms and conditions of the award or in agency implementing instructions.

      (c) The Federal awarding agency shall make prompt payments to a recipient for allowable reimbursable costs under the award being closed out.

      (d) The recipient shall promptly refund any balances of unobligated cash that the Federal awarding agency has advanced or paid and that is not authorized to be retained by the recipient for use in other projects. OMB Circular A-129 governs unreturned amounts that become delinquent debts.

      (e) When authorized by the terms and conditions of the award, the Federal awarding agency shall make a settlement for any upward or downward adjustments to the Federal share of costs after closeout reports are received.

      (f) The recipient shall account for any real and personal property acquired with Federal funds or received from the Federal Government in accordance with § 105-72.401 through § 105-72.407.

      (g) In the event a final audit has not been performed prior to the closeout of an award, the Federal awarding agency shall retain the right to recover an appropriate amount after fully considering the recommendations on disallowed costs resulting from the final audit.

      § 105-72.802   Subsequent adjustments and continuing responsibilities.

#### § § 105-72.802

      (b) After closeout of an award, a relationship created under an award may be modified or ended in whole or in part with the consent of the Federal awarding agency and the recipient, provided the responsibilities of the recipient referred to in § 105-72.803(a), including those for property management as applicable, are considered and provisions made for continuing responsibilities of the recipient, as appropriate.

      § 105-72.803   Collection of amounts due.

#### § § 105-72.803

      (a) Any funds paid to a recipient in excess of the amount to which the recipient is finally determined to be entitled under the terms and conditions of the award constitute a debt to the Federal Government.

  PART 105-74—GOVERNMENTWIDE REQUIREMENTS FOR DRUG-FREE WORKPLACE (FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE)

### Part 105

**Authority:** Authority: 41 U.S.C. 701

**Source:** Source: 68 FR 66627, 66628, Nov. 26, 2003, unless otherwise noted.

    Subpart A—Purpose and Coverage

      § 105-74.100   What does this part do?

#### § § 105-74.100

      This part carries out the portion of the Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988 (41 U.S.C. 701  as amended) that applies to grants. It also applies the provisions of the Act to cooperative agreements and other financial assistance awards, as a matter of Federal Government policy.

      § 105-74.105   Does this part apply to me?

#### § § 105-74.105

      (a) Portions of this part apply to you if you are either—

      (1) A recipient of an assistance award from the General Services Administration; or

      (2) A(n) GSA awarding official. (See definitions of award and recipient in §§ 105-74.605 and 105-74.660, respectively.)

      (b) The following table shows the subparts that apply to you:

      § 105-74.110   Are any of my Federal assistance awards exempt from this part?

#### § § 105-74.110

      This part does not apply to any award that the Administrator of General Services determines that the application of this part would be inconsistent with the international obligations of the United States or the laws or regulations of a foreign government.

      § 105-74.115   Does this part affect the Federal contracts that I receive?

#### § § 105-74.115

      It will affect future contract awards indirectly if you are debarred or suspended for a violation of the requirements of this part, as described in § 105-74. 510(c). However, this part does not apply directly to procurement contracts. The portion of the Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988 that applies to Federal procurement contracts is carried out through the Federal Acquisition Regulation in chapter 1 of Title 48 of the Code of Federal Regulations (the drug-free workplace coverage currently is in 48 CFR part 23, subpart 23.5).

    Subpart B—Requirements for Recipients Other Than Individuals

      § 105-74.200   What must I do to comply with this part?

#### § § 105-74.200

      There are two general requirements if you are a recipient other than an individual.

      (a) First, you must make a good faith effort, on a continuing basis, to maintain a drug-free workplace. You must agree to do so as a condition for receiving any award covered by this part. The specific measures that you must take in this regard are described in more detail in subsequent sections of this subpart. Briefly, those measures are to—

      (1) Publish a drug-free workplace statement and establish a drug-free awareness program for your employees (see §§ 105-74.205 through 105-74.220); and

      (2) Take actions concerning employees who are convicted of violating drug statutes in the workplace (see § 105-74.225).

      (b) Second, you must identify all known workplaces under your Federal awards (see § 105-74.230).

      § 105-74.205   What must I include in my drug-free workplace statement?

#### § § 105-74.205

      You must publish a statement that—

      (a) Tells your employees that the unlawful manufacture, distribution, dispensing, possession, or use of a controlled substance is prohibited in your workplace;

      (b) Specifies the actions that you will take against employees for violating that prohibition; and

      (c) Lets each employee know that, as a condition of employment under any award, he or she:

      (1) Will abide by the terms of the statement; and

      (2) Must notify you in writing if he or she is convicted for a violation of a criminal drug statute occurring in the workplace and must do so no more than five calendar days after the conviction.

      § 105-74.210   To whom must I distribute my drug-free workplace statement?

#### § § 105-74.210

      You must require that a copy of the statement described in § 105-74.205 be given to each employee who will be engaged in the performance of any Federal award.

      § 105-74.215   What must I include in my drug-free awareness program?

#### § § 105-74.215

      You must establish an ongoing drug-free awareness program to inform employees about—

      (a) The dangers of drug abuse in the workplace;

      (b) Your policy of maintaining a drug-free workplace;

      (c) Any available drug counseling, rehabilitation, and employee assistance programs; and

      (d) The penalties that you may impose upon them for drug abuse violations occurring in the workplace.

      § 105-74.220   By when must I publish my drug-free workplace statement and establish my drug-free awareness program?

#### § § 105-74.220

      If you are a new recipient that does not already have a policy statement as described in § 105-74.205 and an ongoing awareness program as described in § 105-74.215, you must publish the statement and establish the program by the time given in the following table:

      § 105-74.225   What actions must I take concerning employees who are convicted of drug violations in the workplace?

#### § § 105-74.225

      There are two actions you must take if an employee is convicted of a drug violation in the workplace:

      (a) First, you must notify Federal agencies if an employee who is engaged in the performance of an award informs you about a conviction, as required by § 105-74.205(c)(2), or you otherwise learn of the conviction. Your notification to the Federal agencies must—

      (1) Be in writing;

      (2) Include the employee's position title;

      (3) Include the identification number(s) of each affected award;

      (4) Be sent within ten calendar days after you learn of the conviction; and

      (5) Be sent to every Federal agency on whose award the convicted employee was working. It must be sent to every awarding official or his or her official designee, unless the Federal agency has specified a central point for the receipt of the notices.

      (b) Second, within 30 calendar days of learning about an employee's conviction, you must either_

      (1) Take appropriate personnel action against the employee, up to and including termination, consistent with the requirements of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794), as amended; or

      (2) Require the employee to participate satisfactorily in a drug abuse assistance or rehabilitation program approved for these purposes by a Federal, State or local health, law enforcement, or other appropriate agency.

      § 105-74.230   How and when must I identify workplaces?

#### § § 105-74.230

      (a) You must identify all known workplaces under each GSA award. A failure to do so is a violation of your drug-free workplace requirements. You may identify the workplaces_

      (1) To the GSA official that is making the award, either at the time of application or upon award; or

      (2) In documents that you keep on file in your offices during the performance of the award, in which case you must make the information available for inspection upon request by GSA officials or their designated representatives.

      (b) Your workplace identification for an award must include the actual address of buildings (or parts of buildings) or other sites where work under the award takes place. Categorical descriptions may be used (e.g., all vehicles of a mass transit authority or State highway department while in operation, State employees in each local unemployment office, performers in concert halls or radio studios).

      (c) If you identified workplaces to the GSA awarding official at the time of application or award, as described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, and any workplace that you identified changes during the performance of the award, you must inform the GSA awarding official.

    Subpart C—Requirements for Recipients Who Are Individuals

      § 105-74.300   What must I do to comply with this part if I am an individual recipient?

#### § § 105-74.300

      As a condition of receiving a(n) GSA award, if you are an individual recipient, you must agree that—

      (a) You will not engage in the unlawful manufacture, distribution, dispensing, possession, or use of a controlled substance in conducting any activity related to the award; and

      (b) If you are convicted of a criminal drug offense resulting from a violation occurring during the conduct of any award activity, you will report the conviction:

      (1) In writing.

      (2) Within 10 calendar days of the conviction.

      (3) To the GSA awarding official or other designee for each award that you currently have, unless § 105-74.301 or the award document designates a central point for the receipt of the notices. When notice is made to a central point, it must include the identification number(s) of each affected award.

      § 105-74.301   [Reserved]

#### § § 105-74.301

    Subpart D—Responsibilities of GSA Awarding Officials

      § 105-74.400   What are my responsibilities as a(n) GSA awarding official?

#### § § 105-74.400

      As a(n) GSA awarding official, you must obtain each recipient's agreement, as a condition of the award, to comply with the requirements in—

      (a) Subpart B of this part, if the recipient is not an individual; or

      (b) Subpart C of this part, if the recipient is an individual.

    Subpart E—Violations of this Part and Consequences

      § 105-74.500   How are violations of this part determined for recipients other than individuals?

#### § § 105-74.500

      A recipient other than an individual is in violation of the requirements of this part if the Administrator of General Services determines, in writing, that—

      (a) The recipient has violated the requirements of subpart B of this part; or

      (b) The number of convictions of the recipient's employees for violating criminal drug statutes in the workplace is large enough to indicate that the recipient has failed to make a good faith effort to provide a drug-free workplace.

      § 105-74.505   How are violations of this part determined for recipients who are individuals?

#### § § 105-74.505

      § 105-74.510   What actions will the Federal Government take against a recipient determined to have violated this part?

#### § § 105-74.510

      If a recipient is determined to have violated this part, as described in § 105-74.500 or § 105-74.505, the General Services Administration may take one or more of the following actions—

      § 105-74.515   Are there any exceptions to those actions?

#### § § 105-74.515

      The Administrator of General Services may waive with respect to a particular award, in writing, a suspension of payments under an award, suspension or termination of an award, or suspension or debarment of a recipient if the Administrator of General Services determines that such a waiver would be in the public interest. This exception authority cannot be delegated to any other official.

      means an action taken by a Federal agency that immediately prohibits a recipient from participating in Federal Government procurement contracts and covered nonprocurement transactions for a temporary period, pending completion of an investigation and any judicial or administrative proceedings that may ensue. A recipient so prohibited is suspended, in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation for procurement contracts (48 CFR part 9, subpart 9.4) and the common rule, Government-wide Debarment and _Suspension_ (Nonprocurement), that implements Executive Order 12549 and Executive Order 12689.
