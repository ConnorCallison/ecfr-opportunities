#### § § 18.1

      The purpose of this part is to effectuate the provisions of Title VI of the Civil Rights _Act_ of 1964 (hereafter referred to as the ) to the end that no person in the United States shall, on the ground of race, color, or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be otherwise subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance from the Department of Veterans Affairs.

      § 18.2   Application of this part.

#### § § 18.2

      This part applies to any program for which Federal financial assistance is authorized under a law administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs, including the types of Federal financial assistance listed in appendix A to this subpart. It applies to money paid, property transferred, or other Federal financial assistance extended after the effective date of this part pursuant to an application approved prior to such effective date. This part does not apply to (a) any Federal financial assistance by way of insurance or guaranty contracts, (b) money paid, property transferred, or other assistance extended before the effective date of this part, (c) any assistance to any individual who is the ultimate beneficiary, or (d) any employment practice, under any such program, of any employer, employment agency, or labor organization, except to the extent described in § 18.3. The fact that a type of Federal financial assistance is not listed in appendix A to this subpart shall not mean, if Title VI of the Act is otherwise applicable, that a program is not covered. Other types of Federal financial assistance under statutes now in force or hereinafter enacted may be added to appendix A to this subpart by notice published in the

      § 18.3   Discrimination prohibited.

#### § § 18.3

      (a)  No person in the United States shall, on the ground of race, color, or national origin be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be otherwise subjected to discrimination under any program to which this part applies.

      (b)  (1) A recipient to which this part applies may not, directly or through contractual or other arrangements, on grounds of race, color, or national origin:

      (i) Deny an individual any service, financial aid, or other benefit provided under the program;

      (ii) Provide any service, financial aid, or other benefit to an individual which is different, or is provided in a different manner, from that provided to others under the program;

      (iii) Subject an individual to segregation or separate treatment in any matter related to receipt of any service, financial aid, or other benefit under the program;

      (iv) Restrict an individual in any way in the enjoyment of any advantage or privilege enjoyed by others receiving any service, financial aid, or other benefit under the program;

      (v) Treat an individual differently from others in determining whether is satisfied any admission, enrollment, quota, eligibility, membership or other requirement or condition which individuals must meet in order to be provided any service, financial aid, or other benefit provided under the program.

      (vi) Deny a person an opportunity to participate in the program through the provision of services or otherwise or afford an opportunity to do so which is different from that afforded others under the program.

      (vii) Deny a person the opportunity to participate as a member of a planning or advisory body which is an integral part of the program.

      (2) A recipient, in determining the types of services, financial aid, or other benefits, or facilities which will be provided under any such program, or the class of individuals to whom, or the situations in which, such services, financial aid, other benefits, or facilities will be provided under any such program, or the class of individuals to be afforded an opportunity to participate in any such program, may not, directly or through contractual or other arrangements, utilize criteria or methods of administration which have the effect of subjecting individuals to discrimination because of their race, color, or national origin, or have the effect of defeating or substantially impairing accomplishment of the objectives of the program with respect to individuals of a particular race, color, or national origin.

      (3) In determining the site or location of facilities, a recipient or applicant may not make selections with the purpose or effect of excluding individuals from, denying them the benefits of, or subjecting them to discrimination under any program to which this part applies on the grounds of race, color or national origin; or with the purpose or effect of defeating or substantially impairing the accomplishment of the objectives of the Act or this part.

      (4) As used in this section the services, financial aid, or other benefits provided under a program receiving Federal financial assistance shall be deemed to include any service, financial aid, or other benefit provided in or through a facility provided with the aid of Federal financial assistance.

      (5) The enumeration of specific forms of prohibited discrimination in this paragraph does not limit the generality of the prohibition in paragraph (a) of this section.

      (6)(i) In administering a program regarding which the recipient has previously discriminated against persons on the ground of race, color, or national origin, the recipient must take affirmative action to overcome the effects of prior discrimination.

      (ii) Even in the absence of such prior discrimination, a recipient in administering a program may take affirmative action to overcome the effects of conditions which resulted in limiting participation by persons of a particular race, color or national origin.

      (c)  Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this section, a recipient of Federal financial assistance shall not be deemed to have failed to comply with paragraph (a) of this section if immediate provision of a service or other benefit to an individual is necessary to prevent his or her death or serious impairment of his or her health, and such service or other benefit cannot be provided except by or through a medical institution which refuses or fails to comply with paragraph (a) of this section.

      (d)  (1) Whenever a primary objective of the Federal financial assistance to a program to which part 18 applies, is to provide employment, a recipient of such assistance may not (directly or through contractual or other arrangements) subject any individual to discrimination on the ground of race, color, or national origin in its employment practices under such program (including recruitment or recruitment advertising, employment, layoff, or termination, upgrading, demotion, or transfer, rates of pay or other forms of compensation, and use of facilities). The requirements applicable to construction employment under any such program shall be those specified in or pursuant to part III of Executive Order 11246 (3 CFR Chapter IV) or any Executive order which supersedes it.

      (2) In regard to Federal financial assistance which does not have providing employment as a primary objective, the provisions of paragraph (d)(1) of this section apply to the employment practices of the recipient if discrimination on the ground of race, color, or national origin in such employment practices tends, on the grounds of race, color, or national origin, to exclude persons from participation in, to deny them the benefits of or to subject them to discrimination under the program receiving Federal financial assistance. In any such case, the provisions of paragraph (d)(1) of this section shall apply to the extent necessary to assure equality of opportunity to and nondiscriminatory treatment of beneficiaries.

      § 18.4   Assurances required.

#### § § 18.4

      (a)  (1) Every application for Federal financial assistance to which this part applies, except an application to which paragraph (b) of this section applies, and every application for Federal financial assistance to provide a facility shall, as a condition to its approval and the extension of any Federal financial assistance pursuant to the application, contain or be accompanied by an assurance that the program will be conducted or the facility operated in compliance with all requirements imposed by or pursuant to this part. Every award of Federal financial assistance shall require the submission of such an assurance. In the case of an application for Federal financial assistance to provide real property or structures thereon, the assurance shall obligate the recipient, or, in the case of a subsequent transfer, the transferee, for the period during which the real property or structures are used for a purpose for which the Federal financial assistance is extended or for another purpose involving the provision of similar services or benefits. In the case of personal property the assurance shall obligate the recipient for the period during which the recipient retains ownership or possession of the property. In all other cases the assurance shall obligate the recipient for the period during which Federal financial assistance is extended pursuant to the application. The responsible agency official shall specify the form of the foregoing assurances and the extent to which like assurances will be required of subgrantees, contractors and subcontractors, transferees, successors in interest, and other participants. Any such assurance shall include provisions which give the United States a right to seek its judicial enforcement.

      (2) Transfers of surplus property are subject to regulations issued by the Administrator of General Services (41 CFR subpart 101-6.2).

      (b)  Every application by a State or a State agency for continuing Federal financial assistance to which this part applies (including the types of Federal financial assistance listed in appendix A to this subpart) shall as a condition to its approval and the extension of any Federal financial assistance pursuant to the application (1) contain or be accompanied by a statement that the program is (or, in the case of a new program, will be) conducted in compliance with all requirements imposed by or pursuant to this part, and (2) provide or be accompanied by provision for such methods of administration for the program as are found by the responsible agency official to give reasonable assurance that the applicant and all recipients of Federal financial assistance under such program will comply with all requirements imposed by or pursuant to this part. In any case in which the recipient is claiming financial assistance pursuant to arrangements entered into prior to the effective date of this part, the assurances provided by this paragraph shall be included in the first application or claim for assistance on or after the effective date of this part.

      (c)  The requirements of paragraph (a) or (b) of this section with respect to any elementary or secondary school or school system shall be deemed to be satisfied if such school or school system (1) is subject to a final order of a court of the United States for the desegregation of such school or school system, and provides an assurance that it will comply with such order, including any future modification of such order, or (2) submits a plan for the desegregation of such school or school system which the responsible agency official determines is adequate to accomplish the purposes of the Act and this part, at the earliest practicable time, and provides reasonable assurance that it will carry out such plan; in any case of continuing Federal financial assistance the responsible agency official may reserve the right to redetermine, after such period as may be specified by the official, the adequacy of the plan to accomplish the purposes of the Act and this part. In any case in which a final order of a court of the United States for the desegregation of such school or school system is entered after submission of such a plan, such plan shall be revised to conform to such final order, including any future modification of such order.

      (d)  In the case where any assurances are required from an academic, a medical care, or any other institution or facility, insofar as the assurances relate to the institution's practices with respect to the admission, care, or other treatment of persons by the institution or with respect to the opportunity of persons to participate in the receiving or providing of services, treatment, or benefits, such assurances shall be applicable to the entire institution or facility.

      § 18.6   Compliance information.

#### § § 18.6

      (a)  Each responsible agency official shall to the fullest extent practicable seek the cooperation of recipients in obtaining compliance with this part and shall provide assistance and guidance to recipients to help them comply voluntarily with this part.

      (b)  Each recipient shall keep such records and submit to the responsible agency official or designee, timely, complete and accurate compliance reports at such times, and in such form and containing such information, as the responsible agency official or designee may determine to be necessary to enable the official to ascertain whether the recipient has complied or is complying with this part. In the case in which a primary recipient extends Federal financial assistance to any other recipient, such other recipient shall also submit such compliance reports to the primary recipient as may be necessary to enable the primary recipient to carry out its obligations under this part. In general, recipients should have available for the agency racial and ethnic data showing the extent to which members of minority groups are beneficiaries of federally assisted programs.

      (c)  Each recipient shall permit access by the responsible agency official or designee during normal business hours to such of its books, records, accounts, and other sources of information, and its facilities as may be pertinent to ascertain compliance with this part. Where any information required of a recipient is in the exclusive possession of any other agency, institution or person and this agency, institution or person shall fail or refuse to furnish this information, the recipient shall so certify in its report and shall set forth what efforts it has made to obtain the information.

      (d)  Each recipient shall make available to participants, beneficiaries, and other interested persons such information regarding the provisions of this part and its applicability to the program for which the recipient receives Federal financial assistance, and make such information available to them in such manner, as the responsible agency official finds necessary to apprise such persons of the protections against discrimination assured them by the Act and this part.

      § 18.7   Conduct of investigations.

#### § § 18.7

      (a)  The responsible agency official or designee shall from time to time review the practices of recipients to determine whether they are complying with this part.

      (b)  Any person or any specific class of individuals who believe they have been subjected to discrimination prohibited by this part may themselves, or by a representative, file with the responsible agency official or designee a written complaint. A complaint must be filed not later than 180 days from the date of the alleged discrimination unless the time for filing is extended by the responsible agency offical or designee.

      (c)  The responsible agency official or designee will initiate a prompt investigation whenever a compliance review, report, complaint, or any other information indicates a possible failure to comply with this part. The investigation should include, where appropriate, a review of the pertinent practices and policies of the recipient, the circumstances under which the possible noncompliance with this part occurred, and other factors relevant to a determination as to whether the recipient has failed to comply with this part.

      (d)  (1) If an investigation pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section indicates a failure to comply with this part, the responsible agency official or designee will so inform the recipient and the matter will be resolved by informal means whenever possible. If it has been determined that the matter cannot be resolved by informal means, action will be taken as provided for in § 18.8.

      (2) If an investigation does not warrant action pursuant to paragraph (d)(1) of this section the responsible agency official or designee will so inform the recipient and the complainant, if any, in writing.

      (e)  No recipient or other person shall intimidate, threaten, coerce, or discriminate against any individual for the purpose of interfering with any right or privilege secured by section 601 of the Act or this part, or because the individual has made a complaint, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this part. The identity of complainants shall be kept confidential except to the extent necessary to carry out the purposes of this part, including the conduct of any investigation, hearing, or judicial proceeding arising thereunder.

      § 18.8   Procedure for effecting compliance.

#### § § 18.8

      (a)  If there appears to be a failure or threatened failure to comply with this part, and if the noncompliance or threatened noncompliance cannot be corrected by informal means, compliance with this part may be effected by the suspension or termination of or refusal to grant or to continue Federal financial assistance or by any other means authorized by law. Such other means may include, but are not limited to, (1) a reference to the Department of Justice with a recommendation that appropriate proceedings be brought to enforce any rights of the United States under any law of the United States (including other titles of the Act), or any assurance or other contractual undertaking, and (2) any applicable proceeding under State or local law.

      (b)  If an applicant fails or refuses to furnish an assurance required under § 18.4 or otherwise fails or refuses to comply with a requirement imposed by or pursuant to that section Federal financial assistance may be refused in accordance with the procedures of paragraph (c) of this section. The Department of Veterans Affairs shall not be required to provide assistance in such a case during the pendency of the administrative proceedings under such paragraph except that the Department of Veterans Affairs shall continue assistance during the pendency of such proceedings where such assistance is due and payable pursuant to an application therefor approved prior to the effective date of this part.

      (c)  No order suspending, terminating or refusing to grant or continue Federal financial assistance shall become effective until (1) the responsible agency official has advised the applicant or recipient of failure to comply and has determined that compliance cannot be secured by voluntary means, (2) there has been an express finding on the record, after opportunity for hearing, of a failure by the applicant or recipient to comply with a requirement imposed by or pursuant to this part, (3) the action has been approved by the Secretary pursuant to § 18.10(e), and (4) the expiration of 30 days after the Secretary has filed with the committee of the House and the committee of the Senate having legislative jurisdiction over the program involved, a full written report of the circumstances and the grounds for such action. Any action to suspend or terminate or to refuse to grant or to continue Federal financial assistance shall be limited to the particular political entity, or part thereof, or other applicant or recipient as to whom such a finding has been made and shall be limited in its effect to the particular program, or part thereof, in which such noncompliance has been so found.

      (d)  No action to effect compliance with Title VI of the Act by any other means authorized by law shall be taken by the Department of Veterans Affairs until (1) the responsible agency official has determined that compliance cannot be secured by voluntary means, (2) the recipient or other person has been notified of its failure to comply and of the action to be taken to effect compliance, and (3) the expiration of at least 10 days from the mailing of such notice to the recipient or other person. During this period of at least 10 days, additional efforts shall be made to persuade the recipient or other person to comply with this part and to take such corrective action as may be appropriate.

      § 18.9   Hearings.

#### § § 18.9

      (a)  Whenever an opportunity for a hearing is required by § 18.8(c), reasonable notice shall be given by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, to the affected applicant or recipient. This notice shall advise the applicant or recipient of the action proposed to be taken, the specific provision under which the proposed action against it is to be taken, and the matters of fact or law asserted as the basis for this action, and either (1) fix a date not less than 20 days after the date of such notice within which the applicant or recipient may request of the responsible agency official that the matter be scheduled for hearing or (2) advise the applicant or recipient that the matter in question has been set down for hearing at a stated place and time. The time and place so fixed shall be reasonable and shall be subject to change for cause. The complainant, if any, shall be advised of the time and place of the hearing. An applicant or recipient may waive a hearing and submit written information and argument for the record. The failure of an applicant or recipient to request a hearing under this paragraph or to appear at a hearing for which a date has been set shall be deemed to be a waiver of the right to a hearing under section 602 of the Act and § 18.8(c) of this part and consent to the making of a decision on the basis of such information as is available.

      (b)  Hearings shall be held at the offices of the Department of Veterans Affairs in Washington, D.C., at a time fixed by the responsible agency official unless the official determines that the convenience of the applicant or recipient or of the Department of Veterans Affairs requires that another place be selected. Hearings shall be held before the responsible agency official or, at the official's discretion, before an administrative law judge appointed in accordance with section 3105 of Title 5, U.S.C., or detailed under section 3344 of Title 5, U.S.C.

      (c)  In all proceedings under this section, the applicant or recipient and the Department of Veterans Affairs shall have the right to be represented by counsel.

      (d)  (1) The hearing decision and any administrative review thereof shall be conducted in conformity with the procedures contained in 5 U.S.C. 554-557 (sections 5-8 of the Administrative Procedure Act) and in accordance with such rules of procedure as are proper (and not inconsistent with this section) relating to the conduct of the hearing, giving of notices subsequent to those provided for in paragraph (a) of this section, taking of testimony, exhibits, arguments and briefs, requests for findings, and other related matters. Both the Department of Veterans Affairs and the applicant or recipient shall be entitled to introduce all relevant evidence on the issues as stated in the notice for hearing or as determined by the officer conducting the hearing at the outset of or during the hearing.

      (2) Technical rules of evidence shall not apply to hearings conducted pursuant to this part, but rules or principles designed to assure production of the most credible evidence available and to subject testimony to test by cross-examination shall be applied where reasonably necessary by the officer conducting the hearing. The hearing officer may exclude irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious evidence. All documents and other evidence offered or taken for the record shall be open to examination by the parties and opportunity shall be given to refute facts and arguments advanced on either side of the issues. A transcript shall be made of the oral evidence except to the extent the substance thereof is stipulated for the record. All decisions shall be based upon the hearing record and written findings shall be made.

      (e)  In cases in which the same or related facts are asserted to constitute noncompliance with this part with respect to two or more Federal statutes; authorities, or other means by which Federal financial assistance is extended and to which this part applies, or noncompliance with this part and the regulations of one or more other Federal departments or agencies issued under Title VI of the Act, the Secretary may, by agreement with such other departments or agencies where applicable, provide for the conduct of consolidated or joint hearings, and for the application to such hearings of rules of procedures not inconsistent with this part. Final decisions in such cases, insofar as this part is concerned, shall be made in accordance with § 18.10.

      § 18.10   Decisions and notices.

#### § § 18.10

      (a)  If the hearing is held by an administrative law judge such administrative law judge shall either make an initial decision, if so authorized, or certify the entire record including recommended findings and proposed decision to the responsible agency official for a final decision, and a copy of such initial decision or certification shall be mailed to the applicant or recipient. Where the initial decision is made by the administrative law judge the applicant or recipient may within 30 days of the mailing of such notice of initial decision file with the responsible agency official exceptions to the initial decision with reasons therefor. In the absence of exceptions, the responsible agency official may within 45 days after the initial decision serve on the applicant or recipient a notice that the decision will be reviewed. Upon the filing of such exceptions or of such notice of review the responsible agency official shall review the initial decision and issue a decision thereon including the reasons therefor. In the absence of either exceptions or a notice of review the initial decision shall constitute the final decision of the responsible agency official.

      (b)  Whenever a record is certified to the responsible agency official for decision or the official reviews the decision of an administrative law judge pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, or whenever the responsible agency official conducts the hearing, the applicant or recipient shall be given reasonable opportunity to file with the official briefs or other written statements of its contentions, and a written copy of the final decision of the responsible agency official shall be sent to the applicant or recipient and to the complainant, if any.

      (c)  Whenever a hearing is waived pursuant to § 18.9(a) a decision shall be made by the responsible agency official on the record and a written copy of such decision shall be sent to the applicant or recipient, and to the complainant, if any.

      (d)  Each decision of an administrative law judge or responsible agency official shall set forth a ruling on each finding, conclusion, or exception presented, and shall identify the requirements imposed by or pursuant to this part with which it is found that the applicant or recipient has failed to comply.

      (e)  Any final decision by an administrative law judge which provides for the suspension or termination of, or the refusal to grant or continue Federal financial assistance, or the imposition of any other sanction available under this part of the Act, shall promptly be transmitted to the Secretary personally, who may approve such decision, may vacate it, or remit or mitigate any sanction imposed.

      (f)  The final decision may provide for suspension or termination of, or refusal to grant or continue Federal financial assistance, in whole or in part, to which this regulation applies, and may contain such terms, conditions, and other provisions as are consistent with and will effectuate the purposes of the Act and this part, including provisions designed to assure that no Federal financial assistance to which this regulation applies will thereafter be extended to the applicant or recipient determined by such decision to be in default in its performance of an assurance given by it pursuant to this part, or to have otherwise failed to comply with this part, unless and until it corrects its noncompliance and satisfies the responsible agency official that it will fully comply with this part.

      (g)  (1) An applicant or recipient adversely affected by an order issued under paragraph (f) of this section shall be restored to full eligibility to receive Federal financial assistance if it satisfies the terms and conditions of that order for such eligibility or if it brings itself into compliance with this section and provides reasonable assurance that it will fully comply with this part.

      (2) Any applicant or recipient adversely affected by an order entered pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section may at any time request the responsible agency official to restore fully its eligibility to receive Federal financial assistance. Any such request shall be supported by information showing that the applicant or recipient has met the requirements of paragraph (g)(1) of this section. If the responsible agency official determines that those requirements have been satisfied, the official shall restore such eligibility.

      (3) If the responsible agency official denies any such request, the applicant or recipient may submit a request for a hearing in writing, specifying why it believes such official to have been in error. It shall thereupon be given an expeditious hearing, with a decision on the record, in accordance with rules of procedure issued by the responsible agency official. The applicant or recipient will be restored to such eligibility if it proves at such a hearing that it satisfied the requirements of paragraph (g)(1) of this section. While proceedings under this paragraph are pending, the sanctions imposed by the order issued under paragraph (f) of this section shall remain in effect.

      § 18.12   Effect on other regulations, forms and instructions.

#### § § 18.12

      (a)  All regulations, orders, or like directions issued before the effective date of this part by any officer of the Department of Veterans Affairs which impose requirements designed to prohibit any discrimination against individuals on the grounds of race, color or national origin under any program to which this part applies, and which authorize the suspension or termination of or refusal to grant or to continue Federal financial assistance to any applicant for or recipient of such assistance for failure to comply with such requirements, are hereby superseded to the extent that such discrimination is prohibited by this part, except that nothing in this part shall be deemed to relieve any person of any obligation assumed or imposed under any such superseded regulation, order, instruction, or like direction prior to the effective date of this part.

        (3) Despite the existence of separate or different aid, benefits, or services provided in accordance with this part, a recipient may not deny a qualified handicapped person the opportunity to participate in aid, benefits, or services that are not separate or different.

        (4) A recipient may not, directly or through contractual or other arrangements, utilize criteria or methods of administration that:

        (i) Have the effect of subjecting qualified handicapped persons to discrimination on the basis of handicap,

        (ii) Have the purpose or effect of defeating or substantially impairing accomplishment of the objectives of the recipient's program or activity with respect to handicapped persons, or

        (iii) Perpetuate the discrimination of another recipient if both recipients are subject to common administrative control or are agencies of the same State.

        (5) In determining the site or location of a facility, an applicant for assistance or a recipient may not make selections that:

        (3) In all other cases the assurance will obligate the recipient for the period during which Federal financial assistance is extended.

        (c)  An assurance shall apply to the entire institution or facility.

        (d)  (1) Where Federal financial assistance is provided in the form of real property or interest in the property from the Agency, the instrument effecting or recording this transfer shall contain a covenant running with the land to assure nondiscrimination for the period during which the real property is used for a purpose for which the Federal financial assistance is extended or for another purpose involving the provisions of similar services or benefits.

        (2) Where no transfer of property is involved but property is purchased or improved with Federal financial assistance, the recipient shall agree to include the covenant described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section in the instrument effecting or recording any subsequent transfer of property.

        (3) Where Federal financial assistance is provided in the form of real property or interest in the property from the Agency, the covenant shall also include a condition coupled with a right to be reserved by the Agency to revert title to the property if there is a breach of the covenant. If a transferee of real property proposes to mortgage or otherwise encumber the real property as security for financing construction of new, or improvement of existing, facilities on the property for the purpose for which the property was transferred, the Secretary may, upon request of the transferee and if necessary to accomplish such financing and upon such conditions as considered appropriate, agree to forbear the exercise of the right to revert title for as long as the lien of the mortgage or other encumbrance remains effective.

        (e)  (1) Recipients are required to keep such records as the responsible VA official deems necessary for complete and accurate compliance reports. VA can specify intervals for reporting and prescribe the form and content of information required to ascertain whether the recipient has complied or is complying with the law.

        (3) From study of documentation, results of interviews, and observation of activities during tours of facilities, compliance officers will evaluate recipients' compliance status.

        (d) A recipient may not deny any employment opportunity to a qualified handicapped employee or applicant if the basis for denial is the need to make reasonable accommodation to the physical or mental limitations of the employee or applicant.

        § 18.413   Employment criteria.

#### § § 18.413

        (a) A recipient may not use any employment test or other selection criterion that screens out or tends to screen out handicapped persons or any class of handicapped persons unless:

        (1) The test score or other selection criterion, as used by the recipient, is shown to be job-related for the position in question; and

        (2) Alternative job-related tests or criteria that do not screen out or tend to screen out as many handicapped persons are not shown by the Secretary to be available.

        (b) A recipient shall select and administer tests concerning employment to best ensure that when administered to an applicant or employee who has a handicap that impairs sensory, manual, or speaking skills, the test results accurately reflect the applicant's or employee's job skills, aptitude, or whatever other factor the test purports to measure, rather than reflect the applicant's or employee's impaired sensory, manual, or speaking skills (except when those skills are the factors that the test purports to measure).

        § 18.414   Preemployment inquiries.

#### § § 18.414

        (a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, a recipient may not conduct a preemployment medical examination or may not make preemployment inquiry of an applicant as to whether the applicant is a handicapped person or as to the nature or severity of a handicap. A recipient may, however, make preemployment inquiry into the applicant's ability to perform job-related functions.

        (b) When a recipient is taking remedial action to correct the effects of past discrimination pursuant to § 18.406(a), when a recipient is taking voluntary action to overcome the effects of conditions that resulted in limited participation in its federally assisted program or activity pursuant to § 18.406(b), or when a recipient is taking affirmative action pursuant to section 503 of the Act, the recipient may invite applicants for employment to indicate whether and to what extent they are handicapped, provided that:

        (1) The recipient states clearly on any written questionnaire used for this purpose or makes clear orally if no written questionnaire is used that the information requested is intended for use solely in connection with its remedial action obligations or its voluntary or affirmative action efforts; and

        (2) The recipient states clearly that the information is being requested on a voluntary basis, that it will be kept confidential as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, that refusal to provide it will not subject the applicant or employee to any adverse treatment, and that it will be used only in accordance with this part.

        (c) Nothing in this section shall prohibit a recipient from conditioning an offer of employment on the results of a medical examination conducted prior to the employee's entrance on duty, provided that:

        (1) All entering employees are subjected to such an examination regardless of handicap, and (2) the results of such an examination are used only in accordance with the requirements of this part.

        (d) Information obtained in accordance with this section as to the medical condition or history of the applicant shall be collected and maintained on separate forms that shall be accorded confidentiality as medical records, except that:

        (1) Supervisors and managers may be informed regarding restrictions on the work or duties of handicapped persons and regarding necessary accommodations;

        (2) First aid and safety personnel may be informed, where appropriate, if the condition might require emergency treatment;

        (3) Government officials investigating compliance with the Act shall be provided relevant information upon request.

      Accessibility

        § 18.421   Discrimination prohibited.

#### § § 18.421

        No qualified handicapped person shall, because a recipient's facilities are inaccessible to or unusable by handicapped persons, be denied the benefits of, be excluded from participation in, or otherwise be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity to which this part applies.

        § 18.422   Existing facilities.

#### § § 18.422

        (a)  A recipient shall operate each program or activity to which this part applies so that when each part is viewed in its entirety it is readily accessible to handicapped persons. This paragraph does not require a recipient to make each of its existing facilities or every part of a facility accessible to and usable by handicapped persons.

        (b)  A recipient may comply with the requirement of paragraph (a) of this section through such measures as redesign of equipment, reassignment of classes or other services to accessible buildings, assignment of aids to beneficiaries, home visits, delivery of health, or other social services at alternate accessible sites, alteration of existing facilities and construction of new facilities in conformance with § 18.423 or any other methods that make its program or activity accessible to handicapped persons. A recipient is not required to make structural changes in existing facilities where other methods are effective in making its programs or activities readily accessible to handicapped persons. In choosing among available methods for complying with paragraph (a) of this section, a recipient shall give priority to methods that serve handicapped persons in the most integrated setting appropriate.

        (c)  If a recipient with fewer than fifteen employees finds after consultation with a handicapped person seeking its services that there is no method of complying with paragraph (a) of this section other than making a significant alteration in its existing facilities, the recipient may, as an alternative, refer the qualified handicapped person to other providers whose services are accessible. Where referrals are necessary, transportation costs shall not exceed costs to and from recipients' programs or activities.

        (d)  A recipient shall comply with paragraph (a) of this section within 60 days of the effective date of this part except that when structural changes in facilities are necessary, these changes shall be made as soon as practicable, but not later than three years after the effective date of this part.

        (e)  If structural changes to facilities are necessary to meet the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section, a recipient shall develop a transition plan within six months of the effective date of this part setting forth the steps necessary to complete such change. The plan shall be developed with the assistance of interested persons, including handicapped persons or organizations representing handicapped persons. A copy of the transition plan shall be available for public inspection. The plan shall, at a minimum:

        (1) Identify physical obstacles in the recipient's facilities that limit the accessibility of its program or activity to handicapped persons;

        (2) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the facilities accessible;

        (3) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve full accessibility under paragraph (a) of this section and, if the time period of the transition plan is longer than one year, identify steps that will be taken during each year of the transition period; and

        (4) Indicate the person responsible for implementation of the plan.

        (f)  The recipient shall implement procedures to ensure that interested persons, including persons with impaired vision or hearing, can obtain information concerning the existence and location of services, activities, and facilities that are accessible to and usable by handicapped persons.

        § 18.423   New construction.

#### § § 18.423

        (a)  Each facility or part of a facility constructed by, on behalf of, or for the use of a recipient shall be designed and constructed so that the facility or part of the facility is readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons, if the construction was commenced after the effective date of this part.

        (b)  Each facility or part of a facility which is altered by, on behalf of, or for the use of a recipient after the effective date of this part in a manner that affects or could affect the usability of the facility or part of the facility shall, to the maximum extent feasible, be altered so that the altered portion of the facility is readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons.

        (c)  (1) Effective as of January 18, 1991, design, construction, or alteration of buildings in conformance with sections 3-8 of the Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards (USAF) (appendix A to 41 CFR subpart 101-19.6) shall be deemed to comply with the requirements of this section with respect to those buildings. Departures from particular technical and scoping requirements of UFAS by the use of other methods are permitted where substantially equivalent or greater access to and usability of the building is provided.

        (2) For purposes of this section, section 4.1.6(1)(g) of UFAS shall be interpreted to exempt from the requirements of UFAS only mechanical rooms and other spaces that, because of their intended use, will not require accessibility to the public or beneficiaries or result in the employment or residence therein of persons with physical handicaps.

        (3) This section does not require recipients to make building alterations that have little likelihood of being accomplished without removing or altering a load-bearing structural member.

#### § § 18.431

        Sections 18.431 through 18.439 apply to elementary, secondary, and adult education programs or activities that receive Federal financial assistance from the Department of Veterans Affairs and to recipients that operate or receive Federal financial assistance for the operation of such programs or activities.

        § 18.432   Location and notification.

#### § § 18.432

        A recipient that operates a public elementary or secondary educational program shall annually:

        (a) Undertake to identify and locate every qualified handicapped person residing in the recipient's jurisdiction who is not receiving a public education; and

        (b) Take appropriate steps to notify handicapped persons their parents or guardians of the recipients's duty under §§ 18.431 through 18.439.

        § 18.433   Free appropriate public education.

#### § § 18.433

        (a)  A recipient that operates a public elementary or secondary education program shall provide a free appropriate public education to each qualified handicapped person who is in the recipient's jurisdiction, regardless of the nature or severity of the person's handicap.

        (b)  (1) The provision of an appropriate education is the provision of regular or special education and related aids and services that:

        (i) Are designed to meet individual educational needs of handicapped persons as adequately as the needs of nonhandicapped persons are met; and

        (ii) Are based upon adherence to procedures that satisfy the requirements of §§ 18.434, 18.435, and 18.436.

        (2) Implementation of an Individualized Education Program developed in accordance with the Education of the Handicapped Act is one means of meeting the standard established in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section.

        (3) A recipient may place a qualified handicapped person or refer that person for aid, benefits, or services other than those that it operates or provides as its means of carrying out the requirements of §§ 18.431 through 18.439. The recipients remain responsible for ensuring that the requirements of §§ 18.431 through 18.439 are met with respect to any qualified handicapped person so placed or referred.

        (c)  (1) The provision of a free education is the provision of educational and related services without cost to the handicapped person, parents or guardian, except for those fees that are imposed on nonhandicapped persons or their parents or guardian. It may consist either of the provision of free services or, if a recipient places a handicapped person or refers that person for aid, benefits, or services not operated or provided by the recipient as its means of carrying out the requirements of §§ 18.431 through 18.439, of payment for the costs of the aid, benefits, or services. Funds available from any public or private agency may be used to meet the requirements of this subpart. Nothing in this section shall be construed to relieve an insurer or similar third party from an otherwise valid obligation to provide or pay for services provided to a handicapped person.

        (2) If a recipient places a handicapped person or refers that person for aid, benefits, or services not operated or provided by the recipient as its means of carrying out the requirements of this subpart, the recipient shall ensure that adequate transportation to and from the aid, benefits, or services is provided at no greater cost than would be incurred by the person, parents or guardian if the person were placed in the aid, benefits, or services operated by the recipient.

        (3) If placement in a public or private residential program is necessary to provide free appropriate public education to a handicapped person because of his or her handicap, the program, including non-medical care and room and board, shall be provided at no cost to the person, parents or guardian.

        (4) If a recipient has made available, in conformance with this section and § 18.434, a free appropriate public education to a handicapped person and the person's parents or guardian chooses to place the person in a private school, the recipient is not required to pay for the person's education in the private school. Disagreements between a parent or guardian and a recipient regarding whether the recipient has made a free appropriate public education available or regarding the question of financial responsibility are subject to the due process procedures of § 18.436.

        (d)  A recipient may not exclude any qualified handicapped person from a public elementary or secondary education after the effective date of this part. A recipient that is not, on the effective date of this part, in full compliance with the requirements of paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section shall meet those requirements at the earliest practicable time, but not later than October 1, 1981.

> [45 FR 63268, Sept. 24, 1980, as amended at 51 FR 10385, Mar. 26, 1986; 51 FR 12702, Apr. 15, 1986; 68 FR 51370, Aug. 26, 2003]

        § 18.434   Education setting.

#### § § 18.434

        (a)  A recipient shall educate, or shall provide for the education of, each qualified handicapped person in its jurisdiction with persons who are not handicapped to the maximum extent appropriate to the needs of the handicapped person. A recipient shall place a handicapped person in the regular educational environment operated by the recipient unless it is demonstrated by the recipient that the education of the person in the regular environment with the use of supplementary aids and services cannot be achieved satisfactorily. In deciding whether to place a person in a setting other than the regular educational environment, a recipient shall consider the proximity of the alternate setting to the person's home.

        (b)  In providing or arranging for the provision of nonacademic and extracurricular services and activities, a recipient shall ensure that handicapped persons participate with nonhandicapped persons in those activities and services to the maximum extent appropriate to the needs of the handicapped person in question.

        (c)  If a recipient in compliance with paragraph (a) of this section operates a facility that is identifiable as being for handicapped persons, the recipient shall ensure that the facility and the services and activities provided in that facility are comparable to the other facilities, services, and activities of the recipient.

        § 18.435   Evaluation and placement.

#### § § 18.435

        (a)  A recipient that operates a public elementary or secondary education program or activity shall conduct an evaluation of any qualified person who, because of handicap, needs or is believed to need special education or related services before taking any action concerning the initial placement of the person in regular or program special education and any subsequent change in placement.

        (b)  Elementary, secondary, and adult education programs or activities that receive Federal financial assistance shall establish standards and procedures for the evaluation and placement of persons who, because of handicap, need or are believed to need special education or related services which ensure that:

        (1) Tests and other evaluation materials have been validated for the specific purpose for which they are used and are administered by trained personnel in conformance with the instructions provided by their producer;

        (2) Tests and other evaluation materials include those tailored to assess specific areas of educational need and not merely those which are designed to provide a single general intelligence quotient; and

        (3) Tests are selected and administered to best ensure that, when a test is administered to a student with impaired sensory, manual, or speaking skills, the test results accurately reflect the student's aptitude or achievement level or whatever other factor the test purports to measure, rather than reflect the student's impaired sensory, manual, or speaking skills (except where those skills are the factors that the test purports to measure.)

        (c)  In interpreting evaluation data and in making placement decisions, a recipient shall:

        (1) Draw upon information from a variety of sources, including aptitude and achievement tests, teacher recommendations, physical condition, social or cultural background and adaptive behavior;

        (2) Establish procedures to ensure that information obtained from all sources is documented and carefully considered;

        (3) Ensure that the placement decision is made by a group of persons, including persons knowledgeable about the student, the meaning of the evaluation data and the placement options; and

        (4) Ensure that the placement decision is made in accordance with § 18.434.

        (d)  A recipient to which this section applies shall establish procedures, in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, for periodic reevaluation of students who have been provided special education and related services. A reevaluation procedure consistent with the Education for the Handicapped Act is one means of meeting this requirement.

        § 18.436   Procedural safeguards.

#### § § 18.436

        (a) A recipient that operates a public elementary or secondary education program shall implement a system of procedural safeguards with respect to actions regarding the identification, evaluation, or educational placement of persons who, because of handicap, need or are believed to need special instruction or related services. The system shall include:

        (1) Notice;

        (2) An opportunity for the parents or guardian of the person to examine relevant records;

        (3) An impartial hearing with opportunity for participation by the person's parents or guardian and representation by counsel; and

        (4) Review procedure.

        (b) Compliance with the procedural safeguards of section 615 of the Education of the Handicapped Act is one means of meeting this requirement.

        § 18.437   Nonacademic services.

#### § § 18.437

        (a)  (1) Elementary, secondary, and adult education programs that receive Federal financial assistance shall provide nonacademic and extracurricular services and activities in a manner which gives handicapped students an equal opportunity for participation in these services and activities.

        (2) Nonacademic and extracurricular services and activities may include counseling services, physical recreational athletics, transportation, health services, recreational activities, special interest groups or clubs sponsored by the recipient, referrals to agencies which provide assistance to handicapped persons, and employment of students, including both employment by the recipient and assistance in making available outside employment.

        (b)  Elementary, secondary, and adult education programs that receive Federal financial assistance and that provide personal, academic, or vocational counseling, guidance, or placement services to their students shall provide these services without discrimination on the basis of handicap and shall ensure that qualified handicapped students are not counseled toward more restrictive career objectives than are nonhandicapped students with similar interests and abilities.

        (c)  (1) In providing physical education courses and athletics and similar aid, benefits, or services to any of its students, an elementary, secondary, or adult education program or activity that receives Federal financial assistance may not discriminate on the basis of handicap. A recipient that offers physical education courses or that operates or sponsors interscholastic, club, or intramural activities shall provide to qualified handicapped students an equal opportunity for participation.

        (2) A recipient may offer to handicapped students physical education and athletic activities that are separate or different from those offered to nonhandicapped students only if separation or differentiation is consistent with the requirements of § 18.434 and only if no qualified handicapped student is denied the opportunity to compete for teams or to participate in courses that are not separate or different.

        (b) A recipient may not charge more for providing an appropriate education to handicapped persons than to nonhandicapped persons except to the extent that any additional charge is justified by a substantial increase in cost to the recipient.

        (c) A recipient to which this section applies that provides special education shall do so in accordance with §§ 18.435 and 18.436. Each recipient to which this section applies is subject to §§ 18.434, 18.437, and 18.438.

        (b)  In administering its admission policies, a recipient;

        (1) May not apply limitations on the number or proportion of handicapped persons who may be admitted;

        (2) May not use any test or criterion for admission that has a disproportionate, adverse effect on handicapped persons or any class of handicapped persons unless:

        (i) The test or criterion, as used by the recipient, has been validated as a predictor of success in the education program or activity in question; and

        (ii) Alternate tests or criteria that have a less disproportionate, adverse effect are not shown by the Secretary to be available;

        (3) Shall assure itself that:

        (i) Admissions tests are selected and administered to best ensure that, when a test is administered to an applicant who has a handicap that impairs sensory, manual, or speaking skills, the test results accurately reflect the applicant's aptitude or achievement level or whatever other factors the test purports to measure, rather than reflect the applicant's impaired sensory, manual, or speaking skills (except where those skills are the factors that the test purports to measure);

        (ii) Admissions tests that are designed for persons with impaired sensory, manual, or speaking skills are offered as often and in as timely a manner as are other admissions tests; and

        (iii) Admissions tests are administered in facilities that, on the whole, are accessible to handicapped persons; and

        (4) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, may not make preadmission inquiries as to whether an applicant for admission is a handicapped person. After admission, the recipient may inquire on a confidential basis as to handicaps that may require accommodation.

        (c)  When a recipient is taking remedial action to correct the effects of past discrimination under § 18.406(a) or when a recipient is taking voluntary action to overcome the effects of conditions that resulted in limited participation in its federally assisted program or activity under § 18.406(b), the recipient may invite applicants for admission to indicate whether and to what extent they are handicapped.

        (1) The recipient shall state clearly on any written questionnaire used for this purpose or make clear orally if no written questionnaire is used that the information requested is intended for use solely in connection with its remedial action obligations or its voluntary action efforts; and

        (2) The recipient shall state clearly that the information is being requested on a voluntary basis, that it will be kept confidential, that refusal to provide it will not subject the applicant to any adverse treatment, and that it will be used only in accordance with this part.

        (d)  For the purpose of paragraph (b)(2) of this section, a recipient may base prediction equations on first year grades, but shall conduct periodic validity studies against the criterion of overall success in the education program or activity in question to monitor the general validity of the test scores.

        § 18.443   General treatment of students.

#### § § 18.443

        (a) No qualified handicapped student shall, on the basis of handicap, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or otherwise be subjected to discrimination under any academic, research, occupational training, housing, health insurance, counseling, financial aid, physical education, athletics, recreation, transportation, other extracurricular, or other aid, benefits, or services operated by a recipient to which this subpart applies.

        (b) A recipient that considers participation by students in education programs or activities not operated wholly by the recipient as part of, or equivalent to, an education program or activity operated by the recipient shall assure itself that the other education program or activity, as a whole, provides an equal opportunity for the participation of qualified handicapped persons.

        (c) A recipient to which this subpart applies may not, on the basis of handicap, exclude any qualified handicapped student from any course, course of study, or other part of its education program or activity.

        (d) A recipient shall operate its program or activity in the most integrated setting appropriate.

        § 18.444   Academic adjustments.

#### § § 18.444

        (a)  A recipient shall make necessary modifications to its academic requirements to ensure that these requirements do not discriminate or have the effect of discriminating, on the basis of handicap, against a qualified handicapped applicant or student. Modifications may include changes in the length of time permitted for the completion of degree requirements, substitution of specific courses required for the completion of degree requirements, and adaptation of the manner in which specific courses are conducted. Academic requirements that the recipient can demonstrate are essential to the instruction being pursued by the student or to any directly related licensing requirement will not be regarded as discriminatory within the meaning of this section.

        (b)  A recipient may not impose upon handicapped students other rules, such as the prohibition of tape recorders in classrooms or guide dogs in campus buildings, that have the effect of limiting the participation of handicapped students in the recipient's education program or activity.

        (c)  In its course examinations or other procedures for evaluating students' academic achievement, a recipient shall provide methods for evaluating the achievement of students who have a handicap that impairs sensory, manual, or speaking skills that will best ensure that the results of the evaluation represent the students' achievement in the course, rather than reflect the students' impaired sensory, manual, or speaking skills (except where such skills are the factors that the test purports to measure).

        (d)  (1) A recipient shall ensure that no qualified handicapped student is denied the benefits of, excluded from participation in, or otherwise subjected to discrimination because of the absence of educational auxiliary aids for students with impaired sensory, manual, or speaking skills.

        (2) Auxiliary aids may include taped texts, interpreters or other effective methods of making orally delivered materials available to students with hearing impairments, readers in libraries for students with visual impairments, classroom equipment adapted for use by students with manual impairments, and other similar services and actions. Recipients need not provide attendants, individually prescribed devices, readers for personal use or study, or other devices or services of a personal nature.

At the end of the transition period provided for in § 18.422(e), this housing shall be available in sufficient quantity and variety so that the scope of handicapped students' choice of living accommodations is, as a whole, comparable to that of nonhandicapped students.

        (b)  A recipient that assists any agency, organization, or person in making housing available to any of its students shall assure itself that such housing is, as a whole, made available in a manner that does not result in discrimination on the basis of handicap.

        (ii) Assist any entity or person that provides assistance to any of the recipient's students in a manner that discriminates against qualified handicapped persons on the basis of handicap.

        (2) A recipient may administer or assist in the administration of scholarships, fellowships, or other forms of financial assistance established under wills, trusts, bequests, or similar legal instruments that require awards to be made on the basis of factors that discriminate or have the effect of discriminating on the basis of handicap only if the overall effect of the award of scholarships, fellowships, and other forms of financial assistance is not discriminatory on the basis of handicap.

        (b)  A recipient that assists any agency, organization, or person in providing employment opportunities to any of its students shall assure itself that these employment opportunities, as a whole, are made available in a manner that would not violate §§ 18.411 through 18.414 if the opportunities were provided by the recipient.

        § 18.447   Nonacademic services.

#### § § 18.447

        (a)  (1) In providing physical education courses and athletics and similar aid, benefits, or services to any of its students, a recipient may not discriminate on the basis of handicap. A recipient that offers physical education courses or that operates or sponsors intercollegiate, club or intramural athletics shall provide to qualified handicapped students an equal opportunity for participation in these activities.

        (2) A recipient may offer to handicapped students physical education and athletic activities that are separate or different only if separation or differentiation is consistent with the requirements of § 18.443(d) and only if no qualified handicapped student is denied the opportunity to compete for teams or to participate in courses that are not separate or different.

        (b)  A recipient that provides personal, academic, or vocational counseling, guidance, or placement services to its students shall provide these services without discrimination on the basis of handicap. The recipient shall ensure that qualified handicapped students are not counseled toward more restrictive career objectives than are nonhandicapped students with similar interests and abilities. This requirement does not preclude a recipient from providing factual information about licensing and certification requirements that may present obstacles to handicapped persons in their pursuit of particular careers.

        (c)  A recipient that provides significant assistance to fraternities, sororities, or similar organizations shall assure itself that the membership practices of these organizations do not permit discrimination otherwise prohibited by §§ 18.441 through 18.447.

        (b)  A recipient may not, in any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance, directly or through contractual licensing, or other arrangements, use age distinctions or take any other actions which have the effect, on the basis of age, of:

        (1) Excluding individuals from, denying them the benefits of, or subjecting them to discrimination under, a program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance; or

        (2) Denying or limiting individuals in their opportunity to participate in any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.

#### § § 18.513

        A recipient is permitted to take an action, otherwise prohibited by § 18.511, if the action reasonably takes into account age as a factor necessary to the normal operation or the achievement of any statutory objective of a program or activity. An action reasonably takes into account age as a factor necessary to the normal operation or the achievement of any statutory objective of a program or activity, if:

        (a) Age is used as a measure or approximation of one or more other characteristics; and

        (b) The other characteristic(s) must be measured or approximated in order for the normal operation of the program or activity to continue, or to achieve any statutory objective of the program or activity; and

        § 18.515   Burden of proof.

#### § § 18.515

        The burden of proving that an age distinction or other action falls within the exceptions outlined in §§ 18.513 and 18.514 is on the recipient of Federal financial assistance.

#### § § 18.516

        (b) Both the complainant and the recipient shall participate in the mediation process to the extent necessary to reach an agreement or make an informed judgment that an agreement is not possible. However, the recipient and the complainant need not meet with the mediator at the same time.

        (c) If the complainant and the recipient reach an agreement, the mediator shall prepare a written statement of the agreement and have the complainant and the recipient sign it. The mediator shall send a copy of the agreement to VA. VA will take no further action on the complaint unless the complainant or the recipient fails to comply with the agreement.

        (d) The mediator shall protect the confidentiality of all information obtained in the course of the mediation process. No mediator shall testify in any adjunctive proceeding, produce any document, or otherwise disclose any information obtained in the course of the mediation process without prior approval of the head of the mediation agency.

        (3) Prior to the end of that 60-day period, the mediator determines that an agreement cannot be reached.

        (g) The mediator shall return unresolved complaints to VA.

        § 18.544   Investigation.

#### § § 18.544

        (a)  (1) VA will investigate complaints that are reopened because of a violation of a mediation agreement.

        (2) As part of the initial investigation VA will use informal fact finding methods, including joint or separate discussions with the complainant and recipient to establish the facts and, if possible, settle the complaint on terms that are mutually agreeable to the parties. VA may seek the assistance of any involved State agency.

        (3) VA will put any agreement in writing and have it signed by the parties and an authorized official from the VA.

        (4) The settlement shall not affect the operation of any other enforcement effort of VA, including compliance reviews and investigation of other complaints which may involve the recipient.

        (5) A settlement need not contain an admission of discrimination or other wrongdoing by the recipient nor should it be considered a finding of discrimination against the recipient.

        (b)  If VA cannot resolve the complaint through informal investigation, it will begin to develop formal findings through further investigation of the complaint. If the investigation indicates a violation of these regulations, VA will attempt to obtain voluntary compliance. If voluntary compliance cannot be achieved, VA may institute enforcement proceedings as described in § 18.546.

        § 18.545   Prohibition against intimidation or retaliation.

        (a) VA may enforce the Act and these regulations through:

        (1) Termination of Federal financial assistance from VA with respect to a recipient's program or activity that has violated the Act or these regulations. The determination of the recipient's violation may be made only after a recipient has had an opportunity for a hearing on the record before an administrative law judge. Therefore, cases which are settled in mediation, or prior to a hearing, will not involve termination of a recipient's Federal financial assistance from VA.

        (2) Any other means authorized by law including but not limited to:

        (i) Referral to the Department of Justice for proceedings to enforce any rights of the United States or obligations of the recipient created by the Act or these regulations.

        (ii) Use of any requirement of or referral to any Federal, State, or local government agency that will have the effect of correcting a violation of the Act or these regulations.

        (b) VA will limit any termination under paragraph (a)(1) of this section to the particular program or activity or part of such program or activity of a recipient that VA finds to be in violation of the Act or these regulations. VA will not base any part of a termination on a finding with respect to any program or activity of the recipient which does not receive Federal financial assistance from VA.

        (c) VA will take no action under paragraph (a) of this section until:

        (1) The Secretary has advised the recipient of its failure to comply with the Act and these regulations and has determined that voluntary compliance cannot be obtained.

        (2) Thirty days have elapsed after the Secretary has sent a written report of the circumstances and grounds of the action to the committees of the Congress having legislative jurisdiction over the program or activity involved. The Secretary will file a report whenever any action is taken under paragraph (a) of this section.

        (d) VA also may defer granting new Federal financial assistance from VA to a recipient when a hearing under paragraph (a)(1) of this section is initiated.

        (1) New Federal financial assistance from VA includes all assistance for which VA requires an application or approval, including renewal or continuation of existing activities, or authorization of new activities during the deferral period. New Federal financial assistance from VA does not include increases in funding resulting solely from a change in the formula or method of computing awards, nor does it include assistance approved prior to the beginning of a hearing under paragraph (a)(1) of this section.

        (2) VA will not begin a deferral until the recipient has received a notice of an opportunity for a hearing under paragraph (a)(1) of this section. VA will not continue a deferral for more than 60 days unless a hearing has begun within that time or the time for beginning the hearing has been extended by mutual consent of the recipient and the Secretary. VA will not continue a deferral for more than 30 days after the close of the hearing, unless the hearing results in a finding against the recipient.

    Hearing Procedures

      § 18b.50   Statements of position and trial briefs.

#### § § 18b.50

      The presiding officer may require parties and amici curiae to file written statements of position prior to the beginning of a hearing. The presiding officer may also require the parties to submit trial briefs.

      § 18b.51   Evidentiary purpose.

#### § § 18b.51

      (a) The hearing is directed to receiving factual evidence and expert opinion testimony related to the issues in the proceeding. Argument will not be received in evidence; rather it should be presented in statements, memoranda, or briefs, as determined by the presiding officer. Brief opening statements, which shall be limited to statement of the party's position and what the party intends to prove, may be made at hearings.

      (b) Hearings for the reception of evidence will be held only in cases where issues of fact must be resolved in order to determine whether the respondent has failed to comply with one or more applicable requirements of part 18 of this chapter. In any case where it appears from the respondent's answer to the notice of hearing or opportunity for hearing, from failure timely to answer, or from admissions or stipulations in the record, that there are no matters of material fact in dispute, the reviewing authority or presiding officer may enter an order so finding, vacating the hearing date if one has been set, and fixing the time for filing briefs under § 18b.70. Thereafter the proceedings shall go to conclusion in accordance with §§ 18b.70 through 18b.76. The presiding officer may allow an appeal from such order in accordance with § 18b.65.

      § 18b.52   Testimony.

#### § § 18b.52

      Testimony shall be given orally under oath or affirmation by witnesses at the hearing; but the presiding officer, in the officer's discretion, may require or permit that the direct testimony of any witness be prepared in writing and served on all parties in advance of the hearing. Such testimony may be adopted by the witness at the hearing, and filed as part of the record thereof. Unless authorized by the presiding officer, witnesses will not be permitted to read prepared testimony into the record. Except as provided in §§ 18b.54 and 18b.55, witnesses shall be available at the hearing for cross-examination.

> [35 FR 10760, July 2, 1970, as amended at 51 FR 10386, Mar. 26, 1986]

      § 18b.53   Exhibits.

#### § § 18b.53

      Proposed exhibits shall be exchanged at the prehearing conference, or otherwise prior to the hearing if the presiding officer so requires. Proposed exhibits not so exchanged may be denied admission as evidence. The authenticity of all proposed exhibits exchanged prior to hearing will be deemed admitted unless written objection thereto is filed prior to the hearing or unless good cause is shown at the hearing for failure to file such written objection.

      § 18b.54   Affidavits.

#### § § 18b.54

      An affidavit is not inadmissible as such. Unless the presiding officer fixes other time periods affidavits shall be filed and served on the parties not later than 15 days prior to the hearing; and not less than 7 days prior to hearing a party may file and serve written objection to any affidavit on the ground that it is believed necessary to test the truth of assertions therein at hearing. In such event the assertions objected to will not be received in evidence unless the affiant is made available for cross-examination, or the presiding officer determines that cross-examination is not necessary for the full and true disclosure of facts referred to in such assertions. Notwithstanding any objection, however, affidavits may be considered in the case of any respondent who waives a hearing.

      § 18b.55   Depositions.

#### § § 18b.55

      Upon such terms as may be just, for the convenience of the parties or of the Department of Veterans Affairs, the presiding officer may authorize or direct the testimony of any witness to be taken by deposition.

      § 18b.56   Admissions as to facts and documents.

#### § § 18b.56

      Not later than 15 days prior to the scheduled date of the hearing except for good cause shown or prior to such earlier date as the presiding officer may order, any party may serve upon an opposing party a written request for the admission of the genuineness and authenticity of any relevant documents described in and exhibited with the request, or for the admission of the truth of any relevant matters of fact stated in the request. Each of the matters of which an admission is requested shall be deemed admitted, unless within a period designated in the request (not less than 10 days after service thereof, or within such further time as the presiding officer or the reviewing authority if no presiding officer has yet been designated may allow upon motion and notice) the party to whom the request is directed serves upon the requesting party a sworn statement either denying specifically the matters of which an admission is requested or setting forth in detail the reasons why the party cannot truthfully either admit or deny such matters. Copies of requests for admission and answers thereto shall be served on all parties. Any admission made by a party to such request is only for the purposes of the pending proceeding, or any proceeding or action instituted for the enforcement of any order entered therein, and shall not constitute an admission by the party for any other purpose or be used against the party in any other proceeding or action.

#### § § 18b.59

      Letters expressing views or urging action and other unsponsored written material regarding matters in issue in a hearing will be placed in the correspondence section of the docket of the proceeding. These data are not deemed part of the evidence or record in the hearing.

      § 18b.60   Objections.

#### § § 18b.60

      Objections to evidence shall be timely and briefly state the ground relied upon.

      § 18b.61   Exceptions to rulings of presiding officer unnecessary.

#### § § 18b.61

      Exceptions to rulings of the presiding officer are unnecessary. It is sufficient that a party, at the time the ruling of the presiding officer is sought, makes known the action which the party desires the presiding officer to take, or the party's objection to an action taken, and the party's grounds therefor.

> [35 FR 10760, July 2, 1970, as amended at 51 FR 10386, Mar. 26, 1986]

      § 18b.62   Official notice.

#### § § 18b.62

      Where official notice is taken or is to be taken of a material fact not appearing in the evidence of record, any party, on timely request, shall be afforded an opportunity to show the contrary.

      § 18b.63   Public document items.

#### § § 18b.63

      Whenever there is offered (in whole or in part) a public document, such as an official report, decision, opinion, or published scientific or economic statistical data issued by any of the executive departments (or their subdivisions), legislative agencies or committees, or administrative agencies of the Federal Government (including Government-owned corporations), or a similar document issued by a State or its agencies, and such document (or part thereof) has been shown by the offeror to be reasonably available to the public, such document need not be produced or marked for identification, but may be offered for official notice, as a public document item by specifying the document or relevant part thereof.

      § 18b.64   Offer of proof.

#### § § 18b.64

      An offer of proof made in connection with an objection taken to any ruling of the presiding officer rejecting or excluding proffered oral testimony shall consist of a statement of the substance of the evidence which counsel contends would be adduced by such testimony; and, if the excluded evidence consists of evidence in documentary or written form or of reference to documents or records, a copy of such evidence shall be marked for identification and shall accompany the record as the offer of proof.

      § 18b.65   Appeals from ruling of presiding officer.

#### § § 18b.65

      Rulings of the presiding officer may not be appealed to the reviewing authority prior to consideration of the entire proceeding except with the consent of the presiding officer and where the reviewing authority certifies on the record or in writing that the allowance of an interlocutory appeal is clearly necessary to prevent exceptional delay, expense, or prejudice to any party, or substantial detriment to the public interest. If an appeal is allowed, any party may file a brief with the reviewing authority within such period as the presiding officer directs. No oral argument will be heard unless the reviewing authority directs otherwise. At any time prior to submission of the proceeding to the reviewing authority for decision, the reviewing authority may direct the presiding officer to certify any question or the entire record to the reviewing authority for decision. Where the entire record is so certified, the presiding officer shall recommend a decision.

    Posthearing Procedures; Decisions

      § 18b.70   Posthearing briefs; proposed findings and conclusions.

#### § § 18b.70

      (a) The presiding officer shall fix the time for filing posthearing briefs, which may contain proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law, and, if permitted, reply briefs.

      (b) Briefs should include a summary of the evidence relied upon together with references to exhibit numbers and pages of the transcript, with citations of authorities relied upon.

      § 18b.71   Decisions following hearing.

#### § § 18b.71

      When the time for submission of posthearing briefs has expired, the presiding officer shall certify the entire record, including recommended findings and proposed decision, to the reviewing authority; or if so authorized shall make an initial decision.

      § 18b.72   Exceptions to initial or recommended decisions.

#### § § 18b.72

      Within 20 days after the mailing of an initial or recommended decision, any party may file exceptions to the decision, stating reasons therefor, with the reviewing authority. Any other party may file a response thereto within 30 days after the mailing of the decision. Upon the filing of such exceptions, the reviewing authority shall review the decision and issue its own decision thereon.

      § 18b.73   Final decisions.

#### § § 18b.73

      (a) Where the hearing is conducted by a hearing examiner who makes an initial decision, if no exceptions thereto are filed within the 20-day period specified in § 18b.72, such decision shall become the final decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs, and shall constitute “final agency action” within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. 704 (formerly section 10(c) of the Administrative Procedure Act), subject to the provisions of § 18b.75.

      (b) Where the hearing is conducted by an administrative law judge who makes a recommended decision or upon the filing of exceptions to an administrative law judge's initial decision, the reviewing authority shall review the recommended or initial decision and shall issue a decision thereon, which shall become the final decision of VA, and shall constitute “final agency action” within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. 704 (formerly section 10(c) of the Administrative Procedures Act), subject to the provisions of § 18b.75.

      § 18b.74   Oral argument to the reviewing authority.

#### § § 18b.74

      (a) If any party desires to argue a case orally on exceptions or replies to exceptions to an initial or recommended decision, the party shall make such request in writing. The reviewing authority may grant or deny such requests in his or her discretion. If granted, the reviewing authority will serve notice of oral argument on all parties. The notice will set forth the order of presentation, the amount of time allotted, and the time and place for argument. The names of persons who will argue should be filed with the agency hearing clerk not later than 7 days before the date set for oral argument.

      (b) The purpose of oral argument is to emphasize and clarify the written argument in the briefs. Reading at length from the brief or other texts is not favored. Participants should confine their arguments to points of controlling importance and to points upon which exceptions have been filed. Consolidations of appearances at oral argument by parties taking the same side will permit the parties' interests to be presented more effectively in the time allotted.

      (c) Pamphlets, charts, and other written material may be presented at oral argument only if such material is limited to facts already in the record and is served on all parties and filed with the Department hearing clerk at least 7 days before the argument.

The Secretary may grant or deny such request, in whole or in part, or serve notice of intent to review the decision in whole or in part upon motion. If the Secretary grants the requested review, or serves notice of intent to review upon motion, each party to the decision shall have 20 days following notice of the Secretary's proposed action within which to file exceptions to the decision and supporting briefs and memoranda, or briefs and memoranda in support of the decision. Failure of a party to request review under this section shall not be deemed a failure to exhaust administrative remedies for the purpose of obtaining judicial review.

It is improper for any person to solicit communications to any such officer, or decisional staff, other than proper communications by parties or amici curiae.

The reviewing authority, the presiding officer, or any employee or person involved in the decisional process of a proceeding shall communicate ex parte with respect to the merits of that or a factually related proceeding only with persons employed by or assigned to work with them and who perform no investigative or prosecuting function in connection with the proceeding.

      § 19.2   Appellant's election for review of a legacy appeal in the modernized system.

#### § § 19.2

      (a)  As used in this section,  means February 19, 2019.

      (b)  The modernized review system refers to the current statutory framework for claims and appeals processing, set forth in Public Law 115-55, and any amendments thereto, applicable on the effective date.

The election is made by filing, on a form prescribed by the Secretary, an appeal in accordance with 38 CFR 20.202, or a review option in accordance with 38 U.S.C. 5108 or 5104B, as implemented by 38 CFR 3.2500 and other applicable regulations. The election must be filed within the time allowed for filing a substantive appeal under § 19.52(b); or

      (3) VA issued notice of a decision prior to the effective date, and, pursuant to the Secretary's authorization to participate in a test program, the claimant elects the modernized review system by filing an appeal in accordance with 38 U.S.C. 7105, or a review option in accordance with 38 U.S.C. 5108 or 5104B.

    Subpart B—Legacy Appeals and Legacy Appeals Processing by Agency of Original Jurisdiction

      § 19.20   What constitutes an appeal.

#### § § 19.20

      An appeal consists of a timely filed Notice of Disagreement submitted in accordance with the provisions of § 19.21, and either § 19.52(a) or § 20.501(a) of this chapter, as applicable and, after a Statement of the Case has been furnished, a timely filed Substantive Appeal.

> [79 FR 57698, Sept. 25, 2014. Redesignated and amended at 84 FR 177, 178, Jan. 18, 2019]

      § 19.21   Notice of Disagreement.

#### § § 19.21

      (a) Cases in which a form is provided by the agency of original jurisdiction for the purpose of initiating an appeal.

      (1)  For every case in which the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) provides, in connection with its decision, a form for the purpose of initiating an appeal, a Notice of Disagreement consists of a completed and timely submitted copy of that form. VA will not accept as a notice of disagreement an expression of dissatisfaction or disagreement with an adjudicative determination by the agency of original jurisdiction and a desire to contest the result that is submitted in any other format, including on a different VA form.

      (2)  If a claimant has established an online benefits account with VA, or has designated an email address for the purpose of receiving communications from VA, VA may provide an appeal form pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this section electronically, whether by email, hyperlink, or other direction to the appropriate form within the claimant's online benefits account. VA may also provide a form pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this section in paper format.

      (3)  This paragraph (a) applies if there is any indication whatsoever in the claimant's file or electronic account that a form was sent pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this section.

      (4)  If the agency of original jurisdiction gave notice that adjudicative determinations were made on several issues at the same time, the specific determinations with which the claimant disagrees must be identified to the extent a form provided pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this section so requires. If the claimant wishes to appeal all of the issues decided by the agency of original jurisdiction, the form must clearly indicate that intent. Issues not identified on the form will not be considered appealed.

      (5)  The filing of an alternate form or other communication will not extend, toll, or otherwise delay the time limit for filing a Notice of Disagreement, as provided in § 19.52(a). In particular, returning the incorrect VA form, including a form designed to appeal a different benefit does not extend, toll, or otherwise delay the time limit for filing the correct form.

      (b)  A written communication from a claimant or his or her representative expressing dissatisfaction or disagreement with an adjudicative determination by the agency of original jurisdiction and a desire to contest the result will constitute a Notice of Disagreement relating to a claim for benefits in any case in which the agency of original jurisdiction does not provide a form identified as being for the purpose of initiating an appeal. The Notice of Disagreement must be in terms which can be reasonably construed as disagreement with that determination and a desire for appellate review. If the agency of original jurisdiction gave notice that adjudicative determinations were made on several issues at the same time, the specific determinations with which the claimant disagrees must be identified.

      (c)  The provisions of paragraph (b) of this section shall apply to appeals in simultaneously contested claims under Rules 500 and 501 (§§ 20.500 and 20.501 of this chapter), regardless of whether a standardized form was provided with the decision of the agency of original jurisdiction.

> [79 FR 57698, Sept. 25, 2014. Redesignated and amended at 84 FR 177, 178, Jan. 18, 2019]

      § 19.22   Substantive Appeal.

#### § § 19.22

      A Substantive Appeal consists of a properly completed VA Form 9, “Appeal to Board of Veterans' Appeals,” or correspondence containing the necessary information. If the Statement of the Case and any prior Supplemental Statements of the Case addressed several issues, the Substantive Appeal must either indicate that the appeal is being perfected as to all of those issues or must specifically identify the issues appealed. The Substantive Appeal should set out specific arguments relating to errors of fact or law made by the agency of original jurisdiction in reaching the determination, or determinations, being appealed. To the extent feasible, the argument should be related to specific items in the Statement of the Case and any prior Supplemental Statements of the Case. The Board will construe such arguments in a liberal manner for purposes of determining whether they raise issues on appeal, but the Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to allege specific error of fact or law in the determination, or determinations, being appealed. The Board will not presume that an appellant agrees with any statement of fact contained in a Statement of the Case or a Supplemental Statement of the Case which is not specifically contested. Proper completion and filing of a Substantive Appeal are the last actions the appellant needs to take to perfect an appeal.

      § 19.23   Applicability of provisions concerning Notice of Disagreement.

#### § § 19.23

      (a) Appeals governed by § 19.21(a) shall be processed in accordance with § 19.24. Sections 19.26 and 19.28 shall not apply to appeals governed by § 19.21(a).

      (b) Appeals governed by § 19.21(b) shall be processed in accordance with §§ 19.26 and 19.28.

      § 19.24   Action by agency of original jurisdiction on Notice of Disagreement required to be filed on a standardized form.

#### § § 19.24

      (a)  When a timely Notice of Disagreement in accordance with the requirements of § 19.21(a) is filed, the agency of original jurisdiction will reexamine the claim and determine whether additional review or development is warranted.

      (b) —(1)  In cases governed by § 19.21(a), if VA determines a form filed by the claimant is incomplete and requests clarification, the claimant must timely file a completed version of the correct form in order to initiate an appeal. A claimant is not required to cure or correct the filing of an incomplete form by filing a completed version of the correct form unless VA informs the claimant or his or her representative that the form is incomplete and requests clarification.

      (2)  In general, a form will be considered complete if the following information is provided:

      (i) Information to identify the claimant;

      (ii) The claim to which the form pertains;

      (iii) Any information necessary to identify the specific nature of the disagreement if the form so requires. For compensation claims, this criterion will be met if the form enumerates the issues or conditions for which appellate review is sought, or if it provides other information required on the form to identify the claimant and the nature of the disagreement (such as disagreement with disability rating, effective date, or denial of service connection); and

      (iv) The claimant's signature.

      (3)  In general, a claimant who wishes to initiate an appeal must provide a complete form within the timeframe established by § 19.52(a). When VA requests clarification of an incomplete form, the claimant must provide a complete form in response to VA's request for clarification within the later of the following dates:

      (i) 60 days from the date of the request; or

      (ii) 1 year from the date of mailing of the notice of the decision of the agency of original jurisdiction.

      (4)  If the claimant fails to provide a completed form within the timeframe set forth in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the decision of the agency of original jurisdiction will become final.

      (5)  If a completed form is received within the timeframe set forth in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, VA will treat the completed form as the Notice of Disagreement and VA will reexamine the claim and determine whether additional review or development is warranted. If no further review or development is required, or after necessary review or development is completed, VA will prepare a Statement of the Case pursuant to § 19.29 unless the disagreement is resolved by a grant of the benefit(s) sought on appeal or the NOD is withdrawn by the claimant.

      (c)  If a form enumerates some but not all of the issues or conditions which were the subject of the decision of the agency of original jurisdiction, the form will be considered complete with respect to the issues for which appellate review is sought and identified by the claimant. Any issues or conditions not enumerated will not be considered appealed on the basis of the filing of that form and will become final unless the claimant timely files a separate form for those issues or conditions within the applicable timeframe set forth in paragraph (b)(3) of this section.

      (d)  Whether or not a claimant has timely filed a Notice of Disagreement is an appealable issue, but in such a case, appellate consideration shall be limited to the question of whether the correct form was timely filed.

      § 19.25   Notification by agency of original jurisdiction of right to appeal.

#### § § 19.25

      The claimant and his or her representative, if any, will be informed of appellate rights provided by 38 U.S.C. chapters 71 and 72, including the right to a personal hearing and the right to representation. The agency of original jurisdiction will provide this information in each notification of a determination of entitlement or nonentitlement to Department of Veterans Affairs benefits.

      § 19.26   Action by agency of original jurisdiction on Notice of Disagreement.

#### § § 19.26

      (a)  When a timely Notice of Disagreement (NOD) is filed, the agency of original jurisdiction (AOJ) must reexamine the claim and determine whether additional review or development is warranted.

      (b)  If within one year after mailing an adverse decision (or 60 days for simultaneously contested claims), the AOJ receives a written communication expressing dissatisfaction or disagreement with the adverse decision, but the AOJ cannot clearly identify that communication as expressing an intent to appeal, or the AOJ cannot identify which denied claim(s) the claimant wants to appeal, then the AOJ will contact the claimant to request clarification of the claimant's intent. This contact may be either oral or written.

      (1) For oral contacts, VA will contact whoever filed the communication. VA will make a written record of any oral clarification request conveyed to the claimant including the date of the adverse decision involved and the response. In any request for clarification, the AOJ will explain that if a response to this request is not received within the time period described in paragraph (c) of this section, the earlier, unclear communication will not be considered an NOD as to any adverse decision for which clarification was requested.

      (2) For written contacts, VA will mail a letter requesting clarification to the claimant and send a copy to his or her representative and fiduciary, if any.

      (c) —(1)  The claimant must respond to the AOJ's request for clarification within the later of the following dates:

      (i) 60 days after the date of the AOJ's clarification request; or

      (ii) One year after the date of mailing of notice of the adverse decision being appealed (60 days for simultaneously contested claims).

      (2)  If the claimant fails to provide a timely response, the previous communication from the claimant will not be considered an NOD as to any claim for which clarification was requested. The AOJ will not consider the claimant to have appealed the decision(s) on any claim(s) as to which clarification was requested and not received.

      (d)  When clarification of the claimant's intent to file an NOD is obtained, the AOJ will reexamine the claim and determine whether additional review or development is warranted. If no further review or development is required, or after necessary review or development is completed, the AOJ will prepare a Statement of the Case pursuant to § 19.29 unless the disagreement is resolved by a grant of the benefit(s) sought on appeal or the NOD is withdrawn by the claimant.

      (e)  For the purpose of the requirements in paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section, references to the “claimant” include reference to the claimant or his or her representative, if any, or to his or her fiduciary, if any, as appropriate.

      (a)  The Statement of the Case will be forwarded to the appellant at the latest address of record and a separate copy provided to his or her representative (if any).

      (b)  With the Statement of the Case, the appellant and the representative will be furnished information on the right to file, and time limit for filing, a substantive appeal; information on hearing and representation rights; a VA Form 9, “Appeal to Board of Veterans' Appeals”; and a statement describing the available review options if the appellant elects review of the issue or issues on appeal in the modernized review system.

      § 19.31   Supplemental statement of the case.

#### § § 19.31

      (a)  A “Supplemental Statement of the Case,” so identified, is a document prepared by the agency of original jurisdiction to inform the appellant of any material changes in, or additions to, the information included in the Statement of the Case or any prior Supplemental Statement of the Case. The information furnished with the Supplemental Statement of the Case shall include a statement describing the available review options if the appellant elects review of the issue or issues on appeal in the modernized system. In no case will a Supplemental Statement of the Case be used to announce decisions by the agency of original jurisdiction on issues not previously addressed in the Statement of the Case, or to respond to a notice of disagreement on newly appealed issues that were not addressed in the Statement of the Case. The agency of original jurisdiction will respond to notices of disagreement on newly appealed issues not addressed in the Statement of the Case using the procedures in §§ 19.29 and 19.30 of this part (relating to statements of the case).

      (b)  The agency of original jurisdiction will furnish the appellant and his or her representative, if any, a Supplemental Statement of the Case if:

      (1) The agency of original jurisdiction receives additional pertinent evidence after a Statement of the Case or the most recent Supplemental Statement of the Case has been issued and before the appeal is certified to the Board of Veterans' Appeals and the appellate record is transferred to the Board;

      (2) A material defect in the Statement of the Case or a prior Supplemental statement of the Case is discovered; or

      (3) For any other reason the Statement of the Case or a prior Supplemental Statement of the Case is inadequate.

      (c)  The agency of original jurisdiction will issue a Supplemental Statement of the Case if, pursuant to a remand by the Board, it develops the evidence or cures a procedural defect, unless:

      (1) The only purpose of the remand is to assemble records previously considered by the agency of original jurisdiction and properly discussed in a prior Statement of the Case or Supplemental Statement of the Case; or

      (2) The Board specifies in the remand that a Supplemental Statement of the Case is not required.

      (d)  Paragraph (b)(1) of this section does not apply in proceedings before the General Counsel conducted under part 14 of this chapter to cancel accreditation or to review fee agreements and expenses for reasonableness.

#### § § 19.32

      The agency of original jurisdiction may close the appeal without notice to an appellant or his or her representative for failure to respond to a Statement of the Case within the period allowed. However, if a Substantive Appeal is subsequently received within the 1-year appeal period (60-day appeal period for simultaneously contested claims), the appeal will be considered to be reactivated.

      (a)  Evidence received by the agency of original jurisdiction prior to transfer of the records to the Board of Veterans' Appeals after an appeal has been initiated (including evidence received after certification has been completed) will be referred to the appropriate rating or authorization activity for review and disposition. If the Statement of the Case and any prior Supplemental Statements of the Case were prepared before the receipt of the additional evidence, a Supplemental Statement of the Case will be furnished to the appellant and his or her representative as provided in § 19.31 of this part, unless the additional evidence received duplicates evidence previously of record which was discussed in the Statement of the Case or a prior Supplemental Statement of the Case or the additional evidence is not relevant to the issue, or issues, on appeal.

      (b)  Additional evidence received by the agency of original jurisdiction after the records have been transferred to the Board of Veterans' Appeals for appellate consideration will be forwarded to the Board if it has a bearing on the appellate issue or issues. The Board will then determine what action is required with respect to the additional evidence.

#### § § 19.38

      When a case is remanded by the Board of Veterans' Appeals, the agency of original jurisdiction will complete the additional development of the evidence or procedural development required. Following completion of the development, the case will be reviewed to determine whether the additional development, together with the evidence which was previously of record, supports the allowance of all benefits sought on appeal. If so, the appellant and his or her representative, if any, will be promptly informed. If any benefits sought on appeal remain denied following this review, the agency of original jurisdiction will issue a Supplemental Statement of the Case concerning the additional development pertaining to those issues in accordance with the provisions of § 19.31 of this part. Following the 30-day period allowed for a response to the Supplemental Statement of the Case pursuant to § 19.52(c), the case will be returned to the Board for further appellate processing unless the appeal is withdrawn or review of the response to the Supplemental Statement of the Case results in the allowance of all benefits sought on appeal. Remanded cases will not be closed for failure to respond to the Supplemental Statement of the Case.

      (a)  Except in the case of simultaneously contested claims, a claimant, or his or her representative, must file a Notice of Disagreement with a determination by the agency of original jurisdiction within one year from the date that that agency mails notice of the determination to him or her. Otherwise, that determination will become final. The date of mailing the letter of notification of the determination will be presumed to be the same as the date of that letter for purposes of determining whether an appeal has been timely filed.

      (b) —(1)  Except in the case of simultaneously contested claims, a _Substantive Appeal_ must be filed within 60 days from the date that the agency of original jurisdiction mails the Statement of the Case to the appellant, or within the remainder of the 1-year period from the date of mailing of the notification of the determination being appealed, whichever period ends later. The date of mailing of the Statement of the Case will be presumed to be the same as the date of the Statement of the Case and the date of mailing the letter of notification of the determination will be presumed to be the same as the date of that letter for purposes of determining whether an appeal has been timely filed.

      (2)  Except in the case of simultaneously contested claims, if (i) a claimant submits additional evidence within 1 year of the date of mailing of the notification of the determination being appealed, and (ii) that evidence requires, in accordance with § 19.31 of this title, that the claimant be furnished a Supplemental Statement of the Case, then the time to submit a Substantive Appeal shall end not sooner than 60 days after such Supplemental Statement of the Case is mailed to the appellant, even if the 60-day period extends beyond the expiration of the 1-year appeal period.

The date of mailing of the Supplemental Statement of the Case will be presumed to be the same as the date of the Supplemental Statement of the Case for purposes of determining whether a response has been timely filed. Provided a Substantive Appeal has been timely filed in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, the response to a Supplemental Statement of the Case is optional and is not required for the perfection of an appeal.

      § 19.55   Withdrawal of Appeal.

#### § § 19.55

      (a)  Only an appellant, or an appellant's authorized representative, may withdraw an appeal. An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal.

      (b) —(1)  Appeal withdrawals must include the name of the veteran, the name of the claimant or appellant if other than the veteran (e.g., a veteran's survivor, a guardian, or a fiduciary appointed to receive VA benefits on an individual's behalf), the applicable Department of Veterans Affairs file number, and a statement that the appeal is withdrawn. If the appeal involves multiple issues, the withdrawal must specify that the appeal is withdrawn in its entirety, or list the issue(s) withdrawn from the appeal.

      (2)  Appeal withdrawals should be filed with the agency of original jurisdiction until the appellant or representative filing the withdrawal receives notice that the appeal has been transferred to the Board. Thereafter, file the withdrawal at the Board.

      (3)  Until the appeal is transferred to the Board, an appeal withdrawal is effective when received by the agency of original jurisdiction. Thereafter, it is not effective until received by the Board. A withdrawal received by the Board after the Board issues a final decision under Rule 1100(a) (§ 20.1100(a) of this chapter) will not be effective.

      (c)  Withdrawal of an appeal will be deemed a withdrawal of the Notice of Disagreement and, if filed, the Substantive Appeal, as to all issues to which the withdrawal applies. Withdrawal does not preclude filing a new Notice of Disagreement and, after a Statement of the Case is issued, a new Substantive Appeal, as to any issue withdrawn, provided such filings would be timely under these rules if the appeal withdrawn had never been filed.

      § 20.6   Rule 6. Withdrawal of services by a representative.

#### § § 20.6

      (a)(1)  The restrictions on a representative's right to withdraw contained in this paragraph apply only to those cases in which the representative has previously agreed to act as representative in an appeal. In addition to express agreement, orally or in writing, such agreement shall be presumed if the representative makes an appearance in the case by acting on an appellant's behalf before the Board in any way after the appellant has designated the representative as such as provided in § 14.630 or § 14.631 of this chapter. The preceding sentence notwithstanding, an appearance in an appeal solely to notify the Board that a designation of representation has not been accepted will not be presumed to constitute such consent.

      (2)  Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b) of this section, after an appeal to the Board of Veterans' Appeals has been filed, a representative may not withdraw services as representative in the appeal unless good cause is shown on motion. Good cause for such purposes is the extended illness or incapacitation of an agent admitted to practice before the Department of Veterans Affairs, an attorney-at-law, or other individual representative; failure of the appellant to cooperate with proper preparation and presentation of the appeal; or other factors which make the continuation of representation impossible, impractical, or unethical. Such motions must be in writing and must include the name of the veteran, the name of the claimant or appellant if other than the veteran ( a veteran's survivor, a guardian, or a fiduciary appointed to receive VA benefits on an individual's behalf), the applicable Department of Veterans Affairs file number, and the reason why withdrawal should be permitted, and a signed statement certifying that a copy of the motion was sent by first-class mail, postage prepaid, to the appellant, setting forth the address to which the copy was mailed. Such motions should not contain information which would violate privileged communications or which would otherwise be unethical to reveal. Such motions must be filed at the following address: Board of Veterans' Appeals, P.O. Box 27063, Washington, DC 20038. The appellant may file a response to the motion with the Board at the same address not later than 30 days following receipt of the copy of the motion and must include a signed statement certifying that a copy of the response was sent by first-class mail, postage prepaid, to the representative, setting forth the address to which the copy was mailed.

      (b)  A representative may withdraw services as representative in a legacy appeal at any time prior to certification of the appeal to the Board of Veterans' Appeals by the agency of original jurisdiction by complying with the requirements of § 14.631 of this chapter.

      (12) Educational Assistance Test Program (10 U.S.C. chapter 107; 38 CFR 21.5701 ).

      (13) Educational Assistance Pilot Program (10 U.S.C. chapter 107; 38 CFR 21.5290 ).

Medical determinations, such as determinations of the need for and appropriateness of specific types of medical care and treatment for an individual, are not adjudicative matters and are beyond the Board's jurisdiction. Typical examples of these issues are whether a particular drug should be prescribed, whether a specific type of physiotherapy should be ordered, and similar judgmental treatment decisions with which an attending physician may be faced.

      (c)  The Board shall decide all questions pertaining to its jurisdictional authority to review a particular case. When the Board, on its own initiative, raises a question as to a potential jurisdictional defect, all parties to the proceeding and their representative(s), if any, will be given notice of the potential jurisdictional defect(s) and granted a period of 60 days following the date on which such notice is mailed to present written argument and additional evidence relevant to jurisdiction and to request a hearing to present oral argument on the jurisdictional question(s). The date of mailing of the notice will be presumed to be the same as the date stamped on the letter of notification. The Board may dismiss any case over which it determines it does not have jurisdiction.

      (d)(1)  All claimants in legacy appeals, as defined in § 19.2 of this chapter, have the right to appeal a determination made by the agency of original jurisdiction that the Board does not have jurisdictional authority to review a particular case. Jurisdictional questions which a claimant may appeal, include, but are not limited to, questions relating to the timely filing and adequacy of the Notice of Disagreement and the Substantive Appeal.

      (2)  Section 20.904 of this part shall not apply to proceedings to determine the Board's own jurisdiction. However, the Board may remand a case to an agency of original jurisdiction in order to obtain assistance in securing evidence of jurisdictional facts. The time restrictions on requesting a hearing and submitting additional evidence in § 20.1305 of this part do not apply to a hearing requested, or evidence submitted, under paragraph (c) of this section.

      § 20.200   Rule 200. Notification by agency of original jurisdiction of right to appeal.

#### § § 20.200

      The claimant and his or her representative, if any, will be informed of appellate rights provided by 38 U.S.C. chapters 71 and 72, including the right to a personal hearing and the right to representation. The agency of original jurisdiction will provide this information in each notification of a determination of entitlement or nonentitlement to Department of Veterans Affairs benefits, pursuant to 38 U.S.C. 5104, 5104B, and 5108.

      § 20.201   Rule 201. What constitutes an appeal.

#### § § 20.201

      An appeal of a decision by the agency of original jurisdiction consists of a Notice of Disagreement submitted to the Board in accordance with the provisions of §§ 20.202-20.204.

      § 20.202   Rule 202. Notice of Disagreement.

#### § § 20.202

      (a)  A Notice of Disagreement must be properly completed on a form prescribed by the Secretary. If the agency of original jurisdiction decision addressed several issues, the Notice of Disagreement must identify the specific decision and issue or issues therein with which the claimant disagrees. The term issue means an adjudication of a specific entitlement as described in 38 CFR 3.151(c). The Board will construe such arguments in a liberal manner for purposes of determining whether they raise issues on appeal, but the Board may dismiss any appeal which fails to identify the specific decision and issue or issues therein with which the claimant disagrees.

      (b)  Upon filing the Notice of Disagreement, a claimant must indicate whether the claimant requests:

      (1) Direct review by the Board of the record before the agency of original jurisdiction at the time of its decision, without submission of additional evidence or a Board hearing;

      (2) A Board hearing, to include an opportunity to submit additional evidence at the hearing and within 90 days following the hearing; or

      (3) An opportunity to submit additional evidence without a Board hearing with the Notice of Disagreement and within 90 days following receipt of the Notice of Disagreement.

      (c)(1) The information indicated by the claimant in paragraph (b) of this section determines the evidentiary record before the Board as described in subpart D of this part, and the docket on which the appeal will be placed, as described in Rule 800 (§ 20.800). Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (2) of this section, the Board will not consider evidence as described in Rules 302 or 303 (§§ 20.302 and 20.303) unless the claimant requests a Board hearing or an opportunity to submit additional evidence on the Notice of Disagreement.

      (2) A claimant may modify the information identified in the Notice of Disagreement for the purpose of selecting a different evidentiary record option as described in paragraph (b) of this section. Requests to modify a Notice of Disagreement must be made by completing a new Notice of Disagreement on a form prescribed by the Secretary, and must be received at the Board within one year from the date that the agency of original jurisdiction mails notice of the decision on appeal, or within 60 days of the date that the Board receives the Notice of Disagreement, whichever is later. Requests to modify a Notice of Disagreement will not be granted if the appellant has submitted evidence or testimony as described in §§ 20.302 and 20.303.

      (d)  The Board will not accept as a Notice of Disagreement an expression of dissatisfaction or disagreement with an adjudicative determination by the agency of original jurisdiction and a desire to contest the result that is submitted in any format other than the form prescribed by the Secretary, including on a different VA form.

      (e)  The filing of an alternate form or other communication will not extend, toll, or otherwise delay the time limit for filing a Notice of Disagreement, as provided in § 20.203(b). In particular, returning the incorrect VA form does not extend, toll, or otherwise delay the time limit for filing the correct form.

      (f)  If within one year after mailing an adverse decision (or 60 days for simultaneously contested claims), the Board receives a Notice of Disagreement completed on the form prescribed by the Secretary, but the Board cannot identify which denied issue or issues the claimant wants to appeal or which option the claimant intends to select under paragraph (b) of this section, then the Board will contact the claimant to request clarification of the claimant's intent.

      (g) —(1)  The claimant must respond to the Board's request for clarification on or before the later of the following dates:

      (i) 60 days after the date of the Board's clarification request; or

      (ii) One year after the date of mailing of notice of the adverse decision being appealed (60 days for simultaneously contested claims).

      (2)  If the claimant fails to provide a timely response, the previous communication from the claimant will not be considered a Notice of Disagreement as to any claim for which clarification was requested. The Board will not consider the claimant to have appealed the decision(s) on any claim(s) as to which clarification was requested and not received.

      (h)  The unclear Notice of Disagreement is properly completed, and thereby filed, under paragraph (a) of this section when the Board receives the clarification.

      (i)  For the purpose of the requirements in paragraphs (f) through (h) of this section, references to the “claimant” include reference to the claimant or his or her representative, if any, or to his or her fiduciary, if any, as appropriate.

      § 20.203   Rule 203. Place and time of filing of Notice of Disagreement.

#### § § 20.203

      (a)  The Notice of Disagreement must be filed with the Board of Veterans' Appeals, P.O. Box 27063, Washington, DC 20038.

      (b)  Except as provided in § 20.402 for simultaneously contested claims, a claimant, or his or her representative, must file a properly completed Notice of Disagreement with a decision by the agency of original jurisdiction within one year from the date that the agency mails the notice of the decision. The date of mailing the letter of notification of the decision will be presumed to be the same as the date of that letter for purposes of determining whether an appeal has been timely filed.

      (c)  An extension of the period for filing a Notice of Disagreement or a request to modify a Notice of Disagreement may be granted for good cause. A request for such an extension must be in writing and must be filed with the Board. Whether good cause for an extension has been established will be determined by the Board.

      § 20.204   Rule 204. Who can file a Notice of Disagreement.

#### § § 20.204

      (a)  A Notice of Disagreement may be filed by a claimant personally, or by his or her representative if a proper Power of Attorney is on record or accompanies such Notice of Disagreement.

      (b)  If an appeal is not filed by a person listed in paragraph (a) of this section, and the claimant is rated incompetent by the Department of Veterans Affairs or has a physical, mental, or legal disability which prevents the filing of an appeal on his or her own behalf, a Notice of Disagreement may be filed by a fiduciary appointed to manage the claimant's affairs by the Department of Veterans Affairs or a court, or by a person acting as next friend if the appointed fiduciary fails to take needed action or no fiduciary has been appointed.

      (c)  Notwithstanding the fact that a fiduciary may have been appointed for a claimant, an appeal filed by a claimant will be accepted.

      § 20.205   Rule 205. Withdrawal of appeal.

#### § § 20.205

      (a)  Only an appellant, or an appellant's authorized representative, may withdraw an appeal. An appeal may be withdrawn as to any or all issues involved in the appeal.

      (b) —(1)  Appeal withdrawals must include the name of the veteran, the name of the claimant or appellant if other than the veteran ( a veteran's survivor, a guardian, or a fiduciary appointed to receive VA benefits on an individual's behalf), the applicable Department of Veterans Affairs file number, and a statement that the appeal is withdrawn. If the appeal involves multiple issues, the withdrawal must specify that the appeal is withdrawn in its entirety, or list the issue(s) withdrawn from the appeal.

      (2)  Appeal withdrawals should be filed with the Board.

      (3)  An appeal withdrawal is effective when received by the Board. A withdrawal received after the Board issues a final decision under Rule 1100(a) (§ 20.1100(a)) will not be effective.

      (c)  Withdrawal of an appeal will be deemed a withdrawal of the Notice of Disagreement as to all issues to which the withdrawal applies. Withdrawal does not preclude filing a new Notice of Disagreement pursuant to this subpart, a request for higher-level review under 38 U.S.C. 5104B, or a supplemental claim under 38 U.S.C. 5108, as to any issue withdrawn, provided such filing would be timely under these rules if the withdrawn appeal had never been filed.

      (a)  An appellant, or an appellant's representative, may request a hearing before the Board when submitting the substantive appeal (VA Form 9) or anytime thereafter, subject to the restrictions in Rule 1305 (§ 20.1305). Requests for such hearings before a substantive appeal has been filed will be rejected.

      (b)  Following the receipt of a request for a hearing, the Board shall determine, for purposes of scheduling the hearing for the earliest practical date, whether a hearing before the Board will be held at its principal location or at a facility of the Department or other appropriate Federal facility located within the area served by a regional office of the Department. The Board shall also determine whether the hearing will occur by means of an electronic hearing or by the appellant personally appearing before a Board member or panel. An electronic hearing will be in lieu of a hearing held by personally appearing before a Member or panel of Members of the Board and shall be conducted in the same manner as, and considered the equivalent of, such a hearing.

      (c)  The Board will notify the appellant and his or her representative of the method of a hearing before the Board.

      (d)  Upon notification of the method of the hearing requested pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section, an appellant may make one request for a different method of the requested hearing.

      (e)  The Board will notify the appellant and his or her representative of the scheduled time and location for the requested hearing not less than 30 days prior to the hearing date. This time limitation does not apply to hearings which have been rescheduled due to a postponement requested by an appellant, or on his or her behalf, or due to the prior failure of an appellant to appear at a scheduled hearing before the Board with good cause. The right to notice at least 30 days in advance will be deemed to have been waived if an appellant accepts an earlier hearing date due to the cancellation of another previously scheduled hearing.

      (a)  Hearings may be conducted by a Member or Members of the Board during prescheduled visits to Department of Veterans Affairs facilities having adequate physical resources and personnel for the support of such hearings. Subject to paragraph (f) of this section, the hearings will be scheduled for each area served by a regional office in accordance with the place of each case on the Board's docket, established under § 20.902, relative to other cases for which hearings are scheduled to be held within that area.

      (b)  When a hearing at a Department of Veterans Affairs field facility is scheduled, the person requesting it will be notified of its time and place, and of the fact that the Government may not assume any expense incurred by the appellant, the representative, or witnesses attending the hearing.

      (c)  Requests for a change in a hearing date may be made at any time up to two weeks prior to the scheduled date of the hearing if good cause is shown. Such requests must be in writing, must explain why a new hearing date is necessary, and must be filed with the Board. Examples of good cause include, but are not limited to, illness of the appellant and/or representative, difficulty in obtaining necessary records, and unavailability of a necessary witness. If good cause is shown, the hearing will be rescheduled for the next available hearing date after the appellant or his or her representative gives notice that the contingency which gave rise to the request for postponement has been removed. If good cause is not shown, the appellant and his or her representative will be promptly notified and given an opportunity to appear at the hearing as previously scheduled. If the appellant elects not to appear at the prescheduled date, the request for a hearing will be considered to have been withdrawn. In such cases, however, the record will be submitted for review by the Member who would have presided over the hearing. If the presiding Member determines that good cause has been shown, the hearing will be rescheduled for the next available hearing date after the contingency which gave rise to the request for postponement has been removed.

      (d)  If an appellant (or when a hearing only for oral argument by a representative has been authorized, the representative) fails to appear for a scheduled hearing and a request for postponement has not been received and granted, the case will be processed as though the request for a hearing had been withdrawn. No further request for a hearing will be granted in the same appeal unless such failure to appear was with good cause and the cause for the failure to appear arose under such circumstances that a timely request for postponement could not have been submitted prior to the scheduled hearing date. A motion for a new hearing date following a failure to appear for a scheduled hearing must be in writing, must be filed within 15 days of the originally scheduled hearing date, and must explain why the appellant failed to appear for the hearing and why a timely request for a new hearing date could not have been submitted. Such motions must be filed with: Board of Veterans' Appeals, P.O. Box 27063, Washington, DC 20038. Whether good cause for such failure to appear and the impossibility of timely requesting postponement have been established will be determined by the Member who would have presided over the hearing. If good cause and the impossibility of timely requesting postponement are shown, the hearing will be rescheduled for the next available hearing date at the same facility after the appellant or his or her representative gives notice that the contingency which gave rise to the failure to appear has been removed.

      (e)  A request for a hearing may be withdrawn by an appellant at any time before the date of the hearing. A request for a hearing may not be withdrawn by an appellant's representative without the consent of the appellant. Notices of withdrawal must be submitted to the Board.

      (f)  A hearing may be scheduled at a time earlier than would be provided for under paragraph (a) of this section upon written motion of the appellant or the representative. The same grounds for granting relief, motion filing procedures, and designation of authority to rule on the motion specified in Rule 902(c) (§ 20.902(c)) for advancing a case on the Board's docket shall apply.

The presiding Member will determine the period of time during which the record will stay open, considering the amount of time estimated by the appellant or representative as needed to obtain the evidence and other factors adduced during the hearing. Ordinarily, the period will not exceed 60 days, and will be as short as possible in order that appellate consideration of the case not be unnecessarily delayed.

#### § § 20.700

      (a)  A hearing on appeal will be granted if an appellant, or an appellant's representative acting on his or her behalf, expresses a desire to testify before the Board. An appellant is limited to one Board hearing following the filing of a Notice of Disagreement with a decision of the agency of original jurisdiction. Requests for additional Board hearings may be granted for good cause shown.

      (b)  The purpose of a hearing is to receive argument and testimony relevant and material to the appellate issue or issues. It is contemplated that the appellant and witnesses, if any, will be present. A hearing will not normally be scheduled solely for the purpose of receiving argument by a representative. Such argument may be submitted in the form of a written brief. Requests for appearances by representatives alone to personally present argument to Members of the Board may be granted if good cause is shown. Whether good cause has been shown will be determined by the presiding Member assigned to conduct the hearing.

      (c)  Hearings conducted by the Board are ex parte in nature and nonadversarial. Parties to the hearing will be permitted to ask questions, including follow-up questions, of all witnesses but cross-examination will not be permitted. Proceedings will not be limited by legal rules of evidence, but reasonable bounds of relevancy and materiality will be maintained. The presiding Member may set reasonable time limits for the presentation of argument and may exclude documentary evidence, testimony, and/or argument which is not relevant or material to the issue, or issues, being considered or which is unduly repetitious.

      § 20.703   Rule 703. When a hearing before the Board of Veterans' Appeals may be requested; procedure for requesting a change in method of hearing.

#### § § 20.703

      (a)  An appellant, or an appellant's representative, may request a hearing before the Board when submitting the Notice of Disagreement, or when requesting to modify the Notice of Disagreement, as provided in Rule 202 (§ 20.202). Requests for such hearings at any other time will be rejected.

      (b)  Following the receipt of a request for a hearing, the Board shall determine, for purposes of scheduling the hearing for the earliest practical date, whether a hearing before the Board will be held at its principal location or by picture and voice transmission at a facility of the Department located within the area served by a regional office of the Department.

      (c)  The Board will notify the appellant and his or her representative of the method of a hearing before the Board.

      (d)  If an appellant declines to participate in the method of hearing selected by the Board, the appellant's opportunity to participate in a hearing before the Board shall not be affected. Upon notification of the method of the hearing requested pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section, an appellant may make one request for a different method of the requested hearing. If the appellant makes such a request, the Board shall grant the request and notify the appellant of the change in method of the hearing.

      (e)  The Board will notify the appellant and his or her representative of the scheduled time and location for the requested hearing not less than 30 days prior to the hearing date. This time limitation does not apply to hearings which have been rescheduled due to a postponement requested by an appellant, or on his or her behalf, or due to the prior failure of an appellant to appear at a scheduled hearing before the Board of Veterans' Appeals with good cause. The right to notice at least 30 days in advance will be deemed to have been waived if an appellant accepts an earlier hearing date due to the cancellation of another previously scheduled hearing.

      § 20.704   Rule 704. Scheduling and notice of hearings conducted by the Board of Veterans' Appeals.

#### § § 20.704

      (a)(1)  To the extent that officials scheduling hearings for the Board determine that necessary physical resources and qualified personnel are available, hearings will be scheduled at the convenience of appellants and their representatives, with consideration of the travel distance involved. Subject to paragraph (f) of this section, electronic hearings will be scheduled for each area served by a regional office in accordance with the place of each case on the Board's docket, established under Rule 801 (§ 20.801) for appeals and under Rule 902 (§ 20.902) for legacy appeals, relative to other cases for which hearings are scheduled to be held within that area.

      (2)  The procedures for scheduling and providing notice of Board hearings in legacy appeals conducted at a Department of Veterans Affairs facility having adequate physical resources and personnel for the support of such hearings under paragraph (a)(3) of Rule 601 (§ 20.601(a)(3)) are contained in Rule 603 (§ 20.603).

      (b)  When a hearing is scheduled, the person requesting it will be notified of its time and place, and of the fact that the Government may not assume any expense incurred by the appellant, the representative or witnesses attending the hearing.

      (c)  Requests for a change in a hearing date may be made at any time up to two weeks prior to the scheduled date of the hearing if good cause is shown. Such requests must be in writing, must explain why a new hearing date is necessary, and must be filed with the Board. Examples of good cause include, but are not limited to, illness of the appellant and/or representative, difficulty in obtaining necessary records, and unavailability of a necessary witness. If good cause is shown, the hearing will be rescheduled for the next available hearing date after the appellant or his or her representative gives notice that the contingency which gave rise to the request for postponement has been removed. If good cause is not shown, the appellant and his or her representative will be promptly notified and given an opportunity to appear at the hearing as previously scheduled. If the appellant elects not to appear at the prescheduled date, the request for a hearing will be considered to have been withdrawn. In such cases, however, the record will be submitted for review by the Member who would have presided over the hearing. If the presiding Member determines that good cause has been shown, the hearing will be rescheduled for the next available hearing date after the contingency which gave rise to the request for postponement has been removed.

      (d)  If an appellant (or when a hearing only for oral argument by a representative has been authorized, the representative) fails to appear for a scheduled hearing and a request for postponement has not been received and granted, the case will be processed as though the request for a hearing had been withdrawn. No further request for a hearing will be granted in the same appeal unless such failure to appear was with good cause and the cause for the failure to appear arose under such circumstances that a timely request for postponement could not have been submitted prior to the scheduled hearing date. A motion for a new hearing date following a failure to appear for a scheduled hearing must be in writing, must be filed within 15 days of the originally scheduled hearing date, and must explain why the appellant failed to appear for the hearing and why a timely request for a new hearing date could not have been submitted. Such motions must be filed with: Board of Veterans' Appeals, P.O. Box 27063, Washington, DC 20038. Whether good cause for such failure to appear and the impossibility of timely requesting postponement have been established will be determined by the Member who would have presided over the hearing. If good cause and the impossibility of timely requesting postponement are shown, the hearing will be rescheduled for the next available hearing date at the same facility after the appellant or his or her representative gives notice that the contingency which gave rise to the failure to appear has been removed.

      (e)  A request for a hearing may be withdrawn by an appellant at any time before the date of the hearing. A request for a hearing may not be withdrawn by an appellant's representative without the consent of the appellant. Notices of withdrawal must be submitted to the Board.

      (f)  A hearing may be scheduled at a time earlier than would be provided for under paragraph (a) of this section upon written motion of the appellant or the representative. The same grounds for granting relief, motion filing procedures, and designation of authority to rule on the motion specified in Rule 902(c) (§ 20.902(c)) for advancing a case on the Board's docket shall apply.

      § 20.709   Rule 709. Subpoenas.

#### § § 20.709

      (a)  An appellant, or his or her representative, may arrange for the production of any tangible evidence or the voluntary appearance of any witnesses desired. When necessary evidence cannot be obtained in any other reasonable way, the appellant, or his or her representative, may move that a subpoena be issued to compel the attendance of witnesses residing within 100 miles of the place where a hearing on appeal is to be held and/or to compel the production of tangible evidence. A subpoena will not be issued to compel the attendance of Department of Veterans Affairs adjudicatory personnel.

      (b)  The motion for a subpoena must be in writing, must clearly show the name and address of each witness to be subpoenaed, must clearly identify all documentary or other tangible evidence to be produced, and must explain why the attendance of the witness and/or the production of the tangible evidence cannot be obtained without a subpoena.

      (c)  Motions for a subpoena must be filed with the Board of Veterans' Appeals, P.O. Box 27063, Washington, DC 20038.

      (d)  Motions for the issuance of a subpoena for the attendance of a witness, or the production of documents or other tangible evidence, at a hearing on appeal must be filed not later than 30 days prior to the hearing date.

      (e) —(1)  The ruling on the motion will be made by the Member or panel of Members to whom the case is assigned. Where the case has not been assigned, the Chairman, or the Chairman's designee, will assign the case to a Member or panel who will then rule on the motion.

      (2)  If the motion is denied, the Member(s) ruling on the motion will issue an order to that effect which sets forth the reasons for the denial and will send copies to the moving party and his or her representative, if any. Granting the motion will be signified by completion of a VA Form 0714, “Subpoena,” if attendance of a witness is required, and/or VA Form 0713, “Subpoena Duces Tecum,” if production of tangible evidence is required. The completed form shall be signed by the Member ruling on the motion, or, where applicable, by any panel Member on behalf of the panel ruling on the motion, and served in accordance with paragraph (g) of this section.

      (f)  Any person who is required to attend a hearing as a witness shall be allowed and paid the same fees and mileage as are paid witnesses in the district courts of the United States. A subpoena for a witness will not be issued or served unless the party on whose behalf the subpoena is issued submits a check in an amount equal to the fee for one day's attendance and the mileage allowed by law, made payable to the witness, as an attachment to the motion for the subpoena. Except for checks on the business accounts of attorneys-at-law, agents, and recognized service organizations, such checks must be in the form of certified checks or cashiers checks.

      (g)  The Board will serve the subpoena by certified mail, return receipt requested. The check for fees and mileage described in paragraph (f) of this section shall be mailed with the subpoena. The receipt, which must bear the signature of the witness or of the custodian of the tangible evidence, and a copy of the subpoena will be filed in the claims folder, loan guaranty folder, or other applicable Department of Veterans Affairs records folder.

      (h) —(1)  Upon written motion of the party securing the subpoena, or of the person subpoenaed, the Board may quash or modify the subpoena if it is unreasonable and oppressive or for other good cause shown. Relief may include, but is not limited to, requiring the party who secured the subpoena to advance the reasonable cost of producing books, papers, or other tangible evidence. The motion must specify the relief sought and the reasons for requesting relief. Such motions must be filed at the address specified in paragraph (c) of this section within 10 days after mailing of the subpoena or the time specified in the subpoena for compliance, whichever is less. The motion may be accompanied by such supporting evidence as the moving party may choose to submit. It must be accompanied by a declaration showing:

      (i) That a copy of the motion, and any attachments thereto, were mailed to the party who secured the subpoena, or the person subpoenaed, as applicable;

      (ii) The date of mailing; and

      (iii) The address to which the copy was mailed.

      (2)  Not later than 10 days after the date that the motion was mailed to the responding party, that party may file a response to the motion at the address specified in paragraph (c) of this section. The response may be accompanied by such supporting evidence as the responding party may choose to submit. It must be accompanied by a declaration showing:

      (i) That a copy of the response, and any attachments thereto, were mailed to the moving party;

      (ii) The date of mailing; and

      (iii) The address to which the copy was mailed. If the subpoena involves testimony or the production of tangible evidence at a hearing before the Board and less than 30 days remain before the scheduled hearing date at the time the response is received by the Board, the Board may reschedule the hearing to permit disposition of the motion.

      (3)  The Member or panel to whom the case is assigned will issue an order disposing of the motion. Such order shall set forth the reasons for which a motion is either granted or denied. The order will be mailed to all parties to the motion. Where applicable, an order quashing a subpoena will require refund of any sum advanced for fees and mileage.

      (i)  In case of disobedience to a subpoena issued by the Board, the Board will take such steps as may be necessary to invoke the aid of the appropriate district court of the United States in requiring the attendance of the witness and/or the production of the tangible evidence subpoenaed. A failure to obey the order of such a court may be punished by the court as a contempt thereof.

The appellant will be allowed to present opening testimony and argument. Thereafter, any other contesting party who wishes to do so may present testimony and argument. The appellant will then be allowed an opportunity to present testimony and argument in rebuttal. Cross-examination will not be allowed.

      (b)  (1) General. Except as described in paragraphs (b)(2) and (3) of this section, any party to a simultaneously contested claim may request a change in a hearing date in accordance with the provisions of Rule 704, paragraph (c) (§ 20.704(c)).

      (ii) In order to obtain a new hearing date under the provisions of Rule 704, paragraph (c) (§ 20.704(c)), the consent of all other interested parties must be obtained and submitted with the request for a new hearing date. If such consent is not obtained, the date of the hearing will become fixed. After a hearing date has become fixed, an extension of time for appearance at a hearing will be granted only for good cause, with due consideration of the interests of other parties. Examples of good cause include, but are not limited to, illness of the appellant and/or representative, difficulty in obtaining necessary records, and unavailability of a necessary witness. The motion for a new hearing date must be in writing and must explain why a new hearing date is necessary. If good cause is shown, the hearing will be rescheduled for the next available hearing date after the appellant or his or her representative gives notice that the contingency which gave rise to the request for postponement has been removed. Ordinarily, however, hearings will not be postponed more than 30 days. Whether good cause for establishing a new hearing date has been shown will be determined by the presiding Member assigned to conduct the hearing.

      (3) A copy of any motion for a new hearing date required by these rules must be mailed to all other interested parties by certified mail, return receipt requested. The receipts, which must bear the signatures of the other interested parties, and a letter explaining that they relate to the motion for a new hearing date and containing the applicable Department of Veterans Affairs file number must be filed at the same address where the motion was filed as proof of service of the motion. Each interested party will be allowed a period of 10 days from the date that the copy of the motion was received by that party to file written argument in response to the motion.

      (a)  (1) The Board must notify the appellant and his or her representative in writing in the event the Board discovers that a Board hearing has not been recorded in whole or in part due to equipment failure or other cause, or the official transcript of the hearing is lost or destroyed and the recording upon which it was based is no longer available. The notice must provide the appellant with a choice of either of the following options:

      (i) Appear at a new Board hearing, pursuant to Rules 703 and 704 (§§ 20.703 and 20.704) for appeals or Rules 602 and 603 (§§ 20.602 and 20.603) for legacy appeals, as defined in § 19.2 of this chapter; or

      (2) The notice will inform the appellant that he or she has a period of 30 days to respond to the notice. If the appellant does not respond by requesting a new hearing within 30 days from the date of the mailing of the notice, then the Board will decide the appeal on the basis of the evidence of record. A request for a new Board hearing will not be accepted once the Board has issued a decision on the appeal.

      (b)  The Board will not accept a request for a new Board hearing under this section if a Board decision was issued on an appeal prior to the loss of the recording or transcript of a Board hearing, and the Board decision considered testimony provided at that Board hearing.

    Subpart I—Appeals Processing

      § 20.800   Rule 800. Order of consideration of appeals.

#### § § 20.800

      (a)  (1) Applications for review on appeal are docketed in the order in which they are received on the following dockets:

      (i) A docket for appeals in which an appellant does not request a hearing or an opportunity to submit additional evidence on the Notice of Disagreement;

      (ii) A docket for appeals in which the appellant does not request a hearing but does request an opportunity to submit additional evidence on the Notice of Disagreement; and

      (iii) A docket for appeals in which the appellant requests a hearing on the Notice of Disagreement.

      (2) An appeal may be moved from one docket to another only when the Notice of Disagreement has been modified pursuant to Rule 202, paragraph (c)(3) (§ 20.202(c)(3)). The request to modify the Notice of Disagreement must reflect that the appellant requests the option listed in § 20.202(b) that corresponds to the docket to which the appeal will be moved. An appeal that is moved from one docket to another will retain its original docket date.

      (b) Except as otherwise provided, each appeal will be decided in the order in which it is entered on the docket to which it is assigned.

      (c) —(1)  A case may be advanced on the docket to which it is assigned on the motion of the Chairman, the Vice Chairman, a party to the case before the Board, or such party's representative. Such a motion may be granted only if the case involves interpretation of law of general application affecting other claims, if the appellant is seriously ill or is under severe financial hardship, or if other sufficient cause is shown. “Other sufficient cause” shall include, but is not limited to, administrative error resulting in a significant delay in docketing the case, administrative necessity, or the advanced age of the appellant. For purposes of this Rule, “advanced age” is defined as 75 or more years of age. This paragraph does not require the Board to advance a case on the docket in the absence of a motion of a party to the case or the party's representative.

      (2)  Motions for advancement on the docket must be in writing and must identify the specific reason(s) why advancement on the docket is sought, the name of the veteran, the name of the appellant if other than the veteran ( a veteran's survivor, a guardian, a substitute appellant, or a fiduciary appointed to receive VA benefits on an individual's behalf), and the applicable Department of Veterans Affairs file number. The motion must be filed with the Board of Veterans' Appeals, P.O. Box 27063, Washington, DC 20038.

      (3)  If a motion is received prior to the assignment of the case to an individual Member or panel of Members, the ruling on the motion will be by the Vice Chairman, who may delegate such authority to a Deputy Vice Chairman. If a motion to advance a case on the docket is denied, the appellant and his or her representative will be immediately notified. If the motion to advance a case on the docket is granted, that fact will be noted in the Board's decision when rendered.

      (d)  A case remanded by the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims for appropriate action will be treated expeditiously by the Board without regard to its place on the Board's docket.

      (e)  A case will not be returned to the Board following the agency of original jurisdiction's readjudication of an appeal previously remanded by the Board pursuant to Rule 802, paragraph (c) (§ 20.802(c)), unless the claimant files a new Notice of Disagreement. Such cases will be docketed in the order in which the most recent Notice of Disagreement was received.

      (f)  A case returned to the Board following the grant of a substitution request or pursuant to an appeal of a denial of a substitution request assumes the same place on the docket held by the deceased appellant at the time of his or her death. If the deceased appellant's case was advanced on the docket prior to his or her death pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section, the substitute will receive the benefit of the advanced placement.

      (g)  Any other provision of this Rule notwithstanding, a case may be postponed for later consideration and determination if such postponement is necessary to afford the appellant a hearing.

Any findings favorable to the claimant as identified by the agency of original jurisdiction in notification of a decision or in a prior Board decision on an issue on appeal are binding on all agency of original jurisdiction and Board of Veterans' Appeals adjudicators, unless rebutted by evidence that identifies a clear and unmistakable error in the favorable finding. For purposes of this section, findings means conclusions on questions of fact and application of law to facts made by an adjudicator concerning the issue under review.

      (b)  The decision of the Board will be in writing and will set forth specifically the issue or issues under appellate consideration. Except with respect to appeals which are dismissed because an appellant seeking nonmonetary benefits has died while the appeal was pending, the decision will also include:

      (1) Findings of fact and conclusions of law on all material issues of fact and law presented on the record;

      (2) The reasons or bases for those findings and conclusions;

      (3) A general statement reflecting whether any evidence was received at a time when not permitted under subpart D, and informing the appellant that any such evidence was not considered by the Board and of the options available to have that evidence reviewed by the Department of Veterans Affairs; and

      (4) An order granting or denying the benefit or benefits sought on appeal, dismissing the appeal, or remanding the issue or issues as described in Rule 802 (§ 20.802).

      (a)  Unless the issue or issues can be granted in full, the Board shall remand the appeal to the agency of original jurisdiction for correction of an error on the part of the agency of original jurisdiction to satisfy its duties under 38 U.S.C. 5103A, if the error occurred prior to the date of the agency of original jurisdiction decision on appeal. The Board may remand for correction of any other error by the agency of original jurisdiction in satisfying a regulatory or statutory duty, if correction of the error would have a reasonable possibility of aiding in substantiating the appellant's claim. The remand must specify the action to be taken by the agency of original jurisdiction.

      (b)  If the Board determines that an error as described in paragraph (a) of this section may only be corrected by obtaining an advisory medical opinion from a medical expert who is not an employee of the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Board shall remand the case to the agency of original jurisdiction to obtain such an opinion, specifying the questions to be posed to the independent medical expert providing the advisory medical opinion.

      (c)  After correction of any error identified in the Board's remand, the agency of original jurisdiction must readjudicate the claim and provide notice of the decision under 38 U.S.C. 5104, to include notice under 38 U.S.C. 5104C of a claimant's options for further review of the agency of original jurisdiction's decision. The agency of original jurisdiction must provide for the expeditious treatment of any claim that is remanded by the Board.

      § 20.902   Rule 902. Order of consideration of appeals.

#### § § 20.902

      (a)  Applications for review on appeal are docketed in the order in which they are received.

      (1) A case returned to the Board following action pursuant to a remand assumes its original place on the docket.

      (2) A case returned to the Board following the grant of a substitution request or pursuant to an appeal of a denial of a substitution request assumes the same place on the docket held by the deceased appellant at the time of his or her death. Pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section, if the deceased appellant's case was advanced on the docket prior to his or her death, the substitute will receive the benefit of the advanced placement.

      (b)  Except as otherwise provided in this Rule, appeals are considered in the order in which they are entered on the docket.

      (c) —(1)  A case may be advanced on the docket on the motion of the Chairman, the Vice Chairman, a party to the case before the Board, or such party's representative. Such a motion may be granted only if the case involves interpretation of law of general application affecting other claims, if the appellant is seriously ill or is under severe financial hardship, or if other sufficient cause is shown. “Other sufficient cause” shall include, but is not limited to, administrative error resulting in a significant delay in docketing the case, administrative necessity, or the advanced age of the appellant. For purposes of this Rule, “advanced age” is defined as 75 or more years of age. This paragraph does not require the Board to advance a case on the docket in the absence of a motion of a party to the case or the party's representative.

      (2)  Motions for advancement on the docket must be in writing and must identify the specific reason(s) why advancement on the docket is sought, the name of the veteran, the name of the appellant if other than the veteran (e.g., a veteran's survivor, a guardian, a substitute appellant, or a fiduciary appointed to receive VA benefits on an individual's behalf), and the applicable Department of Veterans Affairs file number. The motion must be filed with: Board of Veterans' Appeals, P.O. Box 27063, Washington, DC 20038.

      (3)  If a motion is received prior to the assignment of the case to an individual member or panel of members, the ruling on the motion will be by the Vice Chairman, who may delegate such authority to a Deputy Vice Chairman. If a motion to advance a case on the docket is denied, the appellant and his or her representative will be immediately notified. If the motion to advance a case on the docket is granted, that fact will be noted in the Board's decision when rendered.

      (d)  A case remanded by the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims for additional development or other appropriate action will be treated expeditiously by the Board without regard to its place on the Board's docket.

      (e)  Any other provision of this Rule notwithstanding, a case may be postponed for later consideration and determination if such postponement is necessary to afford the appellant a hearing.

      (b)  The decision of the Board will be in writing and will set forth specifically the issue or issues under appellate consideration. Except with respect to issues remanded to the agency of original jurisdiction for further development of the case and appeals which are dismissed because the issue has been resolved by administrative action or because an appellant seeking nonmonetary benefits has died while the appeal was pending, the decision will also include findings of fact and conclusions of law on all material issues of fact and law presented on the record, the reasons or bases for those findings and conclusions, and an order granting or denying the benefit or benefits sought on appeal or dismissing the appeal.

      (c) A decision by a panel of Members will be by a majority vote of the panel Members.

#### § § 20.904

      (a)  If further evidence, clarification of the evidence, correction of a procedural defect, or any other action is essential for a proper appellate decision, a Veterans Law Judge or panel of Veterans Law Judges shall remand the case to the agency of original jurisdiction, specifying the action to be undertaken.

      (b)  The Board shall refer to the agency of original jurisdiction for appropriate consideration and handling in the first instance all claims reasonably raised by the record that have not been initially adjudicated by the agency of original jurisdiction, except for claims over which the Board has original jurisdiction.

      (c)  In cases before the Board in which a claimant has timely filed a Notice of Disagreement with a determination of the agency of original jurisdiction on a claim, but the record reflects that the agency of original jurisdiction has not subsequently granted the claim in full and has not furnished the claimant with a Statement of the Case, the Board shall remand the claim to the agency of original jurisdiction with instructions to prepare and issue a Statement of the Case in accordance with the provisions of part 19, subpart B of this chapter. A remand for a Statement of the Case is not required if the claimant, consistent with the withdrawal requirements of § 19.55 of this chapter, withdraws the Notice of Disagreement.

      (d)  A remand or referral to the agency of original jurisdiction is not necessary for any of the following purposes:

      (1) Clarifying a procedural matter before the Board, including the appellant's choice of representative before the Board, the issues on appeal, or requests for a hearing before the Board;

      (2) Considering law not already considered by the agency of original jurisdiction, including, but not limited to, statutes, regulations, and court decisions;

      (3) Reviewing additional evidence received by the Board, if, pursuant to Rule 1305 (§ 20.1305(c) of this part), the appellant or the appellant's representative waives the right to initial consideration by the agency of original jurisdiction, or if the Board determines that the benefit or benefits to which the evidence relates may be fully allowed on appeal;

      (4) Requesting an opinion under Rule 906 (§ 20.906 of this part);

      (5) Supplementing the record with a recognized medical treatise; or

      (6) Considering a matter over which the Board has original jurisdiction.

      When a Privacy Act request is filed under § 1.577 of this chapter by an individual seeking records pertaining to him or her and the relevant records are in the custody of the Board, such request will be reviewed and processed prior to appellate action on that individual's appeal.

      § 20.1201   Rule 1201. Amendment of appellate decisions.

#### § § 20.1201

      A request for amendment of an appellate decision under the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a) may be entertained. However, such a request may not be used in lieu of, or to circumvent, the procedures established under Rules 1001 through 1004 (§§ 20.1001-20.1004). The Board will review a request for correction of factual information set forth in a decision. Where the request to amend under the Privacy Act is an attempt to alter a judgment made by the Board and thereby replace the adjudicatory authority and functions of the Board, the request will be denied on the basis that the Act does not authorize a collateral attack upon that which has already been the subject of a decision of the Board. The denial will satisfy the procedural requirements of § 1.579 of this chapter. If otherwise appropriate, the request will be considered one for reconsideration under Rules 1001 through 1004 (§§ 20.1001-20.1004).

      § 20.1301   Rule 1301. Disclosure of information.

#### § § 20.1301

      (a)  It is the policy of the Board for the full text of appellate decisions to be disclosed to appellants. In those situations where disclosing certain information directly to the appellant would not be in conformance with 38 U.S.C. 5701, that information will be removed from the decision and the remaining text will be furnished to the appellant. A full-text appellate decision will be disclosed to the designated representative, however, unless the relationship between the appellant and representative is such (for example, a parent or spouse) that disclosure to the representative would be as harmful as if made to the appellant.

      (b)  For legacy appeals as defined in § 19.2 of this chapter, the policy described in paragraph (a) of this section is also applicable to Statements of the Case and supplemental Statements of the Case.

      (c) —(1)  Decisions rendered by the Board of Veterans' Appeals on or after January 1, 1992, are electronically available for public inspection and copying on the Board's website. All personal identifiers are redacted from the decisions prior to publication. Specific decisions may be identified by a word and/or topic search, or by the Board docket number. Board decisions will continue to be provided in a widely-used format as future advances in technology occur.

      (2)  Decisions rendered by the Board of Veterans' Appeals prior to January 1, 1992, have been indexed to facilitate access to the contents of the decisions (BVA Index I-01-1). The index, which was published quarterly in microfiche form with an annual cumulation, is available for review at Department of Veterans Affairs regional offices and at the Board of Veterans' Appeals in Washington, DC. Information on obtaining a microfiche copy of the index is also available from the Board. The index can be used to locate citations to decisions with issues similar to those of concern to an appellant. Each indexed decision has a locator number assigned to it. The manner in which the locator number is written depends upon the age of the decision. Decisions archived prior to late 1989 have a number such as  Decisions archived at a later date have a number such as  This number must be used when requesting a copy of that decision. These requests must be directed to the Board of Veterans' Appeals, P.O. Box 27063, Washington, DC 20038.

      § 20.1302   Rule 1302. Death of appellant during pendency of appeal before the Board.

#### § § 20.1302

      (a)  An appeal pending before the Board of Veterans' Appeals when the appellant dies will be dismissed without prejudice. A person eligible for substitution under § 3.1010 of this chapter may file with the agency of original jurisdiction a request to substitute for the deceased appellant. If the agency of original jurisdiction grants the request to substitute, the case will assume its original place on the docket pursuant to Rule 800, paragraph (f) (§ 20.800(f)) or, for legacy appeals, Rule 902, paragraph (a)(2) (§ 20.902(a)(2)). If the agency of original jurisdiction denies the request to substitute and the person requesting to substitute appeals that decision to the Board, the appeal regarding eligibility to substitute will assume the same place on the docket as the original claim pursuant to Rule 800, paragraph (f) (§ 20.800(f)) or, for legacy appeals, Rule 902, paragraph (a)(2) (§ 20.902(a)(2)).

      (b)  (1) If a hearing request is pending pursuant to Rule 704 (§ 20.704) when the appellant dies, the agency of original jurisdiction may take action on a request to substitute without regard to whether the pending appeal has been dismissed by the Board, if the request is submitted in accordance with § 3.1010 of this chapter.

      (2) If the agency of original jurisdiction grants the request to substitute, the Board of Veterans' Appeals can then take the testimony of the substitute at a hearing held pursuant to Rules 700 through 717 (§§ 20.700 through 20.717). If the substitute desires representation at the hearing, he or she must appoint a representative prior to the hearing pursuant to § 14.631(g) of this chapter.

#### § § 20.1303

      Although the Board strives for consistency in issuing its decisions, previously issued Board decisions will be considered binding only with regard to the specific case decided. Prior decisions in other appeals may be considered in a case to the extent that they reasonably relate to the case, but each case presented to the Board will be decided on the basis of the individual facts of the case in light of applicable procedure and substantive law.

      § 20.1304   Rule 1304. Request for a change in representation.

#### § § 20.1304

      (a)  An appellant and his or her representative, if any, will be granted a period of 90 days following receipt of a Notice of Disagreement, or up to and including the date the appellate decision is promulgated by the Board, whichever comes first, during which they may submit a request for a change in representation.

      (b)  Following the expiration of the period described in paragraph (a) of this section, the Board will not accept a request for a change in representation except when the appellant demonstrates on motion that there was good cause for the delay. Examples of good cause include, but are not limited to, illness of the appellant or the representative which precluded action during the period; death of an individual representative; illness or incapacity of an individual representative which renders it impractical for an appellant to continue with him or her as representative; and withdrawal of an individual representative. Such motions must be in writing and must include the name of the veteran; the name of the claimant or appellant if other than the veteran ( a veteran's survivor, a guardian, or a fiduciary appointed to receive VA benefits on an individual's behalf) or the name of any substitute claimant or appellant; the applicable Department of Veterans Affairs file number; and an explanation of why the request for a change in representation could not be accomplished in a timely manner. Such motions must be filed at the following address: Board of Veterans' Appeals, P.O. Box 27063, Washington, DC 20038. Depending upon the ruling on the motion, action will be taken as follows:

      (1)  If good cause is not shown, the request for a change in representation will be referred to the agency of original jurisdiction for association with the appellant's file for any pending or subsequently received claims upon completion of the Board's action on the pending appeal without action by the Board concerning the request.

      (2)  If good cause is shown, the request for a change in representation will be honored.

      § 20.1305   Rule 1305. Procedures for legacy appellants to request a change in representation, personal hearing, or submission of additional evidence following certification of an appeal to the Board of Veterans' Appeals.

#### § § 20.1305

      (a)  An appellant in a legacy appeal, as defined in § 19.2 of this chapter, and his or her representative, if any, will be granted a period of 90 days following the mailing of notice to them that an appeal has been certified to the Board for appellate review and that the appellate record has been transferred to the Board, or up to and including the date the appellate decision is promulgated by the Board, whichever comes first, during which they may submit a request for a personal hearing, additional evidence, or a request for a change in representation. Any such request or additional evidence should be submitted directly to the Board and not to the agency of original jurisdiction. If any such request or additional evidence is submitted to the agency of original jurisdiction instead of to the Board, the agency of original jurisdiction must forward it to the Board in accordance with § 19.37(b) of this chapter. The date of mailing of the letter of notification will be presumed to be the same as the date of that letter for purposes of determining whether the request was timely made or the evidence was timely submitted. Any evidence which is submitted at a hearing on appeal which was requested during such period will be considered to have been received during such period, even though the hearing may be held following the expiration of the period. Any pertinent evidence submitted by the appellant or representative is subject to the requirements of paragraph (d) of this section if a simultaneously contested claim is involved.

      (b) —(1)  Subject to the exception in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, following the expiration of the period described in paragraph (a) of this section, the Board of Veterans' Appeals will not accept a request for a change in representation, a request for a personal hearing, or additional evidence except when the appellant demonstrates on motion that there was good cause for the delay. Examples of good cause include, but are not limited to, illness of the appellant or the representative which precluded action during the period; death of an individual representative; illness or incapacity of an individual representative which renders it impractical for an appellant to continue with him or her as representative; withdrawal of an individual representative; the discovery of evidence that was not available prior to the expiration of the period; and delay in transfer of the appellate record to the Board which precluded timely action with respect to these matters. Such motions must be in writing and must include the name of the veteran; the name of the claimant or appellant if other than the veteran (e.g., a veteran's survivor, a guardian, or a fiduciary appointed to receive VA benefits on an individual's behalf) or the name of any substitute claimant or appellant; the applicable Department of Veterans Affairs file number; and an explanation of why the request for a change in representation, the request for a personal hearing, or the submission of additional evidence could not be accomplished in a timely manner. Such motions must be filed at the following address: Board of Veterans' Appeals, P.O. Box 27063, Washington, DC 20038. Depending upon the ruling on the motion, action will be taken as follows:

      (i)  If good cause is not shown, the request for a change in representation, the request for a personal hearing, or the additional evidence submitted will be referred to the agency of original jurisdiction upon completion of the Board's action on the pending appeal without action by the Board concerning the request or additional evidence. Any personal hearing granted as a result of a request so referred or any additional evidence so referred may be treated by that agency as the basis for a reopened claim, if appropriate. If the Board denied a benefit sought in the pending appeal and any evidence so referred which was received prior to the date of the Board's decision, or testimony presented at a hearing resulting from a request for a hearing so referred, together with the evidence already of record, is subsequently found to be the basis of an allowance of that benefit, the effective date of the award will be the same as if the benefit had been granted by the Board as a result of the appeal which was pending at the time that the hearing request or additional evidence was received.

      (ii)  If good cause is shown, the request for a change in representation or for a personal hearing will be honored. Any pertinent evidence submitted by the appellant or representative will be accepted, subject to the requirements of paragraph (d) of this section if a simultaneously contested claim is involved.

      (2)  The motion described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section is not required to submit evidence in response to a notice described in § 20.908.

      (c)  Any pertinent evidence submitted by the appellant or representative which is accepted by the Board under the provisions of this section, or is submitted by the appellant or representative in response to a § 20.908 of this part, notification, as well as any such evidence referred to the Board by the agency of original jurisdiction under § 19.37(b) of this chapter, must be referred to the agency of original jurisdiction for review, unless this procedural right is waived by the appellant or representative, or unless the Board determines that the benefit or benefits to which the evidence relates may be fully allowed on appeal without such referral. Such a waiver must be in writing or, if a hearing on appeal is conducted, the waiver must be formally and clearly entered on the record orally at the time of the hearing. Evidence is not pertinent if it does not relate to or have a bearing on the appellate issue or issues.

      (d)  In simultaneously contested claims, if pertinent evidence which directly affects payment, or potential payment, of the benefit sought is submitted by any claimant and is accepted by the Board under the provisions of this section, the substance of such evidence will be mailed to each of the other claimants who will then have 60 days from the date of mailing of notice of the new evidence within which to comment upon it and/or submit additional evidence in rebuttal. For matters over which the Board does not have original jurisdiction, a waiver of initial agency of original jurisdiction consideration of pertinent additional evidence received by the Board must be obtained from each claimant in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section. The date of mailing of the letter of notification of the new evidence will be presumed to be the same as the date of that letter for purposes of determining whether such comment or evidence in rebuttal was timely submitted. No further period will be provided for response to such comment or rebuttal evidence.

      (e)  The provisions of paragraphs (a), (b), and (d) of this section allowing appellants to submit additional evidence do not apply in proceedings before the General Counsel conducted under part 14 of this chapter to cancel accreditation or to review fee agreements and expenses for reasonableness.

      § 20.1400   Rule 1400. Motions to revise Board decisions.

#### § § 20.1400

      (a) Review to determine whether clear and unmistakable error exists in a final Board decision may be initiated by the Board, on its own motion, or by a party to that decision (as the term “party” is defined in Rule 1401(b) (§ 20.1401(b) of this part) in accordance with Rule 1404 (§ 20.1404 of this part).

      (b) All final Board decisions are subject to revision under this subpart except:

      (1) Decisions on issues which have been appealed to and decided by a court of competent jurisdiction; and

      (2) Decisions on issues which have subsequently been decided by a court of competent jurisdiction.

#### § § 20.1401

      (a)  Unless otherwise specified, the term “issue” in this subpart means a matter upon which the Board made a final decision (other than a decision under this subpart). As used in the preceding sentence, a “final decision” is one which was appealable under Chapter 72 of title 38, United States Code, or which would have been so appealable if such provision had been in effect at the time of the decision.

      (b)  As used in this subpart, the term “party” means any party to the proceeding before the Board that resulted in the final Board decision which is the subject of a motion under this subpart.

      § 20.1403   Rule 1403. What constitutes clear and unmistakable error; what does not.

#### § § 20.1403

      (a)  Clear and unmistakable error is a very specific and rare kind of error. It is the kind of error, of fact or of law, that when called to the attention of later reviewers compels the conclusion, to which reasonable minds could not differ, that the result would have been manifestly different but for the error. Generally, either the correct facts, as they were known at the time, were not before the Board, or the statutory and regulatory provisions extant at the time were incorrectly applied.

      (b) —(1)  Review for clear and unmistakable error in a prior Board decision must be based on the record and the law that existed when that decision was made.

      (2)  For a Board decision on a legacy appeal as defined in § 19.2 of this chapter issued on or after July 21, 1992, the record that existed when that decision was made includes relevant documents possessed by the Department of Veterans Affairs not later than 90 days before such record was transferred to the Board for review in reaching that decision, provided that the documents could reasonably be expected to be part of the record.

      (c)  To warrant revision of a Board decision on the grounds of clear and unmistakable error, there must have been an error in the Board's adjudication of the appeal which, had it not been made, would have manifestly changed the outcome when it was made. If it is not absolutely clear that a different result would have ensued, the error complained of cannot be clear and unmistakable.

      (d) —(1)  A new medical diagnosis that “corrects” an earlier diagnosis considered in a Board decision.

      (2)  The Secretary's failure to fulfill the duty to assist.

      (3)  A disagreement as to how the facts were weighed or evaluated.

      (e)  Clear and unmistakable error does not include the otherwise correct application of a statute or regulation where, subsequent to the Board decision challenged, there has been a change in the interpretation of the statute or regulation.

#### § § 20.1404

      (a)  A motion for revision of a decision based on clear and unmistakable error must be in writing, and must be signed by the moving party or that party's representative. The motion must include the name of the veteran; the name of the moving party if other than the veteran; the applicable Department of Veterans Affairs file number; and the date of the Board of Veterans' Appeals decision to which the motion relates. If the applicable decision involved more than one issue on appeal, the motion must identify the specific issue, or issues, to which the motion pertains. Motions which fail to comply with the requirements set forth in this paragraph shall be dismissed without prejudice to refiling under this subpart.

      (b)  The motion must set forth clearly and specifically the alleged clear and unmistakable error, or errors, of fact or law in the Board decision, the legal or factual basis for such allegations, and why the result would have been manifestly different but for the alleged error. Non-specific allegations of failure to follow regulations or failure to give due process, or any other general, non-specific allegations of error, are insufficient to satisfy the requirement of the previous sentence. Motions which fail to comply with the requirements set forth in this paragraph shall be dismissed without prejudice to refiling under this subpart.

      (c)  A motion for revision of a decision based on clear and unmistakable error may be filed at any time. Such motions should be filed at the following address: Board of Veterans' Appeals, P.O. Box 27063, Washington, DC 20038.

      (d)  A request for revision transmitted to the Board by the Secretary pursuant to 38 U.S.C. 7111(f) (relating to requests for revision filed with the Secretary other than at the Board) shall be treated as if a motion had been filed pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section.

      (e)  A motion for reconsideration, as described in subpart K of this part, whenever filed, will not be considered a motion under this subpart.

      (f)  A motion under this subpart may be withdrawn at any time before the Board promulgates a decision on the motion. Such withdrawal shall be in writing, shall be filed at the address listed in paragraph (c) of this section, and shall be signed by the moving party or by such party's representative. If such a writing is timely received, the motion shall be dismissed without prejudice to refiling under this subpart.

#### § § 20.1405

      (a) —(1)  Motions under this subpart will be docketed in the order received and will be assigned in accordance with § 20.106 (relating to assignment of proceedings). Where an appeal is pending on the same underlying issue at the time the motion is received, the motion and the appeal may be consolidated under the same docket number and disposed of as part of the same proceeding. A motion may not be assigned to any Member who participated in the decision that is the subject of the motion. If a motion is assigned to a panel, the decision will be by a majority vote of the panel Members.

      (2)  A motion may be advanced on the docket subject to the same substantive and procedural requirements as those applicable to an appeal under Rule 800, paragraph (c) (§ 20.800(c)) or, for legacy appeals, Rule 902, paragraph (c) (§ 20.902(c)).

      (3)  When the Board receives a motion under this subpart from an individual whose claims file indicates that he or she is represented, the Board shall provide a copy of the motion to the representative before assigning the motion to a Member or panel. Within 30 days after the date on which the Board provides a copy of the motion to the representative, the representative may file a relevant response, including a request to review the claims file prior to filing a further response. Upon request made within the time allowed under this paragraph (a)(2), the Board shall arrange for the representative to have the opportunity to review the claims file, and shall permit the representative a reasonable time after making the file available to file a further response.

      (b)  No new evidence will be considered in connection with the disposition of the motion. Material included in the record on the basis of Rule 1403(b)(2) (§ 20.1403(b)(2) of this part) is not considered new evidence.

      (c) —(1)  The Board may, for good cause shown, grant a request for a hearing for the purpose of argument. No testimony or other evidence will be admitted in connection with such a hearing. The determination as to whether good cause has been shown shall be made by the member or panel to whom the motion is assigned.

      (2)  Requests for such a hearing shall be submitted to the following address: Board of Veterans' Appeals, P.O. Box 27063, Washington, DC 20038.

      (d)  Subject to the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section, the Board may use the various agencies of original jurisdiction to ensure completeness of the record in connection with a motion under this subpart.

      (e)  The Board may secure opinions of the General Counsel in connection with a motion under this subpart. In such cases, the Board will notify the party and his or her representative, if any. When the opinion is received by the Board, a copy of the opinion will be furnished to the party's representative or, subject to the limitations provided in 38 U.S.C. 5701(b)(1), to the party if there is no representative. A period of 60 days from the date of mailing of a copy of the opinion will be allowed for response. The date of mailing will be presumed to be the same as the date of the letter or memorandum which accompanies the copy of the opinion for purposes of determining whether a response was timely filed.

      (f)  The decision of the Board on a motion under this subpart will be in writing. The decision will include separately stated findings of fact and conclusions of law on all material questions of fact and law presented on the record, the reasons or bases for those findings and conclusions, and an order granting or denying the motion.

      If the Board undertakes, on its own motion, a review pursuant to this subpart, the party to that decision and that party's representative (if any) will be notified of such motion and provided an adequate summary thereof and, if applicable, outlining any proposed discontinuance or reduction in benefits that would result from revision of the Board's prior decision. They will be allowed a period of 60 days to file a brief or argument in answer. The failure of a party to so respond does not affect the finality of the Board's decision on the motion.

      In the case of a motion under this subpart to revise a final Board decision in a simultaneously contested claim, as that term is used in Rule 3(l) (§ 20.3(l) of this part), a copy of such motion shall, to the extent practicable, be sent to all other contesting parties. Other parties have a period of 30 days from the date of mailing of the copy of the motion to file a brief or argument in answer. The date of mailing of the copy will be presumed to be the same as the date of the letter which accompanies the copy. Notices in simultaneously contested claims will be forwarded to the last address of record of the parties concerned and such action will constitute sufficient evidence of notice.

#### § § 21.1

        (a)  The purposes of this program are to provide to eligible veterans with compensable service-connected disabilities all services and assistance necessary to enable them to achieve maximum independence in daily living and, to the maximum extent feasible, to become employable and to obtain and maintain suitable employment.

        (1) The Department of Veterans Affairs must first find that the veteran has basic entitlement to services as prescribed by § 21.40.

        (2) The services necessary for training and rehabilitation must be identified by the Department of Veterans Affairs and the veteran.

        (3) An individual written plan must be developed by the Department of Veterans Affairs and the veteran describing the goals of the program and the means through which these goals will be achieved.

      Claims

        § 21.30   Claims.

#### § § 21.30

        A specific claim in the form prescribed by the Department of Veterans Affairs must be filed for:

        (a) A program of rehabilitation services, or

        (b) Employment assistance.

        § 21.31   Informal claim.

#### § § 21.31

        Any communication or action indicating an intent to apply for rehabilitation or employment assistance, from a veteran, a duly authorized representative, or a Member of Congress may be considered an informal claim. Upon receipt of an informal claim, if a formal claim has not been filed, an application form will be forwarded to the veteran for execution. In the case of a claim for rehabilitation, or employment assistance, the formal claim will be considered filed as of the date of receipt of the informal claim if received within 1 year from the date it was sent to the veteran, or before cessation of the course, whichever is earlier.

        § 21.32   Notification by VA of necessary information or evidence when a claim is filed; time for claimant response and VA action.

#### § § 21.32

        The provisions of this section apply to claims that are governed by this subpart or subpart M of this part.

        (a)  Except when a claim cannot be substantiated because there is no legal basis for the claim, or undisputed facts render the claimant ineligible for the claimed benefit, when VA receives a complete or substantially complete application for vocational rehabilitation benefits and services provided under this subpart or subpart M of this part VA will:

        (1) Notify the claimant of any information and evidence that is necessary to substantiate the claim;

        (2) Inform the claimant which information and evidence, if any, the claimant is to provide to VA and which information and evidence, if any, VA will try to obtain for the claimant; and

        (3) Inform the claimant of the time limit, as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, for responding to VA's notification, and of actions, as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, that VA may take to decide the claim if the claimant does not respond to such notification within 30 days.

        (b)  For purposes of this section and § 21.33:

        (1) The term  does not include a notice of disagreement.

        (2) The term  means the notice described in paragraph (a) of this section.

        (3) The term  means, for an individual's first application for vocational rehabilitation benefits and services administered by VA, an application containing:

        (i) The claimant's name;

        (ii) His or her relationship to the veteran, if applicable;

        (iii) Sufficient information for VA to verify the claimed service, if applicable; and

        (iv) The benefit claimed.

        (4) The term  means nonevidentiary facts, such as the claimant's Social Security number or address, or the name of the educational institution the claimant is attending.

        (c)  Any information and evidence described in the notification as information and evidence that the claimant is to provide must be received by VA within one year from the date of the notification. If VA does not receive the information and evidence from the claimant within that time period, VA may adjudicate the claim based on the information and evidence in the file.

        (d)  If the claimant has not responded to the notification within 30 days, VA may decide the claim before the expiration of the one-year period, based on all the information and evidence in the file, including information and evidence it has obtained on behalf of the claimant. If VA does so, however, and the claimant subsequently provides the information and evidence specified in the notification within one year of the date of the notification, VA must readjudicate the claim. If VA's decision on a readjudication is favorable to the claimant, the award of vocational rehabilitation benefits and services shall take effect as if the prior decision by VA on the claim had not been made.

        (e)  If VA receives an incomplete application for benefits, it will notify the claimant of the information necessary to complete the application and will defer assistance until the claimant submits this information. If the information necessary to complete the application is not received by VA within one year from the date of such notice, VA cannot pay or provide any benefits based on that application.

        (f)  For the purpose of this section, when VA seeks to notify a claimant, it will provide such notice to:

        (1) The claimant;

        (2) His or her fiduciary, if any; and

        (3) His or her representative, if any.

        § 21.33   VA has a duty to assist claimants in obtaining evidence.

#### § § 21.33

        The provisions of this section apply to claims that are governed by this subpart or subpart M of this part.

        (a)  (1) Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, upon receipt of a complete or substantially complete application for vocational rehabilitation benefits and services under this subpart or subpart M of this part, VA will:

        (i) Make reasonable efforts to help a claimant obtain evidence necessary to substantiate the claim; and

        (ii) Give the assistance described in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section to an individual attempting to reopen a finally decided claim.

        (2) VA will not pay any fees a custodian of records may charge to provide the records VA requests.

        (b)  (1) VA will make reasonable efforts to obtain relevant records not in the custody of a Federal department or agency. These records include relevant records from:

        (i) State or local governments;

        (ii) Private medical care providers;

        (iii) Current or former employers; and

        (iv) Other non-Federal governmental sources.

        (2) The reasonable efforts described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section will generally consist of an initial request for the records and, if VA does not receive the records, at least one follow-up request. The following are exceptions to this provision concerning the number of requests that VA generally will make:

        (i) VA will not make a follow-up request if a response to the initial request indicates that the records sought do not exist or that a follow-up request for the records would be futile.

        (ii) If VA receives information showing that subsequent requests to this or another custodian could result in obtaining the records sought, reasonable efforts will include an initial request and, if VA does not receive the records, at least one follow-up request to the new source or an additional request to the original source.

        (3) The claimant must cooperate fully with VA's reasonable efforts to obtain relevant records from non-Federal agency or department custodians. The claimant must provide enough information to identify and locate the existing records, including:

        (i) The person, company, agency, or other custodian holding the records;

        (ii) The approximate time frame covered by the records; and

        (iii) In the case of medical treatment records, the condition for which treatment was provided.

        (4) If necessary, the claimant must authorize the release of existing records in a form acceptable to the person, company, agency, or other custodian holding the records.

        (c)  (1) Subject to paragraphs (c)(2) through (c)(4) of this section, VA will make as many requests as are necessary to obtain relevant records from a Federal department or agency. These records include but are not limited to:

        (i) Military records;

        (ii) Medical and other records from VA medical facilities;

        (iii) Records from non-VA facilities providing examination or treatment at VA expense; and

        (iv) Records from other Federal agencies.

        (2) VA will cease its efforts to obtain records from a Federal department or agency only if VA concludes that the records sought do not exist or that further efforts to obtain those records would be futile. Cases in which VA may conclude that no further efforts are required include cases in which the Federal department or agency advises VA that the requested records do not exist or that the custodian of such records does not have them.

        (3) The claimant must cooperate fully with VA's reasonable efforts to obtain relevant records from Federal department or agency custodians. At VA's request, the claimant must provide enough information to identify and locate the existing records, including:

        (i) The custodian or agency holding the records;

        (ii) The approximate time frame covered by the records; and

        (iii) In the case of medical treatment records, the condition for which treatment was provided.

        (4) If necessary, the claimant must authorize the release of existing records in a form acceptable to the custodian or agency holding the records.

        (d)  VA will refrain from providing assistance in obtaining evidence for a claim if the substantially complete or complete application for benefits indicates that there is no reasonable possibility that any assistance VA would provide to the claimant would substantiate the claim. VA will discontinue providing assistance in obtaining evidence for a claim if the evidence obtained indicates that there is no reasonable possibility that further assistance would substantiate the claim. Circumstances in which VA will refrain from or discontinue providing assistance in obtaining evidence include but are not limited to:

        (1) The claimant's ineligibility for the benefit sought because of lack of qualifying service, lack of veteran status, or other lack of legal eligibility;

        (2) Claims that are inherently not credible or clearly lack merit;

        (3) An application requesting a benefit to which the claimant is not entitled as a matter of law; and

        (4) The claimant's lack of cooperation in providing or requesting information or evidence necessary to substantiate the claim.

        (e)  (1) VA will notify the claimant either orally or in writing when VA:

        (i) Has made reasonable efforts to obtain relevant non-Federal records, but is unable to obtain them; or

        (ii) After continued efforts to obtain Federal records, concludes that it is reasonably certain they do not exist or that further efforts to obtain them would be futile.

        (2) For non-Federal records requests, VA may provide the notice to the claimant at the same time it makes its final attempt to obtain the relevant records.

        (3) VA will make a written record of any oral notice conveyed under this paragraph to the claimant.

        (4) The notice to the claimant must contain the following information:

        (i) The identity of the records VA was unable to obtain;

        (ii) An explanation of the efforts VA made to obtain the records;

        (iii) The fact described in paragraph (e)(1)(i) or (e)(1)(ii) of this section;

        (iv) A description of any further action VA will take regarding the claim, including, but not limited to, notice that VA will decide the claim based on the evidence of record unless the claimant submits the records VA was unable to obtain; and

        (v) A notice that the claimant is ultimately responsible for obtaining the evidence.

        (5) If VA becomes aware of the existence of relevant records before deciding the claim, VA will notify the claimant of the existence of such records and ask that the claimant provide a release for the records. If the claimant does not provide any necessary release of the relevant records that VA is unable to obtain, VA will ask that the claimant obtain the records and provide them to VA.

        (6) For the purpose of this section, if VA must notify the claimant, VA will provide notice to:

        (i) The claimant;

        (ii) His or her fiduciary, if any; and

        (iii) His or her representative, if any.

        (a)  (1) For purposes of §§ 21.41 through 21.46, the term  means the 12-year period beginning on the date of a veteran's discharge or release from his or her last period of active military, naval, or air service, and ending on the date that is 12 years from the veteran's discharge or release date, but the beginning date may be deferred or the ending date extended under the sections referred to in paragraph (b) of this section. ( §§ 21.70 through 21.79 concerning duration of rehabilitation programs.)

        (2) Except as provided in paragraph (b) or (c) of this section, the period during which an individual may receive a program of vocational rehabilitation benefits and services under 38 U.S.C. chapter 31 is limited to his or her basic period of eligibility.

        (b)  VA may defer the beginning date of a veteran's basic period of eligibility under § 21.42. VA may extend the ending date of a veteran's basic period of eligibility under § 21.42 (extension due to medical condition); § 21.44 (extension for a veteran with a serious employment handicap), § 21.45 (extension during a program of independent living services and assistance), and § 21.46 (extension for a veteran recalled to active duty).

        (c)  The basic period of eligibility for a servicemember who is entitled to vocational rehabilitation services and assistance under 38 U.S.C. chapter 31 for a period before discharge does not run while the servicemember remains on active duty, but begins on the date of discharge from the active military, naval, or air service. The period of eligibility requirements of this section are not applicable to provision of vocational rehabilitation services and assistance under chapter 31 during active duty.

        § 21.42   Deferral or extension of the basic period of eligibility.

#### § § 21.42

        The basic period of eligibility does not run as long as any of the following reasons prevents the veteran from commencing or continuing a vocational rehabilitation program:

        (a)  The basic period of eligibility does not commence until the day VA notifies a veteran of a rating determination by VA that the veteran has a qualifying compensable service-connected disability under § 21.40.

        (b)  (1) The basic period of eligibility does not commence until the veteran meets the requirement of a discharge or release under conditions other than dishonorable. (For provisions regarding character of discharge, see § 3.12 of this chapter.)

        (2) If VA has considered a veteran's character of discharge to be a bar to benefits, the basic period of eligibility commences only when one of the following happens:

        (i) An appropriate authority changes the character of discharge or release; or

        (ii) VA determines that the discharge or release was under conditions other than dishonorable or that the discharge or release was, but no longer is, a bar to benefits.

        (3) If there is a change in the character of discharge, or the discharge or release otherwise is determined, as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, not to be a bar to benefits, the beginning date of the basic period of eligibility will be the effective date of the change or VA determination.

        (c)  (1) The basic period of eligibility does not run during any period when a veteran's participation in a Veteran Readiness and Employment (VR&E) program is determined to be infeasible for 30 days or more because of any medical condition(s) of the veteran, including the disabling effects of chronic alcoholism (see paragraphs (c)(2) through (c)(5) of this section).

        (2) For purposes of this section, the term  means alcohol-induced physical or mental disorders or both, such as habitual intoxication, withdrawal, delirium, amnesia, dementia, and other like manifestations that:

        (i) Have been diagnosed as manifestations of alcohol dependency or chronic alcohol abuse; and

        (ii) Have been determined to prevent the affected veteran from beginning or continuing in a program of VR&E.

        (3) A diagnosis of alcoholism, chronic alcoholism, alcohol dependency, or chronic alcohol abuse, in and of itself, does not satisfy the definition of disabling effects of chronic alcoholism.

        (4) Injuries sustained by a veteran as a proximate and immediate result of activity undertaken by the veteran while physically or mentally unqualified to do so due to alcoholic intoxication are not considered disabling effects of chronic alcoholism. An injury itself, however, may prevent commencement or continuation of a rehabilitation program.

        (5) For purposes of this section, after November 17, 1988, the disabling effects of chronic alcoholism do not constitute willful misconduct. See 38 U.S.C. 105(c).

        (6) If the basic period of eligibility is delayed or interrupted under this paragraph (c) due to any medical condition(s) of the veteran, it will begin or resume on the date a Counseling Psychologist (CP) or Vocational Rehabilitation Counselor (VRC) notifies the veteran in writing that the CP or VRC has determined, based on the evidence of record, that participation in a VR&E program is reasonably feasible for the veteran.

        § 21.44   Extension of the basic period of eligibility for a veteran with a serious employment handicap.

#### § § 21.44

        (a)  A Counseling Psychologist (CP) or Vocational Rehabilitation Counselor (VRC) may extend the basic period of eligibility of a veteran with a serious employment handicap when the veteran's current employment handicap and need for rehabilitation services and assistance necessitate an extension under the following conditions:

        (1)  The veteran has not been rehabilitated to the point of employability; or

        (2)  The veteran was previously declared rehabilitated to the point of employability, but currently meets one of the following three conditions:

        (i) One or more of the veteran's service-connected disabilities has worsened, preventing the veteran from working in the occupation for which he or she trained, or in a related occupation;

        (ii) The veteran's current employment handicap and capabilities clearly show that the occupation for which the veteran previously trained is currently unsuitable; or

        (iii) The occupational requirements in the occupation for which the veteran trained have changed to such an extent that additional services are necessary to enable the veteran to work in that occupation, or in a related field.

        (b)  For a veteran with a serious employment handicap, a CP or VRC may extend the basic period of eligibility for such additional period as the CP or VRC determines is needed for the veteran to accomplish the purposes of his or her individualized rehabilitation program.

        § 21.45   Extending the period of eligibility for a program of independent living beyond basic period of eligibility.

#### § § 21.45

        A Counseling Psychologist (CP) or Vocational Rehabilitation Counselor (VRC) may extend the period of eligibility for a veteran's program of independent living services beyond the veteran's basic period of eligibility if the CP or VRC determines that an extension is necessary for the veteran to achieve maximum independence in daily living. The extension may be for such period as the CP or VRC determines is needed for the veteran to achieve the goals of his or her program of independent living.

        § 21.47   Eligibility for employment assistance.

#### § § 21.47

        (a)  Each veteran, other than one found in need of a program of independent living services and assistance, who is otherwise currently eligible for and entitled to participate in a program of rehabilitation under chapter 31 may receive employment services. Included are those veterans who:

        (1) Have completed a program of rehabilitation services under chapter 31 and been declared rehabilitated to the point of employability;

        (2) Have not completed a period of rehabilitation to the point of employability under chapter 31, but:

        (i) Have elected to secure employment without completing the period of rehabilitation to the point of employability; and

        (ii) Are employable; or

        (3) Have never received services for rehabilitation to the point of employability under chapter 31 if they:

        (i) Are employable or employed in a suitable occupation;

        (ii) Have an employment handicap or a serious employment handicap; and

        (iii) Need employment services to secure and/or maintain suitable employment.

        (b)  A veteran who at some time in the past has participated in a vocational rehabilitation program under chapter 31 or a similar program under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 as amended, and is employable is eligible for employment services under the following conditions even though he or she is ineligible for any other assistance under chapter 31:

        (1) The veteran is employable in a suitable occupation;

        (2) The veteran has filed a claim for vocational rehabilitation or employment assistance;

        (3) The veteran meets the criteria for eligibility described in § 21.40; and

        (4) The veteran has an employment handicap or serious employment handicap; and

        (5) The veteran:

        (i) Completed a vocational rehabilitation program under 38 U.S.C. ch. 31 or participated in such a program for at least 90 days on or after September 16, 1940; or

        (ii) Completed a vocational rehabilitation program under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 after September 26, 1975, or participated in such a program which included at least 90 days of postsecondary education or vocational training.

        (c)  If a veteran is currently ineligible under chapter 31 because he or she does not have an employment handicap, and has never before participated in a vocational rehabilitation program under chapter 31 or under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, no employment assistance may now be provided to the veteran under chapter 31.

        (d)  The periods during which employment assistance may be provided are not subject to limitations on periods of eligibility for vocational rehabilitation provided in §§ 21.41 through 21.45 of this part, but entitlement to such assistance is, as provided in § 21.73 of this part, limited to 18 total months of assistance.

        § 21.48   Severance of service-connection—reduction to noncompensable degree.

#### § § 21.48

        When a rating action is taken which proposes severance of service-connection or reduction to a noncompensable degree, the provisions of the following paragraphs will govern the veteran's entitlement to rehabilitation and employment assistance under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 31.

        (a)  If the veteran is an applicant for rehabilitation or employment assistance when the proposed rating action is taken, all processes respecting determination of entitlement or induction into training shall be immediately suspended. In no event shall any veteran be inducted into a rehabilitation program or provided employment assistance during the interim periods provided in § 3.105 (d) and (e) of this title. If the proposed rating action becomes final, the application will be denied. See also § 21.50 as to initial evaluation.

        (b)  If the proposed rating action is taken while the veteran is in a rehabilitation program and results in a reduction to a noncompensable rating of his or her disability, the veteran may be retained in the program until the completion of the program, except if “discontinued” under § 21.198 he or she may not reenter.

        (c)  If the proposed rating action is taken while the veteran is in a rehabilitation program and results in severance of the service-connection of his or her disability, rehabilitation will be terminated effective as of the last day of the month in which severance of service-connection becomes final.

      Initial and Extended Evaluation

        § 21.50   Initial evaluation.

#### § § 21.50

        (a)  VA will provide an initial evaluation to an individual who:

        (1) Applies for benefits under 38 U.S.C. chapter 31; and

        (2) Meets the service-connected disability requirements of § 21.40.

        (b)  A counseling psychologist (CP) or vocational rehabilitation counselor (VRC) will determine:

        (1) Whether the individual has an employment handicap as determined in accordance with this section and § 21.51;

        (2) Whether an individual with an employment handicap has a serious employment handicap as determined in accordance with this section and § 21.52; and

        (3) Whether the achievement of a vocational goal is currently reasonably feasible as described in § 21.53.

        (c)  In making the determinations under paragraph (b) of this section, the following factors will be developed and assessed:

        (1) The handicapping effects of the individual's service-connected and nonservice-connected disability(ies) on employability and on independence in daily living;

        (2) The individual's physical and mental capabilities that may affect employability and ability to function independently in daily living activities in family and community;

        (3) The impact of the individual's identified vocational impairments on the individual's ability to prepare for, obtain, and keep suitable employment;

        (4) The individual's abilities, aptitudes, and interests;

        (5) The individual's personal history and current circumstances (including educational and training achievements, employment record, developmental and related vocationally significant factors, and family and community adjustment); and

        (6) Other factors that may affect the individual's employability.

        (d)  The individual's cooperation is essential in the initial evaluation process. If the individual does not cooperate, the CP or VRC will make reasonable efforts to secure the individual's cooperation. If, despite those efforts, the individual fails to cooperate, VA will suspend the initial evaluation process ( § 21.362, regarding satisfactory conduct and cooperation, and § 21.364, regarding unsatisfactory conduct and cooperation).

        § 21.51   Determining employment handicap.

#### § § 21.51

        For the purposes of § 21.50, an employment handicap will be found to exist only if a CP or VRC determines that the individual meets each of the following conditions:

        (a)  The individual has a vocational impairment; that is, an impairment of the ability to prepare for, obtain, or keep employment in an occupation consistent with his or her abilities, aptitudes, and interests.

        (b)  The individual has not overcome the effects of the individual's impairment of employability through employment in, or qualifying for employment in, an occupation consistent with his or her abilities, aptitudes, and interests. This situation includes an individual who qualifies for a suitable job, but who does not obtain or keep the job for reasons beyond his or her control.

        (c)  (1) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(3) of this section, the service-connected disability(ies) must contribute in substantial part to the individual's overall vocational impairment. This means that the disability(ies) must have an identifiable, measurable, or observable causative effect on the overall vocational impairment, but need not be the sole or primary cause of the employment handicap.

        (2) When determining the individual's overall vocational impairment, the CP or VRC will consider the factors identified in § 21.50(c).

        (3) For determinations made on applications for vocational rehabilitation filed on or after March 30, 1995, but before October 9, 1996, the individual's service-connected disability(ies) need not contribute to the individual's overall vocational impairment.

> [72 FR 14042, Mar. 26, 2007]

        § 21.52   Determining serious employment handicap.

#### § § 21.52

        (a)  For each individual who is found to have an employment handicap, a CP or VRC must make a separate determination of whether the individual has a serious employment handicap. For the purposes of an initial evaluation under § 21.50, a serious employment handicap will be found to exist only if a CP or VRC determines that the individual meets each of the following conditions:

        (1)  The individual has a significant vocational impairment; that is, a significant impairment of the ability to prepare for, obtain, or keep employment in an occupation consistent with his or her abilities, aptitudes, and interests, considering the factors described in § 21.50 and paragraph (b) of this section.

        (2)  The individual has not overcome the effects of the significant vocational impairment through employment in, or qualifying for employment in, an occupation consistent with his or her abilities, aptitudes, and interests. This includes an individual who qualifies for a suitable job, but who does not obtain or keep the job for reasons beyond his or her control.

        (3)  (i) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section, the service-connected disability(ies) must contribute in substantial part to the individual's overall significant vocational impairment. This means that the disability(ies) must have an identifiable, measurable, or observable causative effect on the overall significant vocational impairment, but need not be the sole or primary cause of the serious employment handicap.

        (ii) For determinations made on applications for vocational rehabilitation filed on or after March 30, 1995, but before October 9, 1996, the individual's service-connected disability(ies) need not contribute to the individual's overall significant vocational impairment.

        (b)  The combination of all restrictions and their effects on the individual define the extent of the vocational impairment and its significance. When determining whether the individual has a significant vocational impairment, VA will develop and assess the following factors and their effects:

        (1) Number of disabling conditions;

        (2) Severity of disabling condition(s);

        (3) Existence of neuropsychiatric condition(s);

        (4) Adequacy of education or training for suitable employment;

        (5) Number, length, and frequency of periods of unemployment or underemployment;

        (6) A pattern of reliance on government support programs, such as welfare, service-connected disability compensation, nonservice-connected disability pension, worker's compensation, or Social Security disability;

        (7) Extent and complexity of services and assistance the individual needs to achieve rehabilitation;

        (8) Negative attitudes toward individuals with disabilities and other evidence of restrictions on suitable employment, such as labor market conditions; discrimination based on age, race, gender, disability or other factors; alcoholism or other substance abuse; and

        (9) Other factors that relate to preparing for, obtaining, or keeping employment consistent with the individual's abilities, aptitudes, and interests.

        § 21.53   Reasonable feasibility of achieving a vocational goal.

#### § § 21.53

        (a)  The Department of Veterans Affairs shall determine the reasonable feasibility of achieving a vocational goal in each case in which a veteran has either:

        (1) An employment handicap, or

        (2) A serious employment handicap.

        (b)  The term  means a gainful employment status consistent with the veteran's abilities, aptitudes, and interests.

        (c)  The determination of reasonable feasibility shall be made as expeditiously as possible when necessary information has been developed in the course of initial evaluation. If an extended evaluation is necessary as provided in § 21.57 a decision of feasibility shall be made by the end of the extended evaluation. Any reasonable doubt shall be resolved in favor of a finding of feasibility.

        (d)  Achievement of a vocational goal is reasonably feasible for a veteran with either an employment or serious employment handicap when the following conditions are met:

        (1) Vocational goal(s) has (have) been identified;

        (2) The veteran's physical and mental conditions permit training for the goal(s) to begin within a reasonable period; and

        (3) The veteran:

        (i) Possesses the necessary educational skills and background to pursue the vocational goal; or

        (ii) Will be provided services by the Department of Veterans Affairs to develop such necessary educational skills as part of the program.

        (e)  (1) When VA finds that the provisions of paragraph (d) of this section are not met, but VA has not determined that achievement of a vocational goal is not currently reasonably feasible, VA shall provide the rehabilitation services contained in § 21.35(i)(1)(i) of this part as appropriate;

        (2) A finding that achievement of a vocational goal is infeasible without a period of extended evaluation requires compelling evidence which establishes infeasibility beyond any reasonable doubt.

        (f)  The Counseling Psychologist (CP) or Vocational Rehabilitation Counselor (VRC) shall determine the current reasonable feasibility of a program of independent living services in each case in which a vocational rehabilitation program is not found reasonably feasible. The concurrence of the Veteran Readiness and Employment (VR&E) Officer is required in any case in which the CP or VRC does not approve a program of independent living services.

        (g)  A CP or VRC in the VR&E Division shall determine whether achievement of a vocational goal is:

        (1) Reasonably feasible; or

        (2) Not currently reasonably feasible under the provisions of paragraph (e) of this section for the purpose of determining present eligibility to receive a program of independent living services.

        § 21.57   Extended evaluation.

#### § § 21.57

        (a)  The purpose of an extended evaluation for a veteran with a serious employment handicap is to determine the current feasibility of the veteran achieving a vocational goal, when this decision reasonably cannot be made on the basis of information developed during the initial evaluation.

        (b)  During the extended evaluation, a veteran may be provided:

        (1) Diagnostic and evaluative services;

        (2) Services to improve his or her ability to attain a vocational goal;

        (3) Services to improve his or her ability to live and function independently in the community;

        (4) An allowance as provided in § 21.260.

        (c)  (1) The determination of the reasonable feasibility of a veteran achieving a vocational goal will be made at the earliest time possible during an extended evaluation, but not later than the end of the period of evaluation, or an extension of that period. Any reasonable doubt as to feasibility will be resolved in the veteran's favor;

        (2) When it is reasonably feasible for the veteran to achieve a vocational goal, an individualized written rehabilitation plan (IWRP) will be developed as indicated in § 21.84 of this part.

        (d)  A Counseling Psychologist (CP) or Vocational Rehabilitation Counselor (VRC) in the Veteran Readiness and Employment (VR&E) Division shall determine whether a period of extended evaluation is needed.

        (1) Unmistakable error in fact or law; or

        (2) New and material evidence which justifies a change.

        (b)  (1) The Department of Veterans Affairs will not redetermine a finding of employment handicap, serious employment handicap, or eligibility for a program of employment services subsequent to the veteran's induction into a program because of a reduction in his or her disability rating, including a reduction to 0 percent:

        (2) The Department of Veterans Affairs may consider whether a finding of employment handicap should be changed to serious employment handicap when there is an increase in the degree of service-connected disability, or other significant change in the veteran's situation;

        (3) A redetermination of employment handicap, serious employment handicap, or eligibility for a program of employment services will be made when there is a clear and unmistakable error of fact or law.

        (c)  A veteran's eligibility and entitlement to assistance must be redetermined in any case in which:

        (1) The veteran is determined to be rehabilitated to the point of employability under the provisions of § 21.190;

        (2) The veteran is determined to meet the requirements for rehabilitation under the provisions of § 21.196; or

#### § § 21.72

        (a)  Rehabilitation to the point of employability may include the services needed to:

        (1) Evaluate and improve the veteran's ability to undertake training;

        (2) Train the veteran to the level generally recognized as necessary for entry into employment in a suitable occupational objective. Where a particular degree, diploma, or certificate is generally necessary for entry into the occupation, e.g., an MSW for social work, the veteran shall be trained to that level.

        (b) —(1)  If the amount of training necessary to qualify for employment in a particular occupation in a geographical area where a veteran lives or will seek employment exceeds the amount generally needed for employment in that occupation, the Department of Veterans Affairs will provide, or arrange for the necessary additional training.

        (2)  The Department of Veterans Affairs will assist a veteran with a serious employment handicap to train to a higher level than is usually required to qualify in a particular occupation, when one of the following conditions exist:

        (i) The veteran is preparing for a type of work in which he or she will be at a definite disadvantage in competing with nondisabled persons for jobs or business, and the additional training will help to offset the competitive disadvantage;

        (ii) The number of feasible occupations are restricted, and additional training will enhance the veteran's employability in one of those occupations;

        (iii) The number of employment opportunities within feasible occupations are restricted.

        (c)  (1) The Counseling Psychologist (CP) or Vocational Rehabilitation Counselor (VRC) shall estimate the duration of training and the estimate shall be incorporated in the IWRP (Individualized Written Rehabilitation Plan). When the period of training is estimated to exceed 48 months, the concurrence of the Veteran Readiness and Employment (VR&E) Officer is required, prior to approving the IWRP, under conditions listed in § 21.78.

        (2) The estimated duration of the period of training required to complete an original or amended IWRP may be extended when necessary. Authorization of an extension is the responsibility of the CP or VRC, except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section. Any extension which will result in use of more than 48 months of entitlement must meet conditions described in § 21.78.

        (d)  (1) The VRS (Vocational Rehabilitation Specialist) may authorize an extension of up to six months of the period of vocational rehabilitation training authorized by the IWRP when:

        (i) The veteran is in  status under § 21.190;

        (ii) The veteran has completed more than half of the prescribed training;

        (iii) The veteran is making satisfactory progress;

        (iv) The extension is necessary to complete training;

        (v) Training can be completed within six months; and

        (vi) The extension will not result in use of more than 48 months of entitlement under Chapter 31 alone or in combination with other programs identified in § 21.4020.

        (2) If the conditions listed in paragraph (d)(1) of this section are not met, and an extension is needed to complete the program, the case will be referred to the CP or VRC for a determination.

> [49 FR 40814, Oct. 18, 1984, as amended at 54 FR 37332, Sept. 8, 1989; 81 FR 26131, May 2, 2016]

        § 21.78   Approving more than 48 months of rehabilitation.

#### § § 21.78

        (a)  Neither the basic period of entitlement which may be authorized for a program of rehabilitation under Chapter 31 alone, nor a combination of entitlement of Chapter 31 and other programs listed in § 21.4020 shall exceed 48 months except as indicated in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.

        (b)  A rehabilitation program for a veteran with an employment handicap may only be extended beyond 48 months when:

        (1) The veteran previously completed training for a suitable occupation but the veteran's service-connected disability has worsened to the point that he or she is unable to perform the duties of the occupation for which training had been provided, and a period of training in the same or a different field is required. An extension beyond 48 months under Chapter 31 alone shall be authorized for this purpose.

        (2) The occupation in which the veteran previously completed training is found to be unsuitable because of the veteran's abilities and employment handicap. An extension beyond 48 months under Chapter 31 alone shall be approved for this purpose.

        (3) The veteran previously used education benefit entitlement under other programs administered by VA, and the additional period of assistance to be provided under Chapter 31 which the veteran needs to become employable will result in more than 48 months being used under all VA education programs, under these conditions the number of months necessary to complete the program may be authorized under Chapter 31, provided that the length of the extension will not result in authorization of more than 48 months under Chapter 31 alone.

        (4) A veteran in an approved Chapter 31 program has elected payment of benefits at the Chapter 30 educational assistance rate. The 48 month limitation may be exceeded only:

        (i) To the extent that the entitlement in excess of 48 months does not exceed the entitlement previously used by the veteran in a course at the secondary school level under § 21.4235 before December 31, 1989, or

        (ii) If the veteran is in a course on a term, quarter, or semester basis which began before the 36 month limitation on Chapter 30 entitlement was reached, and completion of the course will be possible by permitting the veteran to complete the training under Chapter 31.

        (5) The assistance to be provided in excess of 48 months consists only of a period of employment assistance (see § 21.73).

        (c)  The duration of a rehabilitation program for a veteran with a serious employment handicap may be extended beyond 48 months under Chapter 31 for the number of months necessary to complete a rehabilitation program under the following conditions:

        (1) To enable the veteran to complete a period of rehabilitation to the point of employability;

        (2) To provide an extended evaluation in cases in which the total period needed for an extended evaluation and for rehabilitation to the point of employability would exceed 48 months;

        (3) To provide a program of independent living services, including cases in which achievement of a vocational goal becomes feasible during or following a program of independent living services;

        (4) Following rehabilitation to the point of employability:

        (i) The veteran has been unable to secure employment in the occupation for which training has been provided despite intensive efforts on the part of the Department of Veterans Affairs and the veteran, and a period of retraining or additional training is needed;

        (ii) The skills which the veteran developed in training for an occupation in which he or she was employed are no longer adequate to maintain employment in that field and a period of retraining is needed;

        (iii) The veteran's service-connected disability has worsened to the point that he or she is unable to perform the duties of the occupation for which the veteran has been trained, and a period of training in the same or different field is required;

        (iv) The occupation in which the veteran previously completed training is found to be unsuitable due to the veteran's abilities and employment handicap.

        (5) The assistance to be provided in excess of 48 months consists, only of a period of employment assistance. (see § 21.73).

        (d)  All extensions of a rehabilitation program beyond 48 months of total entitlement under all Department of Veterans Affairs programs requires the approval of the Counseling Psychologist (CP) or Vocational Rehabilitation Counselor (VRC) and concurrence of the Veteran Readiness and Employment (VR&E) Officer or designee. Concurrence of the VR&E officer is not required for an extension due to provision of employment assistance (see § 21.21).

        § 21.79   Determining entitlement usage under Chapter 31.

#### § § 21.79

        (a)  The determination of entitlement usage for chapter 31 participants is made under the provisions of this section except as provided in paragraph (f) of this section. Charges for entitlement usage shall be based upon the principle that a veteran who pursues a rehabilitation program for 1 day should be charged 1 day of entitlement. The determination of entitlement is based upon the rate at which the veteran pursues his or her rehabilitation program. The rate of pursuit is determined under the provisions of § 21.310 of this part.

        (b)  No charge will be made against chapter 31 entitlement under any of the following circumstances:

        (1) The veteran is receiving employment services under an Individualized Employment Assistance Plan (IEAP);

        (2) The veteran is receiving an employment adjustment allowance; or

        (3) The veteran is on leave from his or her program, but leave is not authorized by the Department of Veterans Affairs.

        (c)  Charges for usage of chapter 31 entitlement may only be made for program participants in one of the following case statuses:

        (1) Rehabilitation to the point of employability;

        (2) Extended evaluation; or

        (3) Independent living.

        (d)  The Department of Veterans Affairs will make a charge against entitlement:

        (1) On the basis of total elapsed time (1 day of entitlement for each day of pursuit) if the veteran is being provided a rehabilitation program on a full-time basis;

        (2) On the basis of a proportionate rate of elapsed time if the veteran is being provided a rehabilitation program on a three-quarter, one-half or less than one-half time basis. Entitlement is charged at a:

        (i) Three-quarter time rate if pursuit is three-quarters or more, but less than full-time;

        (ii) One-half time rate if pursuit is half-time or more, but less than three-quarter time;

        (iii) One-quarter time rate if pursuit is less than half-time. Measurement of pursuit on a one-quarter time basis is limited to veterans in independent living or extended evaluation programs.

        (e)  (1) The computation of entitlement is based upon the rate of program pursuit, as determined under § 21.310 of this part, over the elapsed time during which training and rehabilitation services were furnished;

        (2) The Department of Veterans Affairs will compute elapsed time from the commencing date of the rehabilitation program as determined under § 21.322 of this part to the date of termination as determined under § 21.324 of this part. This includes the period during which veterans not receiving subsistence allowance because of a statutory bar; e.g., certain incarcerated veterans or servicepersons in a military hospital, nevertheless, received other chapter 31 services and assistance. Elapsed time includes the total period from the commencing date until the termination date, except for any period of unauthorized leave;

        (3) If the veteran's rate of pursuit changes after the commencing date of the rehabilitation program, the Department of Veterans Affairs will:

        (i) Separate the period of rehabilitation program services into the actual periods of time during which the veteran's rate of pursuit was different; and

        (ii) Compute entitlement based on the rate of pursuit for each separate elapsed time period.

        (f)  (1) When a chapter 31 participant elects benefits of the kind provided under chapter 30 or chapter 34 as a part of his or her rehabilitation program under chapter 31, the veteran's entitlement usage will be determined by using the entitlement provisions of those programs. Entitlement charges shall be in accordance with § 21.7076 for chapter 30 and § 21.1045 under chapter 34. The entitlement usage computed under these provisions is deducted from the veteran's chapter 31 entitlement. No entitlement charges are made against either chapter 30 or chapter 34.

        (2) When a chapter 31 participant elects to receive payment of the  under § 21.260(c) in lieu of a subsistence allowance under § 21.260(b), the entitlement usage is deducted from the veteran's chapter 31 entitlement. No entitlement charges are made against chapter 33.

        (3) When a veteran is pursuing on-job training or work experience in a Federal agency on a nonpay or nominal pay basis, the amount of entitlement used is determined in the following manner:

        (i) Entitlement used in on-job training in a Federal agency on a nonpay or nominal pay basis is determined in the same manner as other training.

        (ii) Entitlement used in pursuing work experience will be computed in the same manner as for veterans in on-job training except that work experience may be pursued on a less than full-time basis. If the veteran is receiving work experience on a less than full-time basis, entitlement charges are based upon a proportionate amount of the workweek. For example, if the workweek is 40 hours, three-quarter time is at least 30 hours, but less than 40 hours, and half-time is at least 20 hours but less than 30 hours.

        (4) Entitlement is charged on a full-time basis for a veteran found to have a reduced work tolerance.

        (g)  The Department of Veterans Affairs will make a charge against entitlement for an overpayment of subsistence allowance under the conditions described in § 21.1045(h) of this part.

      Individualized Written Rehabilitation Plan

        § 21.80   Requirement for a rehabilitation plan.

#### § § 21.80

        (a)  An IWRP (Individualized Written Rehabilitation Plan) will be developed for each veteran eligible for rehabilitation services under Chapter 31. The plan is intended to assist in:

        (1) Providing a structure which allows Veteran Readiness and Employment (VR&E) staff to translate the findings made in the course of the initial evaluation into specific rehabilitation goals and objectives;

        (2) Monitoring the veteran's progress in achieving the rehabilitation goals established in the plan;

        (3) Assuring the timeliness of assistance by Department of Veterans Affairs staff in providing services specified in the plan; and

        (4) Evaluating the effectiveness of the planning and delivery of rehabilitation services by VR&E staff.

        (b)  A plan will be prepared in each case in which a veteran will pursue:

        (1) A vocational rehabilitation program, as that term is defined in § 21.35(i);

        (2) An extended evaluation program;

        (3) An independent living services program; or

        (4) An employment program.

        (c)  The term  refers to the IWRP (Individualized Written Rehabilitation Plan) § 21.84, IEEP (Individualized Extended Evaluation Plan) § 21.86, IEAP (Individualized Employment Assistance Plan) § 21.88, and IILP (Individualized Independent Living Plan) § 21.90.

        (d)  A plan will not be prepared for a veteran who is not eligible for any assistance under Chapter 31. Department of Veterans Affairs staff, with the veteran's assistance and cooperation, will utilize information developed in the course of an initial evaluation to assist the veteran to develop alternatives for education and training, independence in daily living, or employment assistance. This assistance should help the veteran in achieving attainable vocational, independent living and employment goals utilizing benefits and services for which the veteran may be eligible under other Department of Veterans Affairs or non-Department of Veterans Affairs programs.

        (d)  Interpreter service at VA expense may not be provided by a _relative_ of the veteran. The term  has the same meaning as under § 21.374 pertaining to the use of relatives as attendants.

        § 21.154   Special transportation assistance.

#### § § 21.154

        (a)  A veteran, who because of the effects of disability has transportation expenses in addition to those incurred by persons not so disabled, shall be provided a transportation allowance to defray such additional expenses. The assistance provided in this section is in addition to provisions for interregional and intraregional travel which may be authorized under provisions of §§ 21.370 through 21.376.

        (b)  A special transportation allowance may be provided during:

        (1) Extended evaluation;

        (2) Rehabilitation to the point of employability;

        (3) Independent living services; or

        (4) Employment services, including the first three months of employment.

        (c)  (1) Transportation assistance includes mileage, parking fees, reasonable fee for a driver, transportation furnished by a rehabilitation facility or sheltered workshop, and other reasonable expenses which may be incurred in local travel;

        (2) The veteran's monthly transportation allowance may not exceed the lesser of actual expenses incurred or one-half of the subsistence allowance of a single veteran in full-time institutional training, unless extraordinary arrangements, such as transportation by ambulance, are necessary to enable a veteran to pursue a rehabilitation program.

        (d)  The case manager will determine the need for a transportation allowance. The assistance of a medical consultant shall be utilized, as necessary, to determine the need for special transportation assistance and to develop transportation arrangements which do not unduly tax the veteran's ability to travel and pursue a rehabilitation program.

        (e)  A _relative_ of the veteran may not be paid any part of a special transportation allowance. The term  has the same meaning as under § 21.374 pertaining to the use of a relative as an attendant.

        § 21.155   Services to a veteran's family.

#### § § 21.155

        (a)  VA shall provide services to a veteran's _family_ which are necessary to the implementation of the veteran's rehabilitation plan. The term  includes the veteran's immediate family, legal guardian, or any individual in whose home the veteran certifies an intention to live.

        (b)  The services which may be furnished to the family are generally limited to consultation, homecare training, counseling, and mental health services of brief duration which are designed to enable the family to cope with the veteran's needs. Extended medical, psychiatric or other services may not be furnished to family members under these provisions.

        (c)  Veteran Readiness and Employment (VR&E) Staff will:

        (1) Identify services which family members may need to facilitate the rehabilitation of the veteran; and

        (2) Arrange for provision of the services which have been identified.

        (d)  (1) The established program and services which are furnished by Veterans Health Administration (VHA) to family members of veterans eligible for Chapter 31 should be used to the extent practicable; but

        (2) If services are not readily available through regular VHA programs, necessary services will normally be secured through arrangements with other public and nonprofit agencies.

        § 21.156   Other incidental goods and services.

#### § § 21.156

        (a)  Other incidental goods and services may be authorized if the case manager determines them to be necessary to implement the veteran's rehabilitation plan. For example, a calculator may be authorized for a veteran pursuing an engineering degree, even though the veteran may not be required to have a calculator for any specific subject in his or her course, where there is substantial evidence that lack of a calculator places the veteran at a distinct disadvantage in successfully pursuing the course.

        (b)  The costs of incidental goods and services normally should not exceed five percent of training costs for any twelve-month period.

      Independent Living Services

        § 21.160   Independent living services.

#### § § 21.160

        (a)  The purpose of independent living services is to assist eligible veterans whose ability to function independently in family, community, or employment is so limited by the severity of disability (service and nonservice-connected) that vocational or rehabilitation services need to be appreciably more extensive than for less disabled veterans.

        (b)  The term  means the ability of a veteran, without the services of others or with a reduced level of the services of others, to live and function within the veteran's family and community.

        (c)  Independent living services may be furnished:

        (1) As part of a program to achieve rehabilitation to the point of employability;

        (2) As part of an extended evaluation to determine the current reasonable feasibility of achieving a vocational goal;

        (3) Incidental to a program of employment services; or

        (4) As a program of rehabilitation services for eligible veterans for whom achievement of a vocational goal is not currently reasonably feasible. This program of rehabilitation services may be furnished to help the veteran:

        (i) Function more independently in the family and community without the assistance of others or a reduced level of the assistance of others;

        (ii) Become reasonably feasible for a vocational rehabilitation program; or

        (iii) Become reasonably feasible for extended evaluation.

        (d)  The services which may be authorized as part of an IILP (Individualized Independent Living Plan) include:

        (1) Any appropriate service which may be authorized for a vocational rehabilitation program as that term is defined in § 21.35(i), except for a course of education or training as described in § 21.120; and

        (2) Independent living services offered by approved independent living centers and programs which are determined to be necessary to carry out the veteran's plan including:

        (i) Evaluation of independent living potential;

        (ii) Training in independent living skills;

        (iii) Attendant care;

        (iv) Health maintenance programs; and

        (v) Identifying appropriate housing accommodations.

        (e) Coordination with other VA elements and other Federal, State, and local programs. Implementation of programs of independent living services and assistance will generally require extensive coordination with other VA and non-VA programs. If appropriate arrangements cannot be made to provide these services through VA, other governmental, private nonprofit and for-profit agencies and facilities may be used to secure necessary services if the requirements contained in § 21.294 are met.

        § 21.162   Participation in a program of independent living services.

#### § § 21.162

        (a)  A program of independent living services and assistance is approved when:

        (1) The VA determines that achievement of a vocational goal is not currently reasonably feasible;

        (2) The VA determines that the veteran's independence in daily living can be improved, and the gains made can reasonably be expected to continue following completion of the program;

        (3) All steps required by §§ 21.90 and 21.92 of this part for the development and preparation of an Individualized Independent Living Plan (IILP) have been completed; and

        (4) The Veteran Readiness and Employment (VR&E) Officer concurs in the IILP.

        (b)  The VR&E Officer will consider the following factors in administering programs providing independent living services:

        (1) If VA resources available limit the number of veterans who may be provided a program of independent living services and assistance, the first priority shall be given to veterans for whom the reasonable feasibility of achieving a vocational goal is precluded solely as a result of service-connected disability; and

        (2) To the maximum extent feasible, a substantial portion of veterans provided with programs of independent living services and assistance shall be receiving long-term care in VA medical centers and nursing homes.

      Case Status

        § 21.180   Case status system.

#### § § 21.180

        (a)  Each veteran's case will be assigned to a specific case status from the point of initial contact until all appropriate steps in the rehabilitation process have been completed. The case status system will:

        (1) Assist Veteran Readiness and Employment (VR&E) staff to fulfill its case management responsibility to provide authorized assistance to enable the veteran to successfully pursue his or her program; and

        (2) Assure program management and accountability.

        (b)  The case manager is responsible for assigning a case to the appropriate case status at each point in the rehabilitation process.

        (c)  The VR&E Officer or his or her designee will assign a case manager when the veteran's case is placed in  status. The VR&E Officer or his or her designee may assign case management responsibility for development and implementation of a rehabilitation plan authorized under Chapter 31 to a Counseling Psychologist (CP), Vocational Rehabilitation Counselor (VRC) or vocational rehabilitation specialist in the VR&E Division. The case manager assigned will, unless replaced by the VR&E Officer, continue to be responsible for case management throughout the course of the veteran's rehabilitation program. When securing medical care, treatment, and other related services, the VR&E case manager will coordinate with Veterans Health Administration (VHA) staff members who have case management responsibility for the veteran.

        (d)  The veteran will be informed in writing of changes in case status by VA which affect his or her receipt of benefits and services under Chapter 31. The letter to the veteran will include the reason for the change of case status, and other information required under provisions of § 21.420.

        (e)  The cases of veterans who are eligible for and entitled to services under Chapter 31 for whom individualized plans have been prepared will generally undergo the following changes of status:

        (1)  A veteran with an IWRP (Individualized Written Rehabilitation Plan) will generally move sequentially from  status through  status,  status,  status, and  status.

        (2)  A veteran with an IEEP (Individualized Extended Evaluation Plan) will generally move from  status through  status to  status. Once in  status there will generally be a finding which leads to development of an IWRP (paragraph (e)(1) of this section), or IILP (Individualized Independent Living Plan) (paragraph (e)(3) of this section).

        (3)  A veteran with an IILP (Individualized Independent Living Plan) will generally move from  status through  and

        (4)  (i) A veteran with an IEAP (Individualized Employment Assistance Plan) which is a part of an IWRP will move through the case statuses described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, or in some cases through the steps in paragraph (e)(2) of this section.

        (ii) A veteran for whom only employment services are provided will generally move from  through  to  status.

        (f)  A veteran found _ineligible_ for services under Chapter 31 will generally move from  to  status, to  status.

        (g)  The case manager may change the case status when:

        (1) Conditions for change specified in the status are met;

        (2) The change is not specifically precluded by the status to which change is being considered; and

        (3) The change is consistent with provisions of other applicable regulations.

        (1) Process a veteran's claim for assistance under Chapter 31 in a timely manner; and

        (2) Identify service-disabled veterans whom VA should contact individually to increase their awareness and understanding of how they may benefit from services furnished under Chapter 31.

        (b)  status. VA will assign a veteran's records to  status when either:

        (1) VA receives a formal or informal application from a veteran for services under Chapter 31; or

        (2) The Veteran Readiness and Employment (VR&E) Division:

        (i) Advises a veteran in writing of the veteran's potential eligibility for Chapter 31 services, or

        (ii) Is informed that the veteran has been advised in writing of his or her potential eligibility for Chapter 31 services by other VA elements.

        (c)  status.  status will be terminated when:

        (1) An appointment for an initial evaluation has been kept by the veteran; or

        (2) The veteran's service-connected disability is reduced to a noncompensable degree; or

        (3) The veteran's service-connected disability is severed; or

        (4) The veteran's application is invalid because of fraud or error; or

        (5) The veteran withdraws his or her claim, or otherwise indicates that no further assistance is desired.

        (d)  status. Each instance in which a veteran's case is terminated for reasons described in paragraph (c)(4) or (5) of this section shall be placed in  status.

        § 21.184   “Evaluation and planning” status.

#### § § 21.184

        (a)  The purpose of  status is to identify veterans for whom _evaluation and planning_ services are needed to:

        (1) Accomplish an initial evaluation as provided in § 21.50;

        (2) Develop an IWRP (Individualized Written Rehabilitation Plan), IEEP (Individualized Extended Evaluation Plan), IILP (Individualized Independent Living Plan) or IEAP (Individualized Employment Assistance Plan); or

        (3) Reevaluate:

        (i) Findings made in prior initial evaluations, or

        (ii) Current or previous individualized rehabilitation plans.

        (b)  status. A veteran's records will be assigned to  status for any of the purposes specified in paragraph (a) of this section.

        (i) Completion of an initial evaluation;

        (ii) Development of an IWRP (Individualized Written Rehabilitation Plan) or other individual rehabilitation plan in those cases in which eligibility and entitlement to services provided under Chapter 31 are established; or

        (iii) Completion of reevaluation of prior findings made in initial evaluation or modification of a rehabilitation plan.

        (2)  The Veteran Readiness and Employment (VR&E) Division shall make every reasonable effort to enable the veteran to complete the evaluation and planning phase of the rehabilitation process. A determination that every reasonable effort by VA has been made, and that little likelihood exists that continued efforts will lead to completion of planning and evaluation, may be made under the following conditions:

        (i) The veteran writes VA and requests that his or her case be inactivated;

        (ii) The veteran fails to keep scheduled appointments following his or her initial appointment; or

        (iii) The veteran otherwise fails to cooperate with VA in the evaluation and planning process. If the veteran fails to cooperate, the provisions of § 21.362 are applicable.

        § 21.186   “Ineligible” status.

#### § § 21.186

        (a)  The purpose of  status is to identify the cases in which a veteran requests services under Chapter 31, but the request is denied by VA, usually, on the basis of information developed when the veteran was in  status.

        (b)  status. A veteran's case will be assigned to  status following a finding by VA that the veteran is not eligible for or entitled to services under Chapter 31. The finding must preclude all possible Chapter 31 services.

        (c)  status. The assignment of the veteran's case to  status should be terminated if the veteran thereafter becomes eligible to receive any Chapter 31 service. Placement of the case in  status is a bar to reconsideration of eligibility unless a material change in circumstances occurs.

        (i) Fails to report and does not respond to followup contact by the case manager;

        (ii) Declines or refuses to enter the program; or

        (iii) Defers induction for a period exceeding 30 days beyond the scheduled date of induction, except where the deferment is due to illness or other sufficient reason;

        (2) VA determines the reasonable feasibility of a vocational goal for the veteran before completion of all of the planned evaluation because the decision does not require the further evaluation;

        (3) The veteran completes the extended evaluation;

        (4) Either the veteran or VA interrupts the extended evaluation;

        (5) Either the veteran or VA discontinues the extended evaluation; or

        (a)  The purpose of  status is to recognize that a variety of situations may arise in the course of a rehabilitation program in which a temporary suspension of the program is warranted. In each case, VA first must determine that the veteran will be able to return to a rehabilitation program or a program of employment services following the resolution of the situation causing the interruption. This determination will be documented in the veteran's record.

        (b)  A veteran's case will be assigned to  status when:

        (1) VA determines that a suspension of services being provided is necessary; and

        (2) Either:

        (i) A definite date for resumption of the program is established; or

        (ii) The evidence indicates the veteran will be able to resume the program at some future date, which can be approximately established.

        (c)  A veteran's case may be _interrupted_ and assigned to  status for reasons including but not limited to the following:

        (1)  If a veteran does not begin or continue the rehabilitation process, the veteran's case will be _interrupted_ and assigned to  status, including:

        (i) A case in  status;

        (ii) A case in  status;

        (iii) A case in  status;

        (iv) A case in  status; or

        (v) A case in  status.

        (2)  If a veteran's conduct or cooperation becomes unsatisfactory, services and assistance may be interrupted as determined under provisions of §§ 21.362 and 21.364.

        (3)  The veteran cannot continue the program because the necessary training and rehabilitation services are unavailable.

        (4)  A veteran's case shall be assigned to  status prior to discontinuance and assignment to  status in all cases except as provided in § 21.182(d) and upon the veteran's death. The purpose of assignment to  status is to assure that all appropriate actions have been taken to help the veteran continue in his or her program before discontinuing benefits and services.

        (5)  The veteran is not entitled to be placed on authorized absence under §§ 21.340 through 21.350 while in interrupted status.

        (d)  status. (1) A veteran in  status may be assigned to his or her prior status or other appropriate status, if he or she reports for entrance or reentrance into the prescribed program at the time and place scheduled for the resumption of the rehabilitation program.

        (2) If a veteran in  status fails to report for entrance or reentrance into the program at the appointed time and place, the veteran's case will remain in  status. The case manager will then determine whether there is a satisfactory reason for the veteran's failure to enter a new or reenter the prior program. If the evidence of record does not establish a satisfactory reason, the veteran's case will be _discontinued_ and assigned to  status.

        (e)  The case manager shall maintain contact with the veteran during  and shall arrange for appropriate medical or other services the veteran needs to be able to enter or reenter a rehabilitation program or a program of employment services.

        § 21.198   “Discontinued” status.

#### § § 21.198

        (a)  The purpose of  status is to identify situations in which termination of all services and benefits received under Chapter 31 is necessary.

        (b)  VA will discontinue the veteran's case and assign the case to  status following assignment to  status as provided in § 21.197 for reasons including but not limited to the following:

        (1)  If a veteran does not initiate or continue the rehabilitation process and does not furnish an acceptable reason for his or her failure to do so following assignment to  status, the veteran's case will be _discontinued_ and assigned to  status. This includes:

        (i) A case in  status;

        (ii) A case in  status;

        (iii) A case in  status;

        (iv) A case in  status;

        (v) A case in  status;

        (vi) A case in  status; or

        (vii) A case in  status;

        (2)  When a veteran's conduct or cooperation becomes unsatisfactory, services and assistance may be _discontinued_ and assigned to  status as determined under provisions of §§ 21.362 and 21.364.

        (3)  Unless the veteran desires employment assistance, the veteran's case will be _discontinued_ and assigned to  status when:

        (i) The veteran reaches the basic twelve-year termination date, and there is no basis for extension; or

        (ii) The veteran has used 48 months of entitlement under one or more VA programs, and there is no basis for extension of entitlement.

        (4)  A veteran's case will be _discontinued_ and assigned to  status when:

        (i) The veteran will be unable to participate in a rehabilitation program because of a serious physical or emotional problem for an extended period; and

        (ii) VA medical staff are unable to estimate an approximate date by which the veteran will be able to begin or return to the program.

        (5)  Veteran voluntarily withdraws from the program.

        (6)  The veteran's case will be _discontinued_ and assigned to  status if his or her failure to progress in a program is due to:

        (i) Continuing lack of application by the veteran unrelated to any personal or other problems; or

        (ii) Inability of the veteran to benefit from rehabilitation services despite the best efforts of VA and the veteran.

        (7)  The Veteran Readiness and Employment (VR&E) Officer shall review each case in which discontinuance is being considered for a veteran with a service-connected disability rated 50 percent or more disabling. The VR&E Officer may utilize existing resources to assist in the review, including referral to the Vocational Rehabilitation Panel (VRP).

        (c)  Except as noted in paragraph (c)(3) of this section assignment of the veteran's case to the same status from which the veteran was discontinued or to a different one requires that VA first find:

        (1) The reason for the discontinuance has been removed; and

        (2) VA has redetermined his or her eligibility and entitlement under Chapter 31.

        (3) In addition to the criteria described in paragraphs (c) (1) and (2) of this section a veteran placed into  status as a result of a finding of unsatisfactory conduct or cooperation under §§ 21.362 and 21.364 must also meet the requirements for reentrance into a rehabilitation program found in § 21.364.

        (d)  VA shall establish appropriate procedures to follow up on cases which have been placed in  status, except in those cases reassigned from  status. The purpose of such followup is to determine if:

        (1) The reasons for discontinuance may have been removed, and reconsideration of eligibility and entitlement is possible; or

        (2) The veteran is employed, and criteria for assignment to  status are met.

      Supplies

        § 21.210   Supplies.

#### § § 21.210

        (a)  Supplies are furnished to enable a veteran to pursue rehabilitation and achieve the goals of his or her program.

        (b)  The term  includes books, tools, and other _supplies_ and equipment which VA determines are necessary for the veteran's rehabilitation program.

        (c)  Supplies may be furnished during:

        (1) Extended evaluation;

        (2) Rehabilitation to the point of employability;

        (3) Employment services; and

        (4) An independent living services program.

        (d)  Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (c) of this section, supplies may not be furnished to a veteran who has elected, or is in receipt of, payment at the educational assistance rate paid under Chapter 34.

        § 21.212   General policy in furnishing supplies during periods of rehabilitation.

#### § § 21.212

        (a)  A veteran will be furnished supplies that are necessary for a program of rehabilitation services. For example, a veteran training in a school will be furnished the supplies needed to pursue the school course. If additional supplies are subsequently needed to secure employment, they will be furnished during the period of employment services as provided in § 21.214(d).

        (b)  Subject to the provisions of §§ 21.210 through 21.220, VA will authorize only those supplies which are required:

        (1) To be used by similarly circumstanced non-disabled persons in the same training or employment situation;

        (2) To mitigate or compensate for the effects of the veteran's disability while he or she is being evaluated, trained or assisted in gaining employment; or

        (3) To allow the veteran to function more independently and thereby lessen his or her dependence on others for assistance.

        (c)  Supplies should generally be authorized subsequent to the date of enrollment in training or beginning date of other rehabilitation services unless there are compelling reasons to authorize them earlier. Supplies may not be authorized earlier than the date the veteran's rehabilitation plan is approved by VA and the veteran is accepted by the facility or individual providing services.

        (d)  VA may determine that an item, such as a calculator, while not required by the school for the pursuit of a particular school subject, is nevertheless necessary for the veteran to successfully pursue his or her program under the provisions of § 21.156 pertaining to incidental goods and services. The item may be authorized if:

        (1) It is generally owned and used by students pursuing the course; and

        (2) Students who do not have the item would be placed at a distinct disadvantage in pursuing the course.

        (e)  The amount of supplies that VA may authorize for special projects, including theses, may not exceed the amount generally needed by similarly circumstanced nonveterans in meeting course or thesis requirements.

        (f)  The case manager is responsible for the authorization of supplies, subject to requirements for prior approval contained in § 21.258 and other instructions governing payment of program charges.

        § 21.214   Furnishing supplies for special programs.

#### § § 21.214

        (a)  A veteran pursuing one of the following types of vocational rehabilitation programs is eligible for any types of supplies listed in § 21.212. The following paragraphs clarify the applicability of the general provisions of § 21.212 to these special situations.

        (b)  VA may furnish to veterans training in the home:

        (1) Books, tools, and supplies which schools or training establishments that train individuals outside the home for the objective the veteran is pursuing at home ordinarily require all students and trainees to personally possess;

        (2) Supplies and equipment which are essential to the prescribed course of training because the veteran is pursuing the course at home. Equipment in this category consists of items which ordinarily are not required by a school or training establishment;

        (3) Special equipment, such as a vise or drafting table;

        (4) Supplies needed to enable the veteran to function more independently in his or her home and community.

        (c)  The books and related training supplies which VA may furnish a veteran in farm cooperative training depend upon the type of instruction he or she is receiving:

        (1) When organized, group instruction is part of a veteran's course, VA will furnish those books and supplies which the school requires all students in the school portion of the course to own personally or on a rental basis;

        (2) When all instruction is given on the veteran's farm by an individual instructor, VA will furnish to a student only those textbooks and other supplies which would ordinarily be required by a school.

        (d)  A veteran being furnished employment services may receive supplies which:

        (1) The employer requires similarly circumstanced nonveterans to own upon beginning employment to the extent that the items were not furnished during the period in which the veteran was training for the objective, or the items that were furnished for training purposes are not adequate for employment;

        (2) VA determines that special equipment is necessary for the veteran to perform his or her duties, subject to the obligation of the employer to make reasonable accommodation to the disabling effects of the veteran's condition.

        (e)  The supplies and related assistance which may be furnished, subject to the requirements prescribed under §§ 21.257 and 21.258, to a veteran for whom self-employment has been approved as the occupational objective, are generally limited to those necessary to begin operations:

        (1) Minimum stocks of materials, e.g., inventory of saleable merchandise or goods, expendable items required for day-to-day operations, and items which are consumed on the premises;

        (2) Essential equipment, including machinery, occupational fixtures, accessories, and appliances; and

        (3) Other related assistance such as business license fees.

        (f)  VA may not authorize assistance for:

        (1) Purchase of, or part payment for, land and buildings;

        (2) Making full or part payment of leases or rentals;

        (3) Purchase or rentals of trucks, cars, or other means of transportation;

        (4) Stocking a farm for animal husbandry operations.

        § 21.216   Special equipment.

#### § § 21.216

        (a)  Special equipment should be authorized as necessary to enable a veteran to mitigate or overcome the effects of disability in pursuing a rehabilitation program. The major types of special equipment which may be authorized include:

        (1)  This category includes items which are ordinarily used by nondisabled persons pursuing evaluation or training, modified to allow for use by disabled persons. e.g., calculators with speech capability for blinded persons.

        (2)  This category includes items which are specifically designed to mitigate or overcome the effects of disability. They range from eyeglasses and hearing aids to closed-circuit TV systems which amplify reading material for veterans with severe visual impairments.

        (3)  This category includes adaptations of environment not generally associated with education and training, such as adaptive equipment for automobiles or supplies necessary to modify a veteran's home to make either training or self-employment possible.

        (b)  In any case in which the veteran needs special equipment and is eligible for such equipment under other VA programs, such as medical care and treatment at VA medical centers, the items will be secured under that program. The veteran must be found ineligible for needed special equipment under other programs and benefits administered by VA before the item may be authorized under Chapter 31.

        § 21.218   Methods of furnishing supplies.

#### § § 21.218

        (a)  VA will make arrangements for the school or other facility furnishing a veteran training, rehabilitation assistance, or employment under Chapter 31 to provide supplies to the extent practicable. This method is the one most likely to assure that supplies are available and can be secured expeditiously. A facility may be considered to be furnishing supplies when the facility itself is the supplier, or the facility has designated a supplier. Prior authorization of supplies by the case manager is required, except for standard sets of books, tools, or supplies which the facility requires all trainees or employees to have.

        (b)  VA will issue authorized supplies directly to the veteran, if the supplies are not furnished by the facility providing training, rehabilitation services, or employment.

        § 21.219   Supplies consisting of clothing, magazines and periodicals, and items which may be personally used by the veteran.

#### § § 21.219

        (a)  Protective articles or apparel worn in place of ordinary clothing will be furnished at VA expense, when the school or training establishment requires similarly circumstanced nonveterans to use the articles of apparel. No other clothing will be supplied.

        (b)  Appropriate past issues of magazines, periodicals, or reprints may be furnished in the same manner as text material, when relevant to the course or training.

        (c)  Musical instruments, cameras, or other items which could be used personally by the veteran may only be furnished if required by the facility to meet requirements for degree or course completion.

        § 21.220   Replacement of supplies.

#### § § 21.220

        (a)  VA will replace articles which are necessary to further pursuit of the veteran's program and which are lost, stolen, misplaced, or damaged beyond repair through no fault of the veteran;

        (1) VA will make an advancement from the Vocational Rehabilitation Revolving Fund to a veteran to replace articles for which VA will not pay, if the veteran is without funds to pay for them;

        (2) If a veteran refuses to replace an article indispensable to the program after VA determines that its loss or damage was his or her fault, the veteran's refusal may be considered as noncooperation under § 21.364;

        (3) If the veteran's program is discontinued under provisions of § 21.364(b), he or she will be reentered into the program only when he or she replaces the necessary articles.

        (b)  VA will not generally reimburse a veteran who personally buys supplies. VA may pay for the required supplies which a training facility or other vendor sells to a veteran, if the facility chooses to return to the veteran the amounts he or she paid, so that the charges stand as an unpaid obligation of VA to the facility. If the facility does not agree to such an arrangement, VA may still pay the veteran, if the facts and equities of the case are demonstrated.

        (c)  Except as provided in paragraph (a) of this section, VA will generally furnish any nonconsumable supplies only one time, even though the same supplies may be required for use by the veteran in another subject or in another quarter, semester, or school year.

        § 21.224   Prevention of abuse.

#### § § 21.224

        Supplies are to be furnished under the most careful checks by the case manager as to what is needed by the veteran to pursue his or her program. Determinations of the supplies needed to enable the veteran to successfully pursue his or her rehabilitation program are made under the provisions of §§ 21.210 through 21.220.

      Medical and Related Services

        § 21.240   Medical treatment, care and services.

#### § § 21.240

        (a)  A Chapter 31 participant shall be furnished medical treatment, care and services which VA determines are necessary to develop, carry out and complete the veteran's rehabilitation plan. The provision of such services is a part of the veteran's entitlement to benefits and services under Chapter 31, and is limited to the period or periods in which the veteran is a Chapter 31 participant.

        (b)  The services which may be furnished under Chapter 31 include the treatment, care and services described in part 17 of this title. In addition the following services may be authorized under Chapter 31 even if not included or described in part 17:

        (1) Prosthetic appliances, eyeglasses, and other corrective or assistive devices;

        (2) Services to a veteran's family as necessary for the effective rehabilitation of the veteran;

        (ii) Orientation, adjustment, mobility and related services;

        (iii) Telecommunications, sensory and other technical aids and devices.

        (c)  A veteran is eligible for the services described in paragraph (b) of this section during periods in which he or she is considered a Chapter 31 participant. These periods include:

        (1) Initial evaluation;

        (2) Extended evaluation;

        (3) Rehabilitation to the point of employability;

        (4) Independent living services program;

        (5) Employment services; and

        (6) Other periods to the extent that services are needed to begin or continue in any of the statutes described in paragraphs (c)(1) through (5) of this section. Such periods include but are not limited to services needed to facilitate reentry into rehabilitation following:

        (i) Interruption; or

        (ii) Discontinuance because of illness or injury.

        § 21.242   Resources for provision of treatment, care and services.

#### § § 21.242

        (a)  VA medical centers are the primary resources for the provision of medical treatment, care and services for Chapter 31 participants which may be authorized under the provisions of § 21.240. The availability of necessary services in VA facilities shall be ascertained in each case.

        (b)  Hospital care and medical services provided under Chapter 31 shall only be furnished in facilities over which VA has direct jurisdiction, except as authorized on a contract or fee basis under the provisions of part 17 of this title.

      Employment Services

        § 21.250   Overview of employment services.

#### § § 21.250

        (a)  Employment services shall be provided if:

        (1) Eligibility for employment services exists;

        (2) The employment services which are needed have been identified; and

        (3) The services which have been identified are incorporated in the veteran's IWRP (Individualized Written Rehabilitation Plan) or IEAP (Individualized Employment Assistance Plan).

        (b)  (1) The term  includes the counseling, medical, social, and other placement and postplacement services provided to a veteran under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 31 to assist the veteran in obtaining or maintaining suitable employment. The term  is used only if the veteran's eligibility under Chapter 31 is limited to employment services.

        (2) The term  means a comprehensive professional service to assist the individual veteran to actually obtain a suitable job, and not simply the solicitation of jobs on behalf of the veteran. Continuing and mutually beneficial relationships with employers should be established by VA staff through referral of suitable employees and supportive services (e.g., adjustment counseling and job modification). Job development activities by VA staff are intended to provide disabled workers with a chance for suitable employment with cooperating employers.

        (3) The term  means the veteran is able to secure and maintain employment in the competitive labor market or in a sheltered workshop or other special situation at the minimum wage.

        (c)  (1) A veteran's eligibility for employment services shall be determined under the provisions of § 21.47;

        (2) The duration of the period of employment services is determined under provisions of § 21.73;

        (3) An IEAP (Individualized Employment Assistance Plan) shall be prepared under provisions of § 21.88;

        (4) A veteran shall be placed in and removed from “Employment Assistance Status” under provisions of § 21.194.

        (v) The services of any other public, or nonprofit organization having placement services available; and

        (vi) Any for-profit agency in a case in which it has been determined that comparable services are not available through public and nonprofit agencies and comparable services cannot be provided cost-effectively by the public and nonprofit agencies listed in this paragraph.

        (b)  As funding permits, VA employees engaged in the administration of Chapter 31 will promote the establishment of employment, training, and related opportunities to accomplish the purposes described in § 21.1.

        (c)  VA shall take reasonable steps to ensure that a veteran being provided employment services receives the benefit of any applicable provision of law or regulation providing for special consideration or emphasis or preference of the veteran in employment or training, especially programs and activities identified in the preceding paragraphs of this section.

        (d)  VA employees providing assistance to Chapter 31 participants shall coordinate their job development, placement, promotional, and advocacy activities with similar or related activities of:

        (1) The Department of Labor and State employment security agencies as provided by written agreement or other arrangement;

        (2) The State approving agencies:

        (3) Other public, for-profit and nonprofit agencies providing employment and related services.

        § 21.254   Supportive services.

#### § § 21.254

        (a)  Supportive services which may be provided during a period or program of employment services include a broad range of medical treatment, care and services, supplies, license and other fees, special services, including services to the blind and deaf, transportation assistance, services to the veteran's family, and other appropriate services, subject to the limitations provided in VA regulations governing the provisions of these services under Chapter 31.

        (b)  The following benefits may not be provided to the veteran by VA during a period or program of employment services:

        (1) Subsistence allowance, or payment of an allowance at the educational assistance rate paid under Chapter 30 for similar training;

        (2) Education and training services, other than brief courses, such as review courses necessary for licensure;

        (3) Revolving Fund Loan; and

        (4) Work-study allowance.

        (c)  An individual with service-connected disability(ies) who has trained for self-employment under a State rehabilitation agency may be provided supplemental equipment and initial stocks and supplies similar to the materials supplied under 38 U.S.C. chapter 31 to individuals with the most severe service-connected disability(ies) who require self-employment as defined in § 21.257(b) if VA determines that the following conditions are met:

        (1) The individual is eligible for employment assistance under the provisions of § 21.47;

        (2) Evidence of record indicates that the individual has successfully completed training for a self-employment program under a State rehabilitation agency;

        (3) No other non-VA sources of assistance are known to be available for the individual to complete his or her self-employment program; and

        (4) The individual meets the requirements of the definition in § 21.257(b).

        § 21.256   Incentives for employers.

#### § § 21.256

        (a)  VA may make payments to employers to enable a veteran who has been rehabilitated to employability to begin and maintain employment or to provide on-job training. The purpose of such payment is to facilitate the placement of veterans who are generally qualified for employment but may lack some specific training or work experience which the employer requires or who are difficult to place due to their disability. The specific conditions which must be met before this option may be considered are contained in paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section.

        (b)  Payments may be made to employers to provide on-job training or to begin and maintain employment if all of the following conditions are met:

        (1) The veteran is in need of an on-job training situation or is generally qualified for employment but such on-job situation or employment opportunity is not otherwise available despite repeated and intensive efforts on the part of VA and the veteran to secure such opportunities.

        (b)  Subject to paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, an individual may be inducted into a rehabilitation program on a retroactive basis. If the individual is retroactively inducted, VA may authorize payment pursuant to § 21.262 or § 21.264 for tuition, fees, and other verifiable expenses that an individual paid or incurred consistent with the approved rehabilitation program. In addition, VA may authorize payment of subsistence allowance pursuant to §§ 21.260, 21.266, and 21.270 for the period of retroactive induction, except for any period during which the individual was on active duty.

        (c)  Retroactive induction into a rehabilitation program may be authorized for a past period under a claim for vocational rehabilitation benefits when all of the following conditions are met:

        (1) The past period is within—

        (3) The individual met the criteria for entitlement to vocational rehabilitation benefits and services under 38 U.S.C. chapter 31 in effect during the period.

        (4) VA determines that the individual's training and other rehabilitation services received during the period were reasonably needed to achieve the goals and objectives identified for the individual and may be included in the plan developed for the individual ( §§ 21.80 through 21.88, and §§ 21.92 through 21.96).

        (5) VA has recouped any benefits that it paid the individual for education or training pursued under any VA education program during any portion of the period.

        (6) An initial evaluation was completed under § 21.50.

        (7) A period of extended evaluation is not needed to be able to determine the reasonable feasibility of the achievement of a vocational goal.

        (d)  The effective date for retroactive induction is the date when all the entitlement conditions set forth in paragraph (c) of this section are met, and for a veteran (except as to a period prior to discharge from active duty) in no event before the effective date of a VA rating under 38 U.S.C. chapter 11 establishing a qualifying level under § 21.40 of service-connected disability.

        (ii) Achievement of employment consistent with the veterans's aptitudes, interests, and abilities will be enhanced by the completion of the additional education or training.

        (d)  A veteran under a rehabilitation plan who obtains employment without being declared rehabilitated to the point of employability as contemplated by the plan, including a veteran in a rehabilitation program consisting solely of employment services, is considered to be rehabilitated if the following conditions exist:

        (1) The veteran obtains and retains employment substantially using the services and assistance provided under the plan for rehabilitation.

        (2) The employment obtained is consistent with the veterans's abilities, aptitudes and interests.

        (3) Maximum services feasible to assist the veteran to retain the employment obtained have been provided.

        (4) The veteran has maintained the employment for at least 60 continuous days.

        (e)  A veteran who has pursued a program of independent living services will be considered rehabilitated when all goals of the program have been achieved, or if not achieved, when:

        (1) The veteran, nevertheless, has attained a substantial increase in the level of independence with the program assistance provided;

        (2) The veteran has maintained the increased level of independence for at least 60 days; and

        (3) Further assistance is unlikely to significantly increase the veteran's level of independence.

        (1) The veteran has a compensable service-connected disability and either;

        (2) Current facts, including any relevant medical findings, establish that the veteran's service-connected disability has worsened to the extent that the effects of the service-connected disability considered in relation to other facts precludes him or her from performing the duties of the occupation for which the veteran previously was found rehabilitated; or

        (3) The occupation for which the veteran previously was found rehabilitated under Chapter 31 is found to be unsuitable on the basis of the veteran's specific employment handicap and capabilities.

        (i) The veteran's condition has worsened and as a result the veteran has sustained a substantial loss of independence; or

        (ii) Other changes in the veteran's circumstances have caused a substantial loss of independence; and

        (2) The provisions of § 21.162 pertaining to participation in a program of independent living services are met.

        (1) The conditions for setting aside a finding of rehabilitation under paragraph (a) of this section are found;

        (2) The rehabilitation services originally given to the veteran are now inadequate to make the veteran employable in the occupation for which he or she pursued rehabilitation;

        (3) Experience during the period of employment services has demonstrated that employment in the objective or field for which the veteran was rehabilitated to the point of employability should not reasonably have been expected at the time the program was originally developed; or

        (4) The veteran, because of technological change which occurred subsequent to the declaration of rehabilitation to the point of employability, is no longer able:

        (i) To perform the duties of the occupation for which he or she trained, or in a related occupation; or

        § 21.294   Selecting the training or rehabilitation facility.

#### § § 21.294

        (a)  In addition to approval of the courses offered, all facilities which provide training and rehabilitation services under Chapter 31 must meet the criteria contained in §§ 21.290 through 21.299 applicable to the type of facility. Each facility must:

        (1) Have space, equipment, instructional material and instructor personnel adequate in kind, quality, and amount to provide the desired service for the veteran;

        (2) Fully accept the obligation to give the training or rehabilitation services in all parts of the plan which call for the facility's participation;

        (3) Provide courses or services which:

        (i) Meet the customary requirements in the locality for employment in the occupation in which training is given when employment is the objective of the program; and

        (ii) Meet the requirements for licensure or permit to practice the occupation, if such is required;

        (4) Agree:

        (i) To cooperate with VA, and

        (ii) To provide timely and accurate information covering the veteran's attendance, performance, and progress in training in the manner prescribed by VA.

        (b)  (1) Facilities offering independent living services will be utilized to:

        (i) Evaluate independent living potential;

        (ii) Provide a program of independent living services to veterans for whom an IILP (Individualized Independent Living Plan) has been developed; or

        (iii) Provide independent living services to veterans as part of an IWRP (Individualized Written Rehabilitation Plan) or an IEEP (Individualized Extended Evaluation Plan).

        (2) VA may use public and nonprofit agencies and facilities to furnish independent living services. Public and nonprofit facilities may be:

        (i) Veterans Health Administration (VHA) facilities that provide independent living services;

        (ii) Facilities which meet standards established by the State rehabilitation agency for rehabilitation facilities or for providers of independent living services;

        (iii) Facilities which are neither approved nor disapproved by the State rehabilitation agency, but are determined by VA as able to provide the services necessary in an individual veteran's case.

        (3) VA also may use for-profit agencies and organizations to furnish programs of independent living services only if services comparable in effectiveness to those provided by for-profit agencies and organizations:

        (i) Are not available through public or nonprofit agencies or VHA; or

        (ii) Cannot be obtained cost-effectively from public or nonprofit agencies or VHA.

        (4) In addition to the criteria described in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section for public and private nonprofit agencies; for-profit agencies and organizations must meet any additional standards established by local, state (including the State rehabilitation agency), and Federal agencies which are applicable to for-profit facilities and agencies offering independent living services.

        (c)  VA policy shall be to use VA facilities, if available, to provide rehabilitation services for veterans in a rehabilitation program under chapter 31. Non-VA facilities may be used to provide rehabilitation services only when necessary services are not readily available at a VHA facility. This policy shall be implemented in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section in the case of the use of for-profit facilities to provide programs of independent living services, or in the case of employment services, provision of such services by non-VA sources is permitted under § 21.252.

Selection of a training or rehabilitation facility owned by the veteran or a relative, or in which the veteran or a relative of the veteran has an interest is precluded, except for selection of a farm as provided in § 21.298. The term relative has the same meaning as in § 21.374.

        (f)  The Department of Veterans Affairs will negotiate formal contracts for reimbursement to providers of services as required by § 21.262. However, a letter contract will be effected immediately to permit the induction of the veteran into a program if:

        (1) The veteran is immediately entered into a school with which a contract is required;

        (2) The veteran's rehabilitation plan will be jeopardized by withholding services until a contract can be completed; and

        (3) There are no known reasons to indicate that a contract may not be completed in a reasonable time.

        (g)  VA may only use those facilities and courses outside the United States to provide training under Chapter 31 which meet requirements for approval under §§ 21.4250(c) and 21.4260. The conditions under which training outside the United States may be approved are contained in § 21.130.

        (h)  Flight training may only be provided in educational institutions which offer a standard college degree. The specific conditions under which flight training may be approved are contained in § 21.134.

        (i)  The case manager will consider the veteran's preference for a particular training or rehabilitation facility but VA has final responsibility for selection of the facility.

        (10) Agree to furnish VA a statement in writing showing wages, compensation, and other income paid directly or indirectly to each veteran in training under Chapter 31 during the month.

        (b)  A subminimum hourly wage rate for handicapped workers may be considered where necessary in order to prevent curtailment of opportunities for employment. Payment at the subminimum rate must be approved by the Wage and Hour Division of the Department of Labor.

      Rate of Pursuit

        § 21.310   Rate of pursuit of a rehabilitation program.

#### § § 21.310

        (a)  This section provides policy for determining the full-time and part-time rate of pursuit of a rehabilitation program by a veteran whose ability to pursue a program has not been reduced by the effects of disability.

        (1)  VA will measure the full-time and part-time rate of pursuit of training offered at educational institutions according to the criteria found in §§ 21.4270 through 21.4275, except as provided in paragraphs (a) (2) and (3) of this section.

        (2)  (i) For certain seriously disabled veterans described in subdivision (i)(A) of this subparagraph VA may measure the veteran's enrollment:

        (A) In an independent study course as half-time or greater training, or

        (B) Both in independent study subjects and subjects requiring class attendance on the basis of the combined training load when the number of credit hours of independent study equals or exceeds the number of other credit hours.

        (ii) To qualify for measurement described in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section:

        (A) The seriously disabled veteran must have a disability or circumstances which preclude regular attendance at an institution of higher learning, and

        (B) Independent study must be a sound method for providing the training necessary for restoring the veteran's employability.

        (iii) In all other cases VA will measure independent study according to the provisions of § 21.4280.

        (3)  If training is pursued in a special school, such as those for persons with visual or hearing disabilities, the rate of pursuit will be measured under §§ 21.2470 through 21.4275 unless it is the established policy of the school to measure the rate of pursuit for full-time or particular level or part-time training based upon fewer semester, credit, or clock hours of attendance than prescribed in these regulations.

        (4)  If training in a farm cooperative program is provided by an educational institution, the rate of pursuit shall be determined the same as under § 21.4270 for that type of training.

        (5)  When a school or other entity furnishes all or part of a vocational rehabilitation program under contact with another school, VA will measure the course or courses as appropriate for the school or other entity actually providing the training.

        (b)  The following types of training which are not furnished by an educational institution (§ 21.35(k)(3) may only be pursued full-time:

        (1)  Full-time training in an on-job program is the lesser of the number of hours in the prevailing workweek for:

        (i) Journeyman employees in the same job categories at the establishment where training is being provided;

        (ii) Other persons in on-job training for the same or similar occupations at the facility where the veteran is training or at other facilities in the locality.

        (2)  If training in a farm cooperative program is provided by an individual instructor, the full-time rate of pursuit must meet the requirements of § 21.126.

        (3)  The full-time rate of pursuit for a veteran in an independent instructor program must meet the requirements of § 21.146.

        (4)  The full-time rate for a training program provided in the veteran's home must meet the requirements of § 21.146.

        (5)  A vocational course of training offered by a rehabilitation facility or sheltered workshop (§ 21.35(k) (5) and (6)), will be measured under provisions of § 21.4270(b) for trade or technical nonaccredited courses, unless it is the established policy of the facility to measure the rate of pursuit for full-time or a particular level of part-time training based upon fewer clock hours of attendance than provided in that regulation.

        (c)  The rate of pursuit of a program which combines institutional training and on job training will be measured as follows:

        (1) The institutional part will be assessed under §§ 21.4270 through 21.4275, and

        (2) The on-the-job part will be assessed under paragraph (b)(1) of this section.

        (d)  Measurement of the rate of pursuit for veterans in programs consisting primarily of services designed to evaluate and improve physical and psychological functioning will be assessed under this paragraph.

        (1) The services assessed under this paragraph include:

        (i) Evaluation and improvement of the rehabilitation potential of a veteran for whom attainment of a vocational goal is reasonably feasible;

        (ii) Extended evaluation to determine whether attainment of a vocational goal is reasonably feasible; or

        (iii) A program of independent living services to enable a veteran to function more independently in his or her family and community when attainment of a vocational goal is not reasonably feasible.

        (2) Measurement of the rate of pursuit for services and programs named in paragraph (d)(1) of this section will be:

        (i) As provided in paragraph (a) of this section for services furnished by educational institutions; or

        (ii) According to the noneducational facility's customary criteria for full-time and part-time pursuit. If the facility does not have established criteria for full-time and part-time pursuit, or services are being provided by more than one facility, the rate of pursuit will be assessed in the following manner:

        § 21.312   Reduced work tolerance.

#### § § 21.312

        (a)  VA will consider that a veteran with reduced work tolerance is pursuing a rehabilitation program full-time when the amount of time the veteran is devoting to his or her program is as great as the effects of his or her disability (service and nonservice-connected) will permit.

        (b)  A veteran with reduced work tolerance may pursue a rehabilitation program when the following conditions are met:

        (1) Reduced work tolerance has been determined.

        (2) Achievement of the goals of the program are reasonably feasible;

        (3) The IWRP (Individualized Written Rehabilitation Plan) or other plan provides for completion of the program under Chapter 31.

        (c)  As necessary, but not less than once yearly, the veteran's work tolerance will be reevaluated. The rate of pursuit required to meet the standard of full-time pursuit will be modified if there is either an increase or decrease in the work tolerance of the veteran.

        (d)  A veteran with a reduced work tolerance will be paid a subsistence allowance, at the full-time rate for the type of program being pursued, when the veteran meets the standard for full-time pursuit established for him or her in the Plan. A veteran with reduced work tolerance, who elects benefits at the Chapter 34 rate, will have to meet normal attendance requirements for that chapter, however.

        (e)  A VA physician will make all determinations and redeterminations of work tolerance.

        § 21.314   Pursuit of training under special conditions.

#### § § 21.314

        A veteran is required to pursue a rehabilitation program at a rate which meets the requirement for full- or part-time participation described in §§ 21.310 and 21.312. However, a veteran may pursue a rehabilitation program at a lesser rate, if such pursuit is a part of the veteran's plan. Subsistence allowance is not payable during such periods.

      Authorization of Subsistence Allowance and Training and Rehabilitation Services

        § 21.320   Awards for subsistence allowance and authorization of rehabilitation services.

#### § § 21.320

        Awards providing for payment of a subsistence allowance and authorization of services necessary for rehabilitation may be prepared when an IWRP (Individualized Written Rehabilitation Plan) or other plan has been completed and other requirements for entrance or reentrance into a rehabilitation program have been met.

        (a)  The commencing date of an award of subsistence allowance will be determined under the provisions of § 21.322.

        (b)  The commencing date for authorization of training and rehabilitation services is the same as the effective date for awards for subsistence allowance under provisions of § 21.322, except when:

        (2) An earlier commencement date is established in the veteran's plan or the veteran is entitled to earlier induction under § 21.282;

        (3) The veteran elects payment at the educational assistance allowance rate, in which case the commencing date of payment is determined under provisions applicable to commencement of payment under Chapter 30.

        (c)  The ending date of an award for subsistence allowance will be the earliest of the following dates:

        (1) The ending date provided in the veteran's IWRP or other plan;

        (2) The ending date of a period of enrollment as certified by a training or rehabilitation facility;

        (3) The ending date specified in § 21.324.

        (d)  The ending date of training and rehabilitation services will be the same as the termination date for subsistence allowance under paragraph (c) of this section, except when:

        (1) The ending date for a period of employment services is determined under provisions of § 21.326;

        (2) A later termination date is established in the veteran's plan;

        (i) Result in personal hardship, or

        (ii) Adversely affect the veteran's ability to continue in his or her rehabilitation program.

        (5) The veteran is pursuing a non-college-degree course and there is a period of up to 5 days per twelve-month period during which the school offering non-college-degree courses is not operating, because instructors are attending professional meetings.

        (b)  The case manager may disapprove leave under paragraph (a)(4) of this section if:

        (1) Approval would result in or lead to use of more than 48 months of entitlement under Chapter 31, alone; or

        (2) Approval would require extension of the scheduled completion date of the veteran's program.

        (c)  A veteran, who wishes to receive subsistence allowance while the facility temporarily is not offering training under conditions other than those identified in paragraph (a) of this section, must seek an approved leave of absence and be charged leave.

        (1) Cooperate with VA staff in carrying out the initial evaluation and developing a rehabilitation plan;

        (2) Arrange a schedule which allows him or her to devote the time needed to attain the goals of the rehabilitation plan;

        § 21.364   Unsatisfactory conduct and cooperation.

#### § § 21.364

        (a)  If VA determines that a veteran has failed to maintain satisfactory conduct or cooperation, VA may, after determining that all reasonable counseling efforts have been made and are found not reasonably likely to be effective, discontinue services and assistance to the veteran, unless the case manager determines that mitigating circumstances exist. In any case in which such services and assistance have been discontinued, VA may reinstitute such services and assistance only if the Counseling Psychologist (CP) or Vocational Rehabilitation Counselor (VRC) determines that:

        (1) The unsatisfactory conduct or cooperation of such veteran will not be likely to recur; and

        (2) The rehabilitation program which the veteran proposes to pursue (whether the same or revised) is suitable to such veteran's abilities, aptitudes, and interests.

        (3) Interrupt the program to allow for more intense efforts, if the unsatisfactory conduct and cooperation persist. If a reasonable effort to remedy the situation is unsuccessful during the period in which the program is interrupted, the veteran's case will be discontinued and assigned to “discontinued” status unless mitigating circumstances are found. When mitigating circumstances exist the case may be continued in “interrupted” status until VA staff determines the veteran may be reentered into the same or a different program because the veteran's conduct and cooperation will be satisfactory, or if a plan has been developed, to enable the veteran to reenter and try to maintain satisfactory conduct and cooperation. Mitigating circumstances include:

        (i) The effects of the veteran's service and nonservice-connected condition;

        (ii) Family or financial problems which have led the veteran to unsatisfactory conduct or cooperation; or

        (iii) Other circumstances beyond the veteran's control.

        Sections 21.440 through 21.449 establish and implement the Veterans Employment Pay for Success (VEPFS) grant program, which provides grants to eligible entities to fund outcomes payments for projects that are successful in accomplishing employment rehabilitation for Veterans with service-connected disabilities. These sections apply only to the administration of the VEPFS grant program, unless specifically provided otherwise.

        § 21.441   Definitions.

#### § § 21.441

        is an eligible entity that submits an application for a VEPFS grant announced in a NOFA.

        is a public or nonprofit agency, to include institutions of higher learning.

        is the employment or earnings of a participant in an intervention group or control or comparison group during or after the service period. Improving employment outcomes means creating positive impact in terms of these outcomes, where the results for individuals that receive the intervention are better than the results for a valid control or comparison group that did not receive the intervention.

        is a service or technology that is provided to individuals and is intended to achieve certain results.

        are funds that are paid to an investor or service provider and that are released only for the achievement of outcomes, as compared to those of a control or comparison group, that meet target levels that have been agreed to in advance of the provision of intervention ( if positive impact has been created by the intervention in terms of these outcomes). When investors have provided the upfront capital for the project, these payments generally cover repayment of the principal investment and provide a modest return on investment for any associated risks of paying for the intervention upfront.

        is a multi-party agreement to deliver an innovative or evidence-based intervention intended to improve outcomes for a targeted population signed by the entities that constitute the project partnership.

        is a collaboration among entities that negotiate one or more agreements and execute a project to improve employment outcomes for Veterans with service-connected disabilities. The entities that may be involved in a project partnership include:

        (1)(i)  Entity that receives a VEPFS grant and pays for outcomes of services that meet target levels that have been agreed to in advance of the provision of the intervention.

        (ii)  Facilitates, coordinates, and executes a PFS agreement to improve employment outcomes for Veterans with service-connected disabilities. With respect to other PFS projects, project coordinators are sometimes referred to as intermediaries.

        (iii)  Independent entity that determines the impact of the services provided, including whether the services have resulted in employment outcomes that meet target levels that have been agreed to in advance of the provision of the intervention.

        (iv)  Person or entity that provides upfront capital to cover costs of providing services/delivering an intervention and other associated costs before a determination has been made as to whether certain employment outcomes have been achieved at pre-set target levels.

        (v)  Entity that delivers an intervention designed to achieve improved employment outcomes for Veterans with service-connected disabilities.

        (2) A full project partnership is a project partnership that includes an outcomes payor, evaluator, investor (if the PFS agreement involves PFS financing), and service provider. A partial project partnership includes an outcomes payor and at least one of the following: Evaluator, investor (if the PFS agreement involves PFS financing), or service provider.

        is the entity that receives a VEPFS grant under §§ 21.440 through 21.449. The recipient is also the outcomes payor.

        refers to the _Secretary_ of Veterans Affairs.

        is a disability that is “service-connected” as defined in 38 CFR 3.1.

        is a method for securing financial resources using an investment approach that focuses on achieving positive social and/or environmental impact with some form of financial return.

        constitutes results from previous studies, the designs of which can support causal conclusions ( studies with high internal validity), that include enough of the range of participants and settings to support scaling up to the state, regional, or national level ( studies with high external validity).

        has the same definition as provided in 38 CFR 3.1.

        is a PFS agreement to deliver an innovative, evidence-based intervention intended to improve Veteran employment outcomes.

        is a project with a strategy for delivering a service with a goal to significantly improve a current condition with respect to unemployment of a target Veteran population and sufficient evidence to support the theory behind the project using a financial model that includes cost savings by funding the project only if it is successful.

        is a document that articulates tasks and milestones with regard to a particular project.

        § 21.1031   VA responsibilities when a claim is filed.

#### § § 21.1031

        (a)  VA will furnish all necessary VA claim forms and instructions, and, if appropriate, a description of any supporting evidence required upon receipt of an informal claim.

        (b)  (1) Except when a claim cannot be substantiated because there is no legal basis for the claim, or undisputed facts render the claimant ineligible for the claimed benefit, when VA receives a complete or substantially complete application for educational assistance provided under subpart C, D, G, H, K, L, or P of this part VA will—

        (i) Notify the claimant of any information and evidence that is necessary to substantiate the claim; and

        (ii) Inform the claimant which information and evidence, if any, the claimant is to provide to VA and which information and evidence, if any, VA will try to obtain for the claimant.

        (2) The information and evidence that VA, pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section informs the claimant that the claimant must provide, must be provided within one year from the date of the notice. If VA does not receive such information and evidence from the claimant within that time period, VA may adjudicate the claim based on the information and evidence in the file.

        (3) If the claimant has not responded to the request within 30 days, VA may decide the claim before the expiration of the one-year period prescribed in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, based on all the information and evidence in the file, including information and evidence it has obtained on behalf of the claimant. If VA does so, however, and the claimant subsequently provides the information and evidence within one year of the date of the request, VA must readjudicate the claim. If VA's decision on a readjudication is favorable to the claimant, the award shall take effect as if the prior decision by VA on the claim had not been made.

        (4) If VA receives an incomplete application for benefits, it will notify the claimant of the information necessary to complete the application and will defer assistance until the claimant submits this information. If the information necessary to complete the application is not received by VA within one year from the date of such notice, VA cannot pay or provide any benefits based on that application.

        (5) For the purpose of this paragraph, if VA must notify the claimant, VA will provide notice to:

        (i) The claimant;

        (ii) His or her fiduciary, if any; and

        (iii) His or her representative, if any.

        § 21.1032   VA has a duty to assist claimants in obtaining evidence.

#### § § 21.1032

        (a)  (1) Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, upon receipt of a complete or substantially complete application for educational assistance under subpart C, D, G, H, K, L, or P of this part, VA will—

        (i) Make reasonable efforts to help a claimant obtain evidence necessary to substantiate the claim; and

        (ii) Give the assistance described in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section to an individual attempting to reopen a finally decided claim.

        (2) VA will not pay any fees a custodian of records may charge to provide the records VA requests.

        (b)  (1) VA will make reasonable efforts to obtain relevant records not in the custody of a Federal department or agency. These records include relevant records from:

        (i) State or local governments;

        (ii) Private medical care providers;

        (iii) Current or former employers; and

        (iv) Other non-Federal governmental sources.

        (2) The reasonable efforts described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section will generally consist of an initial request for the records and, if VA does not receive the records, at least one follow-up request. The following are exceptions to this provision concerning the number of requests that VA generally will make:

        (i) VA will not make a follow-up request if a response to the initial request indicates that the records sought do not exist or that a follow-up request for the records would be futile.

        (ii) If VA receives information showing that subsequent requests to the initial or another custodian could result in obtaining the records sought, reasonable efforts will include an initial request and, if VA does not receive the records, at least one follow-up request to the new source or an additional request to the original source.

        (3) The claimant must cooperate fully with VA's reasonable efforts to obtain relevant records from non-Federal agency or department custodians. The claimant must provide enough information to identify and locate the existing records, including—

        (i) The person, company, agency, or other custodian holding the records;

        (ii) The approximate time frame covered by the records; and

        (iii) In the case of medical treatment records, the condition for which treatment was provided.

        (4) If necessary, the claimant must authorize the release of existing records in a form acceptable to the person, company, agency, or other custodian holding the records.

        (c)  (1) VA will make as many requests as are necessary to obtain relevant records from a Federal department or agency. These records include but are not limited to:

        (i) Military records;

        (ii) Medical and other records from VA medical facilities;

        (iii) Records from non-VA facilities providing examination or treatment at VA expense; and

        (iv) Records from other Federal agencies.

        (2) VA will end its efforts to obtain records from a Federal department or agency only if VA concludes that the records sought do not exist or that further efforts to obtain those records would be futile. Cases in which VA may conclude that no further efforts are required include cases in which the Federal department or agency advises VA that the requested records do not exist or that the custodian of such records does not have them.

        (3) The claimant must cooperate fully with VA's reasonable efforts to obtain relevant records from Federal department or agency custodians. At VA's request, the claimant must provide enough information to identify and locate the existing records, including—

        (i) The custodian or agency holding the records;

        (ii) The approximate time frame covered by the records; and

        (iii) In the case of medical treatment records, the condition for which treatment was provided.

        (4) If necessary, the claimant must authorize the release of existing records in a form acceptable to the custodian or agency holding the records.

        (d)  VA will refrain from providing assistance in obtaining evidence for a claim if the substantially complete or complete application for benefits indicates that there is no reasonable possibility that any assistance VA would provide to the claimant would substantiate the claim. VA will discontinue providing assistance in obtaining evidence for a claim if the evidence obtained indicates that there is no reasonable possibility that further assistance would substantiate the claim. Circumstances in which VA will refrain from or discontinue providing assistance in obtaining evidence include, but are not limited to:

        (1) The claimant's ineligibility for the benefit sought because of lack of qualifying service, lack of veteran status, or other lack of legal eligibility;

        (2) Claims that are inherently not credible or clearly lack merit; and

        (3) An application requesting a benefit to which the claimant is not entitled as a matter of law.

        (e)  (1) VA will notify the claimant either orally or in writing when VA:

        (i) Makes reasonable efforts to obtain relevant non-Federal records, but is unable to obtain them; or

        (ii) After continued efforts to obtain Federal records, concludes that it is reasonably certain they do not exist or that further efforts to obtain them would be futile.

        (2) For non-Federal records requests, VA may provide the notice to the claimant at the same time it makes its final attempt to obtain the relevant records.

        (3) VA will make a record of any oral notice conveyed under paragraph (e) of this section to the claimant.

        (4) The notice to the claimant must contain the following information:

        (i) The identity of the records VA was unable to obtain;

        (ii) An explanation of the efforts VA made to obtain the records;

        (iii) The fact described in paragraph (e)(1)(i) or (e)(1)(ii) of this section;

        (iv) A description of any further action VA will take regarding the claim, including, but not limited to, notice that VA will decide the claim based on the evidence of record unless the claimant submits the records VA was unable to obtain; and

        (v) A notice that the claimant is ultimately responsible for obtaining the evidence.

        (5) If VA becomes aware of the existence of relevant records before deciding the claim, VA will notify the claimant of the existence of such records and ask that the claimant provide a release for the records. If the claimant does not provide any necessary release of the relevant records that VA is unable to obtain, VA will ask that the claimant obtain the records and provide them to VA.

        (6) For the purpose of this section, if VA must notify the claimant, VA will provide notice to:

        (i) The claimant;

        (ii) His or her fiduciary, if any; and

        (iii) His or her representative, if any.

        § 21.1033   Time limits.

#### § § 21.1033

        The provisions of this section are applicable to informal claims and formal claims.

        (a)  VA's failure to give a claimant or potential claimant any form or information concerning the right to file a claim or to furnish notice of the time limit for the filing of a claim will not extend the time periods allowed for these actions.

        (b) [Reserved]

        (c)  VA must receive a claim for an extended period of eligibility provided by § 21.3047, § 21.5042, § 21.7051, § 21.7551, or § 21.9535 by the later of the following dates:

        (1) One year from the date on which the spouse's, surviving spouse's, veteran's, reservist's, or other eligible individual's original period of eligibility ended; or

        (2) One year from the date on which the spouse's, surviving spouse's, veteran's, reservist's, or other eligible individual's physical or mental disability no longer prevented him or her from beginning or resuming a chosen program of education.

        (d)  VA must receive a claim for an extended period of eligibility due to a suspension of an eligible child's program of education as provided in § 21.3043 by the later of the following dates.

        (1) One year from the date on which the child's original period of eligibility ended; or

        (2) One year from the date on which the condition that caused the suspension of the program of education ceased to exist.

        (e)  (1) VA may extend for good cause a time limit within which a claimant or beneficiary is required to act to perfect a claim or challenge an adverse VA decision. VA may grant such an extension only when the following conditions are met:

        (i) When a claimant or beneficiary requests an extension after expiration of a time limit, he or she must take the required action concurrently with or before the filing of that request; and

        (ii) The claimant or beneficiary must show good cause as to why he or she could not take the required action during the original time period and could not have taken the required action sooner.

        (2) Denials of time limit extensions are separately appealable issues.

        (f)  (1) In computing the time limit for any action required of a claimant or beneficiary, including the filing of claims or evidence requested by VA, VA will exclude the first day of the specified period, and will include the last day. This rule is applicable in cases in which the time limit expires on a workday. When the time limit would expire on a Saturday, Sunday, or holiday, the VA will include the next succeeding day in the computation.

        (2) The first day of the specified period referred to in paragraph (f)(1) of this section will be the date of the letter of notification to the claimant or beneficiary for purposes of computing time limits. As to appeals, see §§ 20.203 and 20.110 of this chapter.

        § 21.1035   Legacy review of benefit claims decisions.

#### § § 21.1035

        (a) A claimant who has filed a Notice of Disagreement with a decision described in § 21.1034(a) that does not meet the criteria of § 21.1034(e) of this chapter has a right to a review under this section. The review will be conducted by the Educational Officer of the Regional Processing Officer, at VA's discretion. An individual who did not participate in the decision being reviewed will conduct this review. Only a decision that has not yet become final (by appellate decision or failure to timely appeal) may be reviewed. Review under this section will encompass only decisions with which the claimant has expressed disagreement in the Notice of Disagreement. The reviewer will consider all evidence of record and applicable law, and will give no deference to the decision being reviewed.

        (b) Unless the claimant has requested review under this section with his or her Notice of Disagreement, VA will, upon receipt of the Notice of Disagreement, notify the claimant in writing of his or her right to a review under this section. To obtain such a review, the claimant must request it not later than 60 days after the date VA mails the notice. This 60-day time limit may not be extended. If the claimant fails to request review under this section not later than 60 days after the date VA mails the notice, VA will proceed with the legacy appeal process by issuing a Statement of the Case. A claimant may not have more than one review under this section of the same decision.

        (c) The reviewer may conduct whatever development he or she considers necessary to resolve any disagreements in the Notice of Disagreement, consistent with applicable law. This may include an attempt to obtain additional evidence or the holding of an informal conference with the claimant. Upon the request of the claimant, the reviewer will conduct a hearing under the version of § 3.103(c) of this chapter predating Public Law 115-55.

        (d) A review decision made under this section will include a summary of the evidence, a citation to pertinent laws, a discussion of how those laws affect the decision, and a summary of the reasons for the decision.

        (e) The reviewer may grant a benefit sought in the claim, notwithstanding § 3.105(b) of this chapter. The reviewer may not revise the decision in a manner that is less advantageous to the claimant than the decision under review, except that the reviewer may reverse or revise (even if disadvantageous to the claimant) prior decisions of an agency of original jurisdiction (including the decision being reviewed or any prior decision that has become final due to failure to timely appeal) on the grounds of clear and unmistakable error (see § 3.105(a) of this chapter).

        (f) Review under this section does not limit the appeal rights of a claimant. Unless a claimant withdraws his or her Notice of Disagreement as a result of this review process, VA will proceed with the legacy appeal process by issuing a Statement of the Case.

        § 21.3023   Nonduplication; pension, compensation, and dependency and indemnity compensation.

#### § § 21.3023

        (a)  A child who is eligible for educational assistance and who is also eligible for pension, compensation or dependency and indemnity compensation based on school attendance must elect whether he or she will receive educational assistance or pension, compensation or dependency and indemnity compensation.

        (1) An election of educational assistance either before or after the age of 18 years is a bar to subsequent payment or increased rates or additional amounts of pension, compensation or dependency and indemnity compensation on account of the child based on school attendance on or after the age of 18 years. The bar is equally applicable where the child has eligibility from more than one parent.

        (2) Payment of pension, compensation or dependency and indemnity compensation to or on account of a child after his or her 18th birthday does not bar subsequent payments of educational assistance.

        (3) An election of educational assistance will not preclude the allowance of pension, compensation, or dependency and indemnity compensation based on school attendance for periods, including vacation periods, prior to the commencement of educational assistance.

        (b)  Educational assistance allowance or special restorative training allowance may generally be paid concurrently with pension, compensation or dependency and indemnity compensation for a child under the age of 18 years or for a helpless child based on the service of one or more parents. Where, however, entitlement is based on the death of more than one parent in the same parental line, concurrent payments in two or more cases may not be authorized if the death of one such parent occurred on or after June 9, 1960. In the latter cases, an election of educational assistance and pension, compensation or dependency and indemnity compensation in one case does not preclude a reelection of benefits before attaining age 18 or while helpless based on the service of another parent in the same parental line.

        (c)  An election by a child under this section must be submitted to VA in writing.

        (1) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, an election to receive Survivors' and Dependents' Educational Assistance (DEA) is final when the eligible child commences a program of education under DEA (38 U.S.C. chapter 35). Commencement of a program of education under DEA will be deemed to have occurred for VA purposes on the date the first payment of DEA educational assistance is made, as evidenced by negotiation of the first check or receipt of the first payment by electronic funds transfer.

        (2) An election based on erroneous information furnished by an authorized representative of the Department of Veterans Affairs is not considered final.

        (3) A child other than a helpless child, whose eligibility was based on a finding that the veteran had a permanent total service-connected disability and who commenced a program of education under DEA may not thereafter qualify as a dependent for disability compensation purposes if the veteran is later found to be less than permanently and totally disabled, or for pension, compensation or dependency and indemnity compensation after the veteran's death.

        (d)  Educational assistance allowance may be paid for an eligible spouse or surviving spouse concurrently with pension, compensation or dependency and indemnity compensation.

        (1)  A person who is eligible for educational assistance and is also eligible for Office of Workers' Compensation Programs benefits, under the Federal Employees' Compensation Act (FECA) must elect which benefit he or she will receive.

        (2)  An eligible person may receive educational assistance notwithstanding that the Office of Workers' Compensation Programs benefits under the Federal Employees' Compensation Act (FECA) are being paid to a veteran, or surviving spouse.

        (3)  An election of Office of Workers' Compensation Programs benefits, under the Federal employees' Compensation Act (FECA), by or for a child filed on or after July 4, 1966, is a bar to subsequent payments of Department of Veterans Affairs benefits during the period of concurrent eligibility. An election of Office of Workers' Compensation Programs benefits under the Federal Employees' Compensation Act (FECA) by a surviving spouse filed on or after December 1, 1968, is a bar to subsequent payments of Department of Veterans Affairs benefits during the period of concurrent eligibility.

        (b)  The provisions of this paragraph are applicable to cases where there is eligibility for benefits from Office of Workers' Compensation Program, under the Federal Employee's Compensation Act (FECA) based on the disability or death as a result of military service by the veteran from whom eligibility for educational assistance is derived.

        (1)  A person who is eligible for educational assistance and is also eligible for Office of Workers' Compensation Programs benefits, under the Federal Employees' Compensation Act (FECA) must elect which benefit he or she will receive. The election may be made at any time.

        § 21.3041   Periods of eligibility; child.

#### § § 21.3041

        (a)  An eligible child's period of eligibility generally begins on the child's 18th birthday, or on the successful completion of the child's secondary schooling, whichever first occurs. The period of eligibility generally ends on the earlier of the date of the child's 26th birthday or the date the veteran is no longer P&T disabled. VA will extend an eligible child's period of eligibility for the reasons listed in paragraphs (g) and (h) of this section. See paragraph (c) of this section if the child serves on duty in the Armed Forces as an eligible child after his or her 18th birthday and before his or her 26th birthday. If the veteran dies while the P&T rating is in effect and before the eligible child's 26th birthday, see paragraph (b) of this section to determine the new period of eligibility. Exceptions to this general period of eligibility are as follows:

        (1)  The period of eligibility may begin before the eligible child's 18th birthday for one of the reasons in paragraphs (a)(1)(i), (ii), or (iii) of this section. The period of eligibility ends on the earlier of the date the veteran is no longer rated P&T disabled or the date of the child's 26th birthday. See § 21.3135(h) if the veteran is no longer rated P&T disabled.

        (i) The child completed compulsory school attendance under applicable State law (see § 21.3040(a) and (b));

        (ii) The child is pursuing a course designed to prepare him or her for an examination required or used for entrance into an institution of higher education or a graduate school; or

        (iii) The child is beyond his or her 14th birthday and has a physical or mental handicap (see § 21.3040(a)).

        (2)  A child's period of eligibility may begin after his or her 18th birthday if VA first finds the veteran has a P&T disability after the child's 18th birthday but before the child's 26th birthday. See paragraph (e) of this section if an adopted child becomes eligible through qualifying as the veteran's child after VA first finds the veteran has a P&T disability. See paragraph (f) of this section if a stepchild becomes eligible through qualifying as the veteran's child after VA first finds the veteran is P&T disabled.

        (i)  If the effective date of the P&T rating is before the child's 18th birthday, and the date of notification to the veteran occurs after the child's 18th birthday but before the child's 26th birthday, the child may elect the beginning date of his or her period of eligibility. (See paragraph (i) of this section for election requirements.) If the child elects a beginning date that is before his or her 18th birthday, the period of eligibility ends the earlier of the date that the veteran is no longer rated P&T disabled, or the date of the child's 26th birthday. If the child elects a beginning date after his or her 18th birthday, the period of eligibility ends the earlier of the date the veteran is no longer rated P&T disabled or 8 years after the beginning date the child elects. (See § 21.3135(h) if the veteran is no longer rated P&T disabled.) The child can elect as a beginning date either—

        (A) The date of his or her 18th birthday;

        (B) The date he or she completed compulsory school attendance under applicable State law (see § 21.3040(a) and (b)), if that date is on or after the effective date of the P&T rating and before his or her 18th birthday;

        (C) The date he or she begins a course designed to prepare him or her for an examination required or used for entrance into an institution of higher education or a graduate school, if that date is on or after the effective date of the P&T rating and before the date of notification to the veteran of the P&T rating. If the child elects the beginning date of enrollment in such course, he or she may not receive educational assistance for pursuit of secondary schooling unless secondary school pursuit is otherwise authorized (see § 21.3040);

        (D) The date VA notifies the veteran of the P&T rating; or

        (E) Any date between the applicable date described in paragraphs (a)(2)(i)(A) through (C) of this section and the date in paragraph (a)(2)(i)(D) of this section.

        (ii)  If the effective date of the P&T rating occurs after the child's 18th birthday but before the child's 26th birthday, the child may elect the beginning date of his or her period of eligibility. (See paragraph (i) of this section for election requirements.) The period of eligibility ends the earlier of the date the veteran is no longer rated P&T disabled, or 8 years after the beginning date the child elects. (See § 21.3135(h) if the veteran is no longer rated P&T disabled.) The child can elect as a beginning date—

        (A) The effective date of the P&T rating;

        (B) The date VA notifies the veteran of the veteran's P&T rating; or

        (C) Any date in between.

        (b)  An eligible child's period of eligibility begins on the child's 18th birthday, or on the successful completion of the child's secondary schooling, whichever first occurs. The period of eligibility ends on the child's 26th birthday. VA will extend an eligible child's period of eligibility for reasons shown in paragraphs (g) and (h) of this section. See paragraph (c) of this section if the child serves on duty in the Armed Forces as an eligible child after his or her 18th birthday and before his or her 26th birthday. Exceptions to this general period of eligibility are as follows:

        (1)  The period of eligibility may begin before the eligible child's 18th birthday for one of the reasons in paragraphs (i), (ii), or (iii) of this paragraph. The ending date of the period of eligibility is the child's 26th birthday.

        (i) The child completed compulsory school attendance under applicable State law (see § 21.3040(a) and (b));

        (ii) The child is pursuing a course designed to prepare him or her for an examination required or used for entrance into an institution of higher education or a graduate school; or

        (iii) The child is beyond his or her 14th birthday and has a physical or mental handicap (see § 21.3040(a)).

        (2)  If the veteran's death occurs after the child's 18th birthday but before the child's 26th birthday, the child may elect the beginning date of his or her period of eligibility. The period of eligibility ends 8 years after the beginning date the child elects. See paragraph (i) of this section for election requirements. VA may extend the period of eligibility for one of the reasons shown in paragraph (g) or (h) of this section. See paragraph (c) of this section if the child serves in the Armed Forces as an eligible person after his or her 18th birthday and before his or her 26th birthday. The child can elect as a beginning date any date between the—

        (i) Date of the veteran's death; or

        (ii) Date of VA's decision that the veteran's death was service-connected.

        (c)  If the child serves on duty in the Armed Forces as an eligible person (as defined in § 21.3021(a)(1)) after the child's 18th birthday and before the child's 26th birthday, the child is eligible for a modified ending date based on the provisions of this paragraph. Under the provisions of this paragraph, the period of eligibility ends 8 years after the date of the child's first discharge or release from such duty, or the child's 31st birthday, whichever is earlier. VA may extend the ending date for one of the reasons shown in paragraph (g) of this section. See paragraph (h) of this section if the child is ordered to active duty as a reservist.

        (d)  (1) If a child establishes eligibility through the provisions of § 21.3021(a)(1)(iv) after his or her 18th birthday but before his or her 26th birthday, the period of eligibility will end on the earliest of the following dates:

        (i) When the parent is no longer listed as described in § 21.3021(a)(1)(iv);

        (ii) Eight years after the date on which the child becomes eligible under such provisions; or

        (iii) The child's 31st birthday.

        (2) VA may extend the ending date for one of the reasons shown in paragraphs (g) or (h) of this section. See § 21.3135(i) if the child is enrolled in an educational institution and the child's ending date is based on paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section. See paragraph (c) of this section if the child serves in the Armed Forces as an eligible person after his or her 18th birthday and before his or her 26th birthday.

        (e)  If an adopted child becomes eligible through qualifying as the veteran's child (see 38 CFR 3.57(c)) and the date the child so becomes eligible is after VA first finds the veteran is P&T disabled, the beginning date of eligibility is the date determined pursuant to paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section, but in no event before the date the adopted child qualifies as the veteran's child under § 3.57(c) of this chapter. The ending date is the child's 26th birthday. VA may extend the period of eligibility for one of the reasons in paragraph (g) or (h) of this section. See paragraph (c) of this section if the child serves on duty in the Armed Forces as an eligible person.

        (f)  If a stepchild becomes eligible through qualifying as the veteran's child and a member of the veteran's household after VA first finds the veteran is P&T disabled, the beginning date of the period of eligibility is the date determined pursuant to paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section, but in no event before the date he or she becomes the veteran's stepchild and a member of the veteran's household. The ending date of the period of eligibility is the stepchild's 26th birthday. VA may extend the ending date for one of the reasons in paragraphs (g) or (h) of this section. See paragraph (c) of this section for the ending date of the period of eligibility if the stepchild serves on active duty in the Armed Forces as an eligible person. See § 21.3135(g) for award discontinuance dates if the veteran and the stepchild's natural or adopted parent divorce or the stepchild ceases to be a member of the veteran's household.

        (g)  (1) If an eligible child suspends pursuit of his or her program due to conditions that VA determined were beyond the child's control, VA may extend the period of eligibility ending date (see § 21.3043). VA cannot grant an extension beyond age 31 to those children whose period of eligibility ending date (as determined under paragraphs (a) through (f) of this section) is subject to an age limitation.

        (2) If an eligible child's period of eligibility ending date (as determined under paragraphs (a) through (f), or (h) of this section) occurs while the child is enrolled in an educational institution, VA may extend the period of eligibility (extensions may be made beyond age 31)—

        (i) To the end of the quarter or semester, for a child enrolled in an educational institution that regularly operates on the quarter or semester system; or

        (ii) To the end of the course, not to exceed 12 weeks, for a child who completed a major portion of a course while enrolled in an educational institution that operates under other than a quarter or semester system.

        (3) If an eligible child's period of eligibility ending date (as determined under paragraphs (a) through (f), or (h) of this section) occurs while the child is pursuing training in a training establishment (as defined in § 21.4200(c)), VA cannot extend the ending date.

        (h) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, if during an eligible child's period of eligibility, as determined in paragraphs (a) through (g) of this section, but after September 10, 2001, an eligible child is ordered to active duty or involuntarily ordered to full-time National Guard duty VA will grant an extension of the child's period of eligibility. The extension will be equal to the length of the period served plus an additional 4 months for each qualifying period and applies if after September 10, 2001, the eligible child is—

        (i) Ordered to serve on active duty under section 688, 12301(a), 12301(d), 12301(g), 12302, or 12304 of title 10, United States Code; or

        (ii) Involuntarily ordered to full-time National Guard duty under section 502(f) of title 32, United States Code.

        (i)  (1) VA must provide written notice to certain eligible children informing them of their right to elect the beginning date of their period of eligibility. The written notice must identify the beginning dates the child may choose from and must contain a statement that the child must make the election within 60 days of the date of the written notice. An eligible child may elect his or her beginning date if—

        (i) The effective date of the P&T rating is before the child's 18th birthday, and date of the notification to the veteran from whom the child derives eligibility occurs after the child's 18th birthday but before the child's 26th birthday (see paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section);

        (ii) The effective date of the P&T rating, or the date of notification to the veteran from whom the child derives eligibility, occurs after the child's 18th birthday but before the child's 26th birthday (see paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section);

        (iii) The veteran's death occurs after the child's 18th birthday but before the child's 26th birthday (see paragraph (b)(2) of this section);

        (iv) The child makes such election within 60 days of VA's written notice to the child informing him or her of the right to elect his or her beginning date; and

        (v) The child's election is in accordance with the choices VA identified in the written notice described in paragraph (i)(1) of this section.

        (2) If the child does not elect a beginning date within 60 days of VA's written notice informing him or her of the right to elect a beginning date, the period of eligibility beginning date will be whichever of the following applies—

        (i) The date of VA's decision that the veteran has a P&T disability; or

        (ii) The date of VA's decision that the veteran's death is service-connected.

        (3) If upon review of the child's application VA determines the child is entitled to and eligible for an immediate award of educational assistance under 38 U.S.C. chapter 35, VA will for purposes of such award—

        (i) Consider the beginning date of the child's period of eligibility to be the date of VA's decision that the—

        (A) Veteran has a P&T disability in the case of a child whose eligibility is derived from a veteran with a P&T disability; or

        (B) Veteran's death is service-connected in the case of a child whose eligibility is derived due to the veteran's death.

        (ii) Notify the child of his or her right to elect a beginning date in accordance with paragraph (i)(1) of this section.

        (iii) Adjust the child's beginning date based on the child's election if the child makes an election within 60 days after VA's written notice in accordance with paragraph (i)(1) of this section.

        § 21.3042   Service with Armed Forces.

#### § § 21.3042

        (a) No educational assistance under 38 U.S.C. chapter 35 may be provided an otherwise eligible person during any period he or she is on duty with the Armed Forces. See § 21.3021 (e) and (f). This does not apply to brief periods of active duty for training. See § 21.3135(f).

        (b) If the eligible person served with the Armed Forces, his or her discharge or release from each period of service must have been under conditions other than dishonorable.

        § 21.3043   Suspension of program; child.

#### § § 21.3043

        For an eligible person who suspends his program due to conditions determined by the Department of Veterans Affairs to have been beyond his or her control the period of eligibility may, upon his request, be extended by the number of months and days intervening the date the suspension began and the date the reason for suspension ceased to exist. The burden of proof is on the eligible person to establish that suspension of a program was due to conditions beyond his or her control. The period of suspension shall be considered to have ended as of the date of the person's first available opportunity to resume training after the condition which caused it ceased to exist. The following circumstances may be considered as beyond the eligible person's control:

        (a) While in active pursuit of a program of education he or she is appointed by the responsible governing body of an established church, officially charged with the selection and designation of missionary representatives, in keeping with its traditional practice, to serve the church in an official missionary capacity and is thereby prevented from pursuit of his or her program of studies.

        (b) Immediate family or financial obligations beyond his or her control require the eligible person to take employment, or otherwise preclude pursuit of his or her program.

        (c) Unavoidable conditions arising in connection with the eligible person's employment which preclude pursuit of his or her program.

        (d) Pursuit of his or her program is precluded because of the eligible person's own illness or illness or death in his or her immediate family.

        (e) Active duty, including active duty for training in the Armed Forces.

> [41 FR 47929, Nov. 1, 1976]

        § 21.3044   Entitlement.

#### § § 21.3044

        (a)  Each eligible person in entitled to educational assistance not in excess of 45 months, or the equivalent thereof in part-time training. The Department of Veterans Affairs will not authorize an extension of entitlement except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section. The period of entitlement when added to education or training received under any or all of the laws cited in § 21.4020 will not exceed 48 months of full-time educational assistance. The period of entitlement will not be reduced by any period during which employment adjustment allowance was paid after the eligible person completes a period of rehabilitation and reaches a point of employability.

        (b)  The 45-month period of entitlement is any 45 months within the period of eligibility. The eligible person is not required to pursue his or her program for 45 consecutive months.

        (c)  The 45 months limitation may be exceeded only in the following cases:

        (1) Where no charge against the entitlement is made based on a course or courses pursued by a spouse or surviving spouse under the special assistance for the educationally disadvantaged program (See § 21.3344(d); or

        (2) Where special restorative training authorized under § 21.3300 exceeds 45 months.

        § 21.3045   Entitlement charges.

#### § § 21.3045

        VA will make record-purpose charges against an eligible person's 38 U.S.C. chapter 35 entitlement only when required by this section. Charges for institutional training will be based upon the principle that an eligible person who trains full time for 1 day should be charged 1 day of entitlement.

        (a)  VA will make no charge against the entitlement of an eligible person for tutorial assistance received in accordance with § 21.4236.

        (b)  (1) When an eligible spouse or surviving spouse is pursuing a course leading to a secondary school diploma or an equivalency certificate as described in § 21.3344, there are two sets of circumstances which will always result in VA's making no charge against his or her entitlement. These are as follows:

        (i) Either the eligible spouse or surviving spouse completed training during the period beginning on October 1, 1980, and ending on August 14, 1989, and remained continuously enrolled from October 1, 1980, through the time the spouse or surviving spouse either completed training or August 14, 1989, whichever is earlier; or

        (ii) The eligible spouse or surviving spouse completed training before August 15, 1989, and received educational assistance based upon the tuition and fees charged for the course.

        (2) When an eligible spouse or surviving spouse is pursuing a course leading to a secondary school diploma or an equivalency certificate as described in § 21.3344, the following circumstances will always result in VA's making a charge against his or her entitlement unless the provisions of paragraph (d) of this section would exempt the spouse or surviving spouse from receiving an entitlement charge.

        (i) The spouse or surviving spouse elects to receive dependents' educational assistance at the rate described in § 21.3131(a), and

        (ii) Either was not pursuing a course leading to a secondary school diploma or equivalency certificate on October 1, 1980, or has not remained continuously enrolled in such a course since October 1, 1980.

        (3) When an eligible person pursues refresher, remedial or deficiency training before August 15, 1989, the following provisions govern the charge against the entitlement.

        (i) VA will not make a charge against the entitlement of an eligible spouse or surviving spouse.

        (ii) VA will make a charge against the entitlement of an eligible child.

        (4) The following provisions apply to an eligible person for training received after August 14, 1989. When he or she is pursuing a course leading to a secondary school diploma or equivalency certificate or refresher, remedial or deficiency training.

        (i) VA will make no charge against the entitlement of an eligible person for the first five months of full time pursuit (or its equivalent in part-time pursuit).

        (ii) VA will make a charge against the entitlement of an eligible person for pursuit in excess of the pursuit described in paragraph (b)(4)(i) unless the provisions of paragraph (d) of this section would exempt the eligible person from receiving an entitlement charge.

        (c)  Except when the requirements of paragraph (d) of this section are met, VA will make a charge against the period of entitlement of—

        (1) An eligible person for pursuit of a program of apprenticeship or other on-job training;

        (2) A spouse or surviving spouse for pursuit of a correspondence course; or

        (3) An eligible person for the pursuit of any course not described in paragraph (a) or (b) of this section.

        (d)  (1) VA will not make a charge against the entitlement of an eligible person for the pursuit of any course or courses when the requirements of paragraphs (d)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section are met, by VA finding that the eligible person—

        (i) Had to discontinue pursuit of the course or courses as a result of being—

        (A) Ordered, in connection with the Persian Gulf War by orders dated before September 11, 2001, to serve on active duty under 10 U.S.C. 688, 12301(a), 12301(d), 12301(g), 12302, or 12304, or under former 10 U.S.C. 672(a), 672(d), 672(g), 673, or 673(b) (redesignated effective December 1, 1994, as 10 U.S.C. 12301(a), 12301(d), 12301(g), 12302, and 12304, respectively);

        (B) Ordered, by orders dated after September 10, 2001, to serve on active duty under 10 U.S.C. 688, 12301(a), 12301(d), 12301(g), 12302, or 12304; or

        (C) Involuntarily ordered, by orders dated after September 10, 2001, to full-time National Guard duty under 32 U.S.C. 502(f).

        (ii) Failed to receive credit or training time toward completion of the eligible person's approved educational, professional or vocational objective as a result of having to discontinue, for a reason described in paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section, his or her course pursuit.

        (2) The period for which VA will not make a charge against entitlement shall not exceed the portion of the period of enrollment in the course or courses for which the eligible person failed to receive credit or with respect to which the eligible person lost training time.

        (e)  The provisions of this paragraph apply to all courses except those courses for which VA is not making a charge against the eligible person's entitlement, apprenticeship or other on-job training, correspondence courses, and courses offered solely through independent study.

        (1) After making any adjustments required by paragraph (e)(3) of this section, VA will make a charge against entitlement—

        (i) On the basis of total elapsed time (one day for each day of pursuit) if the eligible person is pursuing the program of education on a full-time basis,

        (ii) On the basis of a proportionate rate of elapsed time, if the eligible person is pursuing a program of education on a three-quarter, one-half or less than one-half time basis. For the purpose of this computation, training time which is less than one-half, but more than one-quarter time, will be treated as though it were one-quarter time training.

        (2) VA will compute elapsed time from the commencing date of enrollment to date of discontinuance. If the eligible person changes his or her training time after the commencing date of enrollment, VA will—

        (i) Divide the enrollment period into separate periods of time during which the eligible person's training time remains constant; and

        (ii) Compute the elapsed time separately for each time period.

        (3) An eligible person may concurrently enroll in refresher, remedial or deficiency training for which paragraph (b)(3) or (b)(4)(i) of this section requires no charge against entitlement and in a course or courses for which paragraph (b)(2) or (b)(4)(ii) or (c) of this section requires a charge against entitlement. When this occurs, VA will charge entitlement for the concurrent enrollment based only on pursuit of the courses described in paragraph (b)(2) or (b)(4)(ii) or (c) of this section, measured in accordance with §§ 21.4270 through 21.4275 of this part, as appropriate.

        (f)  For enrollments in terms, quarters, or semesters that begin after June 30, 1993, VA will make charges against the entitlement of an eligible person in the manner prescribed by paragraph (e) of this section, if he or she is pursuing a program of education solely by independent study. For all other enrollments where the eligible person is pursuing a program of education solely by independent study, the computation will be made as though the eligible person's training were one-quarter time.

        (g)  For each month that an eligible person is paid a monthly educational assistance allowance while undergoing apprenticeship or other on-job training, including months in which the eligible person fails to complete 120 hours of training, VA will make a record-purpose charge against 38 U.S.C. chapter 35 entitlement, if any, as follows:

        (1) For training pursued before October 1, 2005, VA will reduce chapter 35 entitlement by one month for each month of benefits paid.

        (2) For training pursued on or after October 1, 2005, VA will reduce chapter 35 entitlement proportionately based on the percentage rate (rounded to the nearest percentage) determined by dividing the amount of the training assistance paid for the month by the monthly educational assistance payable for full-time enrollment in an educational institution.

        (h)  The charge against entitlement of a spouse or surviving spouse for pursuit of a course exclusively by correspondence will be 1 month for each of the following amounts paid as an educational assistance allowance:

        (1) $788.00, paid after June 30, 2004, and before October 1, 2004;

        (2) $803.00, paid after September 30, 2004, and before October 1, 2005;

        (3) $827.00, paid after September 30, 2005, and before October 1, 2006;

        (4) $860.00, paid after September 30, 2006, and before October 1, 2007;

        (5) $881.00, paid after September 30, 2007, and before October 1, 2008; and

        (6) $915.00, paid after September 30 2008.

        (i)  VA will make a charge against entitlement for an overpayment only if the overpayment is discharged in bankruptcy, is waived and is not recovered, or is compromised.

        (1) If the overpayment is discharged in bankruptcy or is waived and is not recovered, the charge against entitlement will be at the appropriate rate for the elapsed period covered by the overpayment (exclusive of interest, administrative costs of collection, court costs and marshal fees).

        (2) If the overpayment is compromised and the compromise offer is less than the amount of interest, administrative costs of collection, court costs and marshal fees, the charge against entitlement will be at the appropriate rate for the elapsed period covered by the overpayment (exclusive of interest, administrative costs of collection, court costs and marshal fees).

        (3) If the overpayment is compromised and the compromise offer is equal to or greater than the amount of interest, administrative costs of collection, court costs and marshal fees, the charge against entitlement will be determined by—

        (i) Subtracting from the sum paid in the compromise offer the amount attributable to interest, administrative costs of collection, court costs and marshal fees,

        (ii) Subtracting the remaining amount of the overpayment balance determined in paragraph (i)(3)(i) of this section from the amount of the original overpayment (exclusive of interest, administrative costs of collection, court costs and marshal fees),

        (iii) Dividing the result obtained in paragraph (h)(3)(ii) of this section by the amount of the original debt (exclusive of interest, administrative costs of collection, court costs and marshal fees), and

        (iv) Multiplying the percentage obtained in paragraph (h)(3)(iii) of this section by the amount of the entitlement otherwise chargeable for the period of the original overpayment.

        (j)  An eligible person may not interrupt a certified period of enrollment for the purpose of conserving entitlement. An educational institution may not certify a period of enrollment for a fractional part of the normal term, quarter or semester, if the eligible person is enrolled for the term, quarter or semester. VA will make a charge against entitlement for the entire period of certified enrollment, if the eligible person is otherwise eligible for benefits, except when benefits are interrupted under any of the following conditions:

        (1) Enrollment is actually terminated;

        (2) The eligible person cancels his or her enrollment, and does not negotiate an educational benefits check for any part of the certified period of enrollment;

        (3) The eligible person interrupts his or her enrollment at the end of any term, quarter, or semester within the certified period of enrollment, and does not negotiate a check for educational benefits for the succeeding term, quarter, or semester;

        (4) The eligible person requests interruption or cancellation for any break when a school was closed during a certified period of enrollment, and VA continued payments under an established policy based upon an Executive Order of the President or an emergency situation.

        § 21.3046   Periods of eligibility; spouses and surviving spouses.

#### § § 21.3046

        This section states how VA will compute the beginning date, the ending date and the length of a spouse's or surviving spouse's period of eligibility. The period of eligibility of a spouse computed under the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section will be recomputed under the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section if her or his status changes to that of surviving spouse.

        (a)  (1) If the permanent total rating is effective before December 1, 1968, the beginning date of the 10-year period of eligibility is December 1, 1968.

        (2) The beginning date of eligibility—

        (i) Shall be determined as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section when—

        (A) The permanent total rating is effective after November 30, 1968, or the notification to the veteran of the rating was after that date, and

        (B) Eligibility does not arise under § 21.3021(a)(3)(ii) of this part.

        (ii) For spouses for whom VA made a final determination of eligibility before October 28, 1986, shall be—

        (A) The effective date of the rating, or

        (B) The date of notification, whichever is more advantageous to the spouse.

        (iii) For spouses for whom VA made a final determination of eligibility after October 27, 1986, shall be—

        (A) The effective date of the rating, or

        (B) The date of notification, or

        (C) Any date between the dates specified in paragraphs (a)(2)(iii) (A) and (B) of this section as chosen by the eligible spouse.

        (iv) May not be changed once a spouse has chosen it as provided in paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section.

        (3) If eligibility arises under § 21.3021(a)(3)(ii) of this part, the beginning date of the 10-year eligibility period is—

        (i) December 24, 1970, or

        (ii) The date the member of the Armed Forces on whose service eligibility is based was so listed by the Secretary concerned, whichever last occurs.

        (b)  (1) If VA determines before December 1, 1968, that the veteran died of a service-connected disability, the beginning date of the 10-year period is December 1, 1968.

        (2) If the veteran's death occurred before December 1, 1968, but VA does not determine that the veteran died of a service-connected disability until after November 30, 1968, the beginning date of the 10-year period is the date on which VA determines that the veteran died of a service-connected disability.

        (3) If the veteran's death occurred before December 1, 1968, while a total, service-connected disability evaluated as permanent in nature was in existence, the beginning date of the 10-year period is December 1, 1968.

        (4) If the veteran's death occurred after November 30, 1968, and VA makes a final decision concerning the surviving spouse's eligibility for dependents' educational assistance before October 28, 1986, the beginning date of the 10-year period is—

        (i) The date of death of the veteran who dies while a total, service-connected disability evaluated as permanent in nature was in existence, or

        (ii) The date on which VA determines that the veteran died of a service-connected disability.

        (5) If the veteran's death occurred after November 30, 1968, and VA makes a final decision concerning the surviving spouse's eligibility for dependents educational assistance after October 27, 1986, VA will determine the beginning date of the 10-year period as follows.

        (i) If the surviving spouse's eligibility is based on the veteran's death while a total, service-connected disability evaluated as permanent in nature was in existence, the beginning date of the 10-year period is the date of death.

        (ii) If the surviving spouse's eligibility is based on the veteran's death from a service-connected disability, the surviving spouse will choose the beginning date of the 10-year period. That date will be no earlier than the date of death and no later than the date of the VA determination that the veteran's death was due to a service-connected disability.

        (6) Once a surviving spouse has chosen a beginning date of eligibility as provided in paragraph (b)(5) of this section, the surviving spouse may not revoke that choice.

        (c) —(1)  (i) If on or after December 27, 2001, VA makes a determination of eligibility for a spouse, the period of eligibility cannot exceed 10 years. The eligibility period can be extended only as provided in paragraph (c)(3) of this section and § 21.3047.

        (ii) If before December 27, 2001, VA made a determination of eligibility for a spouse, the eligibility period has no ending date unless the spouse changes his or her program of education. If on or after December 27, 2001, the spouse changes his or her program of education, the eligibility period cannot exceed 10 years. The beginning date of the eligibility period is determined as provided in paragraph (a) of this section. The 10-year eligibility period can be extended only as provided in paragraph (c)(3) of this section and § 21.3047.

        (iii) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, if eligibility arises before October 24, 1972, educational assistance will not be afforded later than October 23, 1982, based on a course or program of correspondence, apprentice, or other on-the-job training, approved under the provisions of § 21.4256, § 21.4261, or § 21.4262, except that VA may award educational assistance beyond October 23, 1982, if the eligible spouse qualifies for the extended period of eligibility as provided in paragraph (c)(3) of this section and § 21.3047.

        (2)  (i) For surviving spouses, the period of eligibility cannot exceed 10 years and can be extended only as provided in paragraph (c)(3) of this section and § 21.3047.

        (ii) If eligibility arises before October 24, 1972, educational assistance will not be afforded later than October 23, 1982, based on a course or program of correspondence, apprentice, or other on-the-job training approved under the provisions of § 21.4256, § 21.4261, or § 21.4262, except that VA may award educational assistance beyond October 23, 1982, if the eligible surviving spouse qualifies for an extended period of eligibility as provided in paragraph (c)(3) of this section and § 21.3047.

        (iii) The eligibility period for a surviving spouse is not reduced by any earlier period during which the surviving spouse was eligible for educational assistance under this chapter as a spouse.

        (3)  Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, if a spouse or surviving spouse, during the eligibility period otherwise applicable to such individual under this section, serves on active duty pursuant to an order to active duty dated after September 10, 2001, issued under 10 U.S.C. 688, 12301(a), 12301(d), 12301(g), 12302, or 12304, or is involuntarily ordered by an order dated after September 10, 2001, to full-time National Guard duty under 32 U.S.C. 502(f), VA will grant the individual an extension of the ending date of his or her eligibility period. The extension will equal the length of the period of such active duty plus four months.

        (d)  (1) The ending date of a spouse's period of eligibility may be extended when the spouse is enrolled and eligibility ceases for one of the following reasons:

        (i) The veteran is no longer rated permanently and totally disabled;

        (ii) The spouse is divorced from the veteran without fault on the spouse's part; or

        (iii) The spouse no longer is listed in any of the categories of § 21.3021(a)(3)(ii) of this part.

        (3) If the spouse is enrolled in a school not operating on a quarter or semester system, VA will extend the period of eligibility to the earlier of the following:

        (5) VA will not extend the period of eligibility when the spouse is pursuing training in a training establishment as defined in § 21.4200(c) of this part.

        (6) An extension may not—

        (i) Applies for the extension within the appropriate time limit;

        (iv) Is otherwise eligible for payment of educational assistance for the training pursuant to 38 U.S.C. chapter 35.

        (2) In determining whether the eligible spouse or surviving spouse was prevented from initiating or completing the chosen program of education because of a physical or mental disability, VA will consider the following:

        (i) It must be clearly established by medical evidence that such a program of education was medically infeasible.

        (ii) An eligible spouse or surviving spouse who is disabled for a period of 30 days or less will not be considered as having been prevented from initiating or completing a chosen program, unless the evidence establishes that the eligible spouse or surviving spouse was prevented from enrolling or reenrolling in the chosen program of education, or was forced to discontinue attendance, because of the short disability.

        (iii) VA will not consider the disabling effects of chronic alcoholism to be the result of willful misconduct and will consider those disabling effects as physical or mental disabilities.

        (c)  An eligible spouse's or surviving spouse's extended period of eligibility shall be for the length of time that the individual was prevented from initiating or completing his or her chosen program of education. This shall be determined as follows:

        (1) If the eligible spouse or surviving spouse is in training in a course organized on a term, quarter, or semester basis, his or her extended period of eligibility shall contain the same number of days as the number of days from the date during the eligible spouse's or surviving spouse's original period of eligibility that his or her training became medically infeasible to the earliest of the following dates:

        (i) The commencing date of the ordinary term, quarter, or semester following the day the eligible spouse's or surviving spouse's training became medically feasible;

        (ii) All hours of the eligible person's related training which occurred during the standard workweek and for which the eligible person received wages.

        (d)  (1) VA will not pay benefits to any eligible person for a course from which the eligible person withdraws or receives a nonpunitive grade which is not used in computing the requirements for graduation unless the provisions of this paragraph are met.

        (i) The eligible person withdraws because he or she is ordered to active duty; or

        (ii) All of the following criteria are met:

        (A) There are mitigating circumstances;

        (B) The eligible person submits a description of the circumstances in writing to VA either within one year from the date VA notifies the eligible person that he or she must submit the mitigating circumstances or at a later date if the eligible person is able to show good cause why the one-year time limit should be extended to the date on which he or she submitted the description of the mitigating circumstances; and

        (C) The eligible person submits evidence supporting the existence of mitigating circumstances within one year of the date that evidence is requested by VA, or at a later date if the eligible person is able to show good cause why the one-year time limit should be extended to the date on which he or she submitted the evidence supporting the existence of mitigating circumstances.

        (2) The following circumstances are representative of those which the Department of Veterans Affairs considers to be mitigating provided they prevent the eligible person from pursuing the program of education continuously. This list is not all inclusive.

        (i) An illness of the eligible person,

        (ii) An illness or death in the eligible person's family,

        (iii) An unavoidable geographical transfer resulting from the eligible person's employment,

        (iv) An unavoidable change in the eligible person's conditions of employment,

        (vii) Unanticipated active duty for training,

        (viii) Unanticipated difficulties in caring for the eligible person's child or children.

        (3) If the eligible child fails to complete satisfactorily a course of special restorative training or if the eligible person fails to complete satisfactorily a course under section 3533, Title 38 U.S.C., without fault, the Department of Veterans Affairs will consider the circumstances which caused the failure to be mitigating. This will be the case even if the circumstances were not so severe as to preclude continuous pursuit of a program of education.

        (4) In the first instance of a withdrawal after May 31, 1989, from a course or courses for which the eligible person received educational assistance under title 38 U.S.C. or under chapter 1606, title 10 U.S.C., VA will consider that mitigating circumstances exist with respect to courses totaling not more than six semester hours or the equivalent. Eligible persons to whom the provisions of this subparagraph apply are not subject to the reporting requirement found in paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section.

        (5) If an eligible person withdraws from a course during a drop-add period, VA will consider the circumstances which caused the withdrawal to be mitigating. Eligible persons who withdraw from a course during a drop-add period are not subject to the reporting requirement found in paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section.

        § 21.3133   Payment procedures.

#### § § 21.3133

        (a)  In determining whether payments of educational assistance allowance may be made in a lump sum, in advance, for an interval or if a certification is required from an eligible person before a payment may be made, VA will apply the provisions of § 21.4138.

        (b)  (1) VA will pay an educational assistance allowance to the eligible person if he or she has attained majority and has no known legal disability.

        (2) If an eligible person has not attained majority, VA will pay an educational assistance allowance directly to an eligible person, a relative, or some other person for the use and benefit of the eligible person notwithstanding a legal disability on the part of the eligible person when VA determines:

        (i) The best interest of the eligible person would be served;

        (ii) Undue delay in payment would be avoided; or

        (iii) Payment would otherwise not be feasible.

        (c)  Educational assistance remaining due and unpaid at the date of the eligible person's death is payable under the provisions of § 3.1000 of this chapter.

        (d)  An individual who is otherwise eligible to receive benefits under the Survivors' and Dependents' Educational Assistance program may receive supplemental monetary assistance to provide tutorial services. In determining whether VA will pay the individual this assistance, VA will apply the provisions of § 21.4236.

        (e)  Payment of dependents' educational assistance will be subject to offset of amounts of pension, compensation or dependency and indemnity compensation paid over the same period on behalf of a child based on school attendance.

        (f)  VA may withhold final payment until VA receives proof of continued enrollment and adjusts the eligible person's account.

> [61 FR 26111, May 24, 1996]

        § 21.3135   Reduction or discontinuance dates for awards of educational assistance allowance.

#### § § 21.3135

        The reduction or discontinuance date of an award of educational assistance will be as stated in this section. If more than one basis for reduction or discontinuance is involved, the earliest date will control.

        (a)  Educational assistance allowance will be discontinued on the ending date of the course or period of enrollment as certified by the school.

        (b)  Educational assistance allowance will be discontinued on the ending date of the eligible person's eligibility as determined by § 21.3041, § 21.3042, § 21.3043, or § 21.3046.

        (c)  Educational assistance allowance will be reduced or discontinued on the date specified in § 21.4135.

        (d)  If the veteran and eligible spouse divorce, the discontinuance date for the eligible spouse's award of educational assistance will be:

        (1) The end of the quarter or semester if the school is operated on a quarter or semester system, and the divorce was without fault on the eligible spouse's part;

        (2) The end of the course or a 12-week period, whichever is earlier, if the school does not operate on a quarter or semester system, and the divorce was without fault on the eligible spouse's part; or

        (3) In all other instances, the date the divorce decree becomes final.

        (e)  (1) If an eligible surviving spouse remarries, the date of discontinuance of his or her award of educational assistance allowance will be the last date of attendance before remarriage.

        (2) If a spouse or surviving spouse begins a relationship by living with another person and holding himself or herself out openly to the public to be the spouse of the other person, the date of discontinuance of his or her award of educational assistance allowance will be the last date of the month before the spouse's or surviving spouse's relationship began.

        (f)  If an eligible person enters on active duty, VA will terminate his or her educational assistance allowance on the day before the day of entrance on active duty. Brief periods of active duty for training, if the school permits such an absence without interruption of training, will not result in termination of the allowance under this paragraph.

        (g)  (1) If the child ceases to be the veteran's stepchild because the veteran and the stepchild's natural or adoptive parent divorce, the eligibility ending date is as follows:

        (i) If the child ceases to be the veteran's stepchild while the child is not in training, the ending date of the child's period of eligibility is the date on which the child ceases to be the veteran's stepchild.

        (ii) If the child ceases to be the veteran's stepchild while the child is training in a school organized on a term, semester, or quarter basis, the ending date of the child's eligibility is the last day of the term, semester, or quarter during which the child ceases to be the veteran's stepchild.

        (iii) If the child ceases to be the veteran's stepchild while the child is training in a school not organized on a term, semester, or quarter basis, the ending date of the child's eligibility is the end of the course, or 12 weeks from the date on which the child ceases to be the veteran's stepchild, whichever is earlier.

        (2) If the stepchild ceases to be a member of the veteran's household, he or she is no longer eligible. For purposes of this paragraph, VA considers a stepchild a member of the veteran's household even when the stepchild is temporarily not living with the veteran, so long as the actions and intentions of the stepchild and veteran establish that normal family ties have been maintained during the temporary absence. VA will determine the stepchild's eligibility ending date as follows:

        (i) If the stepchild ceases to be a member of the veteran's household while the stepchild is not in training, the eligibility ending date is the date on which the stepchild ceases to be a member of the veteran's household.

        (ii) If the stepchild ceases to be a member of the veteran's household while the stepchild is training in a school organized on a term, semester, or quarter basis, the ending date of the stepchild's eligibility is the last day of the term, semester, or quarter during which the stepchild ceases to be a member of the veteran's household.

        (iii) If the stepchild ceases to be a member of the veteran's household while the stepchild is training in a school not organized on a term, semester, or quarter basis, the ending date of the stepchild's eligibility is the end of the course, or 12 weeks from the date on which the stepchild ceases to be a member of the veteran's household. See § 21.3041(f).

        (h)  (1) If the veteran on whose service an eligible person's eligibility is based is no longer permanently and totally disabled, VA will discontinue the educational assistance allowance—

        (i) On the last date of the quarter or semester during which VA rated the veteran as no longer permanently and totally disabled if the eligible person's educational institution is organized on a quarter or semester basis; or

        (ii) On the earlier of the following dates when the eligible person's educational institution is not organized on a quarter or semester basis:

        (A) The last date of the course;

        (B) The end of a 12-week period beginning on the date VA rated the veteran as being no longer permanently and totally disabled.

        (i) Serviceperson is removed from “missing status” listing. (1) If the serviceperson on whose service an eligible person's eligibility is based is removed from the “missing status” listing, VA will discontinue the educational assistance allowance—

        (i) On the last date of the quarter or semester during which the serviceperson was removed from the “missing status” listing if the eligible person's educational institution is organized on a quarter or semester basis; or

        (ii) On the earlier of the following dates when the eligible person's educational institution is not organized on a quarter or semester basis:

        (A) The last date of the course;

        (B) The end of a 12-week period beginning on the date the serviceperson was removed from the “missing status” listing.

        (i) Eligible person is a fugitive felon; or

        (ii) Veteran from whom eligibility is derived is a fugitive felon.

        (2) The date of discontinuance of an award of educational assistance allowance to an eligible person is the later of—

        (i) The date of the warrant for the arrest of the felon; or

        (ii) December 27, 2001.

        § 21.3301   Need.

#### § § 21.3301

        (a)  When special restorative training has been requested or is being considered for an eligible person with a disability who is a child, spouse, or surviving spouse, a counseling psychologist or vocational rehabilitation counselor will obtain all information necessary to determine the need for and feasibility of special restorative training. After the counseling psychologist or vocational rehabilitation counselor completes this task, he or she will refer the case to the Vocational Rehabilitation Panel. The panel will consider whether—

        (1) There exists a handicap which will interfere with pursuit of a program of education;

        (2) The period of special restorative training materially will improve the child's, spouse's, or surviving spouse's ability to:

        (i) Pursue a program of education,

        (ii) Pursue a program of specialized vocational training,

        (iii) Obtain continuing employment in a sheltered workshop, or

        (iv) Adjust in his or her family or community;

        (3) The special restorative training may be pursued concurrently with a program of education;

        (4) Training will affect adversely the child's, spouse's, or surviving spouse's mental or physical condition;

        (5) In the case of a child, whether it is in the best interest of the child to begin special restorative training after his or her 14th birthday; and

        (6) The Department of Veterans Affairs:

        (i) Has considered assistance available under provisions of State-Federal programs for education of individuals with disabilities; and

        (ii) Has determined that it is in the eligible person's interest to receive benefits under 38 U.S.C. chapter 35.

        (b)  The Vocational Rehabilitation Panel will prepare a written report of its findings and recommendations as to the need for assistance and the types of assistance which should be provided. The report will be sent to the counseling psychologist or vocational rehabilitation counselor.

        (c)  Following consultation with the panel and receipt of the panel's report, the counseling psychologist or vocational rehabilitation counselor will determine the need for and feasibility of special restorative training. If this determination is affirmative, the counseling psychologist or vocational rehabilitation counselor will prepare an individualized written plan comparable to a plan for an extended evaluation under 38 U.S.C. chapter 31. In the case of an eligible person who is a spouse or surviving spouse, or a child who has attained majority under laws applicable in his or her State of residence, the plan will be developed jointly with the spouse or surviving spouse, or the child, respectively. In the case of an eligible person who has a guardian or has not attained majority under laws applicable in his or her State of residence, the plan will be developed jointly with the eligible person and his or her parent or guardian (see § 21.3021(d)).

        (d)  When an eligible person, or a parent or guardian on behalf of an eligible person, has requested special restorative training, and the counseling psychologist or vocational rehabilitation counselor finds that this training is not needed or will not materially improve the eligible person's condition, VA will inform the eligible person, except that VA will inform his or her parent or guardian (see § 21.3021(d)) if the eligible person has a guardian or has not attained majority under laws applicable in his or her State of residence, in writing of the finding and of his or her appeal rights.

        (e)  The case of an eligible person shall be referred to the panel for consideration of whether the eligible person may be permitted reentrance into special restorative training following interruption. The panel will recommend approval to the Counseling Psychologist (CP) or Vocational Rehabilitation Counselor (VRC) if there is a reasonable expectation that the purpose of special restorative training will be accomplished. See § 21.3306.

        § 21.3302   Special restorative training agreements and reports.

#### § § 21.3302

        (a)  The Department of Veterans Affairs may make agreements with public or private educational institutions or others to provide suitable and necessary special restorative training for an eligible person.

        (b)  When a customary tuition charge is not applicable, the agreement will include the fair and reasonable amounts charged for the training provided to the eligible person.

        (c)  Each educational institution or other provider of a course of special restorative training must report promptly the eligible person's enrollment in, interruption of, or termination of the course of special restorative training.

        § 21.3303   Extent of training.

#### § § 21.3303

        (a)  Ordinarily, special restorative training may not exceed 12 months. When the counseling psychologist or vocational rehabilitation counselor, after consulting with the Vocational Rehabilitation Panel, determines that more than 12 months of training is necessary, he or she will refer the program to the Executive Director, Veteran Readiness and Employment (VR&E) Service for prior approval. Where the plan for a program of special restorative training itself (not in combination with the program of education) will require more than 45 months (or its equivalent in accelerated payments) the plan will be included in the recommendation to the Executive Director, VR&E Service for approval.

        (b)  (1) No child may receive special restorative training after reaching the end of his or her eligibility period as determined under § 21.3041.

        (2) No spouse or surviving spouse may receive special restorative training after reaching the end of his or her eligibility period as determined under §§ 21.3046 and 21.3047.

        (c)  An eligible person will pursue special restorative training on a full-time basis.

        (1) Full-time training requires training for:

        (i) That amount of time per week which commonly is required for a full-time course at the educational institution when, based on medical findings, the Department of Veterans Affairs determines that the eligible person's physical or mental condition permits training for that amount of time, or

        (ii) The maximum time per week permitted by the eligible person's disability, as determined by the Department of Veterans Affairs, based on medical findings, if the disability precludes the weekly training time stated in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section.

        (2) If the hours per week that can reasonably be devoted to restorative training will not of themselves equal the time required by paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the course will be supplemented with subject matter which will contribute toward the objective of the program of education.

        § 21.3304   Assistance during training.

#### § § 21.3304

        (a)  A counseling psychologist or vocational rehabilitation counselor will provide the professional and technical assistance needed by the eligible person in pursuing special restorative training. The assistance will be timely, sustained and personal.

        (b)  The counseling psychologist or vocational rehabilitation counselor must be continually aware of the eligible person's progress. At frequent intervals he or she will determine whether the eligible person is progressing satisfactorily. When the counseling psychologist or vocational rehabilitation counselor determines that adjustments are needed in the course or in the training situation, he or she will act immediately to bring about the adjustments in accordance with the following:

        (1) When the eligible person or his or her instructor indicates dissatisfaction with elements of the program, the counseling psychologist or vocational rehabilitation counselor, through personal discussion with the eligible person or his or her instructor or both, will, if possible, correct the difficulty through such means as making minor adjustments in the course or by persuading the eligible person to give more attention to performance.

        (2) When major difficulties cannot be corrected, the counseling psychologist or vocational rehabilitation counselor will prepare a report of pertinent facts and recommendations for action in consultation with the Vocational Rehabilitation Panel.

        (3) Action will be taken to terminate the eligible person's course at the proper time so that his or her entitlement may be conserved when the counseling psychologist or vocational rehabilitation counselor determines that:

        (i) The eligible person is progressing much faster than anticipated, and

        (ii) The eligible person's course may be terminated with satisfactory results before the time originally planned.

#### § § 21.3305

        (a)  An eligible person once entered into special restorative training should pursue his or her course to completion without interruption. Wherever possible, continuous training shall be provided for each eligible person, including training during the summer, except where, because of his or her physical condition or other good reason, it would not be to his or her best interest to pursue training. As long as the eligible person is progressing satisfactorily toward overcoming the effects of his or her disability(ies), the eligible person will be continued in his or her course of training without accounting for days of nonattendance within the authorized enrollment.

        (b)  Special restorative training will be interrupted as necessary under the following conditions:

        (1) During summer vacations or periods when no instruction is given before and after summer sessions.

        (2) During a prolonged period of illness or medical infeasibility.

        (3) When the eligible person voluntarily abandons special restorative training.

        (4) When the eligible person fails to make satisfactory progress in the special restorative training course.

        (5) When the eligible person is no longer acceptable to the institution because of failure to maintain satisfactory conduct or progress in accordance with the rules of the institution.

        (6) When the eligible person's progress is materially retarded because of his or her negligence, lack of application or misconduct.

        § 21.3306   Reentrance after interruption.

#### § § 21.3306

        When a course of special restorative training has been interrupted and the eligible person presents himself or herself for reentrance, the Department of Veterans Affairs will act as follows:

        (a)  A counseling psychologist or vocational rehabilitation counselor will approve reentrance when special restorative training was interrupted:

        (1) For a scheduled vacation period, such as a summer break,

        (2) For a short period of illness, or

        (3) For other reasons which permit reentrance in the same course of special restorative training without corrective action.

        (b)  (1) A counseling psychologist or vocational rehabilitation counselor will consult with the Vocational Rehabilitation Panel when special restorative training was interrupted—

        (i) By reason of failure to maintain satisfactory conduct or progress, or

        (ii) For any other reason, which requires corrective action, such as changes of place of training, change of course, personal adjustment, etc.

        (2) If the counseling psychologist or vocational rehabilitation counselor determines that the conditions which caused the interruption can be overcome, he or she will approve the necessary adjustment.

        (3) The counseling psychologist or vocational rehabilitation counselor will make a finding of infeasibility if—

        (i) All efforts to effect proper adjustment in the case have failed; and

        (ii) There is substantial evidence, resolving any reasonable doubt in favor of the eligible person (as discussed in § 3.102 of this chapter), that additional efforts will be unsuccessful.

        § 21.3307   “Discontinued” status.

#### § § 21.3307

        (a)  If reentrance from  status into a program of special restorative training is not approved under the provisions of § 21.3306, a counseling psychologist or vocational rehabilitation counselor will place the case in  status.

        (b)  In any case of discontinuance the Department of Veterans Affairs will:

        (1) Notify the eligible person of the action taken, except that if the eligible person has a guardian or has not attained majority under laws applicable in his or her State of residence, VA will notify his or her parent or guardian (see § 21.3021(d)) of the action taken.

        (3) If it appears that the falsity or misrepresentation was deliberate, the Department of Veterans Affairs may not pursue administrative collection pending a determination whether the matter should be referred to the Department of Justice for possible civil or criminal action. However, the Department of Veterans Affairs may recover the amount of the overpayment from the educational institution by administrative collection procedure when the Department of Veterans Affairs determines the false certification or misrepresentation resulted from an administrative error or a misstatement of fact and that no criminal or civil action is warranted.

        (4) If the Department of Veterans Affairs recovers any part of the overpayment from the educational institution, it may reimburse the educational institution, if the Department of Veterans Affairs subsequently collects the overpayment from a veteran or eligible person. The reimbursement—

        (i) Will be made when the total amount collected from the educational institution and from the veterans and eligible persons (less any amount applied toward marshal fees, court costs, administrative cost of collection and interest) exceeds the total amount for which the educational institution is liable, and

        (ii) Will be equal to the excess.

        (5) This paragraph does not preclude the imposition of any civil or criminal liability under this or any other law.

        (b)  (1) If a school is required to make periodic or other certifications, the Department of Veterans Affairs may consider the following in determining whether a school is potentially liable for an overpayment:

        (i) The school's failure to report, or to report timely facts which resulted in an overpayment, or

        (ii) The school's submission of an incorrect certification as to fact.

        (2) In either instance the Department of Veterans Affairs will consider other pertinent factors such as:

        (i) Allowing for occasional clerical error or occasional administrative error:

        (ii) The school's past reliability in reporting;

        (iii) The adequacy of the school's reporting system; and

        (iv) The extent of noncompliance with reporting requirements.

        (c)  (1) Each VA Regional Processing Office shall have a _Committee on School Liability._ For the purposes of this section, the Manila Regional Office is considered the VA Regional Processing Office of jurisdiction for educational institutions located in the Philippines.

        (2) The Secretary delegates to each Committee on School Liability, and to any panel that the chairperson of the Committee may designate and draw from the Committee, the authority to find whether an educational institution is liable for an overpayment.

        (d)  (1) The Education Officer of the VA Regional Processing Office of jurisdiction, or the Service Center Manager when the Manila Regional Office is considered the VA Regional Processing Office of jurisdiction, will decide whether there is evidence that would warrant a finding that an educational institution is potentially liable for an overpayment.

        (2) Following each finding of potential liability, the Finance Officer of the VA Regional Processing Office of jurisdiction will notify the educational institution in writing of VA's intent to apply the liability provisions of paragraph (a) of this section. The notice will—

        (i) Identify the students who were overpaid;

        (ii) Identify the veterans and eligible persons who took the licensing or certification test and were overpaid;

        (iii) Set out in the case of each student, or in the case of each veteran or eligible person who took the test, the educational institution's actions or omissions which resulted in the finding that the educational institution was potentially liable for the overpayment; and

        (iv) State that VA will determine liability on the basis of the evidence of record unless the VA Regional Processing Office of jurisdiction receives additional evidence or a request for a hearing within 30 days of the date the educational institution received the notice.

        (e)  An educational institution is entitled to a hearing before a panel drawn from the Committee on School Liability before a decision is made as to whether it is liable for an overpayment. Every hearing will be preceded by a prehearing conference unless the conference is waived by the educational institution. The Committee on School Liability will consider all evidence and testimony presented at the hearing.

        (f)  Waiver of collection of an overpayment as to a veteran, reservist, or eligible person will not relieve the educational institution of liability for the overpayment. Recovery in whole or in part from the veteran, reservist, or eligible person will limit such liability accordingly. If an overpayment has been recovered from the educational institution and the veteran, reservist, or eligible person subsequently repays the amount in whole or in part, the amount repaid will be reimbursed to the educational institution.

        (g)  The educational institution shall be notified in writing of the decision of the Committee on School Liability. If the educational institution is found liable for an overpayment, the educational institution also will be notified of the right to appeal the decision to the Central Office School Liability Appeals Board within 60 days from the date of the letter to the educational institution containing notice of the decision. The 60-day time limit may be extended to 90 days at the discretion of the chairperson of the Committee on School Liability. The appeal must be in writing setting forth fully the alleged errors of fact and law. If an appeal is not received within the 60-day time limit, the Committee decision is final.

        (h)  An appeal will be forwarded to Central Office where it will be considered by the School Liability Appeals Board. The Board's decision will serve as authority for instituting collection proceedings, if appropriate, or for discontinuing collection proceedings instituted on the basis of the original decision of the Committee on School Liability in any case where the Board reverses a decision made by the Committee that the educational institution is liable.

        (i)  Review by the School Liability Appeals Board is limited to the issues raised by the educational institution and shall be on the record and not de novo in character. The Board may affirm, modify or reverse a decision of the Committee on School Liability or may remand an appeal for further consideration by the appropriate Committee on School Liability. If new and material evidence is discovered while the School Liability Appeals Board is considering a case, the Board may remand the case to the appropriate Committee on School Liability.

        (j)  The School Liability Appeals Board has authority to act for the Secretary in deciding appeals concerning an educational institution's liability for an overpayment. There is no right of additional administrative appeal of a decision of the School Liability Appeals Board.

        § 21.4136   Withdrawals or nonpunitive grades may result in nonpayment.

#### § § 21.4136

        (a)  VA will not pay benefits to an individual for a course from which the individual withdraws or receives a nonpunitive grade which is not used in computing the requirements for graduation unless:

        (1) The individual withdraws because he or she is ordered to active duty; or

        (2) All of the following criteria are met:

        (i) There are mitigating circumstances;

        (ii) The individual submits a description of the circumstances in writing to VA either within one year from the date VA notifies the individual that he or she must submit the mitigating circumstances or at a later date if the individual is able to show good cause why the one-year time limit should be extended to the date on which he or she submitted the description of the mitigating circumstances; and

        (iii) The individual submits evidence supporting the existence of mitigating circumstances within one year of the date that evidence is requested by VA, or at a later date if the individual is able to show good cause why the one-year time limit should be extended to the date on which he or she submitted the evidence supporting the existence of mitigating circumstances.

        (b)  The following circumstances, which are not all inclusive, are representative of those that VA considers to be mitigating provided they prevent the individual from pursuing the program of education continuously:

        (1) An illness of the individual;

        (2) An illness or death in the individual's family;

        (3) An unavoidable geographical transfer resulting from the individual's employment;

        (4) An unavoidable change in the individual's conditions of employment;

        (5) Immediate family or financial obligations beyond the control of the individual that require him or her to suspend pursuit of the program of education to obtain employment;

        (6) Discontinuance of the course by the school;

        (7) Unanticipated active duty for training;

        (8) Unanticipated difficulties in caring for the individual's child or children.

        (c)  If the individual fails to satisfactorily complete a course under 38 U.S.C. 3491(a) without fault, VA will consider the circumstances that caused the failure to be mitigating. This will be the case even if the circumstances were not so severe as to preclude continuous pursuit of a program of education.

        (d)  In the first instance of a withdrawal after May 31, 1989, from a course or courses for which the individual received educational assistance under 38 U.S.C. chapter 32, VA will consider that mitigating circumstances exist with respect to courses totaling not more than six semester hours or the equivalent, and paragraphs (a)(2)(ii) and (a)(2)(iii) of this section will not apply.

        (e)  If the individual withdraws from a course during a drop-add period, VA will consider the circumstances that caused the withdrawal to be mitigating, and paragraphs (a)(2)(ii) and (a)(2)(iii) of this section will not apply.

        § 21.4138   Certifications and release of payments.

#### § § 21.4138

        For the purposes of this section, the Manila Regional Office is considered the VA Regional Processing Office of jurisdiction for educational assistance allowance claims processed under 38 U.S.C. chapter 35 for educational institutions located in the Philippines.

        (a)  (1) VA will make payments of educational assistance in advance when:

        (i) The veteran, servicemember, reservist, or eligible person has specifically requested such a payment;

        (ii) The student is enrolled for half time or more;

        (iii) The educational institution at which the veteran, servicemember, reservist, or eligible person is accepted or enrolled has agreed to and can satisfactorily carry out the provisions of 38 U.S.C. 3680(d)(4)(B) and (C) and (5) pertaining to receipt, delivery, or return of checks and certifications of delivery and enrollment;

        (iv) The Director of the VA Regional Processing Office of jurisdiction has not acted under paragraph (a)(4) of this section to prevent advance payments being made to the veteran's, servicemember's, reservist's, or eligible person's educational institution;

        (v) There is no evidence in the veteran's, servicemember's, reservist's, or eligible person's claim file showing that he or she is not eligible for an advance payment;

        (vi) The period for which the veteran, servicemember, reservist, or eligible person has requested a payment either—

        (A) Is preceded by an interval of nonpayment of 30 days or more; or

        (B) Is the beginning of a school year that is preceded by a period of nonpayment of 30 days or more; and

        (vii) The educational institution or the veteran, servicemember, reservist, or eligible person has submitted the certification required by § 21.7151.

        (2) The amount of the advance payment to a veteran, reservist, or eligible person is the educational assistance for the month or fraction thereof in which the term or course will begin plus the educational assistance for the following month. The amount of the advance payment to a servicemember is the amount payable for the entire term, quarter, or semester, as applicable.

        (3) VA will mail advance payments to the educational institution for delivery to the veteran, servicemember, reservist, or eligible person. The educational institution will not deliver the advance payment check more than 30 days in advance of the first date of the period for which VA makes the advance payment.

        (4) The Director of the VA Regional Processing Office of jurisdiction may direct that advance payments not be made to individuals attending an educational institution if:

        (i) The educational institution demonstrates an inability to comply with the requirements of paragraph (a)(3) of this section;

        (ii) The educational institution fails to provide adequately for the safekeeping of the advance payment checks before delivery to the veteran, servicemember, reservist, or eligible person or return to VA; or

        (iii) The Director determines, based on compelling evidence, that the educational institution has demonstrated its inability to discharge its responsibilities under the advance payment program.

        (b)  A lump-sum payment is a payment of all educational assistance due for an entire quarter, semester, or term. VA will make a lump-sum payment to:

        (1) A veteran or servicemember pursuing a program of education at less than the half-time rate under 38 U.S.C. chapter 30;

        (2) A servicemember pursuing a program of education at the half-time rate or greater under 38 U.S.C. chapter 30, provided that VA did not make an advance payment to the servicemember for the term for which a lump-sum payment would otherwise be due; and

        (3) An eligible person pursuing a program of education at less than the half-time rate under 38 U.S.C. chapter 35.

        (c)-(d) [Reserved]

        (e)  An individual must be pursuing a program of education in order to receive payments. To ensure that this is the case the provisions of this paragraph must be met.

        (1) VA will pay educational assistance to an individual (other than one pursuing a program of apprenticeship or other on-job training or a correspondence course, one who qualifies for an advance payment or one who qualifies for a lump-sum payment) only after—

        (i) The educational institution has certified his or her enrollment as provided in § 21.4203; and

        (ii) VA has received from the individual a verification of the individual's enrollment or verification of pursuit and continued enrollment, as appropriate. Generally, this verification will be required monthly, resulting in monthly payments.

        (2) VA will pay educational assistance to an individual pursuing a program of apprenticeship or other on-job training only after—

        (i) The training establishment has certified his or her enrollment in the training program as provided in § 21.4203; and

        (ii) VA has received from the training establishment a certification of hours worked.

        (3) VA will pay educational assistance to an individual who is pursuing a correspondence course only after—

        (i) The educational institution has certified his or her enrollment;

        (ii) VA has received from the individual a certification as to the number of lessons completed and serviced by the educational institution; and

        (iii) VA has received from the educational institution a certification or an endorsement on the individual's certificate, as to the number of lessons completed by the individual and serviced by the educational institution.

        (f)  VA may authorize payment for an _interval_ or for a temporary school closing that occurs within a certified enrollment period. If a school closing that is or may be temporary occurs during an interval, VA will apply any applicable provisions in paragraphs (f)(1) through (f)(5) of this section concerning intervals and in paragraph (f)(6) of this section concerning temporary school closings. For the purposes of this paragraph,  means a period without instruction between consecutive school terms, quarters, or semesters or a period without instruction between a summer term and a term, quarter, or semester. (See definitions of divisions of the school year in § 21.4200(b).)

        (1)  In determining whether a student will be paid for an interval, VA will first review the provisions of paragraph (f)(2) of this section. If none of the provisions apply, VA will review the provisions of paragraphs (f)(3), (f)(4), and (f)(5) of this section to determine if payments may be made for the interval. In determining the length of a summer term, VA will disregard a fraction of a week consisting of 3 days or less, and will consider 4 days or more to be a full week.

        (2)  VA will make no payment for an interval if:

        (i) The student is training at less than the half-time rate on the last day of training during the term, quarter, semester, or summer term preceding the interval;

        (ii) The student is on active duty;

        (iii) The student requests, prior to authorization of an award or prior to negotiating the check, that no benefits be paid for the interval period;

        (iv) The student's entitlement applicable to such payment will be exhausted by receipt of such payment, and it is to the advantage of the student not to receive payment;

        (v) The interval occurs between school years at a school that is not organized on a term, quarter, or semester basis,

        (vi) The student withdraws from all courses in the term, quarter, semester, or summer session preceding the interval, or discontinues training before the scheduled start of an interval in a school not organized on a term, quarter, or semester basis; or

        (vii) The student receives an accelerated payment for the term, quarter, semester, or summer session preceding the interval.

        (3)  If the student transfers from one approved school for the purpose of enrolling in and pursuing a similar course at the second school, VA may make payments for an interval that does not exceed 30 days. If the student does not enroll in a similar course at the second school, VA may not make payments for the interval.

        (4)  (i) If the student remains enrolled at the same school, VA may make payment for an interval which does not exceed 8 weeks and which occurs between:

        (A) Semesters or quarters,

        (B) A semester or quarter and a term that is at least as long as the interval,

        (C) A semester or quarter and a summer term that is at least as long as the interval,

        (D) Consecutive terms (other than semesters or quarters) provided that both terms are at least as long as the interval, or

        (E) A term and summer term provided that both the term and the summer term are at least as long as the interval.

        (ii) If the student remains enrolled at the same school, VA may make payment for an interval that does not exceed 30 days and that occurs between summer sessions within a summer term.

        (5)  (i) If a student is enrolled in overlapping enrollment periods whether before or after an interval (either at the same or different schools), VA will determine whether the student is entitled to payment for the interval between the overlapping enrollment periods, and what dates the interval and enrollment periods will be considered to begin and end, as follows:

        (A) By treating the ending date of each enrollment period as though it were the student's last date of training before the interval,

        (B) By treating the beginning date of each enrollment period as though it were the student's first date of training after the interval,

        (C) By examining the interval payment that would be made to the student on the basis of the various combinations of beginning and ending dates, and

        (D) By choosing the ending date and beginning date that result in the highest payment rate as the start and finish of the interval for VA measurement purposes.

        (ii) VA will not reduce the interval rate of payment as a result of training the student may take during the interval, but VA will increase the interval rate of payment if warranted by such training.

        (6)  VA may authorize payment for temporary school closings that are due to emergencies (including strikes) or established policy based upon an Executive Order of the President. If a school closing that is or may be temporary occurs in whole or in part during an interval, VA will first review the provisions of paragraphs (f)(2) through (f)(5) of this section to determine if payment may be continued during the interval.

        (i) If payment would not be inconsistent with the provisions of paragraphs (f)(2) through (f)(5) of this section, a determination to authorize payment for a period of a temporary school closing, or to not authorize payment if, in the judgment of the VA official specified in this paragraph, either the school closing will not be temporary or payment would not otherwise be in accord with this section, or both, will be made by:

        (A) The Director of the VA Regional Processing Office of jurisdiction if:

        () The reason for the school closing does not result in the closing of a school or schools in the jurisdiction of the Director of another VA Regional Processing Office, and

        () If the reason for the closing is a strike, the strike has lasted 30 days or less and is not anticipated to last more than 30 days.

        (B) The Director, Education Service if:

        () The reason for the school closing results in the closing of schools in the jurisdiction of more than one Director of a VA Regional Processing Office, or

        () The reason for the closing is a strike and the strike lasts, or is anticipated to last, more than 30 days.

        (ii) A school that disagrees with a decision made under paragraph (f)(6) of this section may request an administrative review. The review request must be submitted in writing and received by the Director of the VA Regional Processing Office of jurisdiction within one year of the date of VA's letter notifying the school of the decision. A review of the decision will include the evidence of record and any other pertinent evidence the school may wish to submit. The affirmation or reversal of the initial decision based on an administrative review is final. The review will be conducted by the—

        (A) Director, Education Service, if the Director of the VA Regional Processing Office of jurisdiction made the initial decision to continue or discontinue payments.

        (B) Under Secretary for Benefits, if the Director, Education Service, made the initial decision to continue or discontinue payments.

#### § § 21.4145

        (a)  (1) A veteran or reservist pursuing a program of education under either 38 U.S.C. chapter 30, 32 or 33 or 10 U.S.C. chapter 1606 at a rate of three-quarter time or full time is eligible to receive a work-study allowance.

        (2) An eligible person is eligible to receive a work-study allowance when-

        (d)  In return for the veteran's, reservist's, or eligible person's agreement to perform services for VA totaling not more than 25 hours times the number of weeks contained in an enrollment period, VA will pay an allowance in an amount equal to the higher of:

        (1) The hourly minimum wage in effect under section 6(a) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. 206(a)) times the number of hours the veteran, reservist, or eligible person has agreed to work; or

        (2) The hourly minimum wage under comparable law of the State in which the services are to be performed times the number of hours the veteran, reservist, or eligible person has agreed to work.

        (e)  VA will pay in advance an amount equal to the lesser of the following:

        (1) 40 percent of the total amount payable under the contract; or

        (g)  (1) If the veteran, reservist, or eligible person terminates all training before completing an agreement, the Director of the Department of Veterans Affairs facility or designee:

        (ii) Will not permit him or her to complete that portion of an agreement for which no advance has been made.

        (2) The veteran, reservist, or eligible person must complete the portion of an agreement in the same or immediately following term, quarter or semester in which the veteran, reservist, or eligible person terminates training.

        (h)  (1) If the veteran, reservist, or eligible person has received an advance for hours of unperformed service, and the Department of Veterans Affairs has evidence that he or she does not intend to perform that service, the advance:

        (i) Will be a debt due the United States, and

        § 21.4146   Assignments of benefits prohibited.

#### § § 21.4146

        (a)  Section 5301(a), Title 38 U.S.C., provides that payments of benefits due or to become due under the laws administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs shall not be assigned, except to the extent specifically authorized by law. No law specifically authorizes assignments of educational assistance allowances payable under 38 U.S.C. chapters 30, 32, 33, 35, or 36, or 10 U.S.C. chapter 1606, and therefore none shall be made.

        (b)  In any case where a payee of an educational assistance allowance has designated the address of an attorney-in-fact as the payee's address for the purpose of receiving his or her benefit check and has executed a power of attorney giving the attorney-in-fact authority to negotiate such benefit check, such action shall be deemed to be an assignment and is prohibited.

        (c)  Payments may be made to a post office box address or a bank address only if the educational institution (other than an organization or entity offering a licensing or certification test) attests that it has not entered into an assignment agreement with the student, and is not the attorney-in-fact of the student with power to negotiate an educational assistance check on behalf of the student and is not otherwise able to control the proceeds of the benefits check. Such statements shall be subject to review and when determined to be false, may be cause for creation of an overpayment to the account of the veteran or other eligible person, for which the educational institution (other than an organization or entity offering a licensing or certification test) may be liable under the provisions of § 21.4009.

        (d)  A request by a veteran or other eligible person to send the benefit check payable to him or her at an address which is an educational institution primarily engaged in correspondence course instruction will be presumed not to be the actual address of the veteran or other eligible person and will not be honored. Benefits checks will not be sent to the veteran or other eligible person in that event until a new address is provided designating the individual's mailing address.

        (e)  When the evidence of record indicates that an educational institution has violated the terms of this section, the matter will be referred to the facility Committee on Educational Allowances as provided in §§ 21.4210(g) and 21.4212.

#### § § 21.4151

        (a) The Department of Veterans Affairs and the State approving agencies will take cognizance of the fact that definite duties, functions and responsibilities are conferred upon each of them. To assure that programs of education are administered effectively and efficiently, the cooperation of the Department of Veterans Affairs and the State approving agencies is essential.

        (7) Any expense for supervision or other services to be covered by contract which are already being reimbursed or paid from tuition funds under this law.

        (e)  A request by a State approving agency for reimbursement under the law will be subject to the requirements of 41 CFR 8-7.5101-8 as to “Equal Opportunity”. The request will be accompanied by the proposed plan of operation and the specific duties and responsibilities of all personnel for which reimbursement of salaries and travel expense is required.

        (1) The Department of Veterans Affairs will determine personnel requirements for which the Department of Veterans Affairs provides reimbursement on the basis of estimated workloads agreed upon between the Department of Veterans Affairs and the State agency.

If the State disagrees, the State may request the Contracting Officer to reconsider his or her decision or may initiate action under the Disputes clause of the contract. See 48 CFR 801.602.

        (g)  The State approving agency reimbursement contract is subject to the Contract Disputes Act of 1978. Disputes arising under, or relating to, the contract will be resolved in accordance with the disputes article of the contract and with appropriate procurement regulations.

        (iii) Review the prototype qualification and performance standards with the State approving agencies no less frequently than once every five years.

        (2) In developing and applying standards described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, a State approving agency may take into consideration the State's merit system requirements and other local requirements and conditions. However, no State approving agency may develop, adopt or apply qualification or performance standards that do not meet the requirements of paragraph (d)(3) of this section.

        (3) The qualification and performance standards adopted by the State approving agency shall describe a level of qualification and performance which shall equal or exceed the level of qualification and performance described in the prototype qualification and performance standards developed by VA with the State approving agencies.

        (d)  This term means a standard college degree given by an accredited college or university based on satisfactory completion of a prescribed program of independent study. The program may require occasional attendance for a workshop or seminar and may include some regular residence course work.

        (e)  The term means an associate or higher degree awarded by:

        (1) An institution of higher learning that is accredited as a collegiate institution by a recognized regional or national accrediting agency; or

        (2) An institution of higher learning that is a  for accreditation, as that term is used by the regional or the national accrediting agencies; or

        (2) Other comparable evidence clearly shows that students commute regularly between the two locations.

        (n)  This term means the state of being on that roll, or file of a school which contains the names of active students.

        (3) Any other place of instruction, training or study designated by the educational institution or training establishment where the veteran or eligible person is enrolled and is pursuing a program of education.

        (r)  This term means study at a site or campus of a college or university, or off-campus at an official resident center, requiring pursuit of regularly scheduled weekly class instruction at the rate of one standard class session per week throughout a standard quarter or semester for one quarter- or one semester-hour credit.

        § 21.4201   Restrictions on enrollment; percentage of students receiving financial support.

#### § § 21.4201

        (a)  Except as otherwise provided in this section the Department of Veterans Affairs shall not approve an enrollment in any course for an eligible veteran, not already enrolled, for any period during which more than 85 percent of the students enrolled in the course are having all or part of their tuition, fees or other charges paid for them by the educational institution or by VA under title 38, U.S.C., or under title 10, U.S.C. This restriction may be waived in whole or in part.

        (b)  The requirements of paragraph (a) of this section apply to all courses not otherwise exempt or waived offered by all educational institutions, regardless of whether the institution is degree-granting, proprietary profit, proprietary nonprofit, eleemosynary, public and/or tax-supported.

        (c)  (1) The following courses or programs are exempt from the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section:

        (i) Any farm cooperative course; and

        (ii) Any course offered by a flying club established, organized and operated pursuant to regulations of a military department of the Armed Forces as  which are governmental instrumentalities.

        (2) The provisions of paragraph (a) of this section apply to the enrollment of a serviceperson in a course leading to a high school diploma, equivalency certificate, or a refresher, remedial or deficiency course, but they do not apply to the enrollment of a veteran in such a course.

        (3) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section do not apply to an approved course which:

        (i) Is offered under contract with the Department of Defense,

        (ii) Is on or immediately adjacent to a military base, or a facility of the National Guard (including the Air National Guard) or the Selected Reserve,

        (iii) Has been approved by the State approving agency of the State:

        (A) Where the base is located or

        (B) Where the parent school is located if the course is offered overseas, and

        (iv) Is available only to:

        (A) Military personnel and their dependents, or

        (B) Military personnel, their dependents and civilian employees of a base located in a State, or

        (C) Persons authorized by the base commander to attend the course provided the base is located outside the United States.

        (D) In the case of a course offered on or immediately adjacent to a facility of the National Guard or the Selected Reserve, members of the National Guard, members of the Selected Reserve and their dependents.

        (4) The provisions of paragraph (a) of this section generally do not apply to a course when the total number of veterans, eligible persons, and reservists receiving assistance under 38 U.S.C. chapters 30, 31, 32, 33, 35 and 36, and 10 U.S.C. chapter 1606, who are enrolled in the educational institution offering the course, equals 35 percent or less of the total student enrollment at the educational institution (computed separately for the main campus and any branch or extension of the institution). However, the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section will apply to such a course when—

        (i) The course is a course of Special Assistance for the Educationally Disadvantaged and a serviceperson enrolls in it, or

        (ii) The Director of the Department of Veterans Affairs facility of jurisdiction has reason to believe that the enrollment of veterans and eligible persons in the course may exceed 85 percent of the total student enrollment in the course.

        (d)  No applications are required for any exemptions except that found in paragraph (c)(4) of this section. To obtain an exemption as stated in paragraph (c)(4) of this section schools must submit reports as required in paragraph (f)(1) of this section.

        (e) —(1)  Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section and in paragraph (e)(3) of this section, an 85-15 percent ratio must be computed for each course of study or curriculum leading to a separately approved educational or vocational objective. Computations will not be made for unit subjects, unless only one unit subject is approved by the State approving agency to be offered at a separate branch or extension of a school. Courses or curricula which are offered at separately approved branches or extensions, as well as courses or curricula leading to a secondary school diploma or equivalency certificate offered at any branch or extension, must have an 85-15 percent ratio computed separately from the same course offered at the parent institution. The count of students attending the branch may not be added to those attending the parent institution even for the same courses or curricula. However, the count of those attending courses or curricula offered at an additional facility, as opposed to a branch or extension, must be added to those attending the same course at the parent institution. Pursuit of a course or curriculum that varies in any way from a similar course, although it may have the same designation as the other similar course or curriculum, will require a separate 85-15 percent computation. A course or curriculum will be considered to vary from another if there are different attendance requirements, required unit subjects are different, required completion length is different, etc.

        (i) Separate courses for computation purposes in institutions of higher learning will be determined by general curriculum only until the point at which it is reasonable to assume a major field would be declared and after that point by specific curriculum.

        (A) General 2-year curricula at 2-year institutions of higher learning, general curricula such as AA (Associate of Arts) or AS (Associate of Science) degrees with no major specified, will require separate computations for each curriculum. Terminal 2-year courses (, AAS (Associate of Applied Science), dental technology or auto mechanics certificate) and other associate degree courses where a field is specified must be computed separately for each objective.

        (B) Students attending 4-year institutions of higher learning and graduate schools may be counted in general curricula such as BA (Bachelor of Art) and BS (Bachelor of Science) only until the normal point at which the school requires the student to declare a major subject. Then the 85-15 percent computation must be made for each specific curriculum, , BS (Bachelor of Science) in electrical engineering, MA (Master of Arts) in English, etc.

        (ii) NCD (noncollege degree) courses must be computed separately by approved vocational objective. If several curricula lead to the same coded vocational objective, each must meet the 85-15 percent requirement separately, unless it can be shown that two or more courses are identical in all respects (scheduling, hours devoted to each unit subject, etc.). Branch or extension courses will be computed separately from courses at the parent facility. Courses offered on a full- and part-time basis which are identical in length and content will be combined for computing the ratio.

        (2)  In accordance with the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section,  are those students enrolled in the course who are having none of their tuition, fees or other charges paid for them by the educational institution, or by VA under title 38, U.S.C., or under title 10, U.S.C., while  are those students enrolled in the course who are in receipt of institutional aid or VA educational assistance benefits ( having all or part of their tuition, fees or other charges paid for them by the educational institution, or by VA under chapter 36, title 38, United States Code, or under title 10, United States Code.).  does not include Federal, state, or municipal grant funding, nor does it include matching funds provided by the educational institution through participation in such Federal, state, or municipal grant programs. Recipients of these funds are to be counted as _non-_supported students__ barring receipt of other institutional aid or VA educational assistance benefits.

        (3)  (i) To determine if the requirement of paragraph (a) of this section has been met for all courses except flight courses the full-time equivalent, nonsupported students as defined by paragraph (e)(2) of this section will be compared to the full-time equivalent students enrolled in the course. If the full-time equivalent, nonsupported students do not equal at least 15 percent of the total full-time enrollment, the 85-15 percent requirement has not been met for the course. If a non-Department of Veterans Affairs student in a correspondence course has not completed a lesson nor made a payment toward the cost of the course during the 6-month period immediately prior to the computation, the student will not be counted in computing the 85-15 percent ratio.

        (ii) The 85-15 percent ratio for flight courses shall be computed by comparing the number of hours of training received by or tuition charged to nonsupported students in the preceding 30 days to the total number of hours of training received by or tuition charged to all students in the same period. All approved courses offered under 14 CFR parts 141 and 142 at a flight school will be considered to be one course for the purpose of making this computation. Similarly, all other approved courses offered at a flight school will be considered to be one course for the purpose of making this computation. In this computation hours of training or tuition charges for students enrolled—

        (A) In the recreational pilot certification course and the private pilot certification course will be excluded;

        (B) In a ground instructor certification course will be included;

        (C) In courses approved under 14 CFR part 141, other than a ground instructor certification course, will be actual hours of logged instructional flight time or the charges for those hours; and

        (D) In courses not approved under 14 CFR part 141, such as courses offered by flight simulator or courses for navigator or flight engineer, shall include ground training time or charges; actual logged instructional flight time or charges; and instructional time in a flight simulator or charges for that training.

        (f)  (1) Schools must submit to VA all calculations (those needed to support the exemption found in paragraph (c)(4) of this section as well as those made under paragraph (e)(3) of this section). If the school is organized on a term, quarter, or semester basis, it shall make that submission no later than 30 days after the beginning of the first term for which the school wants the exemption to apply. If the school is organized on a non-standard term basis, it shall make its submission no later than 30 days after the beginning of the first non-standard term for which the school wishes the exemption to apply. A school having received an exemption found in paragraph (c)(4) of this section shall not be required to certify that 85 percent or less of the total student enrollment in any course is receiving Department of Veterans Affairs assistance:

        (i) Unless the Director of the VA facility of jurisdiction has reason to believe that the enrollment of eligible veterans and eligible persons in a specific course may exceed 85 percent of the total enrollment in a specific course, or

        (ii) Until such time as the total number of veterans, eligible persons and reservists receiving assistance under 38 U.S.C. chapters 30, 31, 32, 33, 35 and 36, and 10 U.S.C. chapter 1606, who are enrolled in the educational institution offering the course, equals more than 35 percent of the total student enrollment at the educational institution (computed separately for the main campus and any branch or extension of the institution). At that time the procedures contained in paragraph (f)(2) of this section shall apply.

        (2) The school must submit all calculations made under paragraph (e)(3) of this section to the Department of Veterans Affairs according to these time limits.

        (i) If the school is organized on a term, quarter or semester basis, the calculations must be submitted no later than 30 days after the beginning of each regular school term (excluding summer sessions), or before the beginning date of the next term, whichever occurs first.

        (ii) If a school is organized on a non-standard term basis, reports must be received by the Department of Veterans Affairs no later than 30 days after the beginning of each non-standard term.

        (g)  (1) The Department of Veterans Affairs will process new enrollments of eligible veterans (and servicepersons where this provision applies to them), in a course on the basis of the school's submission of the most recent computation showing that:

        (i) The 85-15 percent ratio is satisfactory, or

        (ii) The course is exempt under paragraph (c)(4) of this section.

        (2) Except for those enrollments with a beginning date before or the same as the date the school completed the most recent computation, no benefits will be paid under 10 U.S.C. chapter 1606 or under 38 U.S.C. chapter 30, 32, 33, or 36, when that computation establishes that the course:

        (i) Neither has a satisfactory 85-15 percent ratio, nor

        (ii) Is exempt under paragraph (c)(4) of this section.

        (3) If a school fails to submit a timely computation, no benefits will be paid for:

        (i) The enrollment of a serviceperson in a course leading to a secondary school diploma or an equivalency certificate if the enrollment has beginning dates beyond the expiration of the allowable computation period, or

        (ii) The enrollment of a veteran in any course to which the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section apply if the enrollment has beginning dates beyond the expiration of the allowable computation period.

        (4) Enrollments with later beginning dates may be processed only after the school certifies that:

        (i) The proper ratio has been reestablished for the course, or

        (ii) The course is exempt from the requirement under paragraph (c)(4) of this section.

        (5) When a school shows a reestablished 85-15 percent ratio, each new veteran enrollment or enrollment of a serviceperson in a course leading to a secondary school diploma or an equivalency certificate which is submitted after reestablishment must be individually computed into the ratio to ensure that the 85 percent limitation is not again immediately exceeded. The Department of Veterans Affairs will require individual computations until:

        (i) The end of the term for which the ratio was reestablished, or

        (ii) The end of the calendar quarter during which the ratio was reestablished if the school is not operated on a term, quarter or semester basis.

        (6) Once a student is properly enrolled in a course which either meets the 85-15 percent requirement or which is exempt pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section, such a student may not have benefits for that course terminated because the 85-15 percent requirement subsequently is not met or because the course loses its exemption, as long as the student's enrollment remains continuous. A student enrolled in an institution organized on a term basis need not attend summer sessions in order to maintain continuous enrollment. An enrollment may also be considered continuous if a “break” in enrollment is wholly due to circumstances beyond the student's control such as serious illness.

        (h)  Schools which desire a waiver of the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section for a course where the number of full-time equivalent supported students receiving VA education benefits equals or exceeds 85 percent of the total full-time equivalent enrollment in the course may apply for a waiver to the Director, Education Service. When applying, a school must submit sufficient information to allow the Director, Education Service, to judge the merits of the request against the criteria shown in this paragraph. This information and any other pertinent information available to VA shall be considered in relation to these criteria:

        (1) Availability of comparable alternative educational facilities effectively open to veterans in the vicinity of the school requesting a waiver.

        (2) General effectiveness of the school's program in providing educational and employment opportunities to the particular veteran population it serves. Factors to be considered should include, but are not limited to: percentage of veteran-students completing the entire course, graduate employment statistics, graduate salary statistics, satisfaction of Department of Education requirements regarding gainful employment (where applicable), other Department of Education metrics (such as student loan default rate), student complaints, industry endorsements, participation in and compliance with the Principles of Excellence program, established by Executive Order 13607 (where applicable), etc.

        (3) Whether the educational institution's aid program appears to be consistent with or appears to undermine the 85/15 rule's tuition and fee costs market validation mechanism.

        (3) An educational institution which disagrees with a decision of a Director of a VA facility as to whether it may delay reporting enrollments or reenrollments as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section may ask to have that decision reviewed by the Director, Education Service. That request must be made in writing to the Director of the VA facility within one year of the date of the letter notifying the educational institution of the original decision.

        (4) An educational institution which, under paragraph (a)(2) of this section, is delaying the reporting of the enrollment or reenrollment of a veteran shall provide the veteran with notice of the delay at the time that the veteran enrolls or reenrolls.

        (5) In addition, educational institutions must—

        (i) Verify enrollment for each veteran and eligible person receiving an advance payment; and

        (ii) Verify the delivery of advance payment check and education loan check for each veteran and eligible person receiving an advance payment or loan.

        (6) Nothing in this section or in any section in 38 CFR part 21 shall be construed as requiring any institution of higher learning to maintain daily attendance records for any course leading to a standard college degree.

        (b)  All the reports required by this paragraph shall be in a form specified by the Secretary.

        (1) VA requires that educational institutions report all entrances and reentrances on a certification of enrollment.

        (2) All educational institutions, regardless of the way in which they are organized, must clearly specify the course in which the veteran or eligible person is enrolled.

        (3) Schools organized on a term, quarter or semester basis—

        (i) May report enrollment for the term, quarter, semester, ordinary school year plus the following summer term.

        (ii) May not report enrollment for a period that exceeds the ordinary school year plus the following summer term.

        (iii) Must report the dates for the break between terms if—

        (A) The certification covers two or more terms, and a term ends and the following term does not begin in the same or the next calendar month;

        (B) The veteran or eligible person elects not to be paid for the intervals between terms;

        (C) The certification covers two or more summer sessions; or

        (D) The certification covers at least one summer session and at least one term which is not a standard semester or quarter.

        (iv) Must submit a separate enrollment certification for each term, quarter or semester if the student—

        (A) Is a veteran or eligible person pursuing a program on a less than half-time basis, or

        (B) Is a serviceperson.

        (v) Where a veteran or an eligible person, who is pursuing a course leading to a standard college degree, transfers between consecutive school terms from one approved institution to another approved institution, for the purpose of enrolling in, and pursuing, a similar course at the second institution, the veteran or eligible person shall, for the purpose of entitlement to the payment of educational assistance allowance be considered to be enrolled at the first institution during the interval, if the interval does not exceed 30 days, following the termination date of the school term of the first institution.

        (c)  A school may assign a nonpunitive grade for a course or subject in which the veteran or eligible person is enrolled even though the veteran or eligible person does not withdraw from the course or subject. When this occurs, the school must report the assignment of the nonpunitive grade in a form specified by the Secretary in time for VA to receive it before the earlier of the following dates is reached:

        (1) Thirty days from the date on which the school assigns the grade, or

        (2) Sixty days from the last day of the enrollment period for which the nonpunitive grade is assigned.

        (d)  When a veteran or eligible person interrupts or terminates his or her training for any reason, including unsatisfactory conduct or progress, or when he or she changes the number of hours of credit or attendance, this fact must be reported to VA by the school in a form specified by the Secretary.

        (1) If the change in status or change in number of hours of credit of attendance occurs on a day other than one indicated by paragraph (d)(2) or (3) of this section, the school will initiate a report of the change in time for the VA to receive it within 30 days of the date on which the change occurs. If the course in which the veteran or eligible person is enrolled does not lead to a standard college degree, and attendance must be certified for the course, the school may include the information on the monthly certification of attendance.

        (2) If the enrollment of the veteran or eligible person has been certified by the school for more than one term, quarter or semester and the veteran or eligible person interrupts or terminates his or her training at the end of a term, quarter or semester within the certified period of enrollment, the school shall report the change in status to the Department of Veterans Affairs in time for the Department of Veterans Affairs to receive the report within 30 days of the last officially scheduled registration date for the next term, quarter or semester.

        (3) If the change in status or change in the number of hours of credit or attendance occurs during the 30 days of a drop-add period, the school must report the change in status or change in the number of hours of credit or attendance to the Department of Veterans Affairs in time for the Department of Veterans Affairs to receive the report within 30 days from the last date of drop-add period or 60 days from the first day of the enrollment period, whichever occurs first.

        (e)  Where the course in which a veteran is enrolled under 38 U.S.C. chapter 34 or a spouse or surviving spouse is enrolled under 38 U.S.C. chapter 35 is pursued exclusively by correspondence, the school will report by an endorsement on the veteran's or eligible spouse's or surviving spouse's certification the number of lessons completed by the veteran, spouse or surviving spouse and serviced by the school. Such reports will be submitted quarterly in a form specified by the Secretary.

        (f)  All reports required by this paragraph must be in a form specified by the Secretary.

        (1)  (i) Except as provided in this paragraph VA requires that a certification of attendance be submitted monthly for each veteran or eligible person enrolled in a course not leading to a standard college degree. The fact that the course may be pursued on a quarter, semester or term basis will not relieve the veteran or eligible person and the school of this requirement. Unless exempted by this paragraph this requirement also applies to courses measured on a credit-hour basis. This requirement does not apply to—

        (A) Courses measured on a credit-hour basis pursuant to footnote 6 of § 21.4270(a),

        (B) A course pursued on a less than one-half-time basis,

        (C) A course pursued by a serviceperson while on active duty, or

        (D) A correspondence course which must meet the requirements of paragraph (e) of this section.

        (2)  Schools which have veterans or eligible persons enrolled in courses which lead to a standard college degree are not required to submit periodic certifications for students enrolled in such courses. Certifications are, however, required under paragraphs (b), (c), (d) and (h) of this section.

        (3)  A certification of attendance must be submitted monthly during the period of enrollment in the same manner as certifications required in paragraph (f)(1) of this section.

        (g)  Where the course consists exclusively of flight training, the school will report by an endorsement on the veteran's certification the type and number of hours of actual flight training received by, and the cost thereof to, the veteran. Such reports may be submitted monthly.

        (h)  At times the unsatisfactory progress, conduct or attendance of a veteran or eligible person is caused by or results in his or her interruption or termination of training. If this occurs, the interruption or termination shall be reported in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section. If the veteran or eligible person continues in training despite unsatisfactory progress, conduct, or despite having failed to meet the regularly prescribed standards of attendance at the school, the school must report the fact of his or her unsatisfactory progress, conduct or attendance to VA within the time limit allowed by paragraph (h) (1) and (2) of this section.

        (1) A veteran's or eligible person's progress may become unsatisfactory according to the regularly prescribed standards and practices of the school as a result of the grades he or she receives The school shall report such unsatisfactory progress to VA in time for VA to receive it before the earlier of the following dates is reached:

        (i) Thirty days from the date on which the school official, who is responsible for determining whether a student is making progress, first received the final grade report which establishes that the veteran either is not progressing satisfactorily, or

        (ii) Sixty days from the last day of the enrollment period during which the veteran or eligible person earned the grades that caused him or her not to meet the satisfactory progress standards.

        (2) If the unsatisfactory progress, conduct or attendance of the veteran or eligible person is caused by any factors other than the grades which he or she receives, the school shall report the unsatisfactory progress, conduct or attendance to VA in time for VA to receive it within 30 days of the date on which the progress, conduct or attendance of the veteran or eligible person becomes unsatisfactory.

        (1) For the ordinary school year or the complete course, the periodic certification will show the intervals between terms, quarters, or semesters as absences.

        (2) By term, quarter, or semester, the periodic certification will not cover the intervals between terms, quarters, or semesters.

        (d)  The periodic certifications will show any vacation period or interval between periods of instruction as absences. The periodic certification will not cover the period between school years.

        (e)  The monthly certification will cover only those periods of classroom instruction which are included in the prescheduled institutional portion of the course.

        § 21.4206   Reporting fee.

#### § § 21.4206

        VA may pay annually to each educational institution furnishing education or each joint apprenticeship training committee acting as a training establishment under 10 U.S.C. chapter 1606 or 38 U.S.C. chapter 30, 32, 33, 35 or 36 a reporting fee for required reports or certifications. The reporting fee will be paid as soon as feasible after the end of the calendar year.

        (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section the reporting fee will be computed for each calendar year by multiplying $7.00 by the number of eligible veterans and eligible persons enrolled under 10 U.S.C. chapter 1606, or 38 U.S.C. chapter 30, 32, 33, 35 or 36 during that calendar year.

        (b) In computing the reporting fee VA will not count a veteran or servicemember whose only receipt of educational assistance under 38 U.S.C. chapter 30 during a calendar year was tuition assistance top-up.

        (c) An additional $4 will be paid to those institutions which have delivered to the veteran or eligible person at registration the educational assistance check representing an advance payment, or which have delivered educational loan checks in accordance with the provisions of subpart F. If an institution delivers both an advance payment check and educational loan check(s) to the same veteran or eligible person within 1 calendar year, it shall receive only one additional $4 fee. In order to receive this fee, the institution shall submit to the Department of Veterans Affairs a certification of delivery of each check. If an advance payment check is not delivered within 30 days after commencement of the student's program, the check is to be returned to the Department of Veterans Affairs. If an education loan check is not delivered within 30 days of the date the educational institution received it, the check shall be returned to the Department of Veterans Affairs.

        (d) No reporting fee payable to an educational institution under this section shall be subject to offset by the Department of Veterans Affairs against any liability of the educational institution for any overpayment which the Department of Veterans Affairs has administratively determined to exist unless the liability of the educational institution was not contested by the educational institution or was upheld by a final decree of a court of appropriate jurisdiction.

        (e) Before payment of a reporting fee the Department of Veterans Affairs will require an educational institution to certify that:

        (1) It has exercised reasonable diligence in determining whether it or any course offered by it approved for the enrollment of veterans or eligible persons meets all of the applicable requirements of chapter 1606 of title 10 U.S.C. or chapters 30, 32, 33, 35 and 36 of title 38, U.S.C.; and

        (2) It will, without delay, report any failure to meet any requirement to the Department of Veterans Affairs.

        (3) The records of other individuals who took a licensing or certification test that VA believes are necessary to ascertain whether the veterans and eligible persons taking such test were reimbursed the correct amount.

        (b)  Each educational institution must upon request of duly authorized representatives of the Government make available for examination all appropriate records and accounts, including but not limited to:

        (1) Records and accounts which are evidence of tuition and fees charged to and received from or on behalf of all veterans, reservists, and eligible persons and from other students similarly circumstanced;

        (2) Records of previous education or training of veterans, reservists, and eligible persons at the time of admission as students and records of advance credit, if any, granted by the educational institution at the time of admission;

        (3) Records of the veteran's, reservists's, or eligible person's grades and progress;

        (4) Records of all advertising, sales or enrollment materials as required by § 21.4252(h) and section 3696(b), title 38 U.S.C.;

Each training establishment that has enrolled veterans under 38 U.S.C. chapter 30, 32, or 33, reservists under 10 U.S.C. chapter 1606, or eligible persons under 38 U.S.C. chapter 35 must also make available payroll records.

        (d)  The educational institution having veterans or eligible persons enrolled in nonaccredited courses must make available, in addition to the records and accounts required in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section the following:

        (1) Records of interruptions for unsatisfactory conduct or attendance.

        (2) Records of refunds of tuition, fees and other charges made to a veteran or eligible person who fails to enter the course or withdraws or is discontinued prior to completion of the course.

        (e)  Failure to make such records available as provided in this section will be grounds for discontinuing the payment of educational assistance allowance or special training allowance.

        (f)  (1) Except as provided in paragraph (f)(2) of this section, an educational institution must keep records and accounts, including those pertaining to students not receiving benefits from VA, as described in this section, pertaining to each period of enrollment of a veteran, reservist, or eligible person. If those records are not available electronically, the paper records must be kept intact and in good condition at the educational institution for at least 3 years following the end of each enrollment period. If the records are stored electronically, the paper records may be stored at another site. The electronic records must be easily accessible at the educational institution for at least 3 years following the end of each enrollment period.

        (2) An organization or entity offering a licensing or certification test must keep records and accounts intact and in good condition that are needed to show that veterans and eligible persons have been paid correctly for taking licensing or certification tests. The organization or entity must keep those records, at a site mutually agreed on, for at least 3 years following the date of the test.

        (3) An educational institution will not be required under this section to retain records for longer than 3 years unless the educational institution receives from the Government Accountability Office or VA not later than 30 days before the end of the 3-year period a written request for longer retention.

        § 21.4210   Suspension and discontinuance of educational assistance payments, and of enrollments or reenrollments for pursuit of approved courses.

#### § § 21.4210

        (a)  (1) VA may pay educational assistance to a reservist under 10 U.S.C. chapter 1606 for the reservist's pursuit of a course approved in accordance with the provisions of 38 U.S.C. chapter 36. VA may pay educational assistance under 38 U.S.C. chapter 32 or 35 to a veteran or eligible person for the individual's pursuit of a course approved in accordance with the provisions of 38 U.S.C. chapter 36; or if the individual has taken a licensing or certification test approved in accordance with the provisions of 38 U.S.C. chapter 36. VA may pay educational assistance under 38 U.S.C. chapter 30 to a veteran or servicemember for the individual's pursuit of a course approved in accordance with the provisions of 38 U.S.C. chapter 36; if the individual has taken a licensing or certification test approved in accordance with the provisions of 38 U.S.C. chapter 36 or if the individual is entitled to be paid benefits (tuition assistance top-up) to meet all or a portion of an educational institution's charges for education or training that the military department concerned has not covered under tuition assistance. VA may pay educational assistance under 38 U.S.C. chapter 33 to an eligible individual or, as appropriate, to the individual's institution of higher learning on his or her behalf, for the individual's pursuit of a course or program of education if the course or program of education is offered by an institution of higher learning and approved under 38 U.S.C. chapter 30 in accordance with the provisions of 38 U.S.C. chapter 36; if the individual has taken a licensing or certification test approved in accordance with the provisions of 38 U.S.C. chapter 36, or if an individual is entitled to be paid educational assistance to meet all or a portion of the institution of higher learning's established charges that the military department concerned has not covered by tuition assistance under 10 U.S.C. 2007(a) or (c). Except for tuition assistance top-up, where courses do not need to be approved, a State approving agency designated by VA, or in some instances VA, approves the course or test for payment purposes. Notwithstanding such approval, VA, as provided in paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section, may suspend, discontinue, or deny payment of benefits to any or all otherwise eligible individuals for pursuit of a course or training approved under 38 U.S.C. chapter 36, and for taking a licensing or certification test approved under 38 U.S.C. chapter 36.

        (2) For the purposes of this section and the purposes of §§ 21.4211 through 21.4216, except as otherwise expressly stated to the contrary—

        (i) The term “course” includes an apprenticeship or other on-job training program;

        (ii) The term “educational institution” includes a training establishment, or organization or entity offering a licensing or certification test; and

        (iii) Reference to action suspending, discontinuing, or otherwise denying enrollment or reenrollment means such action with respect to providing educational assistance under the chapters listed in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.

        (b)  (1) VA may deny payment of educational assistance to a specific individual for pursuit of a course or courses if, following an examination of the individual's case, VA has credible evidence affecting that individual that—

        (i) The course fails to meet any of the requirements of 10 U.S.C. chapter 1606, or 38 U.S.C. chapter 30, 32, 33, 35, or 36; or

        (ii) The educational institution offering the individual's course has violated any of those requirements of law.

        (2) VA may deny payment of educational assistance to a specific individual for taking a licensing or certification test if, following an examination of the individual's case, VA has credible evidence affecting that individual that—

        (i) The test fails to meet any of the requirements of 38 U.S.C. 3689; or

        (ii) The organization or entity offering the individual's test has violated any of the requirements of 38 U.S.C. 3689.

        (c)  Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, when VA denies payment of educational assistance to an individual under paragraph (b) of this section, VA will provide concurrent written notice to the individual. The notice shall state—

        (1) The adverse action;

        (2) The reasons for the action; and

        (3) The individual's right to an opportunity to be heard thereon in accordance with part 19 of this title.

        (d)  (1) The Director of the VA Regional Processing Office of jurisdiction may:

        (i) Suspend payments of educational assistance to all veterans, servicemembers, reservists, or eligible persons already enrolled in a course;

        (ii) Disapprove all further enrollments or reenrollments of individuals seeking VA educational assistance for pursuit of the course (except for enrollments and reenrollments of servicemembers seeking to be paid benefits (tuition assistance top-up) to meet all or a portion of an educational institution's charges for education or training that the military department concerned has not covered under tuition assistance); and

        (iii) Suspend payments of educational assistance to all veterans, servicemembers, or eligible persons who may take a licensing or certification test after a date that the Director may determine.

        (2) Except as provided in paragraphs (d)(3) and (i) of this section, the decision to act as described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section must be based on evidence of a substantial pattern of veterans, servicemembers, reservists, or eligible persons enrolled in the course or taking the test receiving educational assistance to which they are not entitled because:

        (i) One or more of the course approval requirements of 38 U.S.C. chapter 36 are not met, including the course approval requirements specified in §§ 21.4253, 21.4254, 21.4261, 21.4262, 21.4263, 21.4264, and 21.4268; or

        (ii) The educational institution offering the course has violated one or more of the recordkeeping or reporting requirements of 10 U.S.C. chapter 1606, or of 38 U.S.C. chapters 30, 32, 33, 35, and 36. These violations may include, but are not limited to, the following:

        (A) Willful and knowing submission of false reports or certifications concerning students or courses of education;

        (B) Failure to report to VA a veteran's, servicemember's, reservist's, or eligible person's reduction, discontinuance, or termination of education or training; or

        (C) Submission of improper or incorrect reports in such number, manner, or period of time as to indicate negligence on its part, including failure to maintain an adequate reporting or recordkeeping system.

        (3) The Director also may make a decision to take the action described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section when the Director has evidence that one or more prohibited assignments of benefits have occurred at an educational institution as a result of that educational institution's policy. This decision may be made regardless of whether there is a substantial pattern of erroneous payments at the educational institution. See § 21.4146.

        (4) The Director may disapprove the enrollment of all individuals not already enrolled in an educational institution (which for the purposes of this paragraph does not include a training establishment) when the Director finds that the educational institution:

        (i) Has charged or received from veterans, servicemembers, reservists, or eligible persons an amount for tuition and fees in excess of the amount similarly circumstanced nonveterans are required to pay for the same course; or

        (ii) Has instituted a policy or practice with respect to the payment of tuition, fees, or other established charges that substantially denies to veterans, servicemembers, reservists, or other eligible persons the benefits of advance payment of educational assistance authorized to such individuals under § 21.4138(a), § 21.7140(a), § 21.7640(d), or § 21.9680; or

        (iii) Has used erroneous, deceptive, or misleading practices as set forth in § 21.4252(h).

        (e)  (1) The Director of the VA Regional Processing Office of jurisdiction may suspend payment of educational assistance and may suspend approval of new enrollments and reenrollments as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, only after:

        (i) The Director notifies in writing the State approving agency concerned and the educational institution of any failure to meet the approval requirements and any violation of recordkeeping or reporting requirements; and

        (ii) The educational institution—

        (A) Refuses to take corrective action; or

        (B) Does not take corrective action within 60 days (or 90 days if permitted by the Director).

        (2) Not less than 30 days before the Director acts to make a mass suspension of payments of educational assistance and/or suspend approval of new enrollments and reenrollments, the Director will, to the maximum extent feasible, provide written notice to each veteran, servicemember, reservist, and eligible person enrolled in the affected courses. The notice will:

        (i) State the Director's intent to suspend payments and/or suspend approval of new enrollments and reenrollments unless the educational institution takes corrective action;

        (ii) Give the reasons why the Director intends to suspend payments and/or suspend approval of new enrollments and reenrollments; and

        (iii) State the date on which the Director intends to suspend payments and/or suspend approval of new enrollments and reenrollments.

        (3) If VA receives a claim for educational assistance for the taking by an individual of a licensing or certification test, and the individual took the licensing or certification test during a period when payment for taking such test was suspended, the Director will inform the individual in writing of the fact of the suspension and the reasons why payments were suspended.

        (f)  The Director of the VA Regional Processing Office of jurisdiction will take the following action, as indicated, that may be in addition to suspending payments or further approval of enrollments or reenrollments in a course or educational institution.

        (1) If the Director has evidence indicating that an educational institution has willfully submitted a false or misleading claim, or that a veteran, servicemember, reservist, eligible person, or other person, with the complicity of an educational institution, has submitted such a claim, the Director will make a complete report of the facts of the case to the appropriate State approving agency and to the Office of Inspector General for appropriate action.

        (2) If the Director believes that an educational institution has submitted a false, fictitious, or fraudulent claim or written statement within the meaning of the Program Fraud Civil Remedies Act (31 U.S.C. 3801-3812) or that a veteran, servicemember, reservist, eligible person, or other person, with the complicity of an educational institution, has submitted such a claim or made such a written statement, the Director will follow the procedures in part 42 of this title.

        (g)  The Director of the VA Regional Processing Office of jurisdiction will refer the following matters to the Committee on Educational Allowances as provided in § 21.4212:

        (1) A suspension under paragraph (d) of this section of payments of educational assistance to all veterans, servicemembers, reservists, or eligible persons already enrolled in a course;

        (2) A disapproval under paragraph (d) of this section of all further enrollments or reenrollments of individuals seeking VA educational assistance for pursuit of the course (except for enrollments and reenrollments of servicemembers seeking to be paid tuition assistance top-up benefits to meet all or a portion of an educational institution's charges for education or training that the military department concerned has not covered under tuition assistance); and

        (3) A suspension under paragraph (d) of this section of payments of educational assistance to all veterans, servicemembers, or eligible persons who may take a licensing or certification test after a date that the Director has determined.

        (h)  (1) If, following a suspension of payments and/or of approval of enrollments or reenrollments, the Director of the VA Regional Processing Office of jurisdiction determines that the conditions which justified the suspension have been corrected, and the State approving agency has not withdrawn or suspended approval of the course(s) or test(s), the Director may resume payments to and/or approval of enrollments or reenrollments of the affected veterans, servicemembers, reservists, or eligible persons. If the case has already been referred to the Committee on Educational Allowances under paragraph (g) of this section at the time such action is taken, the Director will advise the Committee that the original referral is withdrawn.

        (2) If, following a referral to the Committee on Educational Allowances, the Director finds that the State approving agency will suspend or withdraw approval, the Director may, if otherwise appropriate, advise the Committee that the original referral is withdrawn.

        (i)  VA will disapprove courses when required by § 21.4005(d) without applying the provisions of paragraphs (a) through (h) of this section.

        § 21.4211   Composition, jurisdiction, and duties of Committee on Educational Allowances.

#### § § 21.4211

        (a)  (1) 38 U.S.C. 3690 authorizes VA to discontinue educational benefits to veterans, servicemembers, reservists, or eligible persons when VA finds that:

        (i) The program of education or course in which such individuals are enrolled fails to meet a requirement of 38 U.S.C. chapter 30, 32, 33, 35, or 36, or 10 U.S.C. chapter 1606, or the regulations in this part; or

        (ii) An educational institution has violated any such statute or regulation, or fails to meet such a statutory or regulatory requirement.

        (2) This authority does not extend to enrollments and reenrollments of individuals seeking to be paid tuition assistance top-up benefits to meet all or a portion of an educational institution's charges for education or training that the military department concerned has not covered under tuition assistance.

        (3) 38 U.S.C. 3689 and 3690 further authorize VA to deny payment to servicemembers or veterans for licensing or certification tests when VA finds that either the test or the organization or entity offering the test fails to meet a requirement of 38 U.S.C. 3689 or the applicable regulations of this part.

        (4) Sections 21.4210 through 21.4216 implement the authority discussed in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(3) of this section.

        (5) Each VA Regional Processing Office shall have a Committee on Educational Allowances. For the purposes of this section, the Manila Regional Office is considered the VA Regional Processing Office of jurisdiction for educational institutions located in the Philippines. The Committee's findings of fact and recommendations will be provided to the Director of the VA Regional Processing Office.

        (6) The Secretary of Veterans Affairs delegates to each Director of a VA Regional Processing Office the authority to suspend or discontinue payment of educational benefits, to disapprove enrollments or reenrollments, or to deny payment of benefits for tests.

        (b)  (1) The Committee on Educational Allowances is established to assist the Director of the VA Regional Processing Office of jurisdiction in deciding in a specific case whether—

        (i) Educational assistance should be discontinued to all individuals enrolled in any course or courses an educational institution offers; and

        (ii) If appropriate, whether approval of all further enrollments or reenrollments in the course or courses an educational institution offers should be denied to veterans, servicemembers, reservists, or other eligible persons pursuing those courses under programs VA administers; or

        (iii) Payment should be denied to all servicemembers and veterans for taking a specific licensing or certification test.

        (2) A Director's decision described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section must be based on a finding that the educational institution is not meeting, or has violated, a requirement of 38 U.S.C. chapter 30, 32, 33, 35, or 36, or 10 U.S.C. chapter 1606, or the regulations in this part.

        (3) The function of the Committee on Educational Allowances is to develop facts and recommend action to be taken on the basis of the facts found. A hearing before the Committee is not in the nature of a trial in a court of law. Instead, it is an administrative inquiry designed to create a full and complete record upon which a recommendation can be made as to whether the Director should discontinue payment of educational benefits and/or deny approval of new enrollments or reenrollments. Both the interested educational institution and VA Regional Counsel, or designee, representing VA, will be afforded the opportunity to present to the Committee any evidence, argument, or other material considered pertinent.

        (c)  The Committee on Educational Allowances will consider only those cases which are referred in accordance with §§ 21.4210(g) and 21.4212.

        (d)  The Committee on Educational Allowances will consist of three employees of the VA Regional Processing Office of jurisdiction, at least one of whom is familiar with the adjudication of claims for benefits administered by the Veterans Benefits Administration. The Director of the VA Regional Processing Office of jurisdiction will designate a Chairperson. In the event that any member becomes unable to serve for any reason, the Director may appoint a replacement member. Before the Committee resumes its proceedings, the new member will be given an opportunity to apprise himself or herself of the actions and testimony already taken by the Committee.

        (e)  (1) The function of the Committee on Educational Allowances is to make recommendations to the Director of the VA Regional Processing Office of jurisdiction in connection with specific cases referred for consideration as provided in §§ 21.4210(g) and 21.4212.

        (2) The performance of this function will include:

        (i) Hearing testimony or argument from witnesses or representatives of educational institutions and VA, as appropriate, when such persons appear personally before the Committee;

        (ii) Receiving and reviewing all the evidence, testimony, briefs, statements, and records included in each case; and

        (iii) Furnishing the Director of the VA Regional Processing Office of jurisdiction a written statement setting forth specifically the question or questions considered, a summation of the essential facts of record, recommendations as to issues referred for consideration by the Committee, and the basis therefor.

#### § § 21.4213

        (a)  In any case referred to the Committee on Educational Allowances for consideration, a hearing will be held. If, as provided in § 21.4212(b), the educational institution has timely notified the Committee of its intent to participate in the hearing, the educational institution will be notified by certified letter from the Chairperson of the date when the hearing will be held. This hearing notification will inform the educational institution of—

        (1) The time and place of the hearing;

        (2) The matters to be considered;

        (3) The right of the educational institution to appear at the hearing with representation by counsel, to present witnesses, to offer testimony, to present arguments, and/or to submit a written statement or brief; and

> [63 FR 35834, July 1, 1998, as amended at 72 FR 16972, Apr. 5, 2007; 74 FR 14669, Mar. 31, 2009]

        § 21.4214   Hearing rules and procedures for Committee on Educational Allowances.

#### § § 21.4214

        (a)  The Chairperson of the Committee on Educational Allowances will be in charge of the proceedings, will administer oaths or affirmations to witnesses, and will be responsible for the official conduct of the hearing. A majority of the members of the Committee will constitute a quorum. No party to the proceedings may conduct a  of the Committee members.

        (b)  At the opening of the hearing, the Chairperson of the Committee on Educational Allowances will inform the educational institution of the purpose of the hearing, the nature of the evidence of record relating to the asserted failures or violations, and the applicable provisions of law and VA regulations. The Chairperson will advise the VA Regional Counsel, or designee, representing VA, that the Committee on Educational Allowances will entertain any relevant evidence or witnesses which VA Counsel presents to the Committee and which would substantiate a decision by the Committee to recommend that the Director of the VA Regional Processing Office of jurisdiction take an adverse action on the issues submitted for its review. The educational institution will be advised of its right to present any evidence, relevant to the issues submitted for the Committee's review, by oral or documentary evidence; to submit rebuttal evidence; to present and cross-examine witnesses; and to make such statements as may be appropriate on its behalf for a true and full disclosure of the facts. VA Counsel will be allowed to cross-examine any witnesses offered by the educational institution and to reply to any written briefs or arguments submitted to the Committee.

        (c)  Any testimony or evidence, either oral or written, which the Committee on Educational Allowances deems to be of probative value in deciding the question at issue will be admitted in evidence. While irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious evidence, testimony, or arguments should be excluded, reasonable latitude will be permitted with respect to the relevancy, materiality, and competency of evidence. In most instances the evidence will consist of official records of the educational institution and VA, and these documents may be attested to and introduced by affidavit; but the introduction of oral testimony by the educational institution or by VA will be allowed, as appropriate, in any instance where the educational institution or VA Counsel desires. VA, however, will neither subpoena any witness on behalf of the educational institution for such purposes nor bear any expenses in connection with the appearance of such witness. In instances where the evidence reasonably available consists of signed written statements, secondary or hearsay evidence, etc., such evidence may be introduced into the record and will be given the weight and consideration which the circumstances warrant.

        (d)  A verbatim stenographic or recorded transcript of the hearing will be made. This transcript will become a permanent part of the record, and a copy will be furnished to the educational institution and the VA Counsel at the conclusion of the proceeding, unless furnishing of the copy of the transcript is waived by the educational institution.

        (e)  The Chairperson of the Committee on Educational Allowances will identify all exhibits in the order of introduction or receipt (numerically for VA exhibits and alphabetically for exhibits introduced by the educational institution). All such original exhibits or documents shall be attached to the original of the transcript. VA shall make photocopies or certified copies and attach them to the copy of the transcript furnished to the educational institution and the VA Counsel. The original transcript will accompany the Committee's recommendation to the Director of the VA Regional Processing Office of jurisdiction along with all exhibits, briefs, or written statements received by the Committee during the course of the proceedings. Such documents should be clearly marked to indicate which were received into evidence and relied upon by the Committee in making its recommendations.

        (f)  The Committee on Educational Allowances, at its discretion, may reasonably limit the number of persons appearing at the hearing, including any affected individuals presented as witnesses by VA or the educational institution.

        (g)  Any person who is presented to testify will be required to be duly placed under oath or affirmation by the Chairperson of the Committee on Educational Allowances. If an official of the educational institution desires to present a statement personally, the individual will be required to be placed under oath or affirmation. The Chairperson will advise each witness that the Committee understands that he or she is voluntarily appearing before the Committee; that any testimony or statement given will be considered as being completely voluntary; and that no one has authority to require the individual to make any statement or answer any question against his or her will before the Committee, except that a person called as a witness on behalf of either VA or the educational institution must be willing to submit to cross-examination with respect to testimony given. Each witness will also be advised that his or her testimony or statement, if false, even though voluntary, may subject him or her to prosecution under Federal statutes.

        (h)  Any member of the Committee on Educational Allowances may question any witness presented to testify at the hearing or either a representative of the educational institution or the VA Counsel concerning matters that are relevant to the question at issue. Generally, questioning by a Committee member will be limited to the extent of clarifying information on the facts and issues involved.

        (i)  If the educational institution fails to timely notify the Committee of its intent to participate in a hearing or if a representative of the educational institution is scheduled to appear for a hearing but, without good cause, fails to appear either in person or by writing, the Committee will proceed with the hearing and will review the case on the basis of the evidence of record which shall be presented by the VA Counsel.

        (j)  Any objection by an authorized representative of the educational institution or the VA Counsel on a ruling by the Chairperson of the Committee on Educational Allowances regarding the admissibility of testimony or other evidence submitted will be made a matter of record, together with the substance in brief of the testimony intended or other evidence concerned. If the other evidence concerned is in the form of an affidavit or other document, it may be accepted for filing as a future reference if it is later ruled admissible as part of the record of the hearing.

        (k)  Objections relating to the jurisdiction or membership of the Committee on Educational Allowances or the constitutionality of statutes or the constitutionality of, or statutory authority for, VA regulations, are not before the Committee for decision. The time of the Committee will not be used to hear arguments in this regard. However, any such matters outside the province of the Committee may be the subject of a brief or a letter for consideration by the VA Office of General Counsel upon completion of the hearing. The ruling of such authority upon such issues will be obtained and included in the record before the Committee's recommendations are submitted to the Director of the VA Regional Processing Office of jurisdiction. If the VA General Counsel's ruling on such legal issues necessitates reopening the proceeding, that shall be done before the Committee makes its recommendations to the Director of the VA Regional Processing Office of jurisdiction.

        (l)  The hearing will be open to the public.

        (m)  The hearing will be conducted in an orderly manner with dignity and decorum. The conduct of members of the Committee on Educational Allowances, the VA Counsel, and any representatives of the educational institution shall be characterized by appropriate impartiality, fairness, and cooperation. The Chairperson of the Committee shall take such action as may be necessary, including suspension of the hearing or the removal of the offending person from the hearing room for misbehavior, disorderly conduct, or the persistent disregard of the Chairperson's ruling. Where this occurs, the Chairperson will point out that the Committee is entitled to every possible consideration in order that the case may be presented clearly and fully, which may be accomplished only through observance of orderly procedures.

        (n)  The Chairperson of the Committee on Educational Allowances will conduct the hearing proceedings in such a manner that will protect from disclosure information which tends to disclose or compromise investigative sources or methods or which would violate the privacy of any individual. The salient facts, which form the basis of charges, may be disclosed and discussed without revealing the source.

        (o)  At the close of the hearing, the Chairperson of the Committee on Educational Allowances shall inform the appropriate representative of the educational institution that the arguments and the evidence presented will be given careful consideration; and that notice of the decision of the Director of the VA Regional Processing Office of jurisdiction, together with the Committee's recommendations, will be furnished to the educational institution and the VA Counsel at the earliest possible time. The Chairperson will also indicate that notice of the Director's decision will be published in the  for the information of all other interested persons.

        (p)  In making its findings of facts and recommendations, the Committee on Educational Allowances will consider only questions which are referred to it by the Director of the VA Regional Processing Office of jurisdiction as being at issue and which are within the jurisdiction of the Committee.

The Director will then notify the educational institution as to whether the matter will be resubmitted to the Committee on Educational Allowances for further proceedings, on the basis of the new circumstances. If the matter is referred back to the Committee, the Director will defer a decision until he or she has received the Committee's new recommendations based upon all of the evidence of record.

        (d)  If the decision of the Director of the VA Regional Processing Office of jurisdiction is adverse to the educational institution, the decision shall indicate specifically the effective date of each adverse action covered by the decision.

        (e)  (1) The Director of the VA Regional Processing Office of jurisdiction shall send a copy of the decision to the educational institution by certified mail, return receipt requested.

#### § § 21.4216

        (a)  At the request of the educational institution the Director, Education Service will review a decision of a Director of a VA Regional Processing Office of jurisdiction to discontinue payments; to disapprove new enrollments or reenrollments; or to deny payment of benefits for licensing or certification tests. This review will be based on the evidence of record when the Director of the VA Regional Processing Office of jurisdiction made that decision. It will not be  in nature and no hearing on the issue will be held.

        § 21.4233   Combination.

#### § § 21.4233

        An approved program may consist of a combination of courses with instruction offered by a school alternating with instruction in a business or industrial establishment (a cooperative course); courses offered by two schools concurrently; or courses offered through class attendance and by television concurrently. A farm cooperative program may be approved which consists of a combination of institutional agricultural courses and concurrent agricultural employment (see § 21.4264). A school may contract the actual training to another school or entity, provided the course is approved by the State approving agency having approval jurisdiction of the school or entity which actually provides the training.

        (a)  A full-time program of education consisting of phases of school instruction alternated with training in a business or industrial establishment with such training being strictly supplemental to the school instruction may be approved. Alternating periods may be a part-day in school and a part-day on job or may be such periods which alternate on a daily, weekly, monthly or on a term basis. For purposes of approval the school offering the course must submit to the State approving agency, with its application, statements of fact showing at least the following:

        (1) That the alternate in-school periods of the course are at least as long as the alternate periods in the business or industrial establishment; in determining this relationship between the two components of the course, training received in a business or industrial establishment during a vacation or officially scheduled school break period shall be excluded from the calculation; where the course is approved as continuous part-time work and part-time study in combination, it shall be measured on the basis of the ratio which each portion of the training bears to full time as defined in § 21.4270(c) of this part. The institutional portion must be at least equivalent to one-half time training and must be combined with a job training portion sufficient for the combined training to equal full time.

        (2) That the course is set up as a cooperative course in the school catalog or other literature of the school;

        (3) That the school itself arranges with the employer's establishment for providing the alternate on-job periods of training on such basis that the on-job portion of the course will be training in a real and substantial sense and will supplement the in-school portion of the course;

        (4) That the school arranges directly with the employer's establishment for placing the individual student in that establishment and exercises supervision and control over the student's activities at the establishment to an extent that assures training in a true sense to the student; and

        (5) That the school grants credit for the on-job portion of the course for completion of a part of the work required for granting a degree or diploma.

        (b)  Where a veteran or eligible person cannot successfully schedule his or her complete program at one school, a program of concurrent enrollment may be approved. When requesting such a program the veteran or eligible person must show that his or her complete program of education or training is not available at the school in which he or she will pursue the major portion of his or her program (the primary school), or that it cannot be scheduled successfully within the period in which he or she plans to complete his or her program.

        (1) If VA measures the courses pursued at both institutions on either a clock-hour basis or a credit-hour basis, VA will measure the veteran's or eligible person's enrollment by adding together the units of measurement in the second school to the units of measurement for the courses in the primary institution. The standard for full time will be the full-time standard for the courses at the primary institution.

        (2) Where the standards for measurement of the courses pursued concurrently in the two schools are different, VA will measure the veteran's or eligible person's enrollment by converting the units of measurement for courses in the second school to the equivalent in value expressed in units of measurement required for the courses in the program of education which the veteran or eligible person is pursuing at the primary institution.

        (3) If the provisions of paragraph (b)(2) of this section require VA to convert clock hours to credit hours, it will do so by—

        (i) Dividing the number of credit hours which VA considers to be full-time at the educational institution whose courses are measured on a credit-hour basis by the number of clock hours which are full-time at the educational institution whose courses are measured on a clock-hour basis; and

        (ii) Multiplying each clock hour of attendance by the decimal determined in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section. VA will drop all fractional hours.

        (4) If the provisions of paragraph (b)(2) of this section require VA to convert credit hours to clock hours, it will do so by—

        (i) Dividing the number of clock hours which VA considers to be full-time at the educational institution whose courses are measured on a clock-hour basis by the number of credit hours which are full-time at the educational institution whose courses are measured on a credit-hour basis; and

        (ii) Multiplying each credit hour by the number determined in paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section. VA will drop all fractional hours.

        (5) Periodic certifications of training will be required from the veteran and each of the schools where concurrent enrollment is approved in a course which does not lead to a standard college degree and to which the measurement provisions of § 21.4270(b), of this part do not apply. (See §§ 21.4203 and 21.4204.)

        (c)  (1) A course offered by open-circuit television is an independent study course. In order for an eligible person to receive educational assistance while pursuing such a course, the course must meet all the requirements for independent study found in § 21.4267.

        (2)  Instruction offered through closed circuit telecast which requires regular classroom attendance is to be recognized to the same extent as regular classroom and/or laboratory instruction.

        (d)  A program of education consisting of institutional agricultural courses pursued by an eligible person who is concurrently engaged in agricultural employment which is relevant to such institutional course may be approved if the course meets the requirements of § 21.4264.

        (e)  All or part of the program of education of a school may be provided by another school or entity under contract. Such school or entity actually providing the training must obtain approval of the course from the State approving agency in the State having jurisdiction of that school or entity. If the course is a course of flight training, the school or entity actually providing the training must also obtain approval of the course from the Federal Aviation Administration. Measurement of the course and payment of an allowance will be appropriate for the course as offered by the school or entity actually providing the training.

        § 21.4234   Change of program.

#### § § 21.4234

        (a)  (1) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, a change of program consists of a change in the educational, professional, or vocational objective for which the veteran, reservist, or eligible person entered training.

        (2) VA does not consider any of the following to be changes of program:

        (i) A change in the type of courses needed to attain a vocational objective;

        (ii) A change in the individual's educational, professional or vocational objective following the successful completion of the immediately preceding program of education;

        (iii) A return to the individual's prior program of education following a change of program if the individual resumes training in the program without any loss of credit or standing in that program;

        (iv) An enrollment in a new program of education when that program leads to a vocational, educational or professional objective in the same general field as the immediately preceding program of education; or

        (v) An enrollment or reenrollment of a servicemember seeking to be paid tuition assistance top-up benefits to meet all or a portion of an educational institution's charges for education or training that the military department concerned has not covered under tuition assistance.

        (b)  A veteran, reservist, or eligible person may request a change of program by any form of communication. However, if the veteran, reservist, or eligible person does not furnish sufficient information to allow the Department of Veterans Affairs to process the request, the Department of Veterans Affairs will furnish the prescribed form for a change of program to him or her for completion.

        (c)  A spouse or surviving spouse eligible to receive educational assistance under 38 U.S.C. chapter 35 may make one optional change of program if his or her previous course was not interrupted due to his or her own misconduct, neglect, or lack of application.

        (d)  (1) The following changes of program may not be made solely at the option of the veteran, reservist, or eligible person. The Department of Veterans Affairs must approve them before paying educational assistance allowance:

        (i) A second or subsequent change of program made by a veteran or eligible person other than a child receiving educational assistance under 38 U.S.C. chapter 35,

        (ii) An initial change of program made by a veteran or eligible spouse or surviving spouse if the first program was interrupted or discontinued due to his or her own misconduct, neglect or lack of application, or

        (iii) Any change of program made by a child receiving educational assistance under 38 U.S.C. chapter 35.

        (2) The Department of Veterans Affairs will approve a change of program listed in paragraph (d)(1) of this section if:

        (i) The program of education which the veteran, reservist, or eligible person proposes to pursue is suitable to his or her aptitudes, interests and abilities,

        (ii) In any instance where the veteran, reservist, or eligible person has interrupted, or failed to progress in his or her program due to his or her own misconduct, neglect or lack of application, there is a reasonable likelihood with respect to the program the veteran, reservist, or eligible person proposes to pursue that there will not be a recurrence of such an interruption or failure to progress, and

        (iii) In the case of an eligible child receiving educational assistance under 38 U.S.C. chapter 35 the new program meets the criteria applicable to final approval of an original application. See § 21.4230.

        (3) The Department of Veterans Affairs may approve a third or subsequent change of program if applicable conditions of paragraph (d)(2) of this section are met and the additional change or changes are necessitated by circumstances beyond the control of the veteran, reservist, or eligible person. Circumstances beyond the control of the veteran, reservist, or eligible person include, but are not limited to:

        (i) The course being discontinued by the school when no other similar course leading to the same objective is available within normal commuting distance.

        (ii) Unexpected financial difficulties preventing completion of the last program because of the overall cost of the program needed to reach the objective, or

        (iii) The veteran, reservist, or eligible person being required to relocate because of health reasons in an area where training for the last objective is not available within normal commuting distance.

        (4) Notwithstanding any provision of any other paragraph of this section, if a third or subsequent change of program occurs after May 31, 1991, VA will apply only the applicable provisions of paragraph (d)(2) of this section. If the applicable provisions of paragraph (d)(2) of this section are met, VA will approve the change of program. VA will not apply any of the provisions of paragraph (d)(3) of this section in determining whether the change of program should be approved.

        (e)  A change in courses or places of training will not be considered a change of objective in the following instances:

        (1) The pursuit of the first program is a prerequisite for entrance into and pursuit of a second program.

        (2) A transfer from one school to another when the program at the second school leads to the same educational, professional or vocational objective, and does not involve a material loss of credit, or increase training time.

        (3) Revision of a program which does not involve a change of objective or material loss of credit nor loss of time originally planned for completion of the veteran's or eligible person's program. For example, an eligible person enrolled for a bachelor of science degree may show a professional objective such as chemist, teacher or engineer. His or her objective for purposes of this paragraph shall be considered to be “bachelor degree” and any change of courses will be considered only an adjustment in the program, not a change, so long as the subjects he or she pursues lead to the bachelor degree and there is no extension of time in the attaining of that degree.

        § 21.4235   Programs of education that include flight training.

#### § § 21.4235

        VA will use the provisions of this section to determine whether an individual may be paid educational assistance for pursuit of flight training. See § 21.4263 for approval of flight courses for VA training.

        (a)  A veteran or servicemember who is otherwise eligible to receive educational assistance under 38 U.S.C. chapter 30 or 32, or a reservist who is eligible for expanded benefits under 10 U.S.C. chapter 1606 as provided in § 21.7540(b), may receive educational assistance for flight training in an approved course provided that the individual meets the requirements of this paragraph. Except when enrolled in a ground instructor certification course or when pursuing flight training under paragraph (f) of this section, the individual must—

        (1) Possess a valid private pilot certificate or higher pilot certificate such as a commercial pilot certificate;

        (2) If enrolled in a course other than an Airline Transport Pilot (ATP) course, hold a second-class medical certificate on the first day of training and, if that course began before October 1, 1998, hold that certificate continuously during training; and

        (3) If enrolled in an ATP certification course, hold a first-class medical certificate on the first day of training and, if that course began before October 1, 1998, hold that certificate continuously during training.

        (b)  VA may approve the individual's program of education as described on the individual's application if:

        (1) The flight courses that constitute the program of education meet Federal Aviation Administration standards for such courses and the Federal Aviation Administration and the State approving agency approve them; and

        (2) The flight training included in the program—

        (i) Is generally accepted as necessary for the attainment of a recognized vocational objective in the field of aviation; or

        (ii) Is given by an educational institution of higher learning for credit toward a standard college degree that the individual is pursuing.

        (c)  (1) VA will pay educational assistance to an eligible individual for an enrollment in a commercial pilot certification course leading to Federal Aviation Administration certification for a particular category even if the individual has a commercial pilot certificate issued by the Federal Aviation Administration for a different category, since each category represents a different vocational objective.

        (2) VA will pay educational assistance to an eligible individual for an enrollment in an instrument rating course only if the individual simultaneously enrolls in a course required for a commercial pilot certificate for the category for which the instrument rating course is pursued or if, at the time of enrollment in the instrument rating course, the individual has a commercial pilot certificate issued by the Federal Aviation Administration for such category. The enrollment in an instrument rating course alone does not establish that the individual is pursuing a vocational objective, as required for VA purposes, since that rating equally may be applied to an individual's private pilot certificate, only evidencing an intent to pursue a non-vocational objective.

        (3) VA will pay educational assistance to an eligible individual for an enrollment in a flight course other than an instrument rating course or a ground instructor course, including courses leading to an aircraft type rating, only if the individual has a commercial pilot certificate issued by the Federal Aviation Administration for the category to which the particular course applies.

        (4) VA will pay educational assistance to an eligible individual for an enrollment in a ground instructor certificate course, even though the individual does not have any other flight certificate issued by the Federal Aviation Administration, since the Federal Aviation Administration does not require a flight certificate as a prerequisite to ground instructor certification and ground instructor is a recognized vocational objective.

        (5) VA will not pay an eligible individual for simultaneous enrollment in more than one flight course, except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.

        (d)  (1) The provisions of §§ 21.5230(a)(4), 21.7110(b)(4), and 21.7610(b)(4), prohibiting payment of educational assistance for enrollment in a course for whose objective the individual is already qualified, apply to enrollments in flight courses.

        (2) A former military pilot with the equivalent of a commercial pilot certificate and an instrument rating may obtain a commercial pilot certificate and instrument rating from the Federal Aviation Administration without a flight exam within 12 months of release from active duty. Therefore, VA will consider such a veteran to be already qualified for the objectives of a commercial pilot certification course and an instrument rating course if begun within 12 months of the individual's release from active duty.

        (e)  The provisions of §§ 21.5230(c), 21.7020(b)(26), 21.7122(b), 21.7520(b)(20), and 21.7610(b)(4) that provide limitations on payment for refresher training that is needed to update an individual's knowledge and skill in order to cope with technological advances while he or she was on active duty service apply to flight training.

        (1) An individual who held a Federal Aviation Administration certificate before or during active duty service may have surrendered that certificate or the Federal Aviation Administration may have canceled it. The individual may receive the equivalent of the number of months of educational assistance necessary to complete the course that will qualify him or her for the same grade certificate.

        (2) A reservist is not eligible for refresher training unless he or she has had prior active duty.

        (f)  (1) An individual who is eligible for educational assistance under 10 U.S.C. chapter 1606 or 38 U.S.C. chapter 30, 32, or 35 is exempt from the provisions of paragraphs (a)(2) through (d) of this section when his or her courses include flight training that is part of a program of education that leads to a standard college degree.

        (2) An individual described in paragraph (f)(1) of this section may pursue courses that may result in the individual eventually receiving recreational pilot certification or private pilot certification, provided that the courses also lead to a standard college degree.

        § 21.4236   Tutorial assistance.

#### § § 21.4236

        (a)  A veteran or eligible person may receive supplemental monetary assistance to provide tutorial services if he or she:

        (1) Is pursuing a post-secondary educational program on a half-time or more basis at an educational institution, and

        (2) Has a deficiency in a subject which is indispensable to the satisfactory pursuit of an approved program of education.

        (b)  The Department of Veterans Affairs will grant approval when:

        (1) The educational institution certifies that:

        (i) Individualized tutorial assistance is essential to correct a deficiency in a specified subject or subjects required as a part of, or which is prerequisite to, or which is indispensable to the satisfactory pursuit of an approved program of education;

        (ii) The tutor selected:

        (A) Is qualified, and

        (B) Is not the parent, spouse, child, brother or sister of the veteran or eligible person; and

        (iii) The charges for this assistance do not exceed the customary charges for such tutorial assistance; and

        (2) The assistance is furnished on an individual basis.

        (c)  (1) VA will authorize the cost of tutorial assistance in an amount not to exceed $100 per month.

        (2) The total amount of all tutorial assistance provided under this section will not exceed $1200.

        (d)  VA will make no charge against the veteran's or eligible person's entitlement to educational assistance for any amount of tutorial assistance authorized.

      Courses

        § 21.4250   Course and licensing and certification test approval; jurisdiction and notices.

#### § § 21.4250

        (a)  The statements made in this paragraph are subject to exceptions found in paragraph (c) of this section.

        (1) If an educational institution offers a resident course in a State, only the State approving agency for the State where the course is being offered may approve the course for VA training. If the State approving agency chooses to approve a resident course (other than a flight course) not leading to a standard college degree, it must also approve the class schedules of that course.

        (2) If an educational institution with a main campus in a State offers a resident course not located in a State, only the State approving agency for the State where the educational institution's main campus is located may approve the course for VA training. If the State approving agency chooses to approve a resident course (other than a flight course) not leading to a standard college degree, it must also approve the class schedules of that course.

        (3) If an educational institution offers a course by independent study or by correspondence, only the State approving agency for the State where the educational institution's main campus is located may approve the course for VA training.

        (4) If a training establishment offers a program of apprenticeship or other on-job training, only the State approving agency for the State where the training will take place may approve the course for VA training.

        (5) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(6)(ii) of this section, if a State or political subdivision of a State offers a licensing test, only the State approving agency for the State where the license will be valid may approve the test for VA payment.

        (6)(i) If an organization or entity offers a licensing or certification test and applies for approval of that test, only the State approving agency for the State where the organization or entity has its headquarters may approve the test and the organization or entity offering the test for VA payment. This approval will be valid wherever the test is given.

        (ii) If the organization or entity offering a licensing or certification test does not apply for approval, and a State or political subdivision of a State requires that an individual take the test in order to obtain a license, the State approving agency for the State where the license will be valid may approve the test for VA payment. This approval will be valid for the purpose of VA payment only if the veteran takes the test in the State or political subdivision of the State where the license is valid.

        (7) A course approved under 38 U.S.C. chapter 36 will be deemed to be approved for purposes of 38 U.S.C. chapter 35.

        (8) Any course that was approved under 38 U.S.C. chapter 33 (as in effect before February 1, 1965), or under 38 U.S.C. chapter 35 before March 3, 1966, and was not or is not disapproved for failure to meet any of the requirements of the applicable chapters, will be deemed to be approved for purposes of 38 U.S.C. chapter 36.

        (9) VA may make tuition assistance top-up payments of educational assistance to an individual to meet all or a portion of an educational institution's charges for education or training that the military department concerned has not covered under tuition assistance, even though a State approving agency has not approved the course in which the individual was enrolled.

        (b)  Approval by State approving agencies will be in accordance with the provisions of 38 U.S.C. Chapter 36 and such regulations and policies as the agency may adopt not in conflict therewith.

        (1)  (i) Each State approving agency must provide to VA:

        (A) A list of schools specifying which courses it has approved;

        (B) A list of licensing and certification tests and organizations and entities offering these tests that it has approved; and

        (C) Any other information that it and VA may determine to be necessary.

        (ii) The lists and information must be provided on paper or electronically as VA may require.

        (2)  Each State approving agency will notify the Department of Veterans Affairs of the suspension of approval or disapproval of any course or licensing or certification test previously approved and will set forth the reasons for such suspension of approval or disapproval. See § 21.4259.

        (3)  If notice has been furnished that the State approving agency does not intend to act on the application of a school, the school may request approval by the Department of Veterans Affairs.

        (c)  (1) The Executive Director, Veteran Readiness and Employment (VR&E) Service may approve special restorative training in excess of 12 months to overcome or lessen the effects of a physical or mental disability to enable an eligible child to pursue a program of education under 38 U.S.C. chapter 35.

        (i) A course of education offered by any agency of the Federal Government authorized under other laws to offer such a course;

        (ii) A course of education to be pursued under 10 U.S.C. chapter 1606 or 38 U.S.C. chapter 30, 32, 33, 35, or 36 offered by a school located in the Canal Zone, Guam or Samoa;

        (iii) Except as provided in § 21.4150(d) as to the Republic of the Philippines, a course of education to be pursued under 10 U.S.C. chapter 1606 or 38 U.S.C. chapter 30, 32, 33, or 35 offered by an institution of higher learning not located in a State;

        (iv) Any course in any other school in accordance with the provisions of 38 U.S.C. chapter 36;

        (v) Any program of apprenticeship the standards for which have been approved by the Secretary of Labor pursuant to section 50a of Title 29 U.S.C. as a national apprenticeship program for operation in more than one State and for which the training establishment is a carrier directly engaged in interstate commerce and providing training in more than one State; and

        (vi) Any licensing or certification test and any organization or entity offering such a test if—

        (A) The organization or entity is an agency of the Federal government;

        (B) The headquarters of the organization or entity offering the test is not located in a State; or

        (C) The State approving agency that would, under paragraph (a)(5) or (a)(6) of this section, have approval jurisdiction for the test has declined to perform the approval function for licensing or certification tests and the organizations or entities offering these tests.

        § 21.4251   Minimum period of operation requirement for educational institutions.

#### § § 21.4251

        The provisions of this section do not apply to licensing or certification tests or to the organizations or entities offering those tests. For information on the minimum period of operation requirement that applies to licensing or certification tests, see § 21.4268.

        (a)  The following definitions apply to the terms used in this section. The definitions in § 21.4200 apply to the extent that no definition is included in this paragraph.

        (1)  The term  (including the term _control_ling) means the possession, direct or indirect, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a person, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by contract, or otherwise.

        (2)  The term  means an individual, corporation, partnership, or other legal entity.

        (b)  Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, when a proprietary educational institution offers a course not leading to a standard college degree, VA may not approve an enrollment in that course if the proprietary educational institution—

        (1) Has been operating for less than 2 years;

        (2) Offers the course at a branch or extension and the branch or extension has been operating for less than 2 years; or

        (3) Offers the course following either a change in ownership or a complete move outside its original general locality, and the educational institution does not retain substantially the same faculty, student body, and courses as before the change in ownership or the move outside the general locality unless the educational institution, after such change or move, has been in operation for at least 2 years.

        (c)  Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section, VA may approve the enrollment of a veteran, servicemember, reservist, or eligible person in a course not leading to a standard college degree approved under this subpart if it is offered by a proprietary educational institution that—

        (1) Offers the course under a contract with the Department of Defense or the Department of Transportation; and

        (2) Gives the course on or immediately adjacent to a military base, Coast Guard station, National Guard facility, or facility of the Selected Reserve.

        (d)  VA will consider, for the purposes of paragraph (b) of this section, that a proprietary educational institution (or a branch or extension of such an educational institution) will be deemed to have been operating for 2 years when the educational institution (or a branch or extension of such an educational institution)—

        (1) Has been operating as an educational institution for 24 continuous months pursuant to the laws of the State(s) in which it is approved to operate and in which it is offering the training; and

        (2) Has offered courses continuously for at least 24 months inclusive of normal vacation or holiday periods, or periods when the institution is closed temporarily due to a natural disaster that directly affected the institution or the institution's students.

        (e)  A proprietary educational institution (or a branch or extension thereof) will be deemed to have moved to a location outside the same general locality of the original location when the new location is beyond normal commuting distance of the original location, , 55 miles or more from the original location.

        (f)  (1) A change of ownership of a proprietary educational institution occurs when—

        (i) A person acquires operational management and/or control of the proprietary educational institution and its educational activities; or

        (ii) A person ceases to have operational management and/or control of the proprietary educational institution and its educational activities.

        (2) Transactions that may cause a change of ownership include, but are not limited to the following:

        (i) The sale of the educational institution;

        (ii) The transfer of the controlling interest of stock of the educational institution or its parent corporation;

        (iii) The merger of 2 or more educational institutions; and

        (iv) The division of one educational institution into 2 or more educational institutions.

        (3) VA considers that a change in ownership of an educational institution does not include a transfer of ownership or control of the institution, upon the retirement or death of the owner, to:

        (i) The owner's parent, sibling, spouse, child, spouse's parent or sibling, or sibling's or child's spouse; or

        (ii) An individual with an ownership interest in the institution who has been involved in management of the institution for at least 2 years preceding the transfer.

        (g)  VA will determine whether a proprietary educational institution has substantially the same faculty, student body, and courses following a change of ownership or move outside the same general locality by applying the provisions of this paragraph.

        (1) VA will consider that the faculty remains substantially the same in an educational institution when faculty members who teach a majority of the courses after the move or change in ownership, were so employed by the educational institution before the move or change in ownership.

        (2) VA will consider that the courses remain substantially the same at an educational institution when:

        (i) Faculty use the same instructional methods during the term, quarter, or semester after the move or change in ownership as were used before the move or change in ownership; and

        (ii) The courses offered after the move or change in ownership lead to the same educational objectives as did the courses offered before the move or change in ownership.

        (3) VA considers that the student body remains substantially the same at an educational institution when, except for those students who have graduated, all, or a majority of the students enrolled in the educational institution on the last day of classes before the move or change in ownership are also enrolled in the educational institution after the move or change in ownership.

#### § § 21.4252

        (a)  Enrollment will not be approved in any bartending or personality development course.

        (b)  Enrollment will not be approved in any course which is avocational or recreational in character or the advertising for which contains significant avocational or recreational themes. The courses identified in paragraphs (b)(1), (2), and (3) of this section are presumed to be avocational or recreational in character and require justification for their pursuit.

        (1) Any photography course or entertainment course, or

        (2) Any music course, instrumental or vocal, public speaking course, or course in dancing, sports or athletics, such as horseback riding, swimming, fishing, skiing, golf, baseball, tennis, bowling, sports officiating, or other sport or athletic courses, except courses of applied music, physical education, or public speaking which are offered by institutions of higher learning for credit as an integral part of a program leading to an educational objective, or

        (3) Any other type of course which the Department of Veterans Affairs determines to be avocational or recreational.

        (4) To overcome the presumption that a course is avocational or recreational in character, the veteran or eligible person will be required to establish that the course will be of bona fide use in the pursuit of his or her present or contemplated business or occupation.

        (c)  The Department of Veterans Affairs may approve an enrollment in any of the following types of courses of flight training if an institution of higher learning offers the course for credit toward the standard college degree the veteran or eligible person is pursuing. The Department of Veterans Affairs otherwise will not approve an enrollment in:

        (1) A course of flight training to obtain a private pilot's license or equivalent level training; or

        (2) Any course of flight training under Chapter 35.

        (d)  Enrollment in such courses will not be approved.

        (e)  (1) VA will not approve the enrollment of an individual under 10 U.S.C. Chapter 1606 or 38 U.S.C.

        (g)  (1) Effective October 29, 1992, VA may pay educational assistance to a veteran who is enrolled in a nonaccredited course or unit subject offered entirely or partly by independent study only if—

        (i) Successful completion of the nonaccredited course or unit subject is required in order for the veteran to complete his or her program of education; and the veteran—

        (A) Was receiving educational assistance on October 29, 1992, for pursuit of the program of education of which the nonaccredited independent study course or unit subject forms a part, and

        (B) Has remained continuously enrolled in that program of education from October 29, 1992, to the date the veteran enrolls in the nonaccredited independent study course or unit subject; or

        (ii) Was enrolled in and receiving educational assistance for the nonaccredited independent study course or unit subject on October 29, 1992, and remains continuously enrolled in that course or unit subject.

        (2) Whether or not the veteran is enrolled will be determined by the regularly prescribed standards and practices of the educational institution.

        (h)  For the purposes of this paragraph, “educational institution” includes an organization or entity offering licensing or certification tests.

        (1) If an educational institution uses advertising, sales, enrollment practices, or candidate handbooks that are erroneous, deceptive, or misleading by actual statement, omission, or intimation, VA will not approve:

        (i) An enrollment in any course such an educational institution offers; and

        (ii) Payment of educational assistance as reimbursement to a veteran or eligible person for taking a licensing or certification test that the educational institution offers.

        (2) VA will use the services and facilities of the Federal Trade Commission, where appropriate, under an agreement:

        (i) To carry out investigations; and

        (ii) To decide whether an educational institution uses advertising, sales, or enrollment practices, or candidate handbooks, described in paragraph (h)(1) of this section.

        (3) Any educational institution offering courses approved for the enrollment of veterans, reservists, and/or eligible persons, or offering licensing or certification tests approved for payment of educational assistance as reimbursement to veterans or eligible persons who take the tests, must maintain a complete record of all advertising, sales materials, enrollment materials, or candidate handbooks (and copies of each) that the educational institution or its agents have used during the preceding 12-month period. The State approving agency and VA may inspect this record. The materials in this record shall include but are not limited to:

        (i) Any direct mail pieces,

        (ii) Brochures,

        (iii) Printed literature used by sales people,

        (iv) Films, video cassettes and audio tapes disseminated through broadcast media,

        (v) Material disseminated through print media,

        (vi) Tear sheets,

        (vii) Leaflets,

        (viii) Handbills,

        (ix) Fliers, and

        (x) Any sales or recruitment manuals used to instruct sales personnel, agents or representatives of the educational institution.

        (i)  The school's certifications shall exclude courses which are being audited by the veteran or eligible person, since no educational assistance allowances shall be paid for such courses.

        (j)  The school shall report any course for which a nonpunitive grade is assigned and no payment shall be authorized for such a course. If payment has already been made, in whole or in part, by the Department of Veterans Affairs at the time the grade is assigned, an overpayment shall be created against the account of the student for such a course, unless the Department of Veterans Affairs determines there are mitigating circumstances.

        (k)  When a State approving agency has suspended the approval of a course for new enrollments, new enrollments in the course shall not be approved until the suspense is lifted. If the State approving agency does not lift the suspense, but disapproves the course instead, new enrollments beginning on or after the date the suspense was effective shall not be approved. See § 21.4259.

        (l)  The provisions of this paragraph apply to veterans and eligible persons who are pursuing a degree, but who have not matriculated. The Department of Veterans Affairs considers a student to have matriculated when he or she has been formally admitted to a college or university as a degree-seeking student.

        (1) Some colleges or universities admit students provisionally, pending receipt of test results or transcripts. The Department of Veterans Affairs may approve such a veteran's or eligible person's enrollment in a course or subject only if the veteran or eligible person matriculates during the first two terms, quarters or semesters following his or her admission.

        (2) The first portion of the courses leading to a single degree may be offered at one college or university. The remaining courses are not offered at the college or university, but are offered at a second college or university which grants the degree based upon the combined credits earned by the student. If the student is not required to matriculate during the portion of the program offered at the first college or university, VA may approve an enrollment in a course or subject that is part of that portion of the program only when the certifications described in either paragraph (l)(2)(i) or (ii) of this section are made.

        (i) The college or university granting the degree certifies concurrently with the student's enrollment in the first portion of the program, that

        (A) Full credit will be granted for the subjects taken in the portion of the curriculum offered at the first college or university;

        (B) In the last 5 years at least three students who have completed the first part of the program have been accepted into the second part of the program;

        (C) At least 90 percent of those who have applied for admission to the second part of the program, after successfully completing the first part, have been admitted;

        (D) The student will be required to matriculate during the first two terms, quarters or semesters following his or her admission to the second part of the program.

        (ii) The college or university offering the first part of the program:

        (A) Certifies to the appropriate State approving agency that as a result of an agreement between that college or university and the college or university offering the second part of the program, all of the courses taken by the veteran or eligible person in the first part of the program, will be accepted by the college or university offering the second part of the program without any loss of credit in partial fulfillment of the requirements for an associate or higher degree. This certification may be made once for each program for which an agreement exists.

        (B) Certifies to VA that the veteran or eligible person has stated to an appropriate official of the college or university offering the first part of the program that he or she is pursuing the program.

        (3) The first portion of the subjects or courses in a baccalaureate program beyond those necessary for an associate degree may be given at a 2-year college, while the remainder may be offered at a 4-year college or university. When the college or university does not require the student to matriculate while pursuing the additional study at the 2-year college, VA may approve an enrollment in a course offered in the program at the 2-year college only if the certifications described in either paragraph (l)(3)(i) or (ii) of this section are made.

        (i) The college or university granting the baccalaureate degree certifies that:

        (A) Full credit is granted for the course upon the student's transfer to the college or university granting the baccalaureate degree,

        (B) The courses taken at the 2-year college will be acceptable in partial fulfillment for the baccalaureate degree, and

        (C) The student will be required to matriculate during the first two terms, quarters or semesters following his or her admission to the college or university granting the baccalaureate degree.

        (ii) Either the 2-year college or the college or university granting the baccalaureate degree:

        (A) Certifies to the appropriate State approving agency that as a result of agreement between the 2-year college and the college or university offering the baccalaureate degree all of the courses pursued beyond the associate degree will be accepted without any loss of credit in partial fulfillment of the requirements for a baccalaureate degree. This certification may be made once for each program for which an agreement exists.

        (B) Certifies to VA that the veteran or eligible person is enrolled in courses covered by the agreement.

        (4) Except as provided in paragraphs (l)(1), (2), and (3) of this section, the Department of Veterans Affairs will not approve a veteran's or eligible person's enrollment in a course or subject if the veteran or eligible person:

        (i) Is pursuing a degree, and

        (ii) Is not matriculated.

        (5) Nothing in this paragraph shall prevent a State approving agency from including more restrictive matriculation requirements in its approval criteria.

        (m)  VA may not approve the enrollment of a veteran, servicemember, reservist, or eligible person in a course as a part of a program of education offered by any educational institution if the educational institution or entity providing the course under contract has not obtained a separate approval for the course in the same manner as for any other course as required by § 21.4253, § 21.4254, § 21.4256, § 21.4257, § 21.4260, § 21.4261, § 21.4263, § 21.4264, § 21.4265, § 21.4266, or § 21.4267, as appropriate.

        § 21.4253   Accredited courses.

#### § § 21.4253

        (a)  A course may be approved as an accredited course if it meets one of the following requirements:

        (1) The course has been accredited and approved by a nationally recognized accrediting agency or association. “Candidate for accreditation” status is not a basis for approval of a course as accredited.

        (2) Credit for such course is approved by the State department of education for credit toward a high school diploma.

        (3) The course is conducted under the Act of February 23, 1917 (20 U.S.C. 11 ).

        (4) The course is accepted by the State department of education for credit for a teacher's certificate or teacher's degree.

        (5) The course is approved by the State as meeting the requirement of regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Health and Human Services under sections 1819(f)(2)(A)(i) and 1919(f)(2)(A)(i) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C.1395i-3(f)(2)(A)(i) and 1396r(f)(2)(A)(i)).

        (b)  Any curriculum offered by an educational institution which is a member of one of the nationally recognized accrediting agencies or associations and which leads to a degree, diploma, or certificate will be accepted as an accredited course when approved as such by the State approving agency. Any curriculum accredited by one of the specialized nationally recognized accrediting agencies or associations and which leads to a degree, diploma, or certificate will also be accepted as an accredited course when approved as such by the State approving agency. Approval of the individual subjects, required or elective, which are designated as a part of a degree curriculum will not be necessary. Such approval may include noncredit subjects that are prescribed as a required part of the curriculum. The course objective may be educational (high school diploma or a standard college degree) or it may be vocational or professional (an occupation).

        (c)  A nationally recognized accrediting agency or association is one that appears on the list published by the Secretary of Education as required by 38 U.S.C. 3675(a). The State approving agencies may use the accreditation of these accrediting agencies or associations for approval of the course specifically accredited and approved by the agency or association.

        (d)  A school desiring to enroll veterans or eligible persons in accredited courses will make application for approval of such courses to the State approving agency. The State approving agency may approve the application of the school when the school and its accredited courses are found to have met the following criteria and additional reasonable criteria established by the State approving agency if the Secretary or designee, in consultation with the State approving agency, approves the additional criteria as necessary and equitable in its treatment of public, private, and proprietary for-profit educational institutions:

        (1) The institution (other than an elementary or secondary school) has submitted to the State approving agency copies of its catalog or bulletin which are certified as true and correct in content and policy by an authorized representative, and the publication shall:

        (i) State with specificity the requirements of the institution with respect to graduation;

        (ii) Include institution policy and regulations relative to standards of progress required of the student by the institution (this policy will define the grading system of the institution, the minimum grades considered satisfactory, conditions for interruption for unsatisfactory grades or progress, a description of the probationary period, if any, allowed by the institution, conditions of reentrance for those students dismissed for unsatisfactory progress, and a statement regarding progress records kept by the institution and furnished the student);

        (iii) Include institution policy and regulations relating to student conduct and conditions for dismissal for unsatisfactory conduct; and

        (iv) Include any attendance standards of the institution if the institution has and enforces such standards.

        (2) Adequate records are kept by the school to show the progress of each veteran or eligible person. The records must be sufficient to show continued pursuit at the rate for which enrolled and the progress being made. They must include final grade in each subject for each term, quarter, or semester; record of withdrawal from any subject to include the last date of attendance for a resident course; and record of reenrollment in subjects from which there was a withdrawal; and may include such records as attendance for resident courses, periodic grades and examination results.

        (3) The school maintains a written record of previous education and training of the veteran or eligible person which clearly indicates that appropriate credit has been given by the school for previous education and training, with the training period shortened proportionately. The record must be cumulative in that the results of each enrollment period (term, quarter or semester) must be included so that it shows each subject undertaken and the final result, , passed, failed, incomplete or withdrawn.

        (4) The school enforces a policy relative to standards of conduct and progress required of the student. The school policy relative to standards of progress must be specific enough to determine the point in time when educational benefits should be discontinued, pursuant to 38 U.S.C. 3474 when the veteran or eligible person ceases to make satisfactory progress. The policy must include the grade or grade point average that will be maintained if the student is to graduate. For example, a 4-year college may require a 1.5 grade point average the first year, a 1.75 average at mid-year the second year, and a cumulative average of 2.0 thereafter on the basis of 4.0 for an A.

        (5) If the school has a standard of attendance, it maintains records of attendance for veterans and eligible persons enrolled in resident courses which are adequate to show the student meets the school's standard of attendance.

        (6) The accredited courses, the curriculum of which they form a part, and the instruction connected with those courses are consistent in quality, content, and length with similar courses in public educational institutions and other private educational institutions in the State with recognized accepted standards.

        (7) There is in the educational institution offering the course adequate space, equipment, instructional material, and instructor personnel to provide training of good quality.

        (8) The educational and experience qualifications of directors, and administrators of the educational institution offering the courses, and instructors teaching the courses for which approval is sought, are adequate.

        (9)(i) For a course designed to prepare an individual for licensure or certification in a State, the course meets all instructional curriculum licensure or certification requirements of such State.

        (ii) For a course designed to prepare an individual for licensure to practice law in a State, the course is accredited by a specialized accrediting agency for programs of legal education or association recognized by the Secretary of Education under subpart 2 of part H of title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1099b), from which recipients of law degrees from such accredited programs are eligible to sit for a bar examination in any State.

        (iii) For a course designed to prepare an individual for employment pursuant to standards developed by a board or agency of a State in an occupation that requires approval, licensure, or certification, the course meets such standards.

        (iv) An educational institution may apply, through their State approving agency of jurisdiction, to the Secretary or designee for a waiver of the requirements of this paragraph (d)(9). The State approving agency will forward an application for waiver, together with its recommendation for granting or denying the application, to the Secretary or designee. The Secretary or designee may grant a waiver upon a finding that all of the following criteria have been met:

        (A) The educational institution is not accredited by an agency or association recognized by the Department of Education.

        (B) The course did not meet the requirements of this paragraph (d)(9) at any time during the 2-year period preceding the date of the waiver.

        (C) The waiver furthers the purposes of the educational assistance programs administered by VA or would further the education interests of individuals eligible for assistance under such programs.

        (D) The educational institution does not provide any commission, bonus, or other incentive payment based directly or indirectly on success in securing enrollments or financial aid to any persons or entities engaged in any student recruiting or admission activities or in making decisions regarding the award of student financial assistance, except for the recruitment of foreign students residing in foreign countries who are not eligible to receive Federal student assistance.

        (10) Before requiring a school and its accredited courses to meet any additional criteria, the State approving agency must present a written proposal to the Secretary or designee justifying the need for the additional criteria and containing an attestation that the criteria will treat all schools equitably, regardless of whether they are public, private, or for-profit institutions. The Secretary or designee will determine whether the additional criteria are necessary and treat schools equitably based on the proposal and any additional information submitted. The Secretary or designee may change the determination at any time if, after implementation, it becomes apparent that the criteria are unnecessary or schools are treated inequitably under the criteria.

        (i) The written proposal must contain a description of the need for the additional criteria and an explanation of how the imposition of the additional criteria would remedy the problem. The proposal must also contain a statement concerning whether State or Federal laws, regulations, or policies require the imposition of the additional criteria and an explanation of the consideration of any alternative means to achieve the same goal as the additional criteria.

        (ii) The Secretary or designee may request such additional information from the State approving agency as the Secretary or designee deems appropriate before determining whether the criteria are necessary and treat schools equitably.

        (e)  Under the provisions of paragraph (a)(1) of this section, any course at college level approved by the State approving agency as an accredited course will be accepted by the Department of Veterans Affairs as an accredited course when all of the following conditions are met:

        (1) The college or university is accredited by a nationally recognized regional accrediting agency listed by the Secretary of Education or the course is accredited at the college level by a specialized accrediting agency or association recognized by the Secretary of Education; and

        (2) The course has entrance requirements of not less than the requirements applicable to the college level program of the school; and

        (3) Credit for the course is awarded in terms of standard semester or quarter hours or by recognition at completion by the granting of a standard college degree.

        (f)  Any course in a school approved by the State approving agency will be accepted as an accredited course when all of the following conditions are met:

        (1) The course or the school offering such course is accredited by the appropriate accrediting agency; and

        (2) The course offers training in the field for which the accrediting agency is recognized and at a level for which it is recognized; and

        (3) The course leads to a high school diploma or a vocational objective.

        § 21.4255   Refund policy; nonaccredited courses.

#### § § 21.4255

        (a)  A refund policy meets the requirements of § 21.4254(c)(13), if it provides that the amount charged for tuition, fees, and other charges for a portion of the course does not exceed the approximate pro rata portion of the total charges for tuition, fees, and other charges that the length of the completed portion of the course bears to the total length. The school may make provision for refund within the following limitations:

        (1)  An established registration fee in an amount not to exceed $10 need not be subject to proration. Where the established registration fee is more than $10, the amount in excess of $10 will be subject to proration.

        (2)  Where the school has a breakage fee, it may provide for the retention of only the exact amount of the breakage, with the remaining part, if any, to be refunded.

        (3)  Where the school makes a separate charge for consumable instructional supplies, as distinguished from laboratory fees, the exact amount of the charges for supplies consumed may be retained but any remaining part must be refunded.

        (4)  (i) A veteran or eligible person may retain or dispose of books, supplies and equipment at his or her discretion when:

        (A) He or she purchased them from a bookstore or other source, and

        (B) Their cost is separate and independent from the charge made by the school for tuition and fees.

        (ii) The school will make a refund in full for the amount of the charge for unissued books, supplies and equipment when:

        (A) The school furnishes the books, supplies and equipment.

        (B) The school includes their cost in the total charge payable to the school for the course.

        (C) The veteran or eligible person withdraws or is discontinued before completing the course.

        (iii) The veteran or eligible person may dispose of issued items at his or her discretion even if they were included in the total charges payable to the school for the course.

        (5)  Where the school either has or adopts an established policy for the refund of the unused portion of tuition, fees, and other charges subject to proration, which is more favorable to the veteran or eligible person than the approximate pro rata basis as provided in this paragraph, such established policy will be applicable. Otherwise, the school may charge a sum which does not vary more than 10 percent from the exact pro rata portion of such tuition, fees, and other charges that the length of the completed portion of the course bears to its total length. The exact proration will be determined on the ratio of the number of days of instruction completed by the student to the total number of instructional days in the course.

        (6)  In the event that the veteran, spouse, surviving spouse or child fails to enter the course or withdraws or is discontinued therefrom at any time prior to completion of the course, the unused portion of the tuition, fees and other charges paid by the individual shall be refunded promptly. Any institution which fails to forward any refund due within 40 days after such a change in status, shall be deemed, prima facie, to have failed to make a prompt refund, as required by this paragraph.

        (b)  (1) An educational institution may apply through the appropriate State approving agency to the Director of the VA facility of jurisdiction for a waiver of the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section as they apply to a veteran or eligible person. The State approving agency shall forward the application to the Director along with its recommendations. The Director shall consider the recommendations and shall grant a waiver only when he or she finds that the educational institution:

        (i) Is a college, university, or similar institution offering post-secondary level academic instruction leading to an associate or higher degree;

        (ii) Is operated by an agency of a State or a unit of local government;

        (iii) If operated by an agency of a State, is located within that State;

        (iv) If operated by a unit of local government, is located within the boundaries of the area over which that unit has taxing jurisdiction;

        (v) Is a candidate for accreditation by a regional accrediting agency; and

        (vi) Charges the veteran or eligible person no more than $120 per quarter, $180 per semester or $360 per school year in tuition, fees and other charges for the course.

        (2) If an educational institution disagrees with a decision of a Director of a VA facility, it may ask that the Director, Education Service review the decision. In reviewing the decision the Director must consider the evidence of record. He or she may not grant a waiver unless all the criteria of paragraph (b)(1) of this section are met.

The educational institution must certify to the State approving agency that at least 50 percent of those pursuing the program or course require six months or more to complete it. For applications for approval that are pending approval by the State approving agency on February 2, 1995, and for applications received by the State approving agency after that date, the required certification shall be based on the experience of students who completed the program or course during the six-month period immediately preceding the educational institution's application for approval.

        (3) State approving agencies have the authority to review periodically the length of time needed to complete each approved correspondence program or approved correspondence-residence course in order to determine whether the program or course should continue to be approved. In implementing this authority, a State approving agency will examine the results over a prior two-year period reasonably related to the date on which such a review is conducted.

        (b)  (1) An educational institution offering a program of education to be pursued exclusively by correspondence must enter into an enrollment agreement with the veteran, spouse, surviving spouse, or reservist who wishes to receive educational assistance from VA while pursuing the program. The enrollment agreement shall disclose fully the obligations of the institution and the veteran, spouse, surviving spouse, or reservist, and shall display in a prominent place on the agreement the conditions for affirmance, termination, refund, and payment of the educational assistance by VA.

        (2) A copy of the agreement shall be given to the veteran, spouse, surviving spouse, or reservist when it is signed.

        (3) The agreement shall not be effective unless the veteran, spouse, surviving spouse, or reservist after the expiration of 10 days after the agreement is signed, shall have signed and submitted to VA a written statement, with a signed copy to the institution, specifically affirming the agreement.

        (c)  (1) Upon notification of the educational institution by the veteran, spouse, surviving spouse, or reservist of an intention not to affirm the enrollment agreement, any fees paid by the individual shall be returned promptly in full to him or her.

        (2) Upon termination of enrollment under an affirmed enrollment agreement for training in the accredited course by the veteran, spouse, surviving spouse, or reservist, without having completed any lessons, a registration fee not in excess of 10 percent of the tuition for the course or $50, whichever is less, may be charged him or her. When the individual terminates the agreement after completion of less than 25 percent of the lessons of the course, the institution may retain the registration fee plus 25 percent of the tuition. When the individual terminates the agreement after completing 25 percent but less than 50 percent of the lessons, the institution may retain the registration fee plus 50 percent of the tuition for the course. If 50 percent or more of the lessons are completed, no refund of tuition is required.

        (3) Where the school either has or adopts an established policy for the refund of the unused portion of tuition, fees, and other charges subject to proration, which is more favorable to the veteran, spouse, surviving spouse, or reservist than the pro rata basis as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, such established policy will be applicable.

        (4) Any institution that fails to forward any refund due to the veteran, spouse, surviving spouse, or reservist within 40 days after receipt of a notice of termination or disaffirmance, shall be deemed, prima facie, to have failed to make a prompt refund as required by this section.

        § 21.4259   Suspension or disapproval.

#### § § 21.4259

        (a) The appropriate State approving agency, after approving any course or licensing or certification test:

        (1) May suspend the approval of a course for new enrollments, or approval of a licensing or certification test, for a period not to exceed 60 days to allow the institution to correct any deficiencies, if the evidence of record establishes that the course or licensing or certification test fails to meet any of the requirements for approval.

        (2) Will immediately disapprove the course or licensing or certification test, if any of the requirements for approval are not being met and the deficiency cannot be corrected within a period of 60 days.

        (3) Upon suspension or disapproval, the State approving agency will notify the educational institution by certified or registered letter with a return receipt secured (38 U.S.C. 3679). It is incumbent upon the State approving agency to determine the conduct of courses and to take immediate appropriate action in each case in which it is found that the conduct of a course in any manner fails to comply with the requirements for approval.

        (b) Each State approving agency will immediately notify VA of each course, or licensing or certification test, that it has suspended or disapproved.

        (c) The Department of Veterans Affairs will suspend approval for or disapprove courses or licensing or certification tests under conditions specified in paragraph (a) of this section where it functions for the State approving agency. See § 21.4150(c).

        (d) The Department of Veterans Affairs will immediately notify the State approving agency in each case of Department of Veterans Affairs suspension or disapproval of any school under 38 U.S.C. chapter 31.

        (e) The Secretary or the appropriate State approving agency will disapprove a licensing and certification program of education if the educational institution providing the program of education fails to publicly disclose in a prominent manner any conditions or additional requirements, including training, experience, or examinations required to obtain the license, certification, or approval for which the program of education is designed to provide preparation.

        (1) The Secretary will determine whether a disclosure is sufficiently prominent; however, at a minimum, the educational institution must publish the conditions or requirements on a publicly facing website and in their catalog, and include them in any publication (regardless of medium) which explicitly mentions “educational assistance benefits for servicemembers (and their dependents) or veterans (and their dependents)” or which, in the view of the Secretary, is intended for VA educational assistance beneficiaries.

        (2) Individuals continuously enrolled at the same educational institution pursuing a program of education subject to disapproval under paragraph (e) of this section may complete the program of education.

        (c)  The appropriate State approving agency may approve a course of apprentice training when the training establishment and its apprentice courses are found upon investigation to have met the following criteria:

        (1) The standards of apprenticeship published by the Secretary of Labor pursuant to 29 U.S.C. 50a;

        (2) A signed copy of the training agreement for each veteran or eligible person, making reference to the training program and wage schedule as approved by the State approving agency, is provided to the veteran or eligible person and the Department of Veterans Affairs and the State approving agency by the employer; and

        (d)  As funding permits, Department of Veterans Affairs employees will promote the development of apprenticeships. They will:

        (1) Visit employers and joint apprenticeship committees,

        (2) Coordinate their efforts with activities of any State approving agencies that may choose to promote the development of apprenticeships, and

#### § § 21.4262

        (a)  An “other training on-the-job” course is any training on the job which does not qualify as an apprentice course, as defined in § 21.4261, but which otherwise meets the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section.

        (b)  Any training establishment desiring to furnish a course of other training on-the-job will submit to the appropriate State approving agency a written application setting forth the following:

        (1) Title and description of the specific job objective for which the veteran or eligible person is to be trained;

        (2) The length of the training period;

        (6) There is in the training establishment adequate space, equipment, instructional material, and instructor personnel to provide satisfactory training on-the-job;

        (7) Adequate records are kept to show the progress made by each veteran or eligible person toward his or her job objective;

        (8) The veteran or eligible person is not already qualified by training and experience for the job;

        (9) The requirements of paragraphs (b)(6) and (7) of this section are met;

        (10) A signed copy of the training agreement for each veteran or eligible person, including the training program and wage schedule as approved by the State approving agency, is provided to the veteran or eligible person and the Department of Veterans Affairs and the State approving agency by the employer; and

        (11) The course meets such other reasonable criteria as may be established by the State approving agency.

        (1) Visit employers,

        (2) Coordinate their efforts with activities of any State approving agencies that may choose to promote the development of on-the-job training courses, and

        § 21.4263   Approval of flight training courses.

#### § § 21.4263

        (a)  A State approving agency may approve a flight course only if a flight school or an institution of higher learning offers the course. A State approving agency may not approve a flight course if an individual instructor offers it. The provisions of § 21.4150 shall determine the proper State approving agency for approving a flight course.

        (b)  A  is a school, other than an institution of higher learning, or is an entity, such as an aero club; is located in a State; and meets one of the following sets of requirements:

        (1) The Federal Aviation Administration has issued the school or entity either a pilot school certificate or a provisional pilot school certificate specifying each course the school is approved to offer under 14 CFR part 141;

        (2) The entity is either a flight training center or an air carrier that does not have a pilot school certificate or provisional pilot school certificate issued by the Federal Aviation Administration under 14 CFR part 141, but pursuant to a grant of exemption letter issued by the Federal Aviation Administration under 14 CFR part 61 is permitted to offer pilot training by a flight simulator instead of an actual aircraft; or

        (3) The Federal Aviation Administration has issued the school or entity a training center certificate under 14 CFR part 142.

        (c)  An aero club, established, formed, and operated under authority of service department regulations as a nonappropriated sundry fund activity, is an instrumentality of the Federal government. Consequently, VA has exclusive jurisdiction over approval of flight courses offered by such aero clubs.

        (d)  A State approving agency may approve a flight training course that is part of a program of education leading to a standard college degree provided the course and program meet the requirements of § 21.4253 or § 21.4254, as appropriate. The institution of higher learning offering the course need not be a flight school.

        (e)  A flight course is subject to the same approval requirements as any other course. In addition, the State approving agency must apply the following provisions to the approval of flight courses:

        (1) The Federal Aviation Administration must approve the course; and

        (2)(i) The course must meet the requirements of 14 CFR part 63 or 141, and a flight school described in paragraph (b)(1) or (b)(3) of this section must offer it; or

        (ii) The course must meet the requirements of 14 CFR part 61, and either be offered—

        (A) By a flight school described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section; or

        (B) In whole or in part by a flight simulator pursuant to a grant of exemption letter issued by the Federal Aviation Administration to the flight school offering the course.

        (f)  Notwithstanding the fact that the Federal Aviation Administration will permit flight schools to conduct training at a base other than the main base of operations if the requirements of either 14 CFR 141.91 or 14 CFR 142.17 are met, the satellite base is considered under 38 U.S.C. 3680A(e)(2) to be a branch of the principal school, and must meet the requirements of 38 U.S.C. 3680A(e)(2).

        (g)  When a school or entity offers all or part of a flight course under a contract with another school or entity, the State approving agency must apply § 21.4233 in the following manner:

        (1) The requirements of § 21.4233(e) must be met for all contracted flight instruction, instruction by flight training device, flight simulator instruction, and ground school training. Ground school training may be given through a ground school facility operated jointly by two or more flight schools in the same locality; and

        (2) The responsibility for providing the instruction lies with the flight school. The degree of affiliation between the flight school and the entity or other school that actually does the instructing must be such that all charges for instruction are made by, and paid to, one entity having jurisdiction and control over both the flight and ground portions of the program.

        (h) —(1)  The provisions of § 21.4254 are applicable to approval of flight training courses.

        (2)  The State approving agency will apply the following additional requirements to a flight course:

        (i) All flight instruction, instruction by flight training device, flight simulator instruction, preflight briefings and postflight critiques, and ground school training in a course must be given by the flight school or under suitable arrangements between the school and another school or entity such as a local community college.

        (ii) All ground school training connected with the course must be in residence under the direction and supervision of a qualified instructor providing an opportunity for interaction between the students and the instructor. Simply making provision for having an instructor available to answer questions does not satisfy this requirement.

        (3) A flight school must keep at a minimum the following records for each eligible veteran, servicemember, or reservist pursuing flight training:

        (i) A copy of his or her private pilot certificate;

        (ii) Evidence of completion of any prior training that may be a prerequisite for the course;

        (iii) A copy of the medical certificate required by paragraph (a)(2) of this section for the courses being pursued and copies of all medical certificates (expired or otherwise) needed to support all periods of prior instruction received at the current school;

        (iv) A daily flight log or copy thereof;

        (v) A permanent ground school record;

        (vi) A progress log;

        (vii) An invoice of flight changes for individual flights or flight lessons for training conducted on a flight simulator or advanced flight training device;

        (viii) Daily flight sheets identifying records upon which the 85-15 percent ratio may be computed;

        (ix) A continuous meter record for each aircraft;

        (x) An invoice or flight tickets signed by the student and instructor showing hour meter reading, type of aircraft, and aircraft identification number;

        (xi) An accounts receivable ledger;

        (xii) Individual instructor records;

        (xiii) Engine log books;

        (xiv) A record for each student above the private pilot level stating the name of the course in which the student is currently enrolled and indicating whether the student is enrolled under 14 CFR part 61, part 63, part 141, or part 142;

        (xv) Records of tuition and accounts which are evidence of tuition charged and received from all students; and

        (xvi) If training is provided under 14 CFR part 141, the records required by that part, or if training is provided under 14 CFR part 142, the records required by that part.

        (i)  A flight course approved pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section shall be approved only for those hours of instruction generally considered necessary for a student to obtain an identified vocational objective. This requirement is met only if the number of hours approved does not exceed the maximum set forth in paragraph (i)(1) through (3) of this section. Flight instruction may never be substituted for ground training.

        (1)  Except as provided in paragraph (i)(4) of this section, the maximum number of hours of flight instruction or flight simulator instruction which may be approved for a flight course shall not exceed the number determined by this paragraph.

        (i) The maximum number of hours of solo flight instruction shall not exceed the minimum number of hours required for the course provided by FAA regulations.

        (ii) The maximum number of hours of dual flight instruction shall not exceed the lesser of—

        (A) The number of hours of dual flight instruction in the course outline approved by the FAA, or

        (B) 120% of the minimum number of hours of dual flight instruction required for the course by FAA regulations.

        (iii) The maximum number of hours of instruction by flight simulator or flight training device that a State approving agency may approve is the maximum number of hours of instruction by flight simulator or flight training device permitted by 14 CFR part 61 for that course when:

        (A) A course is offered in whole or in part by flight simulator or flight training device conducted by a training center certificated under 14 CFR part 142; and

        (B) 14 CFR part 61 contains a maximum number of hours of instruction by flight simulator or flight training device that may be credited toward the requirements of the rating or certificate that is the objective of the course.

        (iv) If a course is offered in whole or in part by flight simulator or flight training device, and the course is not described in paragraph (i)(1)(iii) of this section, either because the course is offered by a flight training center with a grant of exemption letter, or because 14 CFR part 61 does not contain a maximum number of hours of instruction by flight simulator or flight training device, the maximum number of hours of instruction by flight simulator or flight training device that may be approved may not exceed the number of hours in the Federal Aviation Administration-approved outline.

        (2)  The ground training portion of a flight course may include two forms of ground training instruction, ground school and preflight briefings and postflight critiques. The minimum hours for ground training, as specified in 14 CFR part 141, appendixes C through J refer only to ground school and not to preflight briefings and postflight critiques. If the ground school training consists of units using kits containing audiovisual equipment, quizzes and examinations, the maximum number of units approved shall not exceed the number on the course outline approved by the FAA. For all other ground school training, the number of hours of training shall not exceed the number of hours on the course outline approved by the FAA.

        (3)  Hours spent in preflight briefings and postflight critiques need not be approved by the FAA.

        (i) If these hours are on the FAA-approved outline, the maximum number of hours of preflight briefings and postflight critiques shall not exceed the number of hours on the outline exclusive of the preflight briefings and post-flight critiques which are attributable to solo flying hours that exceed the minimum number of solo flying hours for the course in 14 CFR part 141.

        (ii) If these hours are not on the FAA-approved outline, they may not be approved unless the State approving agency finds that the briefings and critiques are an integral part of the course and do not precede or follow solo flying hours which exceed the minimum number of solo flying hours for the course in 14 CFR part 141. The maximum number of hours of preflight briefings and postflight critiques which may be approved for these courses may not, when added together, exceed 25 percent of the approved hours of flight instruction.

        (4)  (i) Flight schools that wish to have a greater number of hours of dual flight instruction approved than are permitted by paragraph (i)(1)(ii) of this section, may seek an administrative review of their approval by the Director, Education Service. Requests for such a review should be made in writing to the Director of the VA facility having jurisdiction over the flight school. The request should—

        (A) State the reasons why the flight school believes that the approval should extend to a greater number of hours, and

        (B) Include any evidence tending to show that the greater number of hours should be approved.

        (ii) The Director, Education Service shall base her or his decision upon the evidence submitted, the recommendation of the Director of the VA facility, and, if appropriate, the recommendation of the State approving agency having jurisdiction over the flight school.

        (iii) The limit on the number of hours of solo flight instruction found in paragraph (i)(1)(i) of this section may not be waived.

        (j)  The appropriate State approving agency shall approve charges for tuition and fees for each flight course exclusive of charges for tuition and fees for solo flying hours which exceed the maximum permitted under paragraph (i)(1)(i) of this section and for preflight briefings and postflight critiques which precede or follow the excess solo hours.

        (1) The approved charges for tuition and fees shall be based upon the charges for tuition and fees which similarly circumstanced nonveterans enrolled in the same flight course are required to pay. Charges for books, supplies and lodging may not be reimbursed.

        (2) For the ground school portion of ground training, the State approving agency should approve group charges or unit prices if audio-visual equipment is used. For the preflight briefings and postflight critiques, the State approving agency should approve individual instructor rates for individual training flights. An average charge per hour based upon total hours and cost of all training given on the ground may not be approved.

        (3) A veteran, servicemember or reservist or group (all or part of whom are veterans, servicemembers or reservists) owning an airplane may lease it to an approved flight school and have exclusive use of the aircraft for flight training. The aircraft should meet the requirements prescribed for all airplanes to be used in the course, and should be shown in the approval by the State approving agency. The leasing arrangement should not result in charges for flight instruction for those owning the airplane greater than charges made to others not leasing an aircraft to the school.

        (4) If membership in a flight club entitles a veteran, servicemember or reservist to flight training at less than the standard rate, his or her educational allowance will be based on the reduced rate. No payments will be made for the cost of joining the flight club, since it is not a charge for the flight course.

        (k)  Except for minor substitutions a veteran, servicemember or reservist enrolled in a flight course may train only in the aircraft approved for that course. If a particular aircraft is not available for some compelling reason, the veteran, servicemember or reservist may be permitted to train in an aircraft different from that approved for the particular course, provided the aircraft substituted will adequately meet the training requirements for this particular phase of the course. Substitutions should be explained on the monthly certifications of flight training. If this shows that the charge for the substituted aircraft is different from the charge approved for the regular aircraft, the reimbursement will be based on the lesser charge. When substitution becomes the practice rather than the exception, VA will suspend payments and notify the veterans, servicemembers, reservists and the school. VA will refer the matter to the State approving agency for appropriate action.

        (l)  A flight course must meet the 85-15 percent ratio requirement set forth in § 21.4201 before VA may approve new enrollments in the course. The contracted portion of a flight course must meet all the requirements of § 21.4201 for each subcontractor.

        § 21.4264   Farm cooperative courses.

#### § § 21.4264

        (a)  A farm cooperative course is an institutional agricultural course. It provides training on a reduced basis to those engaged in farming, compared to other types of training. Part-time benefits are provided for students whose farming operation will not permit them to attend class at least 10 hours per week.

        (b)  In order to receive educational assistance allowance an eligible person must be engaged concurrently in agricultural employment for an average of at least 40 hours per week. This agricultural employment must be relevant to the farm cooperative course.

        (c)  (1) The institutional portion of a farm cooperative course:

        (i) May be on a term, quarter or semester basis, or

        (ii) May consist of courses which:

        (A) Are offered during at least 44 weeks of the year, and

        (B) Require a minimum of 5 clock hours per week.

        (2) The time involved in field trips and individual and group instruction, sponsored and conducted by the educational institution offering farm cooperative courses may be counted toward meeting the clock-hour requirements. See § 21.4270(c) of this part for measurement of farm cooperative courses.

        (d)  (1) Any school desiring to enroll spouses or children in farm cooperative courses:

        (i) Will submit to the appropriate State approving agency a written application for approval in accordance with § 21.4253 or § 21.4254 as appropriate; and

        (ii) Must submit statements of fact showing at least the following:

        (A) That the course is set up in the school catalog or other literature of the school;

        (B) That the agricultural course is offered concurrently with agricultural employment; and

        (C) That the school itself verifies on a continuing basis that students are engaged for an average of at least 40 hours per week in suitable agricultural employment which is relevant to the institutional agricultural course offered by the school and is in an area consistent with their institutional training program.

        (2) For the purposes of this paragraph suitable agricultural employment must include employment on a farm or other agricultural establishment where the basic activity is either:

        (i) The cultivation of the ground such as the raising and harvesting of crops including fruits, vegetables and pastures, or

        (ii) The feeding, breeding and managing of livestock, including poultry and other specialized farming.

        (3) The Department of Veterans Affairs does not consider employment in training establishments which are engaged primarily in the processing, distribution or sale of agricultural products or combinations thereof, such as dairy processing plants, grain elevators, packing plants, hatcheries, stockyards or florists shops to be suitable agricultural employment.

        (e)  The appropriate State approving agency may approve the school's application when the agency finds upon investigation that the school and its courses have met the following conditions:

        (1) The criteria specified in § 21.4253 or § 21.4254, as appropriate; and

        (2) The requirements of paragraph (d) of this section.

        § 21.4265   Practical training approved as institutional training or on-job training.

#### § § 21.4265

        (a)  (1) Medical residencies (other than residencies in podiatric medicine), dental residencies, and osteopathic internships and residencies may be approved and recognized as institutional courses only when an appropriate accrediting agency accredits and approves them as leading to certification for a recognized professional objective.

        (2) The appropriate accrediting agencies are:

        (i) The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education, or where the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education has delegated accrediting authority, the appropriate Residency Review Committee,

        (ii) The American Osteopathic Association, and

        (iii) The Commission on Dental Accreditation of the American Dental Association.

        (3) These residency programs—

        (i) Must lead to certification by an appropriate Specialty or Subspecialty Board, the American Osteopathic Association, or the American Dental Association; and

        (ii) Will not be approved to include a period of practice following completion of the education requirements even though the accrediting agency requires the practice.

        (4) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(5) of this section, no other medical or dental residency or osteopathic internship or residency will be approved or recognized as institutional training.

        (5) A residency in podiatric medicine may be approved and recognized as institutional training only when it has been approved by the Council on Podiatry Education of the American Podiatry Association.

        (b)  (1) Courses for the objective of registered nurse or registered professional nurse will be assessed as institutional training when they are provided in autonomous schools of nursing, hospital schools of nursing, or schools of nursing established in other schools or departments of colleges and universities, if they are accredited by a nationally recognized accrediting agency or if they meet the requirements of the licensing body of the State in which the school is located. The hospital or fieldwork phase of a nursing course, including a course leading to a degree in nursing, will be assessed as an institutional course when the hospital or fieldwork phase is an integral part of the course, the completion thereof is a prerequisite to the successful completion of the course, the student remains enrolled in the school during the period, and the training is under the direction and supervision of the school.

        (2) Courses offered by schools which lead to the objective of practical nurse, practical trained nurse, or licensed practical nurse will be assessed as institutional training including both the academic subjects and the clinical training if the clinical training is offered by an affiliated or cooperating hospital and the student is enrolled in and supervised by the school during the period of such clinical training. Also they must be accredited by a nationally recognized accrediting agency or meet the requirements of the licensing body of the State in which the school is located.

        (3) Except for enrollment in a nurse's aide course approved pursuant to § 21.4253(a)(5), VA shall not approve an enrollment in a nonaccredited nursing course which does not meet the licensing requirements of the State where the course is offered.

        (c)  (1) Required clinical training included in a school course given in an affiliated hospital, clinic, laboratory, or medical center as a part of a medical or dental specialty course whether accredited or nonaccredited offered by a school such as X-ray technician, medical technician, medical records administrator, physical therapist or dental technician shall be assessed as institutional training provided:

        (i) The student remains enrolled in the course during the clinical period;

        (ii) The clinical training is;

        () An integr_a_l part of the course;

        () A prerequisite to the successful completion of the course; and

        () Under the dire_c_tion and supervision of the school; and

        (iii) The course includes substantial technical or professional training and does not consist of training preliminarily directed to clerical, administrative, secretarial, or receptionist duties.

        (2) Medical and dental specialty courses offered in hospitals, clinics, laboratories, or medical centers which are accredited as institutional courses by a nationally recognized accrediting agency will be assessed as institutional training.

        (3) Clinical training included in a school course given in a physician's office or a dentist's office, also called externship, will be recognized as part of the institutional training if the course is accredited by a nationally recognized accrediting agency and meets the other requirements of paragraph (c)(1) of this section. If the course is not so accredited such practical or on-the-job training or experience in a physician's office may not be included unless the program is approved as a cooperative course.

        (4) Nonaccredited courses offered in hospitals, clinics, laboratories, or medical centers will be considered on-the-job training when the courses meet the requirements of § 21.4262.

        (d)  A course prescribed by the Secretary for full-time physicians' assistants or for full-time expanded-function auxiliaries (formerly referred to as dentists' assistants) may be approved as institutional training, if the course is conducted at Department of Veterans Affairs facilities or in facilities operated by hospitals, medical schools, or medical installations pursuant to a contract with the Department of Veterans Affairs.

        (e)  (1) Any non-medically related professional internship program, such as a clinical pastoral course, will be recognized as an institutional course when it is accredited as an institutional course by a nationally recognized accrediting agency, and

        (2) The approved facility for such a course must be the institution or other facility where the training is given.

        (f)  (1) Other off-campus job experience included in a school course, variously described by schools as internship, residency, practicum, externship, et cetera, may be included as a part of a cooperative program when the course meets the requirements of § 21.4233(a).

        (2) However, such off-campus courses may be considered as resident institutional training only if all of the following conditions are met. The course is:

        (i) Accredited by a nationally recognized accrediting agency or is offered by a school that is accredited by one of the regional accrediting associations;

        (ii) A part of the approved curriculum of the school;

        (iii) Directly supervised by the school;

        (iv) Measured in the same unit as other courses;

        (v) Required for graduation; and

        (vi) Has a planned program of activities described in the school's official publication which is approved by the State approving agency and which is institutional in nature as distinguished from training on-the-job. The description shall include at least:

        (A) A unit subject description;

        (B) A provision for an assigned instructor;

        (C) A statement that the planned program of activities is controlled by the school, not by the officials of the job establishment;

        (D) A requirement that class attendance on at least a weekly basis be regularly scheduled to provide for interaction between instructor and student;

        (E) A statement that appropriate assignments are required for completion of the course;

        (F) A grading system similar to the system used for other resident subjects offered by the school; and

        (G) A schedule of time required for the training which demonstrates that the student shall spend at least as much time in preparation and training as is normally required by the school for its other resident courses.

        (g)  Any nonaccredited internship program not given in a school will be recognized as other on-the-job training when it meets the requirements of § 21.4262 and when the program is required for licensure by the State in which it is offered. (See § 21.4275 for measurement.)

        § 21.4266   Approval of courses at a branch campus or extension.

#### § § 21.4266

        (a)  The following definitions apply to the terms used in this section.

        (1)  means the ability to maintain all records and accounts that § 21.4209 requires.

        (2)  means a representative of an educational institution designated to provide VA with the reports and certifications that §§ 21.4203, 21.4204, 21.5810, 21.5812, 21.7152, and 21.7652 require.

        (3)  means the location where the primary teaching facilities of an educational institution are located. If an educational institution has only one teaching location, that location is its main campus. If it is unclear which of the educational institution's teaching facilities is primary, the main campus is the location of the primary office of its Chief Executive Officer.

        (4)  means a location of an educational institution that—

        (i) Is geographically apart from and operationally independent of the main campus of the educational institution;

        (ii) Has its own faculty, administration and supervisory organization; and

        (iii) Offers courses in education programs leading to a degree, certificate, or other recognized education credential.

        (5)  means a location of an educational institution that is geographically apart from and is operationally dependent on the main campus or a branch campus of the educational institution.

        (b)  (1) The State approving agency for the State where a residence course is being taught has jurisdiction over approval of that course for VA education benefit purposes.

        (2) The fact that the location where the educational institution is offering the course may be temporary will not serve to change jurisdictional authority.

        (3) The fact that the main campus of the educational institution may be located in another State from that in which the course is being taught will not serve to change jurisdictional authority.

        (c)  Before approving a course or a program of education offered at a branch campus or an extension of an educational institution, the State approving agency must ensure that—

        (1) Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, each location where the course or program is offered has administrative capability; and

        (2) Except as provided in paragraph (f) of this section, each location where the course or program is offered has a certifying official on site.

        (d)  (1) A State approving agency may approve a course or program offered by a branch campus that does not have its own administrative capability if—

        (i) The main campus of the educational institution within the same State maintains a centralized recordkeeping system that includes all records and accounts that § 21.4209 requires for each student attending the branch campus without administrative capability. These records may be originals, certified copies, or in an electronically formatted record keeping system; and

        (ii) The main campus can identify the records of students at the branch campus for which it maintains centralized records.

        (2) The State approving agency may approve a course or program offered by an extension that does not have its own administrative capability if—

        (i) The extension and the main campus or branch campus it is dependent on are located within the same State;

        (ii) The main campus or branch campus the extension is dependent on has administrative capability for the extension; and

        (iii) The State approving agency combines the approval of the course(s) offered by the extension with the approval of the courses offered by the main campus or branch campus the extension is dependent on.

        (e)  The State approving agency may combine the approval of courses offered by an extension of an educational institution with the approval of the main campus or the branch campus that the extension is dependent on, if the extension is within the same State as the campus it is dependent on. Combining the approval of courses offered by an extension, with the approval of courses offered by the main campus or branch campus the extension is dependent on, does not negate the minimum period of operation requirements in § 21.4251 for courses that do not lead to a standard college degree offered by an extension of a proprietary educational institution. The State approving agency will list the extension and courses approved on the notice of approval sent to the educational institution pursuant to § 21.4258 of this part.

        (f)  Exceptions to the requirement in paragraph (c) of this section, that each location with an approved course or program of education must have a certifying official on site, will be permitted for—

        (1) Extensions of an educational institution when the State approving agency combines the approval of the courses offered by the extension with a branch campus or main campus. (See paragraph (e) of this section.)

        (2) Educational institutions with more than one campus within the same State if the main campus—

        (i) Maintains a centralized recordkeeping system. (See paragraph (d)(1) of this section.);

        (ii) Has administrative capability for the branch campus (or branch campuses) within the same State; and

        (iii) Centralizes its certifying official function at the main campus.

        (3) Educational institutions with multi-state campuses when an educational institution wants to centralize its certifying official function into one or more locations if:

        (i) The educational institution submits all required reports and certifications that §§ 21.4203, 21.4204, 21.5810, 21.5812, 21.7152, and 21.7652 require via electronic submission through VA's Internet-based education certification application;

        (ii) The educational institution designates an employee, at each teaching location of the educational institution that does not have a certifying official present, to serve as a point-of-contact for veterans, servicemembers, reservists, or other eligible persons; the certifying official(s); the State approving agency of jurisdiction; and VA. The designated employee must have access (other than to transmit certifications) to VA's Internet-based education certification application to provide certification information to veterans, servicemembers, reservists, or other eligible persons, State approving agency representatives, and VA representatives;

        (iii) Each certifying official uses the VA facility code for the location that has administrative capability for the teaching location where the student is training when submitting required reports and certifications to VA; and

        (iv) Each certifying official has full access to the administrative records and accounts that § 21.4209 requires for each student attending the teaching location(s) for which the certifying official has been designated responsibility. These records may be originals, certified copies, or in an electronically formatted record keeping system.

        (1) A cooperative course as defined in § 21.4233(a);

        (2) A farm cooperative course; or

        (3) A course approved as a correspondence course.

        (d)  VA considers the following undergraduate courses to be resident training.

        (1) A course which meets the requirements for resident institutional training found in § 21.4265(f);

        (2) A course which requires regularly scheduled, standard class sessions at least once every two weeks and which has a total number of class sessions equal to the number of credit hours awarded for the course, times the number of weeks in a standard quarter or semester, as applicable;

        (3) A course of student teaching; and

        (4) Flight training which is an integral part of a standard undergraduate college degree.

        (e)  VA considers a graduate course to be resident training if the course—

        (1) Is offered through regularly scheduled, conventional classroom or laboratory sessions; or

        (2) Consists of research (either on campus or in absentia) necessary for the preparation of the student's—

        (i) Master's thesis,

        (ii) Doctoral dissertation, or

        (iii) Similar treatise which is prerequisite to the degree being pursued; or

        (3) Consists of a combination of training as described in paragraphs (e)(1) and (e)(2) of this section.

        (f)  A State approving agency may approve a course offered by independent study or a combination of independent study and resident training only if the course—

        (1) Is accredited;

        (2) Meets the requirements of § 21.4253; and

        (3) Either—

        (i) Leads to a standard college degree; or

        (ii) For courses approved on or after December 27, 2001, leads to a certificate that reflects educational attainment offered by an institution of higher learning.

        (g)  Remedial and deficiency courses offered by independent study cannot be approved.

#### § § 21.4268

        (a)  (1) Except for approval of the licensing and certification tests and the organizations or entities offering these tests that, as provided in § 21.4250(c)(2), are VA's responsibility, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs delegates to each State approving agency the authority, within the respective State approving agency's jurisdiction provided in § 21.4250(a), to approve licensing and certification tests and to approve the organizations or entities offering licensing and certification tests.

        (2) The Secretary of Veterans Affairs delegates to the Under Secretary for Benefits, and to personnel the Under Secretary for Benefits may designate within the Education Service of the Veterans Benefits Administration, the authority to approve the licensing and certification tests and the organizations or entities offering these tests that, as provided in § 21.4250(c)(2)(vi), are VA's responsibility.

        (b)  (1) If an organization or entity wants a licensing or certification test that it offers to be approved for payment of educational assistance, it must apply for approval to the State approving agency having jurisdiction over the locality where the organization or entity has its headquarters. The application must be in the form the State approving agency requires.

        (2) In order to be approved for payment of educational assistance to veterans and eligible persons, a licensing or certification test must meet the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section, and the organization or entity offering the test must meet the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section and, if appropriate, the requirements of paragraph (d) of this section.

        (i) The State approving agency may approve a licensing or certification test only if—

        (A) The test is required under Federal, State, or local law or regulation for an individual to enter into, maintain, or advance in employment in a predetermined and identified vocation or profession; or

        (B) The State approving agency decides that the test is generally accepted, in accordance with relevant government, business, or industry standards, employment policies, or hiring practices, as attesting to a level of knowledge or skill required to qualify to enter into, maintain, or advance in employment in a predetermined and identified vocation or profession.

        (ii) If a State or political subdivision of a State offers a licensing or certification test, the State approving agency will deem the test to have met the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section.

        (3) In considering whether the test is generally accepted, a State approving agency may consider the following:

        (i) The nature and number of the entities that recognize the certificate awarded to candidates who pass the test;

        (ii) The degree to which employers in the relevant industry accept the certification test;

        (iii) Whether major employers in an industry require that their employees obtain the certificate awarded to candidates who pass the test;

        (iv) The percentage of people employed in the vocation or profession who have taken the test and obtained the certificate; or

        (v) Any other reasonable criterion that the State approving agency believes will clarify whether the test is generally accepted.

        (4) Generally, if a State approving agency approves a certification test, VA will consider that the test is approved for any veteran or eligible person even if he or she takes the test at a location outside the State where the organization or entity offering the test has its headquarters. However, a certification test approval is valid only in the State where the State approving agency has jurisdiction if—

        (i) A State licensing agency recognizes the certification test as meeting a requirement for a license and has sought approval for that test; and

        (ii) The State approving agency for the State where the licensing agency is located approves that test.

        (c)  An organization or entity must meet the requirements of this paragraph and, if a nongovernmental organization, of paragraph (d) of this section, in order for the State approving agency to approve a licensing or certification test that the organization or entity offers for payment of educational assistance to veterans and eligible persons who take the test. The organization or entity must—

        (1) Maintain appropriate records with respect to all candidates who take the test for a period of not less than three years from the date the organization or entity administers the test to the candidates;

        (2) Promptly issue notice of the results of the test to the candidate for the license or certificate;

        (3) Have a process to review complaints submitted against the organization or entity with respect to the test or the process for obtaining a license or certificate required for a vocation or profession;

        (4) Give to the State approving agency the following information:

        (i) A description of the licensing or certification test that the organization or entity offers, including the purpose of the test, the vocational, professional, governmental, and other entities that recognize the test, and the license or certificate issued upon passing the test;

        (ii) The requirements to take the test, including the amount of the fee charged for the test and any prerequisite education, training, skills, or other certification; and

        (iii) The period for which the license or certificate is awarded is valid, and the requirements for maintaining or renewing the license or certificate; and

        (5) Agree to give the following information to VA at VA's request:

        (i) The amount of the fee a candidate pays to take a test;

        (ii) The results of any test a candidate takes; and

        (iii) Personal identifying information of any candidate who applies for reimbursement from VA for a test.

        (d)  (1) In addition to complying with the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section, a nongovernmental organization or entity must meet the requirements of paragraph (d) of this section before a certification test it offers can be approved for payment of educational assistance to veterans and eligible persons who take the test. Except as provided in paragraphs (d)(3) and (d)(4) of this section, the organization or entity—

        (i) Certifies to the State approving agency that the licensing or certification test offered by the organization or entity is generally accepted, in accordance with relevant government, business, or industry standards, employment policies, or hiring practices, as attesting to a level of knowledge or skill required to qualify to enter into, maintain, or advance in employment in a predetermined and identified vocation or profession;

        (ii) Is licensed, chartered, or incorporated in a State and has offered the test for a minimum of two years before the date on which the organization or entity first submits to the State approving agency an application for approval under this section;

        (iii) Employs, or consults with, individuals with expertise or substantial experience with respect to all areas of knowledge or skill that are measured by the test and that are required for the license or certificate issued; and

        (iv) Has no direct financial interest in—

        (A) The outcome of the test; or

        (B) An organization that provides the education or training of candidates for licenses or certificates required for a vocation or profession.

        (2) At the request of the State approving agency, the organization or entity seeking approval for a licensing or certification test must give such information to the State approving agency as the State approving agency decides is necessary to perform an assessment of—

        (i) The test the organization or entity conducts as compared to the level of knowledge or skills that a license or certificate attests; and

        (ii) The applicability of the test over such periods of time as the State approving agency decides is appropriate.

        (3) The provisions of paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section will not prevent the approval of a test if the organization or entity has offered a reasonably related test for at least two years.

        (4) The provisions of paragraph (d)(1)(iv) of this section will not prevent the approval of a test if the organization or entity—

        (i) Offers a sample test or preparatory materials to a candidate for the test but does not otherwise provide preparatory education or training to the candidate; or

        (ii) Has a financial interest in an organization that provides preparatory education or training of a candidate for a test, but that test is advantageous in but not required for practicing a vocation or profession.

        (e)  The State approving agency must provide notice of an approval of a test as required in § 21.4250(b). If the State approving agency wishes to withdraw approval of a test, it must follow the provisions of § 21.4259.

        (f)  (1) If an organization or entity offering a test disagrees with a State approving agency's decision to disapprove a test or to disapprove the organization or entity offering the test, it may seek a review of the decision from the Director, Education Service. If the Director, Education Service has acted as the State approving agency, the organization or entity may seek a review of the decision from the Under Secretary for Benefits.

        (2) The organization or entity must make its request for a review in writing to the State approving agency. The State approving agency must receive the request within 90 days of the date of the notice to the organization or entity that the test or the organization or entity is disapproved.

        (3) The review will be based on the evidence of record at the time the State approving agency made its initial decision. It will not be  in character.

        (4) The Director, Education Service or the Under Secretary for Benefits may seek the advice of the Professional Certification and Licensure Advisory Committee, established under 38 U.S.C. 3689(e), as to whether the State approving agency's decision should be reversed.

        (5) The decision of the Director, Education Service or the Under Secretary for Benefits is the final administrative decision. It will not be subject to further administrative review.

        § 21.4269   Bar to approval.

#### § § 21.4269

        (a) Beginning on August 1, 2019, a State approving agency, or the Secretary when acting in the role of the State approving agency, shall disapprove a program of education provided by an educational institution that has in effect a policy that is inconsistent with any of the following:

        (1) A policy that permits any covered individual to attend or participate in the program of education during the period beginning on the date on which the individual provides to the educational institution any verifiable and authoritative VA document demonstrating entitlement to educational assistance under 38 U.S.C. chapter 31, chapter 33, or chapter 35 (such as a decision or notice of decision on entitlement, letter from VA, updated award letter from VA, or print-out of eligibility (statement of benefits) from a web-based VA system or beneficiary portal to include verification through VA's secure information technology system in accordance with 38 U.S.C. 3699A if an individual has provided authorization to obtain remaining entitlement information), and ending on the earlier of the following dates:

        (i) The date on which payment from VA is made to the institution.

        (ii) The date that is 90 days after the date on which the educational institution certifies tuition and fees following receipt of the verifiable and authoritative VA document proving entitlement to educational assistance under 38 U.S.C. chapter 31, chapter 33, or chapter 35.

        (2) A policy that ensures an educational institution will not impose any penalty, including the assessment of late fees, the denial of access to classes, libraries, or other institutional facilities, or the requirement that a covered individual borrow additional funds, on any covered individual because of the individual's inability to meet his or her financial obligations to the institution due to the delayed disbursement of a payment to be provided by VA under 38 U.S.C. chapter 31, chapter 33, or chapter 35.

        (b) For purposes of this section, a covered individual is any individual who is entitled to educational assistance under 38 U.S.C. chapter 31, chapter 33, or chapter 35.

        (c) The Secretary (or designee) may waive such requirements of paragraph (a) of this section as the Secretary (or designee) considers appropriate. An educational institution must apply for a waiver within 60 days of the SAA determination that an educational institution is not in compliance with paragraph (a).

        (d) It shall not be inconsistent with a policy described in paragraph (a) of this section for an educational institution:

        (1) To require a covered individual to take the following additional actions:

        (i) Submit any verifiable and authoritative VA document to prove entitlement to educational assistance under 38 U.S.C. chapter 31, chapter 33, or chapter 35 (as described in paragraph (a)(1)) not later than the first day of a program of education for which the individual has indicated the individual wishes to use the individual's entitlement to educational assistance.

        (ii) Submit a written request to use such entitlement.

        (iii) Provide additional information necessary to the proper certification of enrollment by the educational institution. If an educational institution intends to require additional information necessary for proper certification of enrollment, any such requirement must be included in the school's published catalog and also must be approved by the State approving agency, or the Secretary when acting in the role of the State approving agency, as being necessary for proper certification and not overly burdensome to submit.

        (2) In a case in which a covered individual is unable to meet a financial obligation to an educational institution due to the delayed disbursement of a payment to be provided by VA under 38 U.S.C. chapter 31, chapter 33, or chapter 35 and the amount of such disbursement is less than the educational institution anticipated, to require additional payment of or impose a fee for the amount that is the difference between the amount of the financial obligation and the amount of the disbursement.

        (i) Such additional payment may include the amount of a financial obligation associated with charges for which VA does not pay benefits ( room and board, any portion of tuition for which a claimant does not qualify).

        (ii) An educational institution may utilize its standard debt collection policies for these amounts, including the assessment of late fees.

      Assessment and Pursuit of Courses

        § 21.4270   Measurement of courses.

#### § § 21.4270

        (a)  Trade, technical, high school, and high school preparatory courses shall be measured as stated in this paragraph.

        (1)  (i) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, if shop practice is an integral part of a trade or technical course not leading to a standard college degree—

        (A) A full-time enrollment is 22 clock hours per week (exclusive of supervised study) with not more than 2  hours rest period allowance;

        (B) A three-quarter-time enrollment is 16 through 21 clock hours per week (exclusive of supervised study) with not more than 2 hours rest period allowance;

        (C) A one-half-time enrollment is 11 through 15 clock hours per week (exclusive of supervised study) with not more than 1  hours rest period allowance;

        (D) A less than one-half-time but more than one-quarter-time enrollment is 6 through 10 clock hours per week (exclusive of supervised study) with not more than   hour rest period allowance; and

        (E) A quarter-time enrollment is 1 through 5 clock hours per week (exclusive of supervised study).

        (ii) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, if theory and class instruction constitute more than 50 percent of the required hours in a trade or technical course not leading to a standard college degree, enrollments will be measured as follows. In measuring net instruction there will be included customary intervals not to exceed 10 minutes between classes. Shop practice and rest periods are excluded. Supervised instruction periods in a school's shops and the time involved in field trips and group instruction may be included in computing the clock hour requirements.

        (A) A full-time enrollment is 18 clock hours net instruction per week (exclusive of supervised study);

        (B) A three-quarter-time enrollment is 13 through 17 clock hours net instruction per week (exclusive of supervised study);

        (C) A one-half-time enrollment is 9 through 12 clock hours net instruction per week (exclusive of supervised study);

        (D) A less than one-half-time but more than one-quarter-time enrollment is 5 through 8 clock hours net instruction per week (exclusive of supervised study); and

        (E) A quarter-time enrollment is 1 through 4 clock hours net instruction per week (exclusive of supervised study).

        (2)  If a student is pursuing high school courses at a rate which would result in an accredited high school diploma in four ordinary school years, VA considers him or her to be enrolled full time. Otherwise, for high school enrollments, training time will be determined as follows. (For the purpose of this paragraph, a unit is not less than one hundred and twenty 60-minute hours or the equivalent of study in any subject in one academic year.)

        (i) A full-time enrollment is 18 clock hours net instruction per week or four units per year or the equivalent;

        (ii) A three-quarter-time enrollment is 13 through 17 clock hours net instruction per week or three units per year or the equivalent;

        (iii) A one-half-time enrollment is 9 through 12 clock hours net instruction per week or two units per year or the equivalent;

        (iv) A less than one-half-time but more than one-quarter-time enrollment is 5 through 8 clock hours net instruction per week or one unit per year or the equivalent; and

        (v) A one-quarter-time enrollment is 1 through 4 clock hours net instruction per week.

        (3)  For a high school preparatory course pursued at the elementary school level—

        (i) A full-time enrollment is 18 clock hours net instruction per week;

        (ii) A three-quarter-time enrollment is 13 through 17 clock hours net instruction per week;

        (iii) A one-half-time enrollment is 9 through 12 clock hours net instruction per week;

        (iv) A less than one-half-time but more than one-quarter-time enrollment is 5 through 8 clock hours net instruction per week; and

        (v) A one-quarter-time enrollment is 1 through 4 clock hours per week.

        (b)  (1) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a)(1) of this section, if a student is enrolled in a course which is not leading to a standard college degree and which is offered by an institution of higher learning, VA will measure his or her enrollment in the same manner as collegiate undergraduate courses are measured according to the provisions of paragraph (c) of this section.

        (2) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a)(1) of this section, if a student is enrolled in a course not leading to a standard college degree which is offered on a standard quarter- or semester-hour basis by an educational institution which is not an institution of higher learning, VA shall measure his or her enrollment in the same manner as collegiate undergraduate courses are measured according to the provisions of paragraph (c) of this section, provided that the educational institution requires at least the same minimum number of hours of weekly attendance as are required by paragraph (a)(1) of this section for courses offered on a clock-hour basis. If the educational institution does not require at least the same minimum number of hours of weekly attendance as are required in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, VA will not apply the provisions of paragraph (c) of this section, but will measure the course according to the criteria in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.

        (c)  Collegiate graduate, professional and on-the-job training courses shall be measured as stated in this table. This shall be used for measurement of collegiate undergraduate courses subject to all the measurement criteria of § 21.4272. Clock hours and sessions mentioned in this table mean clock hours and class sessions per week.

#### § § 21.4271

        § 21.4272   Collegiate course measurement.

#### § § 21.4272

        VA will measure a college level course in an institution of higher learning on a credit-hour basis provided all the conditions under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section are met. See also § 21.4273.

        (a)  VA will measure a degree course on a credit-hour basis when—

        (1) An institution of higher learning offers the course; and

        (2) A nationally recognized accrediting association either—

        (i) Accredits the institution of higher learning, or

        (ii) Recognizes the institution as a candidate for accreditation; and

        (3) The credits earned in the course can be applied towards an associate, baccalaureate or higher degree which is—

        (i) Appropriate to the level of the institution of higher learning's accreditation, or

        (ii) Appropriate to the level of the institution of higher learning's candidacy for accreditation; and

        (4) The course is offered on a semester-hour or quarter-hour basis, and

        (5) The degree to which the course credits are applicable either—

        (i) Is granted by the institution of higher learning offering the course,

        (ii) Is a part of a concurrent enrollment as described in § 21.4233(b), or

        (iii) Is being pursued by a nonmatriculated student as provided in § 21.4252(l)(1), (2) or (3).

        (b)  VA will measure on a credit-hour basis a degree course which does not meet the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section when—

        (1) The course is offered on a semester- or quarter-hour basis, and

        (2) The course leads to an associate, baccalaureate, or higher degree, which is granted by the school offering the degree under authority specifically conferred by a State education agency, and

        (3) The school will furnish a letter from a State university or letters from three schools that are full members of a nationally recognized accrediting association. In each letter the State university or accredited school must certify either:

        (i) That credits have been accepted on transfer at full value without reservation, in partial fulfillment of the requirements for a baccalaureate or higher degree for at least three students within the last 5 years, and that at least 40 percent of the subjects within each curriculum, for which credit-hour measurement is sought, has been accepted without reservation by the certifying State university or accredited school, or

        (ii) That in the last 5 years at least three students, who have received a baccalaureate or higher degree as a result of having completed the nonaccredited course, have been admitted without reservation into a graduate or advanced professional program offered by the certifying State university or accredited school.

        (c) [Reserved]

        (d)  When an undergraduate course qualifies for credit-hour measurement, VA will measure it according to the table contained in § 21.4270(c) of this part.

        (e)-(f) [Reserved]

        (g)  (1) When a term is not a standard semester or quarter as defined in § 21.4200(b), the Department of Veterans Affairs will determine the equivalent for full-time training by:

        (i) Multiplying the credits to be earned in the term by 18 if credit is granted in semester hours, or by 12 if credit is granted in quarter hours, and

        (ii) Dividing the product by the number of whole weeks in the term.

        (2) In determining whole weeks for this formula VA will—

        (i) Determine the number of days from the beginning to the end of the term as certified by the educational institution, subtracting any vacation period of 7 days or more;

        (ii) Divide the number of days in the term by 7;

        (iii) Disregard a remainder of 3 days or less, and

        (iv) Consider 4 days or more to be a whole week.

        (3) The quotient resulting from the use of the formula is called equivalent credit hours. VA treats equivalent credit hours as credit hours for measurement purposes.

        (h)-(i) [Reserved]

        (j)  If a course is acceptable for credit, but the educational institution does not award credit to the veteran or eligible person because he or she has not met college entrance requirements or for some other valid reason, the Department of Veterans Affairs will measure the course as though it were pursued for credit, provided the veteran or eligible person performs all of the work prescribed for other students who are enrolled for credit.

        (k)  (1) Except for courses leading to a secondary school diploma or equivalent, the Department of Veterans Affairs will measure noncredit courses given by an institution of higher learning on a quarter- or semester-hour basis if the institution considers them to be the equivalent, for other administrative purposes, of undergraduate courses that lead to a standard college degree at the institution of higher learning.

        (2) The Department of Veterans Affairs shall measure other noncredit courses under the appropriate criteria of § 21.4270.

        (3) Where a school requires a veteran or eligible person to pursue noncredit deficiency, remedial or refresher courses in order to meet scholastic or entrance requirements, the school will certify the credit-hour equivalent of the noncredit deficiency, remedial or refresher courses in addition to the credit hours for which the veteran or eligible person is enrolled. The Department of Veterans Affairs will measure the course on the total of the credit hours and credit-hour equivalency.

        (2) An accredited graduate or advanced professional course, including law as specified in § 21.4274, pursued in residence at an institution of higher learning will be measured in accordance with § 21.4272 unless it is the established policy of the school to consider less than 14 semester hours or the equivalent as full-time enrollment, or the course includes research, thesis preparation, or a comparable prescribed activity beyond that normally required for the preparation of ordinary classroom assignments. In either case a responsible official of the school will certify that the veteran or eligible person is pursuing the course full, three-quarter, one-half, less than one-half but more than one-quarter, or one quarter or less time.

        (b)  A responsible official of the school will certify a program of research pursued by a veteran or eligible person in absentia as full, three-fourths, one-half, less than one-half but more than one-quarter, or one-quarter or less time, and the activity will be assessed by the Department of Veterans Affairs accordingly when:

        (1) The research activity is defined and organized so as to enable the certifying official to evaluate the time required for its successful pursuit, and

        (2) The time certified for the research activity is independent of the time devoted to any employment situation in which the veteran or eligible person might be engaged.

        (c)  If a graduate student is enrolled in both graduate and undergraduate courses concurrently, or solely in undergraduate courses, VA will measure such an enrollment using the provisions of § 21.4272 or the graduate school's assessment of training time, whichever will result in a higher monthly rate for the veteran.

      (1) The full amount of the loan.

      (2) Agreement to pay a fee not to exceed 3 percent for an insurance fund against defaults.

      (3) A note or other written obligation providing for repayment of the principal amount, and interest on the loan in annual installments over a period beginning 9 months after the date on which the borrower first ceases to be at least a half-time student and ending:

      (i) For loans of $600 or more, 10 years and 9 months after such date, or

      (ii) For loans of less than $600, 1 year and 7 months after such date for the first $50 of the loan plus 1 additional month for each additional $5 of the loan.

      (4) A provision for prepayment of all or part of the loan, without penalty, at the option of the borrower.

      (b)  The promissory note shall advise the student that the loan shall bear interest on the unpaid balance of the loan at a rate comparable to, but not in excess of, the rate of interest charged students at such time on loans insured by the Secretary of Education, Department of Education, under part B of Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965. The rate shall be determined as of the date the agreement is executed and shall be a fixed amount.

      (c)  The loan shall be made without security and without endorsement.

      (d)  Whenever VA determines that a default, in whole or in part, has occurred on any such loan the eligible spouse or surviving spouse shall be notified that the amount of the default shall be recovered from the eligible spouse or surviving spouse concerned in the same manner as other debt due the United States. Once a default has occurred, the eligible spouse's or surviving spouse's subsequent reentrance into training at the half-time or greater rate shall not be the basis for rescinding the default. A default may only be rescinded when VA has been led to create the default as a result of a mistake of fact or law.

      (e)  If the eligible spouse or surviving spouse dies or becomes permanently and totally disabled, even though he or she ceases to be permanently and totally disabled subsequent to the granting of the loan, the remaining liability of such person for an educational loan shall be discharged.

      (f)  Material misrepresentation of fact by the eligible spouse or surviving spouse, including omissions of relevant information, shall render the loan agreement null and void. The deferred payment provisions of the agreement shall not apply in such a case and the full amount of any loan balance shall become due and payable immediately. The amount due shall be recovered from the eligible spouse or surviving spouse in the same manner as any other debt due the United States.

      (g)  An eligible spouse or surviving spouse may sign both the loan application and the promissory note required and payment of the amounts authorized will be made to such person, notwithstanding his or her minority, unless the person has a legal guardian. In such cases the legal guardian must sign and will be paid the loan amounts.

      Eligibility

        § 21.5040   Basic eligibility.

#### § § 21.5040

        (a)  Whether an individual has basic eligibility under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 32 for educational assistance depends upon when he or she entered the military service, the length of that service, and the character of that service.

        (b)  (1) An individual not on active duty:

        (i) Must have entered the military service after December 31, 1976, and before July 1, 1985;

        (ii) Must not have and except as provided in paragraph (g) of this section must not have had basic eligibility under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 34;

        (iii) Must have received an unconditional discharge or release under conditions other than dishonorable from any period of service upon which eligibility is based;

        (iv) Must either have:

        (A) Served on active duty for a least 181 continuous days, or

        (B) Been discharged or released from active duty for a service-connected disability.

        (2) The Department of Veterans Affairs will consider that the veteran has an unconditional discharge or release if:

        (i) The individual was eligible for complete separation from active duty on the date a discharge or release was issued to him or her, or

        (ii) The provisions of § 3.13(c) of this chapter are met.

        (3) The provisions of § 3.12 of this chapter as to character of discharge and § 3.13 of this chapter as to conditional discharges are applicable.

        (c)  (1) Unless exempted by paragraph (d) of this section, persons who originally enlist in a regular component of the Armed Forces after September 7, 1980, or who enter on active duty after October 16, 1981 (either as an enlisted member or an officer) to be eligible under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 32, must first complete the shorter of:

        (i) 24 continuous months of active duty, or

        (ii) The full period for which the individual was called or ordered to active duty.

        (2) For the purpose of paragraph (c)(1) of this section the Department of Veterans Affairs considers that an enlisted person originally enlisted in a regular component of the Armed Forces on the date he or she entered on active duty even though he or she may have signed a delayed-entry contract on an earlier date.

        (3) In computing time served for the purpose of this paragraph, the Department of Veterans Affairs will exclude any period during which the individual is not entitled to credit for service as specified in § 3.15 of this chapter. However, those periods will be included in determining if the service was continuous.

        (d)  (1) An individual who originally enlists in a regular component of the Armed Forces after September 7, 1980, or who enters on active duty after October 16, 1981 (either as an enlisted member or officer), will be eligible to receive benefits under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 32 based upon the ensuing period of active duty, and is exempt from the provisions of paragraph (c) of this section if he or she subsequently:

        (i) Is discharged or released from active duty:

        (A) Under 10 U.S.C. 1173 (hardship discharge), or

        (B) Under 10 U.S.C. 1171 (early-out discharge), or

        (C) For a disability incurred in or aggravated in line of duty; or

        (ii) Is found by Department of Veterans Affairs to have a service-connected disability which gives the individual basic entitlement to disability compensation as described in § 3.4(b) of this chapter. Once the Department of Veterans Affairs makes this finding, the exemption will continue to apply even if the disability subsequently improves and becomes noncompensable.

        (2) An individual who enters on a period of active duty after October 16, 1981, is also exempt from the provisions of paragraph (c) of this section if he or she:

        (i) Previously completed a continuous period of active duty of at least 24 months, or

        (ii) Was discharged or released from a previous period of active duty under 10 U.S.C. 1171 (early-out discharge).

        (3) In computing time served for the purpose of this paragraph, the Department of Veterans Affairs will exclude any period during which the individual is not entitled to credit for service as specified in § 3.15 of this chapter. However, those periods will be included in determining if the service was continuous.

        (e)  An individual may become a participant and establish basic eligibility under the provisions of this section based upon a period of active duty service which began before October 16, 1981. He or she would not lose the basic eligibility based upon that period of service if, following a release from active duty, the individual reenters on active duty after October 16, 1981, and fails to meet the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section or qualify for an exemption under paragraph (d) of this section. He or she will receive a refund of any contributions he or she may make to the fund during the second period of active duty. See § 21.5065.

        (f)  To establish basic eligibility under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 32 for educational assistance an individual on active duty:

        (1) Must have entered into military service after December 31, 1976, and before July 1, 1985.

        (2) Must have served on active duty for a period of 181 or more continuous days after December 31, 1976, and

        (3) If not enrolled in a course, courses or a program of education leading to a secondary school diploma or equivalency certificate, must have completed the lesser of the following two periods of active duty:

        (i) The individual's first obligated period of active duty which began after December 31, 1976, or

        (ii) The individual's period of active duty which began after December 31, 1976, and which is 6 years in length,

        (4) If enrolled in a course, courses or a program of education leading to a secondary school diploma or equivalency certificate, the individual:

        (i) Must be an enlisted member of the Armed Forces,

        (ii) Must be a participant

        (iii) Must be training during the last 6 months of his or her first period of active duty, or any time thereafter, and

        (5) If he or she originally enlisted after September 7, 1980, must have completed at least 24 months of his or her original enlistment

        (g)  An individual who serves in the Selected Reserves may not receive credit for that service under both 38 U.S.C. Chapter 32 and 10 U.S.C. Chapter 1606. If he or she wishes to receive educational assistance based upon this service, the veteran must elect the chapter under which he or she will receive benefits.

        (1) This election must be in writing and submitted to VA.

        (2) If a veteran elects to receive educational assistance under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 32, and negotiates an educational assistance check which is based upon the period of service for which the election was made, the election is irrevocable. Negotiation of an educational assistance check provided under either 38 U.S.C. chapter 32 or 10 U.S.C. chapter 1606, but based upon a period of service which preceded the period for which an election was made, will not serve to make the election irrevocable.

        § 21.5042   Extended period of eligibility.

#### § § 21.5042

        (a)  A veteran shall be granted an extension of the applicable delimiting period, as otherwise determined by § 21.5041 of this part provided—

        (1) The veteran applies for an extension.

        (2) The veteran was prevented from initiating or completing the chosen program of education within the otherwise applicable delimiting period because of a physical or mental disability that did not result from the willful misconduct of the veteran. VA will not consider the disabling effects of chronic alcoholism to be the result of willful misconduct. See § 21.5021(v).

        (b)  The veteran must apply for the extended period of eligibility in time for VA to receive the application by the later of the following dates:

        (1) One year from the last date of the delimiting period otherwise applicable to the veteran under § 21.5401 of this part, or

        (2) One year from the termination date of the period of the veteran's mental or physical disability.

        (c)  (1) A veteran's extended period of eligibility shall be based on the period of time that the veteran himself or herself was prevented by reason of physical or mental disability, not the result of the veteran's willful misconduct, from initiating or completing his or her chosen program of education.

        (2) VA will not consider the disabling effects of chronic alcoholism to be the result of willful misconduct provided the last date of the time limit for filing a claim for the extension determined under § 21.5030(c)(3) of this part occurs after November 17, 1988.

        (3) Evidence must be presented which clearly establishes that the veteran's disability made pursuit of his or her program medically infeasible during the veteran's original period of eligibility as determined by § 21.5041 of this part. A period of disability following the end of the original disability period will not be a basis for extension.

        (4) VA will not consider a veteran who is disabled for a period of 30 days or less as having been prevented from enrolling or reenrolling in the chosen program of education or was forced to discontinue attendance, because of the short disability.

        (d)  The veteran shall elect the commencing date of an extended period of eligibility. The date chosen—

        (1) Must be on or after the original date of expiration of eligibility as determined by § 21.5041 of this part, and

        (2) Must be on or before the 90th day following the date on which the veteran's application for an extension was approved by VA, if the veteran is training during the extended period of eligibility in a course not organized on a term, quarter or semester basis, or

        (3) Must be on or before the first day of the first ordinary term, quarter or semester following the 90th day after the veteran's application for an extension was approved by VA if the veteran is training during the extended period of eligibility in a course organized on a term, quarter or semester basis.

        (4) For a veteran whose entitlement to an extended period of eligibility is dependent upon the disabling effects of chronic alcoholism, may not begin before November 18, 1988.

        (e)  A veteran's extended period of eligibility shall be based upon the qualifying period of disability, and determined as follows:

        (1) If the veteran is in training in a course organized on a term, quarter or semester basis, his or her extended period of eligibility shall contain the same number of days as the number of days from the date during the veteran's original delimiting period that his or her training became medically infeasible to the earliest of the following dates:

        (i) The commencing date of the ordinary term, quarter or semester following the day the veteran's training became medically feasible,

        (ii) The veteran's delimiting date as determined by § 21.5041 of this part, or

        (iii) The date the veteran resumed training.

        (2) If the veteran is training in a course not organized on a term, quarter or semester basis, his or her extended period of eligibility shall contain the same number of days as the number of days from the date during the veteran's original delimiting period that his or her training became medically infeasible to the earlier of the following dates:

        (i) The date the veteran's training became medically feasible, or

        (ii) The veteran's delimiting date as determined by § 21.5041 of this part.

        (f)  If the veteran is pursuing a course on the date an extended period of eligibility expires (as determined under this section), VA will discontinue the educational assistance allowance effective the day before the end of the extended period of eligibility.

        (2) The Department of Veterans Affairs will consider the lump-sum contributions to have been made by monthly deductions from the participant's military pay at the rate of $100 per month unless the participant specifies a different rate which must be

        (i) No lower than $25 per month,

        (ii) No higher than $100 per month, and

        (iii) Evenly divisible by five.

        (3) If otherwise eligible to make contributions, a participant:

        (i) May make a lump-sum contribution to cover any period of his or her active duty. This may entail a retroactive period, including one which—

        (A) Begins after December 31, 1976, and before October 1, 1980, or

        (B) Although made after October 27, 1986, includes all or part of the period beginning on July 1, 1985, and ending on October 27, 1986.

        (iii) May make a lump-sum payment to cover a period for which he or she previously obtained a refund;

        (iv) May not make a lump-sum payment to cover a period during which the participant was not on active duty or will not be on active duty.

        (b)  VA will treat contributions which have been restored under paragraph (a) of this section as though the veterans had contributed them for all purposes including—

        (1) Computing the veteran's monthly rates and benefit payments under § 21.5138, and

        (2) Determining any refund which may become due the veteran under §§ 21.5064 and 21.5065.

        (a) —(1)  If an individual who would have been eligible, but for the fact of his or her reenlistment, for the award of a discharge or release under conditions other than dishonorable at the time he or she completed an obligated period of service, later receives a discharge or release under dishonorable conditions, the Department of Veterans Affairs may refund a portion of his or her contribution.

        (2)  The Department of Veterans Affairs shall refund to the individual all of his or her remaining contributions made to the fund after the individual completed the obligated period of service.

        (3)  The Department of Veterans Affairs shall refund all monies due the individual:

        (i) On the date of the individual's discharge or release from active duty; or

        (ii) Within 60 days of receipt by the Department of Veterans Affairs of notice of the individual's discharge or release, whichever is later.

        (b)  (1) An individual who has contributed to the fund during more than one period of active duty may be required to receive a refund of those contributions made during the most recent period of active duty. When an individual who meets all the criteria in paragraph (b)(2) of this section is discharged, the Department of Veterans Affairs will refund all contributions he or she made during the most recent period of active duty unless the individual meets one or more of the criteria stated in either paragraph (b)(4) or (5) of this section. If he or she meets one of those criteria, the contributions will not be refunded unless the individual voluntarily disenrolls.

        (2) Unless a compulsory refund is prohibited by paragraph (b)(4) or (5) of this section, the Department of Veterans Affairs will refund all contributions made by an individual during the most recent period of active duty when the individual:

        (ii) Reentered on his or her most recent period of active duty after October 16, 1981;

        (iii) Contributed to the fund during his or her most recent period of active duty; and

        (iv) Is discharged.

        (3) The circumstances which prohibit an automatic refund of monies contributed during the individual's most recent period of active duty do not relate only to the most recent period of active duty which began after October 16, 1981, but also the individual's prior periods of active duty regardless of whether they began before, after or on October 16, 1981.

        (4) Meeting one or more of the following criteria concerning periods of active duty before the most recent one will be sufficient to prohibit a compulsory refund of contributions made during the most recent period of active duty. The individual:

        (i) Before the most recent period of active duty began, completed at least one continuous period of active duty of at least 24 months, or

        (ii) Was discharged or released under 10 U.S.C. 1171 (early-out discharge) from any period of active duty before the most recent one.

        (5) Meeting one or more of the following criteria concerning the most recent period of active duty will be sufficient to prohibit a compulsory refund of contributions made during the most recent period of active duty. The individual:

        (i) For the most recent period of active duty completes 24 months of continuous active duty, or the full period for which the individual was called or ordered to active duty, whichever is shorter; or

        (ii) Is discharged or released from the most recent period of active duty under 10 U.S.C. 1171 (early-out discharge) or 1173 (hardship discharge); or

        (iii) Is discharged or released from the most recent period of active duty for a disability incurred or aggravated in line of duty; or

        (iv) Has a service-connected disability which give him or her basic entitlement to disability compensation as described in § 3.4(b) of this chapter.

        (6) In computing time served for the purpose of this paragraph, the individual is not entitled for credit for service as specified in § 3.15 of this chapter. However, those periods will be included in determining if the service was continuous.

        (7) The Department of Veterans Affairs shall refund all monies due the individual:

        (i) On the date of the individual's discharge or release from active duty; or

        (ii) Within 60 days of receipt of notice by the Department of Veterans Affairs of the individual's discharge or release, whichever is later.

        (c)  If a veteran described in § 21.5040(h) makes an election to have a period of service credited toward his or her eligibility and entitlement under 10 U.S.C. Chapter 1606, he or she will be required to receive a refund of any contributions he or she made to the fund during that period of service.

      Entitlement

        § 21.5070   Entitlement.

#### § § 21.5070

        A participant is entitled to a monthly benefit for periods of time during which the individual is enrolled in, and satisfactorily pursuing, an approved program of education. The amount of the benefit will vary from individual to individual and, in some instances, from month to month as provided in § 21.5138.

        § 21.5071   Months of entitlement allowed.

#### § § 21.5071

        (a)  The Department of Veterans Affairs will credit an individual with 1 month of entitlement for each month he or she contributes to the fund up to a maximum of 36 months or its equivalent in part-time training.

        (b)  If an individual elects to make a lump-sum contribution, the Department of Veterans Affairs will credit an individual with 1 month of entitlement for:

        (1) Every $100 included in the lump sum, or

        (2) Every amount included in the lump sum which:

        (i) Is at least $25 but no more than $100,

        (i) Compute the entitlement due to each type of contribution separately under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, and

        (ii) Will combine the results of the computations to determine the individual's total entitlement.

        (2) In no event will an individual's entitlement exceed 36 months or its equivalent in part-time training.

        § 21.5072   Entitlement charge.

#### § § 21.5072

        The Department of Veterans Affairs shall determine the entitlement charge for each payment in the same manner for all individuals regardless of whether they are on active duty. Unless the circumstances described in paragraph (i) of this section apply to a servicemember or veteran, VA will use paragraphs (a) through (h) of this section to determine an entitlement charge.

        (a)  (1) Except as provided in paragraphs (b) through (i) of this section, VA will make a charge against entitlement as follows:

        (i) The Department of Veterans Affairs will charge an individual who is a full-time student 1 month's entitlement for each monthly benefit paid to him or her.

        (ii) The Department of Veterans Affairs will charge an individual who is other than a full-time student 1 month's entitlement for each sum of money paid equivalent to what the individual would have been paid had he or she been a full-time student for 1 month.

        (2) When the computation results in a period of time other than a full month, the entitlement charge will be prorated.

        (b)  (1) The Department of Veterans Affairs will make no charge against the entitlement of an individual:

        (i) Who is pursuing a course, courses or a program of education leading to a secondary school diploma or an equivalency certificate, and

        (ii) Whose educational assistance allowance is the monthly rate of the tuition and fees being charged to him or her for the course.

        (2) The Department of Veterans Affairs will make a charge (in the same manner as for any other residence training) against the entitlement of an individual who:

        (i) Is pursuing a course, courses or a program of education leading to a secondary school diploma or an equivalency certificate, and

        (ii) Elects to receive educational assistance allowance calculated according to § 21.5136.

        (c)  (1) A charge against the period of entitlement for a program consisting exclusively of correspondence training will be made on the basis of 1 month for each sum of money paid equivalent to the dollar value of a month of entitlement as determined under § 21.5138(a)(2)(viii), which is paid to the individual as an educational assistance allowance for this training. When computation results in a period of time other than a full month, the charge will be prorated.

        (2) If the individual is contributing to the fund at the same time that benefits are being used or subsequently contributes a sum or sums, the entitlement charges will not be recomputed. Thus, if the monthly rate arrived at by applying the formula is determined to be $150 at the time a benefit program for correspondence training is computed, the individual will be charged 1 month of entitlement for each $150 paid. If a different monthly rate is computed at the time of a subsequent payment for such training, no adjustment will be made in the entitlement charged for the previous payment(s) even though the value of each month's entitlement may vary from payment to payment.

        (d)  (1) The VA will determine the entitlement charge for a veteran in apprenticeship or other on-job training as stated in this paragraph.

        (2) The entitlement charge will be—

        (i) 75 percent of a month for those months for which the veteran's monthly payment is based upon 75 percent of the monthly benefit otherwise payable to him or her;

        (ii) 55 percent of a month for those months for which the veteran's monthly payment is based upon 55 percent of the monthly benefit otherwise payable to him or her; and

        (iii) 35 percent of a month for those months for which the veteran's monthly payment is based upon 35 percent of the monthly benefit otherwise payable to him or her.

        (3) The charge against the veteran's entitlement will be prorated if—

        (i) The veteran's enrollment period ends in the middle of a month,

        (ii) The veteran's monthly rate is reduced in the middle of a month, or

        (iii) The veteran's monthly payment is reduced because he or she worked less than 120 hours during the month. In this instance the number of hours worked will be rounded to the nearest multiple of eight, and the entitlement charge will be reduced proportionately.

        (e)  VA will make a charge against entitlement of 80 percent of a month for each month for which a veteran is paid educational assistance allowance at the cooperative training rate as provided in § 21.5138(a). If the veteran is paid for a partial month of training, the entitlement charge will be prorated.

        (f)  If the veteran must be paid educational assistance allowance at a reduced rate because he or she is incarcerated as provided in § 21.5139 of this part, VA will make a charge against entitlement of one month for each amount of educational assistance allowance paid to the veteran which is the equivalent of one month's benefits as provided in § 21.5138 of this part for the appropriate type of training pursued.

        (g)  If an individual is paid tutorial assistance as provided in § 21.5141 of this part, the following provisions will apply.

        (1) There will be no charge to entitlement for the first $600 of tutorial assistance paid to an individual.

        (2) VA will make a charge against the period of entitlement for each amount of tutorial assistance paid to the individual in excess of $600 that is equal to the amount of monthly educational assistance the individual is otherwise eligible to receive for full-time pursuit of a residence course as provided in § 21.5138(c) of this part. When the amount of tutorial assistance paid to the individual in excess of $600 is less than the amount of monthly educational assistance the individual is otherwise eligible to receive, the entitlement charge will be prorated.

        (h)  (1) A charge against the period of entitlement for pursuit of a flight training course will be one month for each sum of money paid equivalent to the dollar value of a month of entitlement as determined under § 21.5138(a)(5)(viii). When this computation results in a period of time other than a full month, the charge will be prorated.

        (2) If the individual is contributing to the fund at the same time that benefits are being used or subsequently contributes a sum or sums, the entitlement charges will not be recomputed. Thus, if the monthly rate arrived at under § 21.5138(a)(5)(viii) is $150 at the time educational assistance allowance is paid for a period of flight training, the individual will be charged one month of entitlement for each $150 paid. If a different monthly rate is computed at the time of a subsequent payment for such training, no adjustment will be made in the entitlement charged for the previous payment(s) even though the value of each month's entitlement may vary from payment to payment.

        (i)  VA will make no charge against the entitlement of a servicemember or veteran for a payment of educational assistance when—

        (1)(i) A veteran not serving on active duty had to discontinue course pursuit as a result of being ordered, in connection with the Persian Gulf War by orders dated before September 11, 2001, to serve on active duty under 10 U.S.C. 688, 12301(a), 12301(d), 12301(g), 12302, or 12304, or former 10 U.S.C. 672(a), 672(d), 672(g), 673, or 673b (redesignated effective December 1, 1994, as 10 U.S.C. 12301(a), 12301(d), 12301(g), 12302, and 12304, respectively); or

        (ii) A veteran not serving on active duty had to discontinue course pursuit as a result of being ordered, by orders dated after September 10, 2001, to serve on active duty under 10 U.S.C. 688, 12301(a), 12301(d), 12301(g), 12302, or 12304; or

        (iii) A servicemember serving on active duty had to discontinue course pursuit as a result of being ordered, in connection with the Persian Gulf War by orders dated before September 11, 2001, to a new duty location or assignment or to perform an increased amount of work; or

        (iv) A servicemember serving on active duty had to discontinue course pursuit as a result of being ordered, by orders dated after September 10, 2001, to a new duty location or assignment or to perform an increased amount of work; and

        (2) The veteran or servicemember failed to receive credit or lost training time toward completion of his or her educational, professional, or vocational objective as a result of having to discontinue course pursuit as described in paragraph (i)(1) of this section.

        § 21.5076   Entitlement charge—overpayment cases.

#### § § 21.5076

        (a)  VA will make a charge against an individual's entitlement of an overpayment of educational assistance allowance only if:

        (1) The overpayment is discharged in bankruptcy; or

        (2) VA waives the overpayment and does not recover it; or

        (3) The overpayment is compromised.

        (b)  If the overpayment is discharged in bankruptcy or is waived and is not recovered, the entitlement charge will be at the appropriate rate for the elapsed period covered by the overpayment (exclusive of interest, administrative costs of collection, court costs and marshal fees).

        (c)  (1) If the overpayment is compromised and the compromise offer is less than the amount of interest, administrative costs of collection, court costs and marshal fees, the charge against entitlement will be at the appropriate rate for the elapsed period covered by the overpayment (exclusive of interest, administrative costs of collection, court costs and marshal fees).

        (2) If the overpayment is compromised and compromise offer is equal to or greater than the amount of interest, administrative costs of collection, court costs and marshal fees, the charge against entitlement will be determined by—

        (i) Subtracting from the sum paid in the compromise offer the amount attributable to interest, administrative costs of collection, court costs and marshal fees.

        (ii) Subtracting the remaining amount of the overpayment balance determined in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section from the amount of the original overpayment (exclusive of interest, administrative costs of collection, court costs and marshal fees),

        (iii) Dividing the result obtained in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section by the amount of the original debt (exclusive of interest, administrative costs of collection, court costs and marshal fees), and

        (iv) Multiplying the percentage obtained in paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section by the amount of the entitlement otherwise chargeable for the period of the original overpayment.

        § 21.5078   Interruption to conserve entitlement.

#### § § 21.5078

        (a)  No one may interrupt a certified period of enrollment for the purpose of conserving entitlement. A school may not certify a period of enrollment for a fractional part of the normal term, quarter or semester if the individual actually is enrolled and is pursuing his or her program of education for the entire term, quarter or semester.

        (b)  The Department of Veterans Affairs will charge entitlement for the entire period of enrollment certified if the individual otherwise is eligible for benefits, except when benefits are interrupted under any of the following conditions:

        (1) Enrollment actually is terminated.

        (2) Enrollment is canceled and the individual has not negotiated an educational benefits check for any part of the certified period of enrollment.

        (3) The individual:

        (i) Interrupts his or her enrollment at the scheduled end of any term, quarter, semester or school year within the certified period of enrollment; and

        (ii) Has not negotiated any check for educational benefits for the succeeding term, quarter, semester or school year.

        (4) The individual requests interruption or cancellation for any break when a school was closed during a certified period of enrollment and payments were continued under an established policy based upon an Executive order of the President or due to an emergency situation. This exception applies whether or not the individual has negotiated a check for educational benefits for the certified period.

      Counseling

        § 21.5100   Counseling.

#### § § 21.5100

        (a)  The purpose of counseling is:

        (1) To assist in selecting an objective:

VA shall take appropriate steps (including individual notification where feasible) to acquaint all participants with the availability and advantages of counseling services.

        (d)  (1) In any case in which VA has rated the veteran as being incompetent, VA must provide counseling as described in 38 U.S.C. 3697A prior to selection of a program of education or training. The counseling will follow the veteran's initial application for benefits or any communication from the veteran or guardian indicating that the veteran wishes to change his or her program. This requirement that counseling be provided is met when—

        (i) The veteran has had one or more personal interviews with the counselor;

        (ii) The counselor has jointly developed with the veteran recommendations for selecting a program;

        (iii) These recommendations have been reviewed with the veteran.

        (2) The veteran may follow the recommendations developed in the course of counseling, but is not required to do so.

        (3) VA will take no further action on a veteran's application for assistance under 38 U.S.C. chapter 32 unless he or she—

        (i) Reports for counseling;

        (ii) Cooperates in the counseling process; and

        (iii) Completes counseling to the extent required under paragraph (d)(1) of this section.

        § 21.5296   Extended period of eligibility.

#### § § 21.5296

        (a)  A veteran shall be granted an extension of the applicable delimiting period, as otherwise determined by § 21.5041 provided—

        (1) The veteran applies for an extension.

        (2) The veteran was prevented from initiating or completing the chosen program of education within the otherwise applicable delimiting period because of a physical or mental disability that did not result from the willful misconduct of the veteran. VA will not consider the disabling effects of chronic alcoholism to be the result of willful misconduct.

        (b)  (1) Only the veteran may apply for an extended period of eligibility pursuant to this section. A spouse or child to whom entitlement may be or has been transferred may not apply for, nor receive, an extension based upon disability of either the veteran or the spouse or child.

        (2) The veteran must apply for the extended period of eligibility in time for VA to receive the application by the later of the following dates:

        (i) One year from the last date of the delimiting period otherwise applicable to the veteran under § 21.5041, or

        (ii) One year from the termination date of the period of the veteran's mental or physical disability.

        (3) No application for an extended period of eligibility should be submitted and none will be processed during any period when the veteran has transferred entitlement to a spouse or child, since eligibility cannot be fully determined as provided in paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section.

        (c)  A veteran's extended period of eligibility shall be based on the period of time that the veteran himself or herself was prevented by reason of physical or mental disability, not the result of the veteran's willful misconduct, from initiating or completing his or her chosen program of education. VA will not consider the disabling effects of chronic alcoholism to be the result of willful misconduct.

        (1) Evidence must be presented which clearly establishes that the veteran's disability made pursuant of his or her program medically infeasible during the veteran's original period of eligibility as determined by § 21.5041. A period of disability following the end of the original disability period will not be a basis for extension.

        (2) VA will not consider a veteran who is disabled for a period of 30 days or less as having been prevented from enrolling or reenrolling in the chosen program of education or was forced to discontinue attendance, because of the short disability.

        (3) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(4) of this section, a veteran's transfer of entitlement to a spouse or child during a period for which the veteran's disability prevented his or her pursuit of a program of education will not affect the veteran's entitlement to an extension of eligibility under this section.

        (4) Since the act of entitlement transfer to a spouse or child indicates that the veteran did not intend to personally use his or her educational assistance during the specified transfer period, a veteran who becomes disabled after transferring entitlement will not be entitled to an extended period of eligibility based on any period of the disability which coincides with the specified transfer period unless—

        (i) The transferee or transferees did not use any entitlement during this period, and

        (ii) The veteran can clearly demonstrate that, notwithstanding his or her decision to transfer entitlement, the veteran would have used the entitlement during all or part of the transfer period and was prevented from doing so solely by reason of his or her disability.

        (d)  The veteran shall elect the commencing date of an extended period of eligibility. The date chosen—

        (1) Must be on or after the original date of expiration of eligibility as determined by § 21.5041 of this part, and

        (2) Must be on or before the 90th day following the date on which the veteran's application for an extension was approved by VA, if the veteran is training during the extended period of eligibility in a course not organized on a term, quarter or semester basis, or

        (3) Must be on or before the first day of the first ordinary term, quarter or semester following the 90th day after the veteran's application for an extension was approved by VA if the veteran is training during the extended period of eligibility in a course organized on a term, quarter or semester basis.

        (e)  A veteran's extended period of eligibility shall be based on the qualifying period of disability, and determined as follows:

        (1) If the veteran is in training in a course organized on a term, quarter or semester basis, his or her extended period of eligibility shall contain the same number of days as the number of days from the date during the veteran's original delimiting period that his or her training became medically infeasible to the earliest of the following dates:

        (i) The commencing date of the ordinary term, quarter or semester following the day the veteran's training became medically feasible,

        (ii) The veteran's delimiting date as determined by § 21.5041 of this part, or

        (iii) The date the veteran resumed training.

        (2) If the veteran is training in a course not organized on a term, quarter or semester basis, his or her extended period of eligibility shall contain the same number of days as the number of days from the date during the veteran's original delimiting period that his or her training became medically infeasible to the earlier of the following dates:

        (i) The date the veteran's training became medically feasible, or

        (ii) The veteran's delimiting date as determined by § 21.5041 of this part.

        (f)  If the veteran is pursuing a course on the date an extended period of eligibility expires (as determined under this section), VA will discontinue the educational assistance allowance effective the day before the end of the extended period of eligibility.

        (g)  (1) The veteran may only transfer entitlement to a spouse or child for use during the original period of eligibility as determined by § 21.5041 of this part.

        (2) If the veteran has established an extended period of eligibility with VA, only the veteran may use remaining entitlement during that period.

        (3) If the veteran transfers his or her entitlement after having received an extension of eligibility, but before the last day of the delimiting period as determined by § 21.5041 of this part, the eligibility of the spouse or child to use entitlement ends on the veteran's otherwise applicable delimiting date as determined by § 21.5041 of this part.

        (a)  A veteran or servicemember shall be entitled to one standard academic year (or the equivalent) of educational assistance for each year of service following the first enlistment beginning after November 30, 1980 (up to a maximum of four years). If the veteran or servicemember completes two years of active duty in the term of enlistment, but fails to complete the enlistment or fails to complete four years of active duty in an enlistment of more than four years, his or her entitlement to educational assistance shall be calculated as follows:

        (1) VA shall determine the number of years, months and days in the veteran's qualifying period of service by subtracting the entry on duty date from the release from active duty date. Any deductible time under § 3.15 of this chapter (during the period of service on which eligibility is based) will be excluded from the calculation.

        (2) VA shall convert the number of years determined in paragraph (a)(1) of this section to months by multiplying them by 12.

        (3) VA shall convert the number of days determined in paragraph (a)(1) of this section to 0 months if there are 14 days or less, and to 1 month is there are more than 14 days.

        (5) VA shall multiply the number of total months in paragraph (a)(4) of this section by 75.

        (b)  A veteran or servicemember shall be entitled to nine months of subsistence allowance for each standard academic year of entitlement to educational assistance. For each period of entitlement to educational assistance which is shorter than a standard academic year, a veteran or servicemember will be entitled to one month of subsistence allowance for each month of entitlement to educational assistance. This entitlement shall not exceed nine months.

        (ii) Has thereafter reenlisted.

        (4) The servicemember or veteran may revoke at any time a transfer described in either paragraph (a) (2) or (3) of this section.

        (5) If a veteran attempts to transfer entitlement after 10 years have elapsed from the date he or she has retired, has been discharged or has otherwise been separated from active duty, the transfer shall be null and void.

        (b)  (1) A veteran's or servicemember's entitlement to educational assistance and subsistence allowance shall be transferred automatically subject to provisions of paragraph (b)(2) of this section, provided he or she—

        (4) If a servicemember transfers entitlement and then dies, and the effective date of the transfer is more than 10 years from the date of his or her death, the transfer shall be void. The entitlement will be transferred automatically as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.

        (c)  (1) A person to whom a veteran or servicemember transfers entitlement is entitled to educational assistance and subsistence allowance in the same manner and at the same rate as the person from whom entitlement was transferred.

        (2) The total entitlement transferred to the veteran's or servicemember's spouse and children shall not exceed the veteran's or servicemember's remaining entitlement. The veteran or servicemember may transfer entitlement to only one person at a time.

        (d)  (1) A person to whom entitlement is transferred after the death of a veteran or servicemember is entitled to payment of educational assistance and subsistence allowance in the manner as the veteran or servicemember. The rate of educational assistance and subsistence allowance will be as stated in §§ 21.5820 and 21.5822.

        (2) If entitlement is transferred to more than one person following the death of a veteran or servicemember, the total remaining entitlement to educational assistance and subsistence allowance of all is equal to the total entitlement of the person on whose service entitlement is based.

A veteran or servicemember who has transferred entitlement may revoke that transfer by notifying VA in writing.

        (3) If the person to whom entitlement is transferred is in training (for which educational assistance and subsistence allowance are payable) on the date the VA processes revocation, the effective date of the revocation may be no earlier than—

        (i) The last date of the term, quarter, or semester at the accredited institution where that person is enrolled, or

        (ii) If the accredited institution is not organized on a term, quarter or semester basis, the last date of the course or the last date of the school year, whichever is earlier.

        § 21.5820   Educational assistance.

#### § § 21.5820

        (a)  Educational assistance will be paid to cover the educational expenses incurred by an eligible servicemember, veteran, spouse, surviving spouse or dependent child while attending an accredited institution. Educational assistance payments will be made to the eligible individual.

        (1) The educational expenses are limited to—

        (i) Tuition,

        (ii) Fees,

        (iii) Cost of books,

        (iv) Laboratory fees, and

        (v) Shop fees for consumable materials used as part of classroom or laboratory instruction.

        (2) Educational expenses may not exceed those normally incurred by students at the same educational institution who are not eligible for benefits from the educational assistance test program.

        (b)  (1) The amount of educational assistance will be adjusted annually by regulation. For the 2003-04 standard academic year the amount of this assistance may not exceed $4,219.

        (2) The amount of educational assistance payable to a servicemember, veteran, spouse or dependent child of a living servicemember or veteran for an enrollment period will be the lesser of the following:

        (i) The total charges for educational expenses the eligible individual incurs during the enrollment period, or

        (ii) For the 2003-04 standard academic year an amount determined by:

        (A) Multiplying the number of whole months in the enrollment period by $468.78 for a full-time student or by $234.39 for a part-time student;

        (B) Multiplying any additional days in the enrollment period by $15.63 for a full-time student or by $7.81 for a part-time student; and

        (C) Adding the two results. If the enrollment period is as long as or longer than the standard academic year, this amount will be decreased by 2 cents for a full-time student and decreased by 1 cent for a part-time student.

        (3) The amount of educational assistance payable to each surviving spouse or dependent child of a deceased servicemember or veteran for an enrollment period will be the lesser of the following:

        (i) The total charges for educational expenses the eligible individual incurs during the enrollment period, or

        (ii) For the 2003-04 standard academic year an amount determined by:

        (D) Dividing the amount determined in paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(C) of this section by the number of the deceased veteran's dependents receiving educational assistance for that enrollment period. If one or more dependents is receiving educational assistance for part of the enrollment period, the amount calculated in paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(C) will be prorated on a daily basis. The amount for each day when more than one dependent is receiving educational assistance will be divided by the number of dependents receiving educational assistance on that day. The total amount for the days when only one dependent is receiving educational assistance will not be divided.

        (c)  VA will make payments of educational assistance at the end of the first month of each semester, quarter or term in which the individual is entitled to such a payment, provided VA receives a timely enrollment certification. If VA receives the enrollment certification so late that payment cannot be made at the end of the month in which the individual is enrolled, VA will make payment as soon as practicable.

        (2) The following rules govern the amount of subsistence allowance payable to surviving spouses and dependent children of deceased veterans and servicemembers.

        (i) VA will determine the monthly rate of subsistence allowance payable to a person for a day during which he or she is pursuing a course of instruction full-time during the 2003-04 academic year by dividing $1,051 per month by the number of the deceased veteran's dependents pursuing a course of instruction on that day.

        (ii) VA will determine the monthly rate of subsistence allowance payable to a person for a day during which he or she is pursuing a course of instruction on other than a full-time basis during the 2003-04 academic year by dividing $525.50 per month by the number of the deceased veteran's dependents pursuing a course of instruction on that day.

        (iii) The total amount of subsistence allowance payable to a person for a month is the sum of the person's daily rates for the month.

        (c)  VA will make payments of subsistence allowance on the first day of the month following the month for which subsistence allowance is due, provided that VA receives a timely enrollment certification. If VA receives the enrollment certification so late that payment cannot be made on the first day of the month following the month for which subsistence allowance is due, VA will make payment as soon as practicable.

#### § § 21.5838

        (a)  If an individual receives educational assistance but the educational assistance must be discontinued according to § 21.5835, the amount of educational assistance attributable to the portion of the term, quarter or semester following the effective date of discontinuance shall constitute a debt due the United States.

        (1) The amount of the debt is equal to the product of—

        (i) The number of days the individual was entitled to receive subsistence allowance during the enrollment period for which educational assistance was paid, divided by the total number of days in that enrollment period, and

        (ii) The amount of educational assistance provided for that enrollment period.

        (2) Nothing in this method of calculation shall change the fact that the number of months of educational assistance to which the individual remains entitled shall always be the same as the number of months of subsistence allowance to which the individual is entitled.

        (b)  If an individual receives subsistence allowance under any of the following conditions, the amount of that subsistence allowance shall constitute a debt due the United States unless the debt is waived as provided by §§ 1.955 through 1.970 of this chapter.

      Measurement of Courses

        § 21.5870   Measurement of courses.

#### § § 21.5870

        (a)  An individual who enrolls in a standard quarter or semester for 12 undergraduate credit hours is a full-time student. An individual who enrolls in a standard quarter or semester for less than 12 undergraduate credit hours is a part-time student.

        (b)  (1) If an individual enrolls in a nonstandard term, quarter or semester, and the school measures the course on a credit-hour basis, VA will determine whether that individual is a full-time student by—

        (i) Multiplying the credits earned in the term by 18 if credit is granted in semester hours, or by 12 if credit is granted in quarter hours, and

        (ii) Dividing the product by the number of whole weeks in the term.

        (2) In determining whole weeks VA will—

        (i) Divide the number of days in the term by 7;

        (ii) Disregard a remainder of 3 days or less, and

        (iii) Consider 4 days or more to be a whole week.

        (3) If the number obtained by using the formula in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section is 12 or more, the individual is a full-time student. If that number is less than 12, the individual is a part-time student.

        (c)  (1) If it is the established policy of a school to consider less than 12 credit hours to be full-time for graduate students, VA will accept the statement of a responsible school offical as to whether the student is a full-time or part-time student. If the school does not have such a policy, VA will measure the student's enrollment according to the provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.

        (2) VA will measure undergraduate courses required by the school according to the provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, even though the individual is enrolled as a graduate student. If the individual is taking both graduate and undergraduate courses, the school will report the credit-hour equivalent of the graduate work. VA will first measure the undergraduate courses according to the provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section and combine the result with the credit-hour equivalent of the graduate work in order to determine the extent of training.

        (d)  (1) If an individual enrolls in a course measured in clock hours and shop practice is an integral part of the course, he or she is a full-time student when enrolled in 22 clock hours or more per week with not more than a 2  hour rest period allowance per week. For all other enrollments the individual is a part-time student. VA will exclude supervised study in determining the number of clock hours in which the individual is enrolled.

        (2) If an individual enrolls in a course measured in clock hours and theory and class instruction predominate in the course, he or she is a full-time student enrolled in 18 clock hours or more per week. He or she is a part-time student when enrolled in less than 18 clock hours per week. Customary intervals not to exceed 10 minutes between classes will be included in measuring net instruction. Shop practice, rest periods, and supervised study are excluded. Supervised instruction periods in schools' shops and the time involved in field trips and individual and group instruction may be included in computing the clock hour requirements.

        § 21.6010   Applicability of rules and administrative procedures under 38 U.S.C., Chapter 31.

#### § § 21.6010

        (a)  Title 38 U.S.C., section 1524(b)(2)(A) provides, in part, that a vocational training program shall consist of vocationally oriented services and assistance of the kind provided service-disabled veterans under chapter 31, Title 38 U.S.C., and other services and assistance of the kind provided under that chapter as are necessary to enable the veteran to prepare for and participate in vocational training or employment.

        (b)  The rules and procedures in force for administration of the _chapter 31_ program (§§ 21.1-21.430) are deemed to be applicable to administration of this program in so far as their use shall not conflict with 38 U.S.C. 1524 or the rules under this subpart. Where a particular grouping of chapter 31 rules are generally applicable, without modification, the rules under this subpart will be deemed to incorporate the chapter 31 rules. The chapter 31 rules may be read as written, but terms such as  and  shall be understood to read  and  whenever used. References in the chapter 31 rules to benefits (subsistence allowances, loans) or eligibility (dependents, service-connection, serious employment handicap) are to be considered inapplicable to this program and do not confer benefits or rights not provided by 38 U.S.C. 1524.

        § 21.6015   Claims and elections.

#### § § 21.6015

        (a)  A veteran under age 45 who is awarded pension during the program period will be scheduled for an evaluation to determine whether achievement of a vocational goal is reasonably feasible, unless it is determined that the veteran is unable to participate in an evaluation for reasons beyond his or her control. If VA, as a result of the evaluation, determines that achievement of a vocational goal is reasonably feasible, the veteran may elect to pursue a vocational training program. To make this election, the veteran must file a claim, in a form prescribed by VA, for services under this temporary program.

        (b)  Qualified veterans in the following categories will be provided an evaluation if they request assistance under the temporary program, and are found to have good employment potential. These veterans include:

        (1) Veterans age 45 and more who are awarded pension during the program period;

        (2) Veterans awarded pension prior to the beginning of the program period on February 1, 1985, who meet the conditions contained in § 21.6005(c) of this part.

        (c)  A veteran in one of the categories identified in paragraph (b) of this section must file a claim in the form prescribed by VA in order to be considered for an evaluation of his or her ability to achieve a vocational goal through participation in this temporary program. The veteran's claim is considered a request for both the evaluation, and if achievement of a vocational goal is found reasonably feasible, for participation in the vocational training program.

        (d)  (1) If a veteran for whom achievement of a vocational goal is found reasonably feasible does not undertake a vocational training program within the time limits specified in § 21.32, he or she must file an original or reopened claim, as appropriate, in a form prescribed by VA in order to be considered for such services to determine if achievement of the previous vocational goal or a new vocational goal is reasonably feasible.

        (2) If a veteran has been placed in discontinued case status by the VA, he or she must file a new claim in a form prescribed by the VA to reopen the case.

        (e)  Informal claims shall be governed by § 21.31 of this part.

        (f)  The time limit for making a claim to pursue a vocational training program shall be governed by § 21.32 of this part.

        § 21.6021   Nonduplication—38 U.S.C., chapters 30, 31, 32, 34 and 35.

#### § § 21.6021

        (a)  A service-disabled veteran awarded VA pension who is offered a vocational training program under 38 U.S.C. chapter 15 and is also eligible for such assistance under chapter 31, must elect which benefit he or she will receive. The veteran may reelect at any time if he or she is still eligible for the benefit desired.

        (b)  A veteran who is eligible under this program may receive an educational assistance allowance under chapter 30, 32, 34 or 35 if he or she is otherwise eligible under one of these programs.

        (c)  If a veteran has pursued an educational or training program under chapter 30, 32, 34 or 35, or a vocational rehabilitation program under chapter 31, the training received in the earlier program shall be considered, to the extent feasible, in determining the character and duration of the services to be furnished under this program.

        (d)  If a veteran has pursued other significant training under non-VA programs or on his or her own, such training will be considered in determining the character and duration of services to be furnished.

        (e)  The number of months of services provided under this program are not subject to the provisions of § 21.4020 of this part which limit the aggregate months of VA benefits to be provided.

        (3) The 18-month period of employment services allowed under this section shall begin upon the date that a veteran under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section completes the vocational training program or in the case of a veteran under paragraphs (b)(2)(ii), (iii), and (iv) of this section is found to be employable. If a veteran has been provided such services and obtains suitable employment, but is later found to require additional services of this kind, the veteran may be provided such additional services during any portion of the original 18-month period remaining.

        (c)  A qualified veteran for whom a program of vocational training has been found reasonably feasible shall remain eligible for the temporary program, subject to the rules of this subpart and section 1524 of 38 U.S.C. ch. 15, even if his or her pension award is subsequently terminated, except when the veteran's award of VA pension was the result of fraud or administrative error.

      Evaluation

        § 21.6050   Participation of eligible veterans in an evaluation.

#### § § 21.6050

        (a)  A veteran under age 45 awarded pension during the program period shall be provided an evaluation of his or her rehabilitation potential to determine whether achievement of a vocational goal is reasonably feasible. The veteran must report for and participate in the evaluation unless the failure to do so is for reasons beyond the veteran's control. Failure to report for and participate in the evaluation, for reasons other than those beyond the veteran's control, will result in suspension of the veteran's pension under § 3.342 of this chapter. See § 21.6056.

        (b)  An evaluation shall be accorded each qualified veteran as described in § 21.6005(c) of this part who seeks to become a program participant provided VA first determines the veteran has good potential for achieving employment. Failure to choose to participate in an evaluation shall have no adverse effect upon the veteran's continued receipt of pension under § 3.342 of this chapter.

        (c)  (1) A qualified veteran under age 45 awarded pension during the program period for whom participation in an evaluation is not clearly precluded by reasons beyond the veteran's control shall be sent a notice at the time he or she is awarded pension. The notice will inform the veteran of the provisions of this temporary program, the conditions under which participation in an evaluation is required, and the consequences of nonparticipation.

        (2) A qualified veteran age 45 or older awarded pension during the program period will be informed of the provisions of this temporary program and the procedure for requesting an evaluation.

        (d)  (1) An evaluation will be arranged as promptly as practicable for each qualified veteran:

        (i) Under age 50 who is sent the notice required under paragraph (c)(1) of this section; and

        (ii) [Reserved]

        (2) Other qualified veterans identified in § 21.6005(c) who are found to have good employment potential under § 21.6054.

        (e)  The case of each qualified veteran under age 45 awarded pension during the program period for whom an evaluation was not scheduled or who does not complete an evaluation shall be reviewed for followup action by Veteran Readiness and Employment (VR&E) staff as provided in §§ 21.197(c)(4) and 21.198(d).

        (f)  Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section, the number of evaluations which may be provided under this temporary program is subject to the limitations contained in § 21.6059 of this part.

        § 21.6052   Evaluations.

#### § § 21.6052

        (a)  The scope and nature of the evaluation under this program shall be the same as for an evaluation of the reasonable feasibility of achieving a vocational goal under the procedures described for chapter 31 benefits.

        (b)  The following specific services may be provided as a part of the evaluation of reasonable feasibility of achieving a vocational goal, as appropriate:

        (1) Assessment of feasibility by a Counseling Psychologist (CP) or Vocational Rehabilitation Counselor (VRC);

        (2) Review of feasibility assessment and of need for special services by the Vocational Rehabilitation Panel;

        (3) Provision of medical and other diagnostic services;

        (4) Evaluation of employability, for a period not to exceed 30 days, by professional staff of an educational or rehabilitation facility.

        § 21.6054   Criteria for determining good employment potential.

#### § § 21.6054

        (a)  Before scheduling an evaluation of feasibility to pursue a vocational goal for a qualified veteran under § 21.6005(c)(2), VA will first determine whether the veteran has good potential for achieving employment if provided a vocational training or employment program. This determination shall be made on the basis of the information of record, including information submitted by the veteran at the time of the veteran's request to participate in this temporary program.

        (b)  The criteria contained in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section are to be applied by Veteran Readiness and Employment (VR&E) professional staff members to determine whether information of record supports a determination that a veteran age 50 or older has good potential for employment. Any reasonable doubt shall be resolved in the veteran's favor.

        (c)  Indicators of good potential for employment include one or more of the following:

        (1) A period of stable employment prior to the onset of disability.

        (2) Strong motivation to return to the work force.

        (3) Successful pursuit of education or training.

        (4) Cooperation in treatment of disabling conditions.

        (5) Stabilization of medical conditions or substance abuse problems.

        (6) Participation in therapeutic work programs.

        (7) Evidence of recent sustained job-seeking.

        (d)  Contraindications of good potential for employment include one or more of the following:

        (1) A lifelong history of unstable employment with long periods of employment before the onset of disability.

        (2) Being out of the labor market for five years or more preceding the evaluation.

        (3) Unsuccessful pursuit of education or training.

        (4) Noncooperation in the treatment of disability.

        (5) Need for an additional period of medical care or treatment before training would be feasible.

        (6) Nonparticipation in prescribed or recommended therapeutic work programs.

        (7) Failure of previous vocational rehabilitation programs to achieve employability.

        (e)  If VA does not find good employment potential, VA will notify the veteran that he or she is not eligible to receive an evaluation. Since this finding will preclude program participation, the veteran will be informed of his or her appellate rights as described in § 21.59 of this part.

        (1) If the determination cannot be made on the evidence of record, VA shall advise the veteran and may provide him or her with an opportunity to submit additional information within a reasonable time.

        (2) A veteran's disagreement with a negative finding shall be considered evidence of motivation for employment, and may, when considered in relation to other information, provide a basis for finding that good employment potential exists;

        (3) If the final VA determination, following a review of a contested negative finding, is that good potential for achieving employment does not exist, a personal interview will be scheduled, and the reasons for VA's determination shall be discussed with the veteran.

        § 21.6056   Cooperation of the veteran in an evaluation.

#### § § 21.6056

        (a)  The cooperation of the veteran is essential to a successful evaluation. The purpose of the evaluation and the steps in the process shall be explained to the veteran, and the importance of his or her cooperation shall be stressed. If the veteran does not cooperate in the initiation or completion of the evaluation, the Counseling Psychologist (CP) or Vocational Rehabilitation Counselor (VRC) shall make a reasonable effort through counseling to secure the veteran's cooperation.

        (b)  If the veteran fails to report for or cooperate in a required evaluation and the CP or VRC has made a reasonable effort to secure his or her participation, VA shall take appropriate action, including discontinuance of the evaluation under the provisions of § 21.364 of this part. If the veteran's case is discontinued under § 21.364 of this part, the Veterans Service Center will be notified. The Veterans Service Center also will be informed if the reason for discontinuance is subsequently removed and the evaluation process is resumed.

        (c)  If the veteran fails to report for or cooperate in an optional evaluation and the CP or VRC has made a reasonable effort to secure the veteran's participation, VA shall take appropriate action, including discontinuance of the evaluation under the provisions of § 21.364 of this part. The evaluation may be resumed if the reason for the discontinuance is removed and the veteran is otherwise eligible.

        § 21.6058   Consequences of evaluation.

#### § § 21.6058

        (a)  If VA finds, based on the evaluation, that achievement of a vocational goal by the veteran is reasonably feasible, the veteran shall be offered and may elect to pursue a vocational training program. If the veteran elects to pursue such a program, the program shall be designed in consultation with the veteran in order to meet the veteran's individual needs, and shall be set forth in an Individualized Written Rehabilitation Plan (IWRP) under the provisions of § 21.84 of this part or an Individualized Employment Assistance Plan (IEAP) under § 21.88 of this part.

        (b)  A veteran for whom achievement of a vocational goal is not found reasonably feasible shall be notified of this finding and be informed of his or her appellate rights as described in § 21.416 of this part. The veteran shall be provided the assistance described in § 21.50(b)(9) of this part.

        § 21.6059   Limitations on the number of evaluations.

#### § § 21.6059

        (a)  No more than 3,500 evaluations of the reasonable feasibility of achieving a vocational goal may be given during any 12-month period, beginning on February 1, 1985, and each subsequent February 1 during the program period.

        (b)  An evaluation is deemed to be countable against the 3,500 limit permitted during each 12-month period when the following conditions are met:

        (1) The veteran is provided one or more personal interviews by a Counseling Psychologist (CP) or Vocational Rehabilitation Counselor (VRC); and

        (2) A determination of the reasonable feasibility of achieving a vocational goal is made by the CP or VRC.

        (c)  Computation of the number of evaluations which may be provided in a 12-month period shall exclude cases in which:

        (1) The veteran under age 45 awarded pension during the program period is unable to participate for reasons beyond his or her control;

        (2) Review of available information does not indicate a good potential for employment of other qualified veterans.

        (3) The veteran either fails to keep a scheduled appointment to complete the evaluation or withdraws the claim for an evaluation, or

        (4) The veteran who has completed an evaluation requires or requests a reevaluation.

        (d)  If a veteran below age 45 for whom an evaluation is required cannot be provided an evaluation during a particular 12-month period because of the limitation on the number of evaluations, the veteran will be given first priority for evaluation during the following 12-month period, or first available subsequent 12-month period, if otherwise eligible.

      Services and Assistance to Program Participants

        § 21.6060   Services and assistance.

#### § § 21.6060

        (a)  VA may provide to program participants:

        (1) Vocationally oriented services and assistance of the kind provided veterans under chapter 31, title 38 U.S.C.;

        (2) Employment assistance during the 18 month period following completion of a vocational training program, including:

        (i) Educational, vocational, psychological, employment and personal adjustment counseling;

        (ii) Placement services to effect suitable placement in employment, and post-placement services to attempt to insure satisfactory adjustment in employment; and

        (iii) Personal adjustment and work adjustment training.

        (3) Such other services and assistance of the kind provided veterans under chapter 31, except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, as are necessary to enable the veteran to prepare for, and participate in, vocational training or employment.

        (b)  VA will not provide to a participant under this program any:

        (1) Loan;

        (2) Subsistence allowance;

        (3) Automobile adaptive equipment of the kind provided eligible veterans under 38 U.S.C., chapter 39 or chapter 31;

        (4) Training at an institution of higher learning in a program of education that is not predominantly vocational in content;

        (5) Employment adjustment allowance;

        (6) Room and board in a special rehabilitation facility for a period in excess of 30 days;

        (7) Independent living services, except those which are indispensable to the pursuit of the vocational training program during the period of rehabilitation to the point of employability under § 21.6160 of this part; or

        (8) Period of extended evaluation under 38 U.S.C. 3106(e).

      Duration of Training

        § 21.6070   Basic duration of a vocational training program.

#### § § 21.6070

        (a)  The duration of a vocational training program may not exceed 24 calendar months of full-time training except as provided in § 21.6072 of this part.

        (b)  The Counseling Psychologist (CP) or Vocational Rehabilitation Counselor (VRC) is responsible for estimating the time needed by the veteran to complete a vocational training program. The estimate is made in consultation with the veteran and the vocational rehabilitation specialist during the preparation of the IWRP.

        (c)  The veterans will be provided training for a period sufficient for the veteran to reach the level generally recognized as necessary for entry into employment in a suitable occupational objective. Where a particular degree, diploma or certificate is generally necessary for entry into employment, the veteran may be trained to that level.

        (d)  If the amount of training the particular veteran needs in order to qualify for employment in a particular occupation will exceed the amount generally needed for employment in that occupation, VA may provide the necessary additional training under one or more of the following conditions:

        (1) Training requirements for employment in the area in which the veteran lives or will seek employment exceed those generally needed for employment;

        (2) The veteran is preparing for a type of work in which he or she will be at a definite disadvantage in competing with nondisabled persons for a job or business, and the additional training will offset the competitive disadvantage;

        (3) The choice of a feasible occupation is limited and additional training will enhance the veteran's employability in one of the feasible occupations; or

        (4) The number of employment opportunities within a feasible occupation is restricted.

        (e)  The CP or VRC, in estimating duration of the training period needed, must determine that:

        (1) The proposed vocational training program must be one which, when pursued full-time by a nondisabled person, would not normally require more than 24 calendar months of pursuit for successful completion;

        (2) The program of training and other services needed by the veteran, based upon VA's evaluation, will not exceed 24 calendar months, if training is pursued on a full-time basis, or 36 calendar months if pursued on a less than full-time basis. In making this determination the following criteria will be applied:

        (i) The number of actual months and days of the period during which the veteran will pursue the training program will be counted;

        (ii) Days of authorized leave and other periods during which the veteran will not be pursuing training, such as periods between terms will also be counted;

        (iii) The period of evaluation prior to determination of reasonable feasibility will be excluded but the actual number of months and days needed to evaluate and improve rehabilitation potential during the training program will be included;

        (iv) The time required, as determined in months and days under paragraph (e)(2)(i) through (iii) of this section, will be the total period that would be required for the veteran to accomplish the vocational program under consideration;

        (v) If the total period the veteran requires exceeds 24 calendar months, when pursued on a full-time basis, and an extension of the basic training period may not be approved under § 21.6072 of this part, another suitable vocational goal must be selected for which training can be completed within that period.

        (3) If the veteran's vocational training program would require more than 36 calendar months when pursued on a less than full-time basis, the program must be reevaluated to select a vocational goal for which a suitable vocational training program can be completed within that period.

        (f)  The veteran's vocational goal may be changed during the program in accordance with § 21.94 (a) through (d) of this part. The extent to which such changes may be made is limited by the following considerations:

        (1) A change of the vocational goal from one field or occupational family to another field or occupational family may only be approved before the end of the first 24 months of training, whether training is pursued on a full-time or a less than full-time basis; and

        (2) A change from one occupational objective to another within the same field or occupational family shall not be considered a change in the vocational goal identified in the veteran's IWRP.

        (4) Before applying for educational assistance, the individual—

If this veteran fails to establish eligibility under paragraph (b) of this section, he or she will retain eligibility established under paragraph (a) of this section.

        (2) An individual must elect, in writing, whether he or she wishes service in the Selected Reserve to be credited towards establishing eligibility under 38 U.S.C. chapter 30 or under 10 U.S.C. chapter 1606 when:

        (A) Is a veteran who has established eligibility for basic educational assistance through meeting the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section; and

        (B) Also is a reservist who has established eligibility for benefits under 10 U.S.C. chapter 1606 through meeting the requirements of § 21.7540; or

        (4) If a veteran is eligible to receive educational assistance under both 38 U.S.C. chapter 30 and 10 U.S.C. chapter 1606, he or she may receive educational assistance alternately or consecutively under each of these chapters to the extent that the educational assistance is based on service not irrevocably credited to one or the other chapter as provided in paragraphs (d)(1) through (d)(3) of this section.

        (e)  (1) An individual on active duty who does not have sufficient active duty service to establish eligibility under paragraph (a) of this section, nevertheless is eligible to receive basic educational assistance when he or she

        (3) An individual who establishes basic eligibility under this paragraph shall lose that eligibility if, upon discharge or release from active duty, he or she is unable to establish eligibility under any of the other paragraphs of this section. The effective date for that loss of eligibility is the date the veteran was discharged or released from active duty.

        (f)  (1) An individual who, after June 30, 1985, first becomes a member of the Armed Forces or first enters on active duty as a member of the Armed Forces, may elect not to receive educational assistance under 38 U.S.C. ch. 30. This election must be made at the time the individual initially enters on active duty as a member of the Armed Forces. An individual who makes such an election is not eligible for educational assistance under 38 U.S.C. ch. 30 unless he or she withdraws the election as provided in paragraph (c) of this section or in § 21.7045(b) or (c) of this part.

        (2) Except as provided in paragraph (f)(4) of this section, an individual is not eligible for educational assistance under 38 U.S.C. chapter 30 if after December 31, 1976, he or she receives a commission as an officer in the Armed Forces upon graduation from:

        (i) The United States Military Academy;

        (ii) The United States Naval Academy;

        (iii) The United States Air Force Academy; or

        (iv) The United States Coast Guard Academy.

        (3) Except as provided in this paragraph and in paragraph (f)(4) of this section, an individual who after December 31, 1976, receives a commission as an officer in the Armed Forces upon completion of a program of educational assistance under 10 U.S.C. 2107 (the Senior Reserve Officers' Training Corps program) is not eligible for educational assistance under 38 U.S.C. chapter 30. This bar to eligibility under 38 U.S.C. chapter 30 does not apply to an individual who entered active duty after September 30, 1996, and received—

        (i) $2,000 or less in educational assistance under 10 U.S.C. 2107 for at least one year of the individual's participation in that program of educational assistance; or

        (ii) $3,400 or less in educational assistance under 10 U.S.C. 2107 for at least one year of the individual's participation in that program of educational assistance. This provision applies to payment of educational assistance under 38 U.S.C. chapter 30 for months after December 31, 2001.

        (4) Paragraphs (f)(2) and (f)(3) of this section do not apply to a veteran who has met the requirements for educational assistance under paragraph (a), (b) or (c) of this section before receiving a commission in the Armed Forces upon graduation from the United States Military Academy, the United States Naval Academy, the United States Air Force Academy, the United States Coast Guard Academy; or upon completion of a program of educational assistance under 10 U.S.C. 2107 (the Senior Reserve Officers Training Corps Scholarship Program).

        (g)  (1) Except as elsewhere provided in this paragraph, the basic pay of any individual described in paragraph (a), (b), or (c) of this section shall be reduced by $100 for each of the first 12 months that the individual is entitled to basic pay. If the individual does not serve 12 months, it shall be reduced by $100 for each month that the individual is entitled to basic pay.

        (2) The basic pay of an individual who withdraws an election not to receive educational assistance under 38 U.S.C. ch. 30 as described in paragraph (c) of this section shall be reduced by

        (i) $1,200, or

        (ii) In the case of an individual whose discharge or release from active duty prevents the reduction of the individual's basic pay by $1,200, an amount less than $1,200.

        (3) The basic pay of any individual who makes the election described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section and who does not withdraw that election will not be subject to the reduction described in either paragraph (g)(1) or paragraph (g)(2) of this section.

        (4) The individual who makes the election described in either paragraph (a)(7) or (b)(10) of this section shall have his or her basic pay reduced by $1,200 in a manner prescribed by the Secretary of Defense. To the extent that basic pay is not so reduced before the individual's discharge or release from active duty, VA will collect from the individual an amount equal to the difference between $1,200 and the total amount of the reductions described in this paragraph. If the basic pay of an individual is not reduced and/or VA does not collect from the individual an amount equal to the difference between $1,200 and the total amount of the pay reductions, that individual is ineligible for educational assistance.

        (5) If through administrative error, or other reason—

        (i) The basic pay of an individual described in paragraph (a)(1) through (a)(6), (b)(1) through (b)(9), (c), or (d) of this section is not reduced as provided in paragraph (g)(1) or (g)(2) of this section, the failure to make the reduction will have no effect on his or her eligibility, but will negate or reduce the individual's entitlement to educational assistance under 38 U.S.C. chapter 30 determined as provided in § 21.7073 for an individual described in paragraph (c) of this section;

        (ii) The basic pay of an individual, described in paragraph (a)(7) or (b)(10) of this section, is not reduced as described in paragraph (g)(4) of this section and/or VA does not collect from the individual an amount equal to the difference between $1,200 and the total amount of the pay reductions described in paragraph (g)(4) of this section, that individual is ineligible for educational assistance. If the failure to reduce the individual's basic pay and/or the failure to collect from the individual was due to administrative error on the part of the Federal government or any of its employees, the individual may be considered for equitable relief depending on the facts and circumstances of the case. See § 2.7 of this chapter.

        (ii) If the individual is a participant (as defined in § 21.5021(e)) in the educational program provided in 38 U.S.C. ch. 32, the individual must make an irrevocable election to receive educational assistance under 38 U.S.C. ch. 30 rather than under 38 U.S.C. ch. 32. Such an election must be made:

        (A) Before the individual is involuntarily or voluntarily separated as the case may be, and

        (B) Pursuant to procedures which the Secretary of the military department concerned provides in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Defense or which the Secretary of Transportation provides with respect to the Coast Guard when it is not operating as a service in the Navy; or

        (iii) If the individual is not described in either paragraph (b)(1)(i) or (b)(1)(ii) of this section, he or she must make an irrevocable election to receive educational assistance under 38 U.S.C. ch. 30. This election must be made:

        (A) Before the individual is involuntarily or voluntarily separated as the case may be, and

        (B) Pursuant to procedures which the Secretary of the military department concerned provides in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Defense or which the Secretary of Transportation provides with respect to the Coast Guard when it is not operating as a service in the Navy.

        (2)  The basic pay of anyone who makes one of the irrevocable elections described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section is required by 38 U.S.C. 3018B to be reduced by $1,200.

        (i) If for any reason the basic pay of an individual who received an involuntary separation is not so reduced by $1,200, the failure to make the reduction will not affect the individual's eligibility for educational assistance under 38 U.S.C. ch. 30.

        (ii) If the individual is voluntarily separated, such reduction of the individual's basic pay by $1,200 is a precondition to establishing eligibility. Hence, educational assistance under 38 U.S.C. ch. 30 may not be paid to such an individual when the reduction does not occur.

        (3)  (i) Before the date on which VA receives the individual's application for educational assistance under subpart K of this part, the individual must have:

        (A) Successfully completed the requirements of a secondary school diploma (or equivalency certificate); or

        (B) Successfully completed (or otherwise received academic credit for) 12 semester hours (or the equivalent) in a program of education leading to a standard college degree.

        (ii) If a veteran's application for educational assistance is denied due to failure to meet the requirements of paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section at the time of his or her application for educational assistance, the veteran may reapply if the requirements are subsequently met.

        (c)  If an individual meets the requirements of paragraph (a)(2) of this section and is voluntarily discharged before October 23, 1992, he or she must also meet the following requirements in order to establish eligibility for educational assistance.

        (1)  (i) If, under § 21.7042(f), the individual elected not to receive educational assistance under 38 U.S.C. ch. 30, he or she must irrevocably withdraw that election and make an election to receive educational assistance under 38 U.S.C. ch. 30. The withdrawal and the new election must be made:

        (A) Before October 23, 1993, and

        (B) In the form and manner prescribed by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs; and

        (ii) If the individual is a participant (as defined in § 21.5021(e)) in the educational program provided in 38 U.S.C. ch. 32, the individual must make an irrevocable election to receive educational assistance under 38 U.S.C. ch. 30 rather than under 38 U.S.C. ch. 32. Such an election must be made:

        (A) Before October 23, 1993, and

        (B) In the form and manner prescribed by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs.

        (iii) If the individual is not described in either paragraph (c)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section, he or she must make an irrevocable election to receive educational assistance under 38 U.S.C. ch. 30. This election must be made:

        (A) Before October 23, 1993, and

        (B) In the form and manner prescribed by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs.

        (2)  VA must collect $1,200 from the individual before awarding educational assistance under 38 U.S.C. ch. 30. Collection of $1,200 is a precondition to establishing eligibility.

        (3)  (i) Before the date on which VA receives the individual's application for educational assistance under subpart K of this part, the individual must have:

        (A) Successfully completed the requirements of a secondary school diploma (or equivalency certificate); or

        (B) Successfully completed (or otherwise received academic credit for) 12 semester hours (or the equivalent) in a program of education leading to a standard college degree.

        (ii) If a veteran's application for educational assistance under subpart K of this part is denied due to failure to meet the requirements of paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section at the time of his or her application for educational assistance, the veteran will be permitted to apply at a later date.

        (d) —(1)  To receive educational assistance under the authority of paragraph (d) of this section, a veteran or servicemember must—

        (i) Have elected to do so before October 9, 1997;

        (ii) Have been a participant (as that term is defined in § 21.5021(e)) in the Post-Vietnam Era Veterans' Educational Assistance Program on October 9, 1996;

        (iii) Have been on active duty on October 9, 1996; and

        (iv) Receive an honorable discharge.

        (2)  The election to receive educational assistance payable under this subpart in lieu of educational assistance payable under the Post-Vietnam Era Veterans' Educational Assistance Program is irrevocable. The election must have been made before October 9, 1997, pursuant to procedures provided by the Secretary of the military department concerned in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Defense or provided by the Secretary of Transportation with respect to the Coast Guard when it is not operating as a service in the Navy.

        (3)  An individual who has made the election described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section shall have his or her basic pay reduced by $1,200 in a manner prescribed by the Secretary of Defense. To the extent that basic pay is not so reduced before the individual's discharge or release from active duty, VA will collect from the individual an amount equal to the difference between $1,200 and the total amount of the reductions. Reduction in basic pay by $1,200 or collection of $1,200 is a precondition to establishing eligibility.

        (4)  Before applying for benefits that may be payable as the result of making a valid election, an individual must have—

        (i) Completed the requirements of a secondary school diploma (or equivalency certificate); or

        (ii) Successfully completed the equivalent of 12 semester hours in a program of education leading to a standard college degree.

        (e) —(1)  For the purpose of this paragraph a  is a veteran or servicemember who:

        (i) Had enrolled in the Post-Vietnam Era Veterans' Educational Assistance Program, contributed to the fund described in § 21.5021(f), and either—

        (A) Is making contributions by monthly payroll deduction to that fund;

        (B) Has some or all of the contributions remaining in that fund;

        (C) Has disenrolled, and received a refund of contributions; or

        (D) Has used all of his or her entitlement to benefits under the Post-Vietnam Era Veterans' Educational Assistance Program; or

        (ii) Had enrolled in the Post-Vietnam Era Veterans' Educational Assistance Program, and has had the Secretary of Defense make contributions to the fund described in § 21.5021(f) for him or her.

        (2)  To receive educational assistance under authority of this paragraph, a veteran or servicemember must:

        (i) Have elected before November 1, 2001, to receive educational assistance payable under 38 U.S.C. chapter 30 in lieu of educational assistance payable under the Post-Vietnam Era Veterans' Educational Assistance Program;

        (ii) Have been a participant in the Post-Vietnam Era Veterans' Educational Assistance Program on or before October 9, 1996;

        (iii) Have served continuously on active duty since October 9, 1996, through at least April 1, 2000;

        (iv) Receive an honorable discharge when discharged or released from the period of active duty during which the servicemember made the election described in paragraph (e)(3) of this section.

        (3)  The election to receive educational assistance payable under 38 U.S.C. chapter 30 in lieu of educational assistance payable under the Post-Vietnam Era Veterans' Educational Assistance Program is irrevocable. The election must have been made before November 1, 2001, pursuant to procedures provided by the Secretary of the military department concerned.

        (4)  (i) An individual who has made the election described in paragraph (e)(3) of this section must have his or her basic pay reduced by $2,700 in a manner prescribed by the Secretary of the military department concerned. To the extent that basic pay is not so reduced before the individual's discharge or release from active duty, the Secretary of the military department concerned will collect from the individual an amount equal to the difference between $2,700 and the amount that the individual's basic pay has been reduced. The individual may choose how the $2,700 is to be collected. The Secretary of the military department concerned, according to the choice the individual makes, will collect this amount—

        (A) From the individual; or

        (B) By reducing the individual's retired or retainer pay.

        (ii) The individual must pay $2,700 to the Secretary of the military department concerned, as provided for by that Secretary, during an 18-month period beginning on the date the individual made the election described in paragraph (e)(3) of this section.

        (iii) Educational assistance under authority of paragraph (e) of this section to an individual who was discharged or released from active duty before the Secretary of the military department concerned had collected the full $2,700 described in paragraph (e)(4) of this section is not payable until that Secretary either—

        (A) Collects in full the $2,700; or

        (B) Has made the first reduction in retired or retainer pay for the purpose of the $2,700 payment described in paragraph (e)(4) of this section. Thus, a veteran who is making the $2,700 payment through having retired or retainer pay reduced may be eligible before the Secretary of the military department concerned collects the full $2,700.

        (5)  Before applying for benefits that may be payable as the result of making a valid election, an individual must have—

        (i) Completed the requirements of a secondary school diploma (or equivalency certificate); or

        (ii) Successfully completed the equivalent of 12 semester hours in a program of education leading to a standard college degree.

        § 21.7046   Eligibility for supplemental educational assistance.

#### § § 21.7046

        The Secretary concerned, pursuant to regulations prescribed by that Secretary, has the discretion to provide for the payment of supplemental educational assistance to certain veterans and servicemembers eligible for basic educational assistance.

        (a)  The Secretary concerned may authorize supplemental educational assistance to an individual who is eligible for basic educational assistance under § 21.7042 or § 21.7044 of this part based solely on active duty service only if the individual meets the provisions of this paragraph.

        (1) An individual may establish eligibility for supplemental educational assistance by serving five or more consecutive years of active duty in the Armed Forces in addition to the years counted to qualify the individual for basic educational assistance without a break in any such service.

        (2) After completion of the service described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section the individual must either—

        (1) The individual must serve—

        (i) Two or more consecutive years of active duty in the Armed Forces in addition to the years on active duty counted to qualify the individual for basic educational assistance, and

        (ii) Four or more consecutive years of duty in the Selected Reserve in addition to the years of duty in the Selected Reserve counted to qualify the individual for basic educational assistance.

        (v) Continue on active duty, or

        (vi) Continue in the Selected Reserve.

        (3) The Secretary concerned may prescribe by regulation a maximum period of time during which the individual is considered to have continuous service in the Selected Reserve even though he or she is unable to locate a unit of the Selected Reserve of the individual's Armed Force that the individual is eligible to join or that has a vacancy.

        (4) The Secretary concerned may prescribe by regulation a maximum period of time during which the individual is considered to have continuous service in the Selected Reserve even though he or she is not attached to a unit of the Selected Reserve for any reason (also to be prescribed by the Secretary concerned by regulation) other than those stated in paragraph (b)(3) of this section.

        (5) Any decision as to the continuity of an individual's service in the Selected Reserve made by the Department of Defense or the Department of Transportation under regulations described in paragraph (b) (3) or (4) of this section shall be binding upon VA.

        § 21.7050   Ending dates of eligibility.

#### § § 21.7050

        The ending date of eligibility will be determined as follows:

        (a)  (1) Except as provided in paragraphs (c), (d), and (e) of this section and in § 21.7051, VA will not provide basic educational assistance or supplemental educational assistance to a veteran or servicemember beyond 10 years from the later of—

        (i) The date of the veteran's last discharge or release from a period of active duty of 90 days or more of continuous service;

        (ii) The date of the veteran's last discharge or release from a shorter period of active duty if the discharge or release is—

        (C) For hardship, or

        (D) Involuntary, for the convenience of the government after October 1, 1987, as a result of a reduction in force, as determined by the Secretary of the military department concerned, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Defense or by the Secretary of Transportation with respect to the Coast Guard when it is not operating as a service in the Navy;

        (iii) The date on which the veteran meets the requirement for four years service in the Selected Reserve found in §§ 21.7042(b) and 21.7044(b); or

        (iv) December 27, 2001, for individuals who become eligible for educational assistance under § 21.7044(a)(7) or (b)(4)(ii).

        (2) In determining whether a veteran was discharged or released from active duty for a medical condition which preexisted that active duty, VA will be bound by a decision made by a competent military authority.

        (b)  (1) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, a veteran who had eligibility for educational assistance under 38 U.S.C. ch. 34 and who is eligible for educational assistance under 38 U.S.C. ch. 30 as provided in § 21.7044 of this part shall have his or her ten-year period of eligibility reduced by the number of days he or she was not on active duty during the period beginning on January 1, 1977, and ending on June 30, 1985.

        (2) A veteran's ten-year period of eligibility shall not be reduced by any period in 1977 before the veteran began serving on active duty when the veteran qualified for educational assistance under 38 U.S.C. ch. 34 through service on active duty which—

        (i) Commenced within 12 months of January 1, 1977, and

        (ii) Resulted from a contract with the Armed Forces in a program such as the DEP (Delayed Enlistment Program) or an ROTC (Reserve Officers' Training Corps) program for which a person enlisted in, or was assigned to, a reserve component before January 1, 1977.

        (c)  (1) If a veteran or servicemember establishes eligibility for the educational assistance payable under this subpart by making the election described in § 21.7042(a)(7) or (b)(10), VA will not provide basic educational assistance or supplemental educational assistance to that veteran or servicemember beyond 10 years from the later of:

        (i) The date determined by paragraph (a) or (b) of this section, as appropriate; or

        (ii) The effective date of the election described in § 21.7042(a)(7) or (b)(10), as appropriate.

        (2) The effective date of election is the date on which the election is made pursuant to the procedures described in § 21.7045(d)(2).

        (d)  If a veteran would not be eligible but for the provisions of § 21.7020(b)(6)(v), VA will not pay basic educational assistance or supplemental educational assistance to that veteran beyond 10 years after the veteran's last discharge or release from a period of active duty of 90 days or more of continuous service, or November 30, 2009, whichever is later.

        (e)  (1) The ending date of the eligibility period of a veteran described in paragraph (e)(2) of this section is the later of:

        (i) November 1, 2010; or

        (ii) 10 years after the date of the veteran's last discharge from a period of active duty of 90 days or more.

        (2) The ending date of a veteran's eligibility period will be the date described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section if the veteran would have been prevented from establishing eligibility by one or more of the former requirements described in paragraphs (e)(2)(i) through (e)(2)(iv) of this section and the veteran is enabled to establish eligibility by the removal of the statutory bases for those requirements. (For the purposes of this paragraph, the applicable provisions of those former requirements appear in the July 1, 2002 revision of the Code of Federal Regulations, title 38.)

        (i)  The veteran was enabled to establish eligibility by the removal of the former eligibility requirement in 38 CFR 21.7042(a)(2)(ii), 21.7042(a)(5)(iv)(A), and 21.7042(a)(5)(iv)(B), revised as of July 1, 2002, that a veteran had to use his or her initial period of active duty to establish eligibility for educational assistance;

        (ii)  The veteran was enabled to establish eligibility by the removal of the former eligibility requirement in 38 CFR 21.7042(a)(3), 21.7042(b)(2), and 21.7042(c)(4), revised as of July 1, 2002, that before completing the period of active duty used to establish eligibility for educational assistance, a veteran had to complete the requirements for a secondary school diploma (or an equivalency certificate) or successfully complete (or otherwise receive academic credit for) 12 semester hours (or the equivalent) in a program of education leading to a standard college degree;

        (iii)  The veteran was enabled to establish eligibility by the removal of the former eligibility requirement in 38 CFR 21.7042(a)(6), 21.7042(b)(11), and 21.7044(b)(13), revised as of July 1, 2002, that certain veterans meet the requirements for a secondary school diploma (or an equivalency certificate) before October 29, 1994, in order to establish eligibility for educational assistance;

        (iv)  The veteran was enabled to establish eligibility by the removal of the former eligibility requirement in 38 CFR 21.7044(a)(3) and 21.7044(b)(3), revised as of July 1, 2002, that, as one of the two ways that certain veterans could meet the educational criteria for establishing eligibility for educational assistance, the veteran must before January 1, 1990, meet the requirements for a secondary school diploma (or equivalency certificate).

        (f)  A veteran may become eligible for educational assistance as the result of a correction of military records under 10 U.S.C. 1552, or change, correction or modification of a discharge or dismissal under 10 U.S.C. 1553, or other corrective action by competent military authority. When this occurs, the VA will not provide educational assistance later than 10 years from the date his or her dismissal or discharge was changed, corrected or modified (except as provided in § 21.7051 of this part).

        (g)  VA will not include in computing the 10-year period of eligibility for educational assistance under this section, any period during which the veteran after his or her last discharge or release from active duty—

        (1) Was captured and held as a prisoner of war by a foreign government or power, or

        (2) Immediately following the veteran's release from this detention during which he or she was hospitalized at a military, civilian or VA medical facility.

        (h)  (1) Unless the transferor dies while on active duty, the ending date of the eligibility period for a spouse, who is eligible for transferred entitlement under § 21.7080, is the earliest of the following dates:

        (i) The transferor's ending date of eligibility as determined under this section;

        (ii) The ending date the transferor specified, if the transferor specified the period for which the transfer was effective; or

        (iii) The effective date of the transferor's revocation of transfer of entitlement as determined under § 21.7080(g)(2).

        (2) If the transferor dies while on active duty, the ending date of the eligibility period for a spouse, who is eligible for transferred entitlement under § 21.7080, is the earliest of the following dates:

        (i) The date 10 years from the transferor's date of death;

        (ii) The ending date the transferor specified, if the transferor specified the period for which the transfer was effective; or

        (iii) The effective date of the transferor's revocation of transfer of entitlement as determined under § 21.7080(g)(2).

        (i)  (1) Unless the transferor dies while on active duty, the ending date of the eligibility period for a child, who is eligible for transferred entitlement under § 21.7080 is the earliest of the following dates:

        (i) The transferor's ending date of eligibility as determined under this section;

        (ii) The ending date the transferor specified, if the transferor specified the period for which the transfer was effective;

        § 21.7051   Extended period of eligibility.

#### § § 21.7051

        (a)  VA shall grant an extension of the applicable delimiting period, as otherwise determined by § 21.7050 of this part provided:

        (1) The veteran applies for an extension within the time specified in § 21.1033(c).

        (2) The veteran was prevented from initiating or completing the chosen program of education within the otherwise applicable eligibility period because of a physical or mental disability that did not result from the veteran's willful misconduct. VA will not consider the disabling effects of chronic alcoholism to be the result of willful misconduct. (See § 21.7020(b)(38)) It must be clearly established by medical evidence that such a program of education was medically infeasible. VA will not consider a veteran who is disabled for a period of 30 days or less as having been prevented from initiating or completing a chosen program, unless the evidence establishes that the veteran was prevented from enrolling or reenrolling in the chosen program or was forced to discontinue attendance, because of the short disability.

        (b)  The veteran shall elect the commencing date of an extended period of eligibility. The date chosen—

        (1) Must be on or after the original date of expiration of eligibility as determined by § 21.7050 of this part, and

        (2) Must either be—

        (i) On or before the 90th day following the date on which the veteran's application for an extension was approved by VA, if the veteran is training during the extended period of eligibility in a course not organized on a term, quarter or semester basis, or

        (ii) On or before the commencing date of the first ordinary term, quarter or semester following the 90th day after the veteran's application for an extension was approved by VA, if the veteran is training during the extended period of eligibility in a course organized on a term, quarter or semester basis.

        (c)  A veteran's extended period of eligibility shall be for the length of time that the individual was prevented from initiating or completing his or her chosen program of education. This shall be determined as follows:

        (1) If the veteran is in training in a course organized on a term, quarter or semester basis, his or her extended period of eligibility shall contain the same number of days as the number of days from the date during the veteran's original eligibility period that his or her training became medically infeasible to the earliest of the following date.

        (i) The commencing date of the ordinary term, quarter or semester following the day the veteran's training became medically infeasible,

        (ii) The last date of the veteran's delimiting date as determined by § 21.7050 of this part, or

        (iii) The date the veteran resumed training.

        (2) If the veteran is training in a course not organized on a term, quarter or semester basis, his or her extended period of eligibility shall contain the same number of days as the number of days from the date during the veteran's original delimiting period that his or her training became medically infeasible to the earlier of the following dates:

        (i) The date the veteran's training became medically feasible, or

        (ii) The veteran's delimiting date as determined by § 21.7050 of this part.

      Entitlement

        § 21.7070   Entitlement.

#### § § 21.7070

        An eligible servicemember or veteran is entitled to a monthly benefit for periods of time during which he or she is enrolled in, and satisfactorily pursuing, an approved program of education.

        § 21.7072   Entitlement to basic educational assistance.

#### § § 21.7072

        The provisions of this section apply to all veterans and servicemembers except to those to whom § 21.7073 applies.

        (a)  Except as provided in paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section and in § 21.7073, a veteran or servicemember who is eligible for basic educational assistance is entitled to 36 months of basic educational assistance (or the equivalent thereof in part-time educational assistance).

        (b)  (1) Except as provided in § 21.7073, when the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section are met, an eligible individual is entitled to one month of basic educational assistance (or equivalent thereof in part-time basic educational assistance) for each month of the individual's continuous active duty service that is after June 30, 1985, and that, in the case of an individual who had no previous eligibility under 38 U.S.C. ch. 34, is part of the individual's qualifying obligated period of active duty. In the case of a veteran to whom the definition of continuous active duty found in either § 21.7020(b)(6)(iii) or § 21.7020(b)(6)(iv) applies, the length of the continuous active duty will be the aggregate length of the periods of active duty referred to in those paragraphs. Except as provided in § 21.7073, VA will apply paragraph (b) of this section when the individual:

        (i) Establishes eligibility through meeting the eligibility requirements of § 21.7042 or § 21.7044,

        (ii) Serves less than 36 months of continuous active duty service after June 30, 1985 (or less than 24 continuous months of a qualifying obligated period of active duty service after June 30, 1985, if his or her qualifying obligated period of active duty is less than 3 years), and

        (iii) Is discharged or released from active duty either—

        (A) For a service-connected disability, or

        (B) For a medical condition which preexisted the individual's service on active duty and which VA determines is not service connected,

        (C) Under 10 U.S.C. 1173 (hardship discharge), or

        (D) Involuntarily for convenience of the government as a result of a reduction in force, as determined by the Secretary of the military department concerned in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Defense or by the Secretary of Transportation with respect to the Coast Guard when it is not operating as a service in the Navy, or;

        (E) For a physical or mental condition that was not characterized as a disability and did not result from the individual's own willful misconduct but did interfere with the individual's performance of duty, as determined by the Secretary of each military department in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Defense or by the Secretary of Transportation with respect to the Coast Guard when it is not operating as a service in the Navy.

        (2) Entitlement will be calculated in whole months.

        (3) The following types of time lost are not countable in determining the extent of a veteran's or servicemember's entitlement:

        (i) Excess leave,

        (ii) Noncreditable time, and

        (iii) Not-on-duty time.

        (c)  (1) Except as provided in § 21.7073, when the provisions of paragraph (c) of this section are met, an individual is entitled to one month of basic educational assistance (or the equivalent thereof in part-time basic educational assistance) for each month of the individual's active duty service that is after June 30, 1985, and that, in the case of an individual who had no previous eligibility under 38 U.S.C. chapter 34, is part of the individual's qualifying obligated period of active duty. An individual is entitled to one month of basic educational assistance (or the equivalent thereof in part-time basic educational assistance) for each four months served by the individual in the Selected Reserve after June 30, 1985 (other than a month in which the individual serves on active duty). Except as provided in § 21.7073, VA will apply the provisions of paragraph (c) of this section when the individual—

        (i) Establishes eligibility through meeting the eligibility requirements of § 21.7042 or § 21.7044, and

        (ii) Bases his or her eligibility upon a combination of service on active duty and service in the Selected Reserve as described in § 21.7042(b) and § 21.7044(b).

        (2) Entitlement will be calculated in whole months.

        (3) The following types of time lost are not countable in determining the extent of a veteran's or servicemember's entitlement:

        (i) Excess leave,

        (ii) Noncreditable time, and

        (iii) Not-on-duty time.

        (4) A veteran described in this paragraph is not entitled to any basic educational assistance for service in the Selected Reserve in excess of the number of months of service in the Selected Reserve which is evenly divisible by four.

        (5) VA will consider a veteran to be entitled to 36 months of basic educational assistance when he or she—

        (i) Initially enters on active duty after June 30, 1985;

        (ii) Is attempting to establish eligibility through service in the Selected Reserve;

        (iii) Has completed the active duty service required in § 21.7042 of this part; and

        (iv) Is participating in the Selected Reserve, but has not participated for the length of time required in § 21.7042 of this part.

        (d)  If a veteran attempts to establish eligibility through a combination of active duty service and service in the Selected Reserves, but fails to do so, his or her entitlement shall be the number of months to which he or she is entitled on the basis of his or her active duty service.

        (e)  A period of service counted for the purpose of repayment under section 902 of the Department of Defense Authorization Act, 1981, of an education loan may not also be counted for the purposes of determining the number of months of the veteran's or servicemember's entitlement to basic educational assistance. Therefore, in determining a veteran's or servicemember's entitlement, VA will—

        (1) Determine his or her entitlement as provided in paragraph (a), (b), (c) or (d) of this section, as appropriate, and

        (2) Subtract from the figure determined in paragraph (e)(1) of this section the number of months of service counted for the purposes of repayment of an educational loan under section 902 of the Department of Defense Authorization Act, 1981.

        (f)  Except as provided in § 21.7076(e) and § 21.7135(s) of this part no one is entitled to more than 36 months of full-time basic educational assistance (or its equivalent in part-time educational assistance).

        § 21.7073   Entitlement for some individuals who establish eligibility during the open period or who establish eligibility before involuntary separation.

#### § § 21.7073

        (a)  (1) The provisions of this paragraph apply to a veteran or servicemember who:

        (i) Establishes eligibility by withdrawing an election not to enroll as provided in § 21.7042(c);

        (ii) Has less than $1,200 deducted from his or her military pay; and

        (iii) Before completing the period of service which the individual was obligated to serve on December 1, 1988, the individual:

        (A) Is discharged or released from active duty for a service-connected disability, a medical condition which preexisted that service, or hardship; or

        (B) For a physical or mental condition that was not characterized as a disability and did not result from the individual's own willful misconduct but did interfere with the individual's performance of duty, as determined by the Secretary of each military department in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Defense or by the Secretary of Transportation with respect to the Coast Guard when it is not operating as a service in the Navy.

        (C) Is discharged or released from active duty for the convenience of the Government after completing not less than 20 months of that period of service, if that period was less than three years, or 30 months, if that period was at least three years; or

        (D) Is involuntarily discharged or released from active duty for convenience of the Government as a result of a reduction in force, as determined by the Secretary concerned in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Defense or by the Secretary of Transportation with respect to the Coast Guard when it is not operating as a service in the Navy.

        (2) A veteran described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section is entitled to a number of months of basic educational assistance (or equivalent thereof in part-time basic educational assistance) equal to the lesser of:

        (i) A number of months determined by multiplying 36 by a fraction the numerator of which is the amount by which the basic pay of the individual has been reduced as provided in § 21.7042(e)(2) and the denominator of which is $1,200, or

        (ii) The number of months the veteran has served on continuous active duty after June 30, 1985.

        (b)  (1) The provisions of this paragraph apply to a veteran who establishes eligibility by meeting the provisions of § 21.7045 of this part.

        (2) A veteran described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section is entitled to a number of months of basic educational assistance (or equivalent thereof in part-time basic educational assistance) equal to the lesser of—

        (i) 36 months, or

        (ii) The number of months the veteran served on active duty.

        § 21.7074   Entitlement to supplemental educational assistance.

#### § § 21.7074

        In determining the entitlement of a veteran or servicemember who is eligible for supplemental educational assistance VA shall—

        (a) Calculate the veteran's or servicemember's entitlement to basic educational assistance on the day he or she establishes eligibility for supplemental educational assistance, and

        (b) Credit the veteran or servicemember with the same number of months and days entitlement to supplemental educational assistance as the number calculated in paragraph (a) of this section.

        § 21.7075   Entitlement to tuition assistance top-up.

#### § § 21.7075

        An individual who is entitled to educational assistance under 38 U.S.C. chapter 30 is also entitled to 36 months of tuition assistance top-up. This entitlement is parallel to, and does not replace, the entitlement to educational assistance available under § 21.7072. If the individual receives tuition assistance top-up, VA will make a charge against both the entitlement under § 21.7072 and the entitlement under this section. The charge will be as described in § 21.7076(b)(10).

> [72 FR 16980, Apr. 5, 2007, as amended at 72 FR 35662, June 29, 2007]

        § 21.7076   Entitlement charges.

#### § § 21.7076

        (a)  VA will make charges against entitlement as stated in this section.

        (1) Charges will be made against the entitlement the veteran or servicemember has to educational assistance under 38 U.S.C. chapter 30 as the assistance is paid.

        (2) There will be a charge (for record purposes only) against the remaining entitlement, under 38 U.S.C. chapter 34, of an individual who is receiving the educational assistance under § 21.7137 of this part. The record-purpose charges against entitlement under 38 U.S.C. chapter 34 will not count against the 48 months of total entitlement under both 38 U.S.C. chapters 30 and 34 to which the veteran or servicemember may be entitled. ( § 21.4020(a) of this part).

        (3) Generally, VA will base those entitlement charges on the principle that a veteran or servicemember who trains full time for one day should be charged one day of entitlement. However, this general principle does not apply to a veteran or servicemember who:

        (i) Is pursuing correspondence training;

        (ii) Is pursuing flight training;

        (iii) Is pursuing an apprenticeship or other on-job training;

        (iv) Is paid an accelerated payment;

        (v) Is receiving educational assistance for taking an approved licensing or certification test; or

        (vi) Is receiving tuition assistance top-up.

        (4) The provisions of this section apply to:

        (i) Veterans and servicemembers training under 38 U.S.C. chapter 30; and

        (ii) Veterans training under 38 U.S.C. chapter 31 who make a valid election under § 21.21 of this part to receive educational assistance equivalent to that paid to veterans under 38 U.S.C. chapter 30.

        (b)  This paragraph states how VA generally will determine the charge against the entitlement of a servicemember or veteran who is receiving educational assistance. However, when the circumstances described in paragraph (e) apply to a servicemember or veteran, VA will use that paragraph to determine an entitlement charge instead of this paragraph.

        (1) Except for those pursuing correspondence training, flight training, apprenticeship or other on-job training; those receiving tuition assistance top-up; those receiving educational assistance for taking an approved licensing or certification test; those receiving tutorial assistance; and those receiving an accelerated payment, VA will make a charge against entitlement:

        (i) On the basis of total elapsed time (one day for each day of pursuit) if the servicemember or veteran is pursuing the program of education on a full-time basis,

        (ii) On the basis of a proportionate rate of elapsed time, if the veteran or servicemember is pursuing the program of education on a three-quarter, one-half or less than one-half time basis. For the purpose of this computation, training time which is less than one-half, but more than one-quarter time, will be treated as though it were one-quarter time training.

        (2) VA will compute elapsed time from the commencing date of the award to date of discontinuance. If the veteran or servicemember changes his or her training time after the commencing date of the award, VA will—

        (i) Divide the enrollment period into separate periods of time during which the veteran's or servicemember's training time remains constant, and.

        (ii) Compute the elapsed time separately for each time period.

        (3) For each month that a veteran is paid a monthly educational assistance allowance while undergoing apprenticeship or other on-job training, VA will make a charge against 38 U.S.C. chapter 30 entitlement of—

        (i) .75 of a month in the case of payments made during the first six months of the veteran's pursuit of the program of apprenticeship or other on-job training,

        (ii) .55 of a month in the case of payments made during the second six months of the veteran's pursuit of the program of apprenticeship or other on-job training, and

        (iii) .35 of a month in the case of payments made following the first twelve months of the veteran's pursuit of apprenticeship or other on-job training.

        (4) For each month that a veteran is paid a monthly educational assistance allowance while undergoing apprenticeship or other on-job training, including any month in which the veteran fails to complete 120 hours of training, VA will make a record-purpose charge against 38 U.S.C. chapter 34 entitlement, if any, as follows:

        (i) For training that occurs before October 1, 2005, VA will reduce 38 U.S.C. chapter 34 entitlement by one month for each month of benefits paid.

        (ii) For training that occurs on or after October 1, 2005, VA will reduce 38 U.S.C. chapter 34 entitlement proportionately based on the percentage rate (rounded to the nearest percentage) determined by dividing the amount of the training assistance paid for the month by the monthly educational assistance payable for full-time enrollment in an educational institution.

        (5) When a veteran or servicemember is pursuing a program of education by correspondence, VA will make a charge against entitlement for each payment made to him or her. The charge—

        (i) Will be made in months and decimal fractions of a month, and

        (ii) Will be determined by dividing the amount of the payment by an amount equal to the rate of educational assistance otherwise applicable to him or her for full-time training (disregarding in the case of a servicemember the cost of course comparison).

        (6) When a veteran or servicemember is pursuing a program of education partly in residence and partly by correspondence, VA will make a charge against entitlement—

        (i) For the residence portion of the program as provided in paragraphs (b) (1) and (2) of this section, and

        (ii) For the correspondence portion of the program as provided in paragraph (b)(5) of this section.

        (7) When a veteran or servicemember is paid an accelerated payment, VA will make a charge against entitlement for each accelerated payment made to him or her. The charge—

        (i) Will be made in months and decimal fractions of a month; and

        (ii) Will be determined by dividing the amount of the accelerated payment by an amount equal to the rate of basic educational assistance otherwise applicable to him or her for full-time institutional training. If the rate of basic educational assistance increases during the enrollment period, VA will charge entitlement for the periods covered by the initial rate and the increased rate, respectively.

        (8) If an individual is paid tutorial assistance as provided in § 21.7141, the following provisions will apply.

        (i) There will be no charge to entitlement for the first $600 of tutorial assistance paid to an individual under 38 U.S.C. ch. 30.

        (ii) VA will make a charge against the period of entitlement of one month for each amount of tutorial assistance paid under 38 U.S.C. ch. 30, to the individual in excess of $600 that is equal to the amount of monthly educational assistance the individual is otherwise eligible to receive for full-time pursuit of a residence course as provided in §§ 21.7136, 21.7137 and 21.7138, as appropriate. When the amount of tutorial assistance paid to the individual in excess of $600 is less than the amount of monthly educational assistance the individual is otherwise eligible to receive, the entitlement charge will be prorated.

        (9) When a veteran or servicemember is pursuing a program of education through flight training, VA will make a charge against entitlement for each payment made to him or her. The charge—

        (i) Will be made in months and decimal fractions of a month, and

        (ii) Will be determined by dividing the amount of the payment by an amount equal to the rate of basic educational assistance otherwise applicable to him or her for full-time institutional training.

        (10) When a servicemember receives tuition assistance top-up, VA will make a charge against his or her entitlement as established under § 21.7072 equal to the number of months and days determined by dividing the total amount paid by an amount equal to the servicemember's monthly rate of basic educational assistance as calculated under § 21.7136. VA will make a charge against his or her tuition assistance top-up entitlement as established under § 21.7075 by subtracting from that entitlement the total number of months and days in the term, quarter, or semester for which the servicemember received tuition assistance.

        (11) When a veteran or servicemember receives educational assistance for taking an approved licensing or certification test, VA will make a charge against his or her entitlement equal to the number of months and days determined by dividing the total amount paid by an amount equal to the servicemember's monthly rate of basic educational assistance as calculated under § 21.7136, excluding any additional “kicker” that may be paid under § 21.7136(g).

        (c)  VA will make a charge against entitlement for an overpayment only if the overpayment is discharged in bankruptcy; is waived, and is not recovered; or is compromised.

        (1) If the overpayment is discharged in bankruptcy or is waived and is not recovered, the charge against entitlement will be at the appropriate rate for the elapsed period covered by the overpayment (exclusive of interest, administrative costs of collection, court costs and marshal fees).

        (2) If the overpayment is compromised and the compromise offer is less than the amount of interest, administrative costs of collection, court costs and marshal fees, the charge against entitlement will be at the appropriate rate for the elapsed period covered by the overpayment (exclusive of interest, administrative costs of collection, court costs and marshal fees).

        (3) If the overpayment is compromised and the compromise offer is equal to or greater than the amount of interest, administrative costs of collection, court costs and marshal fees, the charge against entitlement will be determined by—

        (i) Subtracting the portion of the debt attributable to interest, administrative costs of collection, court costs and marshal fees from the compromise offer,

        (ii) Subtracting the amount determined in paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section from the amount of the original debt (exclusive of interest, administrative costs of collection, court costs and marshal fees),

        (iii) Dividing the result obtained in paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section by the amount of the original debt (exclusive of interest, administrative costs of collection, court costs and marshal fees), and

        (iv) Multiplying the percentage obtained in paragraph (c)(3)(iii) of this section by the amount of the entitlement which represents the whole overpaid period.

        (d)  A veteran may not interrupt a certified period of enrollment for the purpose of conserving entitlement. An educational institution may not certify a period of enrollment for a fractional part of the normal term, quarter or semester, if the veteran or servicemember is enrolled for the entire term, quarter or semester. VA will make a charge against entitlement for the entire period of certified enrollment, if the veteran or servicemember is otherwise eligible for educational assistance, except when educational assistance is interrupted under any of the following conditions:

        (1) Enrollment is terminated;

        (2) The veteran or servicemember cancels his or her enrollment, and does not negotiate an educational assistance check for any part of the certified period of enrollment;

        (3) The veteran or servicemember interrupts his or her enrollment at the end of any term, quarter or semester within the certified period of enrollment, and does not negotiate a check for educational assistance for the succeeding term, quarter or semester;

        (4) The veteran or servicemember requests interruption or cancellation for any break when a school was closed during a certified period of enrollment, and VA continued payments under an established policy based upon an Executive Order of the President or an emergency situation. Whether the veteran or servicemember negotiated a check for educational assistance for the certified period is immaterial.

        (e)  When the criteria described in this paragraph are met, VA will make no charges against entitlement as described in paragraph (b) of this section.

        (1) VA will make no charge against an individual's entitlement when the individual—

        (i) Either—

        (A) While not serving on active duty, had to discontinue pursuit of a course or courses as a result of being ordered, in connection with the Persian Gulf War, to serve on active duty under section 672 (a), (d), or (g), 673, 673b, or 688 of title 10, U.S. Code; or

        (B) While serving on active duty, had to discontinue pursuit of a course or courses as a result of being ordered, in connection with the Persian Gulf War, to a new duty location or assignment or to perform an increased amount of work.

        (ii) Failed to receive credit or lost training time toward completion of the individual's approved educational, professional or vocational objective as a result of having to discontinue his or her course pursuit.

        (2) The period for which receipt of educational assistance allowance is not charged against the entitlement of an individual described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section shall not exceed the portion of the period of enrollment in the course or courses for which the individual failed to receive credit or with respect to which the individual lost training time.

        (4) A stepchild, who meets VA's definition of child in § 3.57 of this chapter and is temporarily not living with the transferor, remains a member of the transferor's household if the actions and intentions of the stepchild and transferor establish that normal family ties have been maintained during the temporary absence.

        (d)  An individual approved by his or her service department to transfer entitlement may do so at any time after such approval up until the transferor's ending date of eligibility as determined under § 21.7050.

        (f)  (1) The maximum amount of entitlement a transferor may transfer is the lesser of—

        (i) Eighteen months of his or her entitlement; or

        (ii) The amount of entitlement he or she has available.

        (i) To one dependent; or

        (ii) Divided among his or her designated dependents in any manner he or she chooses.

        (g)  (1) A transferor may revoke any unused portion of transferred entitlement any time by submitting a written notice to both the Secretary of Veterans Affairs and the Secretary of the service department that initially approved the transferor to transfer entitlement. VA will accept a copy of the written notice addressed to the service department as sufficient written notification to VA.

        (2) The revocation will be effective the later of—

        (i) The date VA receives the notice of revocation; or

        (ii) The date the service department concerned receives the notice of revocation.

        (h)  (1) A transferor may modify the designations he or she made under paragraph (e) of this section at any time. Any modification made will apply only to any unused transferred entitlement. The transferor must submit a written notice to both the Secretary of Veterans Affairs and the Secretary of the service department that initially approved the transferor to transfer entitlement. VA will accept a copy of the written notice addressed to the service department as sufficient written notification to VA.

        (2) The modification will be effective the later of—

        (i) The date VA receives the notice of modification; or

        (ii) The date the service department concerned receives the notice of modification.

        (i)  VA will reduce the transferor's entitlement at the rate of 1 month of entitlement for each month of transferred entitlement used by the dependents.

        (j)  Children, who have attained age 18, and spouses may use transferred entitlement to pursue and complete the requirements of a secondary school diploma (or equivalency certificate).

        (k)  VA will apply the rules in § 21.7136 or § 21.7137 (and the rules in § 21.7138 when applicable) to determine the educational assistance rate that would apply to the transferor. VA will pay the dependent the monthly rate of educational assistance that would be payable to the transferor except that VA will—

        (1) Exclude the transferor's kicker for service in the Selected Reserve (§§ 21.7136(g) and 21.7137(e)) if the transferor is eligible for such kicker;

        (2) Include the dependent's Selected Reserve kicker, if the dependent is eligible for a kicker from the Selected Reserve based on the dependent's own Selected Reserve service; and

        (3) Disregard the fact that either the transferor or the dependent is on (or both are on) active duty and pay the veteran rate rather than the rate applicable to individuals on active duty.

        (l)  A dependent is not entitled to educational assistance for training pursued in an on-the-job training or apprenticeship program during periods the transferor is on active duty.

        (m)  (1) The dependents are not eligible for transferred entitlement if the transferor fails to complete the amount of active duty service he or she agreed to serve in the Armed Forces in order to participate in the transferability program, unless the transferor did not complete the active duty service due to—

        (i) His or her death;

        (ii) A service-connected disability;

        (iii) A medical condition which preexisted such service on active duty and which the Secretary of VA determines is not service-connected;

        (iv) A hardship; or

        (v) A physical or mental condition that was not characterized as a disability and did not result from the individual's own willful misconduct, but that did interfere with the individual's performance of duty, as determined by the Secretary of each service department.

        (2) VA will treat all payments of educational assistance to dependents as overpayments if the transferor does not complete the required service unless the transferor does not complete the required service due to one of the reasons stated in paragraphs (m)(1)(i) through (v) of this section.

        (n) Dependent is eligible for educational assistance under this section and is eligible for educational assistance under 38 U.S.C. chapter 30 based on his or her own active duty service. Dependents eligible for payment of educational assistance through transferred entitlement and who are eligible for payment under 38 U.S.C. chapter 30 based on their own active service—

        (1) May receive educational assistance payable under this section and educational assistance payable based on their own active duty service for the same course.

        (2) Are not subject to the 48 months limit on training provided for in § 21.4020 when combining transferred entitlement with their own entitlement earned under 38 U.S.C. chapter 30 as long as the only educational assistance paid is under 38 U.S.C. chapter 30. If the dependent is awarded educational assistance under another program listed in § 21.4020 (other than 38 U.S.C. chapter 30), the 48 months limit on training will apply.

        (d)  VA shall provide counseling as needed for the purposes identified in paragraphs (a) and (c) of this section upon request of the individual. In addition, VA shall provide counseling as needed for the purposes identified in paragraph (b) of this section following the veteran's request for counseling, the veteran's initial application for benefits or any communication from the veteran or guardian indicating that the veteran wishes to change his or her program. VA shall take appropriate steps (including individual notification where feasible) to acquaint all participants with the availability and advantages of counseling services.

        § 21.7112   Programs of education combining two or more types of courses.

#### § § 21.7112

        (a)  (1) When a veteran or servicemember cannot successfully schedule his or her complete program at one educational institution, VA may approve a program of concurrent enrollment. When requesting such a program, the veteran or servicemember must show that his or her complete program of education is not available at the educational institution in which he or she will pursue the major portion of his or her program (the primary educational institution), or that it cannot be scheduled successfully within the period in which he or she plans to complete his or her program. When the standards for measurement of the courses pursued concurrently in the two educational institutions are different, the concurrent enrollment shall be measured by converting the measurement of courses being pursued at the second educational institution under the standard applicable to such institution to its equivalent measurement under the standard required for full-time courses applicable to the primary educational institution. For a complete discussion of measurement of concurrent enrollments see § 21.7172 of this part.

        (2) The veteran or servicemember must submit the monthly certification of attendance and pursuit. Each educational institution where concurrent enrollment is approved must either endorse that certification, or submit a separate certification showing the veteran's or servicemember's enrollment and pursuit.

        (b)  In administering benefits payable under 38 U.S.C. chapter 30, the VA will apply the provisions of § 21.4233(e) of this part in the same manner as they are applied under 38 U.S.C. chapter 34.

        § 21.7120   Courses included in programs of education.

#### § § 21.7120

        (a)  Generally, VA will approve, and will authorize payment of educational assistance, for the individual's enrollment in any course or subject which a State approving agency has approved as provided in § 21.7220 of this part and which forms a part of a program of education as defined in § 21.7020(b)(23) of this part.

        (ii) Any music course, instrumental or vocal, public speaking course or courses in dancing, sports or athletics, such as horseback riding, swimming, fishing, skiing, golf, baseball, tennis, bowling, sports officiating, or other sport or athletic courses, except courses of applied music, physical education, or public speaking which are offered by institutions of higher learning for credit as an integral part of a program leading to an educational objective, or

        (iii) Any other type of course which VA determines to be avocational or recreational.

        (3) To overcome the presumption that a course is avocational or recreational in character, the veteran or servicemember must establish that the course will be of bona fide use in the pursuit of his or her present or contemplated business or occupation.

        (c)  (1) VA may pay educational assistance for an enrollment in a flight training course—

        (2) VA will not pay educational assistance for an enrollment in a flight training course which the veteran or servicemember is pursuing as ancillary training for a vocation other than aviation.

        (d)  (1) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, effective October 29, 1992, VA may pay educational assistance to a veteran or servicemember who is enrolled in a nonaccredited course or unit subject offered entirely or partly by independent study only if—

        (i) Successful completion of the nonaccredited course or unit subject is required in order for the veteran or servicemember to complete his or her program of education,

        (ii) On October 29, 1992, the veteran or servicemember was receiving educational assistance for pursuit of the program of education of which the nonaccredited independent study course or unit subject forms a part, and

        (iii) The veteran or servicemember has remained continuously enrolled in the program of education of which the nonaccredited independent study course or unit subject forms a part from October 29, 1992, to the date of enrollment by the veteran or servicemember in the nonaccredited independent study course or unit subject.

        (2) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (d)(1) of this section, VA may pay educational assistance to a veteran or servicemember for enrollment in a course or unit subject offered by independent study which, though part of an approved program of education, is not required in order for the veteran or servicemember to complete the program of education (, an elective) when—

        (i) The veteran or servicemember was enrolled in and receiving educational assistance for the course or unit subject on October 29, 1992, and

        (ii) The veteran or servicemember remains continuously enrolled in the course or unit subject.

#### § § 21.7122

        (a)  The provisions of this section which refer to a State approving agency will be deemed to refer to VA with respect to a State when that State does not have and fails or declines to create or designate a State approving agency; or fails to enter into an agreement as provided in § 21.4153 (see § 21.4150(c)). Except for payment of tuition assistance top-up, VA will not pay educational assistance for:

        (b)  VA will not pay educational assistance for an enrollment in any course that is not part of a program of education unless the veteran or servicemember is enrolled in:

        (1) A refresher course (including a course which will permit the veteran or servicemember to update knowledge and skills or be instructed in the technological advances which have occurred in the veteran's or servicemember's field of employment);

        (d)  Except as otherwise provided VA shall not approve an enrollment in any course for a veteran or servicemember, not already enrolled for any period during which more than 85 percent of the students enrolled in the course are having all or part of their tuition, fees or other charges paid for them by the educational institution or by VA pursuant to title 38, United States Code. This restriction may be waived in whole or in part. In determining which courses to apply this restriction to and whether to waive this restriction, VA will apply the provisions of § 21.4201 of this part to enrollments under 38 U.S.C. chapter 30 in the same manner as it does to enrollments under 38 U.S.C. chapter 34.

If the veteran shows good cause, the provisions of paragraph (e)(1)(ii)(B) of this section will apply.

        (2) If the veteran acquires a dependent after he or she enters or reenters a program of education, the increase will be effective on the latest of the following dates:

        (dd)  The discontinuance date of an award of educational assistance to a dependent, who exhausts the entitlement transferred to him or her is the date he or she exhausts the entitlement.

        (ee)  If the transferor revokes a transfer of entitlement, the dependent's date of discontinuance is the effective date of the revocation of transfer as determined under § 21.7080(g)(2).

        (ff)  VA will discontinue each award of educational assistance given to a dependent, effective the first date of each such award when—

        (1) The transferor fails to complete the additional active duty service requirement that afforded him or her the opportunity to transfer entitlement to educational assistance; and

The individual may choose to receive benefits under 38 U.S.C. chapter 33 at any time, but not more than once during a certified term, quarter, or semester.

        (c)  Payment of educational assistance is prohibited to an otherwise eligible veteran or servicemember—

        (1) For a unit course or courses which are being paid for entirely or partly by the Armed Forces during any period he or she is on active duty;

        (2) For a unit course or courses which are being paid for entirely or partly by the Department of Health and Human Services during any period that he or she is on active duty with the Public Health Service; or

        (3) For a unit course or courses which are being paid for entirely or partly by the United States under the Government Employees' Training Act.

      Pursuit of Courses

        § 21.7150   Pursuit.

#### § § 21.7150

        Except for a veteran or servicemember seeking tuition assistance top-up or reimbursement for taking an approved licensing or certification test, the veteran's or servicemember's educational assistance depends upon his or her pursuit of a program of education. Verification of this pursuit is accomplished by various certifications.

> [53 FR 1757, Jan. 22, 1988, as amended at 72 FR 16982, Apr. 5, 2007]

        § 21.7151   Advance payment and accelerated payment certifications.

#### § § 21.7151

        All certifications required by this paragraph shall be in a form and shall contain such information as specified by the Secretary.

        (a)  In order for a veteran or service member to receive an advance payment of educational assistance, the application or other document must be signed by the veteran or the enrollment certification must be signed by an authorized official of the educational institution.

        (b)  All verifications required by this paragraph shall be in a form and shall contain such information as specified by the Secretary.

        (1) For each individual receiving an advance payment an educational institution must—

        (i) Verify enrollment for the individual; and

        (ii) Verify the delivery of the advance payment check to the individual.

        (2) Once the educational institution has initially verified the enrollment of the individual, the individual, not the educational institution, must make subsequent verifications in order to release further payment for that enrollment as provided in § 21.7154(a) of this part.

        (c)  (1) A veteran or servicemember is eligible for an accelerated payment only if—

        (i) The veteran or servicemember submits a signed statement to the school or to VA that states “I request accelerated payment”;

        (ii) The veteran or servicemember is enrolled in a course or program of education or training beginning on or after October 1, 2002;

        (iii) The veteran is enrolled in an approved program as defined in § 21.4200 (aa);

        (iv) The charged tuition and fees for the term, quarter, or semester (or entire program for those programs not offered on a term, quarter or semester basis) divided by the number of months (and fractions thereof) in the enrollment period, exceeds the amount equal to 200 percent of the monthly rate of basic educational assistance allowance otherwise payable under § 21.7136 or § 21.7137, as applicable;

        (v) The veteran or servicemember requesting the accelerated payment has not received an advance payment under § 21.7140(a) for the same enrollment period; and

        (vi) The veteran or servicemember has submitted all certifications required under § 21.7154(d) for any previous accelerated payment he or she received.

        (2) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(5) of this section, VA will make the accelerated payment directly to the educational institution, in the veteran's or servicemember's name, for delivery to the veteran or servicemember if:

        (i) The educational institution submits the enrollment certification required under § 21.7152 before the actual start of the term, quarter or semester (or the start of the program for a program not offered on a term, quarter or semester basis); and

        (ii) The educational institution at which the veteran or servicemember is accepted or enrolled agrees to—

        (A) Provide for the safekeeping of the accelerated payment check before delivery to the veteran or servicemember;

        (B) Deliver the payment to the veteran or servicemember no earlier than the start of the term, quarter or semester (or the start of the program if the program is not offered on a term, quarter or semester basis);

        (C) Certify the enrollment of the veteran or servicemember and the amount of tuition and fees therefor; and

        (D) Certify the delivery of the accelerated payment to the veteran or servicemember.

        (3) VA will make accelerated payments directly to the veteran or servicemember if the enrollment certification required under § 21.7152 is submitted on or after the first day of the enrollment period. VA will electronically deposit the accelerated payment in the veteran's or servicemember's bank account unless—

        (i) The veteran or servicemember does not have a bank account; or

        (ii) The veteran or servicemember objects to payment by electronic funds transfer.

        (4) VA must make the accelerated payment no later than the last day of the month immediately following the month in which VA receives a certification from the educational institution regarding—

        (i) The veteran's or servicemember's enrollment in the program of education; and

        (ii) The amount of the charged tuition and fees for the term, quarter or semester (or for a program that is not offered on a term, quarter, or semester basis, the entire program).

        (5) The Director of the VA field station of jurisdiction may direct that accelerated payments not be made in advance of the first day of the enrollment period in the case of veterans or servicemembers attending an educational institution that demonstrates its inability to discharge its responsibilities for accelerated payments. In such a case, the accelerated payment will be made directly to the veteran or servicemember as provided in paragraph (a)(3).

        § 21.7152   Certification of enrollment.

#### § § 21.7152

        Except as stated in § 21.7140, the educational institution must certify the veteran's or servicemember's enrollment before he or she may receive educational assistance.

        (a)  VA does not, as a condition of payment of tuition assistance top-up or advance payment, require educational institutions to certify the enrollments of veterans or servicemembers who either are seeking tuition assistance top-up or, in the cases described in § 21.7151, are seeking an advance payment. VA does not require organizations or entities offering a licensing or certification test to certify the fact that the veteran or servicemember took the test. In all other cases the educational institution must certify the veteran's or servicemember's enrollment before he or she may receive educational assistance. This certification must be in a form specified by the Secretary and contain such information as the Secretary may specify.

        (b)  (1) Educational institutions organized on a term, quarter or semester basis generally shall report enrollment for the term, quarter, semester, ordinary school year or ordinary school year plus summer term. If the certification covers two or more terms, the educational institution will report the dates for the break between terms if a term ends and the following term does not begin in the same or the next calendar month or if the veteran elects not be paid for the intervals between terms. The educational institution must submit a separate enrollment certification for each term, quarter or semester when the certification is for—

        (i) A servicemember, or

        (ii) A veteran who—

        (A) Is training on a less than one-half time basis, or

        (B) Is incarcerated in a Federal, State or local prison or jail for conviction of a felony.

        (2) Educational institutions organized on a year-round basis will report enrollment for the length of the course. The certification will include a report of the dates during which the educational institution closes for any intervals designated in its approval data as breaks between school years.

        (3) When a veteran enrolls in independent study leading to a standard college degree, the educational institution's certification will include—

        (i) The enrollment date, and

        (ii) The ending date for the period being certified. If the educational institution has no prescribed maximum time for completion, the certification must include an ending date based on the educational institution's estimate for completion.

        § 21.7153   Progress and conduct.

#### § § 21.7153

        (a)  In order to receive educational assistance for pursuit of a program of education, an individual must maintain satisfactory progress. VA will discontinue educational assistance if the individual does not maintain satisfactory progress. Progress is unsatisfactory if the individual does not satisfactorily progress according to the regularly prescribed standards of the educational institution he or she is attending.

        (b)  In order to receive educational assistance for pursuit of a program of education, an individual must maintain satisfactory conduct according to the regularly prescribed standards and practices of the educational institution in which he or she is enrolled. If the individual will be no longer retained as a student or will not be readmitted as a student by the educational institution in which he or she is enrolled, VA will discontinue educational assistance, unless further development establishes that the educational institution's action is retaliatory.

        (c)  In order to receive educational assistance for pursuit of a program of education, an individual must maintain satisfactory attendance. VA will discontinue educational assistance if the individual does not maintain satisfactory attendance. Attendance is unsatisfactory if the individual does not attend according to the regularly prescribed standards of the educational institution in which he or she is enrolled.

        (d)  (1) An individual may be reentered following discontinuance because of unsatisfactory attendance, conduct or progress when either of the following sets of conditions exists:

        (i) The individual resumes enrollment at the same educational institution in the same program of education and the educational institution has both approved the individual's reenrollment and certified it to VA; or

        (ii) VA determines that—

        (A) The cause of the unsatisfactory attendance, conduct or progress has been removed, and

        (B) The program which the individual now proposes to pursue is suitable to his or her aptitudes, interests and abilities.

        (2) Reentrance may be for the same program, for a revised program, or for an entirely different program depending on the cause of the discontinuance and the removal of that cause.

        § 21.7154   Pursuit and absences.

#### § § 21.7154

        Except as provided in this section, an individual must submit a verification to VA each month of his or her enrollment during the period for which the individual is to be paid. This verification shall be in a form prescribed by the Secretary.

        (a)  An individual does not have to submit a monthly verification as described in the introductory text of this section when the individual—

        (1) Is enrolled in a correspondence course;

        (2) Has received a lump-sum payment for the training completed during a month; or

        (3) Has received an advance payment for the training completed during a month.

        (4) Has received an accelerated payment for the enrollment period.

        (b)  (1) The monthly verification for all veterans and servicemembers will include a report on the following items when applicable:

        (i) Continued enrollment in and actual pursuit of the course;

        (ii) The individual's unsatisfactory conduct, progress, or attendance;

        (iii) The date of interruption or termination of training;

        (iv) Changes in the number of credit hours or in the number of clock hours of attendance other than those described in § 21.7156(a);

        (v) Nonpunitive grades; and

        (vi) Any other changes or modifications in the course as certified at enrollment.

        (2) The verification of enrollment must—

        (i) Contain the information required for release of payment;

        (ii) If required or permitted by the Secretary to be submitted on paper, be signed by the veteran or servicemember on or after the final date of the reporting period, or if permitted by the Secretary to be submitted by telephone in a manner designated by the Secretary, be submitted in the form and manner prescribed by the Secretary on or after the final date of the reporting period; and

        (iii) If submitted on paper, clearly show the date on which it was signed.

        (c)  (1) When a veteran is pursuing an apprenticeship or other on-job training he or she must certify training monthly by reporting the number of hours worked.

        (2) The information provided by the veteran must be verified by the training establishment.

        (d)  (1) When an individual receives an accelerated payment as provided in § 21.7151(c) and (d), he or she must certify the following information within 60 days of the end of the term, quarter or semester (or entire program when the program is not offered on a term, quarter, or semester basis) for which the accelerated payment was made:

        (i) The course or program was successfully completed, or if the course was not completed—

        (A) The date the veteran or servicemember last attended; and

        (B) An explanation why the course was not completed;

        (ii) If the veteran or servicemember increased or decreased his or her training time—

        (A) The date the veteran or servicemember increased or decreased training time; and

        (B) The number of credit/clock hours pursued before and after each such change in training time; and

        (iii) The accelerated payment was received and used.

        (2) VA will establish an overpayment equal to the amount of the accelerated payment if the required certifications in paragraph (c)(1) of this section are not timely received.

        (3) VA will determine the amount of the overpayment of benefits for courses not completed in the following manner—

        (i) For a veteran or servicemember who does not complete the full course, courses, or program for which the accelerated payment was made, and who does not substantiate mitigating circumstances for not completing, VA will establish an overpayment equal to the amount of the accelerated payment.

        (ii) For a veteran or servicemember who does not complete the full course, courses, or program for which the accelerated payment was made, but who substantiates mitigating circumstances for not completing, VA will prorate the amount of the accelerated payment to which he or she is entitled based on the number of days from the beginning date of the enrollment period through the date of last attendance. VA will determine the prorated amount by dividing the accelerated payment amount by the number of days in the enrollment period, and multiplying the result by the number of days from the beginning date of the enrollment period through the date of last attendance. The result of this calculation will equal the amount the individual is due. The difference between the accelerated payment and the amount the individual is due will be established as an overpayment.

#### § § 21.7156

        (a)  (1) A veteran or servicemember enrolled full time in a program of education for a standard term, quarter, or semester must report without delay to VA:

        (i) A change in his or her credit hours or clock hours of attendance if that change would result in less than full-time enrollment;

        (ii) Any change in his or her pursuit that would result in less than full-time enrollment; and

        (iii) Any interruption or termination of his or her attendance.

        (2) A veteran or servicemember not described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section must report without delay to VA:

        (i) Any change in his or her credit hours or clock hours of attendance;

        (ii) Any change in his or her pursuit; and

        (iii) Any interruption or termination of his or her attendance.

        (b)  (1) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, an educational institution must report without delay to VA each time a veteran or servicemember:

        (i) Interrupts or terminates his or her training for any reason; or

        (ii) Changes his or her credit hours or clock hours of attendance.

        (2) An educational institution does not need to report a change in a veteran's or servicemember's hours of credit or attendance when:

        (i) The veteran or servicemember is enrolled full time in a program of education for a standard term, quarter, or semester before the change;

        (ii) The veteran or servicemember continues to be enrolled full time after the change; and

        (iii) The tuition and fees charged to the servicemember have not been adjusted as a result of the change.

        (3) If the change in status or change in number of credit hours or clock hours of attendance occurs on a day other than one indicated by paragraph (b)(4) or (b)(5) of this section, the educational institution will initiate a report of the change in time for VA to receive it within 30 days of the date on which the change occurs.

        (4) If the educational institution has certified the veteran's or servicemember's enrollment for more than one term, quarter or semester and the veteran or servicemember interrupts his or her training at the end of a term, quarter or semester within the certified enrollment period, the educational institution shall report the change in status to VA in time for VA to receive the report within 30 days of the last officially scheduled registration date for the next term, quarter or semester.

        (5) If the change in status or change in the number of hours of credit or attendance occurs during the 30 days of a drop-add period, the educational institution must report the change in status or change in the number of hours of credit or attendance to VA in time for VA to receive the report within 30 days from the last date of the drop-add period or 60 days from the first day of the enrollment period, whichever occurs first.

        (c)  (1) An educational institution may assign a nonpunitive grade for a course or subject in which the veteran or servicemember is enrolled even though the veteran or eligible person does not withdraw from the course or subject. When this occurs, the educational institution must report the assignment of the nonpunitive grade in a form prescribed by the Secretary in time for VA to receive it before the earlier of the following dates is reached:

        (i) Thirty days from the date on which the educational institution assigns the grade, or

        (ii) Sixty days from the last day of the enrollment period for which the nonpunitive grade is assigned.

        (2) If the veteran or servicemember is enrolled in a course which does not lead to a standard college degree and for which a monthly certification of attendance is required, the educational institution may use the monthly certification of attendance to report nonpunitive grades provided VA will receive the report within the time period stated in paragraph (c)(1) of this section.

        (d)  Nothing in this section or in any section in 38 CFR part 21 shall be construed as requiring any institution of higher learning to maintain daily attendance records for any course leading to a standard college degree.

        § 21.7172   Measurement of concurrent enrollments.

#### § § 21.7172

        (a)  Where a veteran enrolls concurrently in courses offered by two schools and the standards for the measurement of the courses pursued concurrently in the two schools are different, VA will measure the veteran's enrollment by converting the units of measurement for courses in the second school to their equivalent in units of measurement required for the courses in the program of education which the veteran is pursuing at the primary institution. This conversion will be accomplished as follows:

        (1) If VA measures the courses at the primary institution on a credit-hour basis (including a course which does not lead to a standard college degree, which is being measured on a credit-hour basis), and VA measures the courses at the second school on a clock-hour basis, the clock hours will be converted to credit hours.

        (2) If VA measures the courses pursued at the primary institution on a clock-hour basis, and VA measures the courses pursued at the second school on a credit-hour basis, VA will convert the credit hours to clock hours to determine the veteran's training time.

        (3) If VA measures the courses pursued at the primary institution on a clock-hour basis, and

        (i) VA measures the courses pursued at the second school on a mixed basis, the courses pursued at the second school which VA can measure on credit-hour basis for at least one program at the second school will be converted to clock hours and the resulting clock hours added to determine the veteran's training time; or

        (ii) VA measures the courses pursued at the second school on a credit-hour basis, VA will convert the credit hours to clock hours to determine the veteran's training time.

        (b)  If the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section require VA to convert clock hours to credit hours, it will do so by—

        (1) Dividing the number of credit hours which VA considers to be full-time at the educational institution whose courses are measured on a credit-hour basis by the number of clock hours which are full-time at the educational institution whose courses are measured on a clock-hour basis; and

        (2) Multiplying each clock hour of attendance by the decimal determined in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. VA will drop all fractional hours.

        (c)  If the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section require VA to convert credit hours to clock hours, it will do so by—

        (1) Dividing the number of clock hours which VA considers to be full-time at the educational institution whose courses are measured on a clock-hour basis by the number of credit hours which are full-time at the educational institution whose courses are measured on a credit-hour basis; and

        (2) Multiplying each credit hour by the number determined in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. VA will drop all fractional hours.

        (d)  If VA measures the courses pursued at both institutions on a credit hour basis or on a clock hour basis, VA will measure the veteran's enrollment by adding together the units of measurement for the courses at the second school and the units of measurement for the courses at the primary institution. The standard for full time will be the full-time standard for the courses at the primary institution.

VA will decide whether a reservist met those requirements before applying for educational assistance. If the reservist applies before completing the requirements, VA will disallow the application. A reservist's premature application will not prevent the reservist from establishing eligibility at a later time by applying for educational assistance again after having completed the academic requirements. The Armed Forces will decide whether a reservist has met all the other eligibility criteria needed in order to receive educational assistance pursuant to 10 U.S.C. chapter 1606. To be eligible a reservist:

        (1) Shall:

        (i) Enlist, reenlist, or extend an enlistment as a Reserve for service in the Selected Reserve so that the total period of obligated service is at least six years from the date of such enlistment, reenlistment, or extension; or

        (2) Must complete his or her initial period of active duty for training;

        (3) Must be participating satisfactorily in the Selected Reserve;

        (4) Must not have elected to have his or her service in the Selected Reserve credited toward establishing eligibility to benefits provided under 38 U.S.C. chapter 30; and

        (5) Must have met the requirements for a secondary school diploma (or an equivalency certificate) before applying for educational assistance.

        (b)  (1) A reservist shall be eligible to pursue all types of training described in subpart L of this part regardless of whether he or she has received a baccalaureate degree or equivalent evidence of completion of study if—

        (ii) The reservist meets the criteria of paragraphs (a)(2) through (a)(4) of this section; and

        (iii) The reservist does not have his or her eligibility limited as described in paragraph (c) of this section.

        (2) A reservist shall be eligible to pursue all types of training described in subpart L of this part except the training described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section if—

        (i) After June 30, 1985, but not after September 30, 1990, he or she takes one of the actions described in paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section;

        (ii) The reservist has not received a baccalaureate degree or the equivalent evidence of completion of study;

        (iii) The reservist meets all the other eligibility criteria of paragraph (a) of this section; and

        (iv) The reservist does not have his or her eligibility limited by paragraph (c) of this section.

        (3) The types of training which a reservist described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section may pursue, but which may not be pursued by a reservist described in paragraph (b)(2), are:

        (i) A course which is offered by an educational institution which is not an institution of higher learning (to determine if a nursing course is offered by an institution of higher learning, see § 21.7622(f));

        (ii) A correspondence course;

        (iii) An accredited independent study course leading to a standard college degree. (See § 21.7622(f) concerning enrollment in a nonaccredited independent study course after October 28, 1992);

        (iv) An accredited independent study course leading to a certificate that reflects educational attainment from an institution of higher learning. This provision applies to enrollment in an independent study course that begins on or after December 27, 2001. (See § 21.7622(f) concerning enrollment in a nonaccredited independent study course after October 28, 1992);

        (v) A refresher, remedial or deficiency course;

        (vi) A cooperative course;

        (vii) An apprenticeship or other on-job training; and

        (viii) A flight course.

        (c)  (1) An individual must elect in writing whether he or she wishes service in the Selected Reserve to be credited towards establishing eligibility under 38 U.S.C. chapter 30 or under 10 U.S.C. chapter 1606 when:

        (i) The individual is a reservist who is eligible for basic educational assistance provided under 38 U.S.C. 3012, and has established eligibility to that assistance partially through service in the Selected Reserve; or

        (2) An election under this paragraph (c) to have Selected Reserve service credited towards eligibility for payment of educational assistance under 38 U.S.C. chapter 30 or under 10 U.S.C. chapter 1606 is irrevocable when the reservist either negotiates the first check or receives the first payment by electronic funds transfer of the educational assistance elected.

        (3) If a reservist is eligible to receive educational assistance under both 38 U.S.C. chapter 30 and 10 U.S.C. chapter 1606, he or she may receive educational assistance alternately or consecutively under each of these chapters to the extent that the educational assistance is based on service not irrevocably credited to one or the other chapter as provided in paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section.

        (d)  An individual who has established eligibility for basic educational assistance under 38 U.S.C. chapter 30 solely through service on active duty may establish eligibility for educational assistance under 10 U.S.C. chapter 1606 by meeting the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section.

        (c)  (1) If a reservist is enrolled in an educational institution regularly operated on the quarter or semester system, and the reservist's period of eligibility as defined in paragraph (a) of this section would expire during a quarter or semester, the period of eligibility shall be extended to the end of the quarter or semester.

        (2) If a reservist is enrolled in an educational institution not regularly operated on the quarter or semester system, and the reservist's period of eligibility as defined in paragraph (a) of this section would expire after a major portion of the course is completed, the period of eligibility shall be extended until the earlier of the following occurs:

        (3) The provisions of paragraphs (e)(1) and (e)(2) of this section do not apply if the reservist ceases to be a member of the Selected Reserve under adverse conditions, as characterized by the Secretary of the military department concerned.

        § 21.7551   Extended period of eligibility.

#### § § 21.7551

        (a)  VA shall grant an extension of a delimiting period determined by § 21.7550(a) of this part provided:

        (1) The individual applies for an extension within the time period specified in § 21.1033(c) of subpart B.

        (2) The individual was prevented from initiating or completing the chosen program of education within the otherwise applicable eligibility period, because of a physical or mental disability, which is not the result of the reservist's own willful misconduct, and which was incurred in or aggravated by service in the Selected Reserve. VA will not consider the disabling effects of chronic alcoholism to be the result of willful misconduct. (See § 21.7520(b)(29)). Evidence must establish that such a program of education was medically infeasible. VA will not grant a reservist an extension for a period of disability which was 30 days or less unless the evidence establishes that the reservist was prevented from enrolling or reenrolling in the chosen program, or was forced to discontinue attendance, because of the short disability.

        (b)  The reservist shall elect the commencing date of an extended period of eligibility. The date chosen—

        (1) Must be on or after the original date of expiration of eligibility as determined by § 21.7550(a) of this part, and

        (2) Must either be—

        (i) On or before the 90th day following the date on which the reservist's application for an extension was approved by VA if the reservist is training during the extended period of eligibility in a course not organized on a term, quarter or semester basis, or

        (ii) On or before the first day of a term, quarter or semester within an ordinary school year following the 90th day after the reservist's application for an extension was approved in VA, if the reservist is training during the extended period of eligibility in a course organized on a term, quarter or semester basis.

        (c)  A reservist's extended period of eligibility shall be for the length of time that the reservist was prevented from initiating or completing his or her chosen program of education, except that it must end when the reservist is separated from the Selected Reserve. VA shall determine the length of time the reservist was prevented from initiating or completing his or her chosen program of education as follows:

        (1) If the reservist is in training in a course organized on a term, quarter or semester basis, his or her extended period of eligibility shall contain the same number of days as the number of days from the date during the reservist's original eligibility period that his or her training became medically infeasible to the earliest of the following dates:

        (i) The commencing date of the ordinary term, quarter or semester following the day the reservist's training became medically infeasible,

        (ii) The last date of the reservist's delimiting date as determined by § 21.7550(a) of this part, or

        (iii) The date the reservist resumed training.

        (2) If the reservist is training in a course not organized on a term, quarter or semester basis, his or her extended period of eligibility shall contain the same number of days as the number of days from the date during the reservist's original delimiting period that his or her training became medically infeasible to the earlier of the following dates:

        (i) The date the reservist's training became medically feasible, or

        (ii) The reservist's delimiting date as determined by § 21.7550(a)(1) of this part.

      Entitlement

        § 21.7570   Entitlement.

#### § § 21.7570

        Except as provided in § 21.7576(e) each reservist is entitled to a maximum of 36 months of educational assistance (or its equivalent in part-time educational assistance) under this program, but is also subject to the provisions of § 21.4020 (a) and (b).

> [58 FR 51783, Oct. 5, 1993]

        § 21.7576   Entitlement charges.

#### § § 21.7576

        (a)  VA will make charges against entitlement as stated in this section. Charges are based upon the principle that a reservist who trains full time for one day should be charged one day of entitlement, except for those pursuing:

        (1) Flight training;

        (2) Correspondence training;

        (3) Cooperative training; or

        (4) Apprenticeship or other on-job training.

        (b)  This paragraph states how VA will generally determine the charge against the entitlement of a reservist who is receiving educational assistance. However, when the circumstances described in paragraph (e) of this section apply to a reservist, VA will use that paragraph to determine an entitlement charge instead of this paragraph.

        (1) Except for those pursuing flight training, correspondence training, cooperative training, apprenticeship or other on-job training, VA will make a charge against entitlement—

        (i) On the basis of total elapsed time (one day for each day of pursuit for which the reservist is paid educational assistance) if the reservist is pursuing the program of education on a full-time basis; or

        (ii) On the basis of a proportionate rate of elapsed time, if the reservist is pursuing the program of education on a three-quarter, one-half, or one-quarter-time basis.

        (2) VA will compute elapsed time from the commencing date of the award of educational assistance to the date of discontinuance. If the reservist changes his or her training time after the commencing date of the award, VA will—

        (i) Divide the enrollment period into separate periods of time during which the reservist's training time remains constant; and

        (ii) Compute the elapsed time separately for each time period.

        (3) For each month that a reservist is paid a monthly educational assistance allowance while undergoing apprenticeship or other on-job training, VA will make a charge against entitlement of—

        (i) .75 of a month in the case of payments made during the first six months of the reservist's pursuit of the program of apprenticeship or other on-job training;

        (ii) .55 of a month in the case of payments made during the second six months of the reservist's pursuit of the program of apprenticeship or other on-job training; and

        (iii) .35 of a month in the case of payments made following the first twelve months of the reservist's pursuit of the program of apprenticeship or other on-job training.

        (4) When a reservist is pursuing a program of education by correspondence, VA will make a charge against entitlement for each payment made to him or her. The charge will be made in months and decimal fractions of a month, as determined by dividing the amount of the payment by an amount equal to the rate stated in § 21.7636(a)(1) as the rate otherwise applicable to the reservist for full-time training.

        (5) When a reservist is pursuing a program of education partly in residence and partly by correspondence, VA will make a charge against entitlement—

        (i) For the residence portion of the program as provided in paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section; and

        (ii) For the correspondence portion of the program as provided in paragraph (b)(4) of this section.

        (6) When a reservist is pursuing a program of education through cooperative training, VA will make a charge against entitlement of .8 of a month for each month in which the reservist is receiving payment at the rate for cooperative training. If the reservist is pursuing cooperative training for a portion of a month, VA will make a charge against entitlement on the basis of total elapsed time (.8 of a day for each day of pursuit).

        (7) When a reservist is pursuing a program of education through flight training, VA will make a charge against entitlement at the rate of one month for each amount equal to the monthly rate stated in § 21.7636(a)(1) as applicable for the month in which the training occurred.

        (c)  VA will make a charge against entitlement for an overpayment only if the overpayment is discharged in bankruptcy; is waived and is not recovered; or is compromised.

        (1) If the overpayment is discharged in bankruptcy or is waived and is not recovered, the charge against entitlement will be at the appropriate rate for the elapsed period covered by the overpayment (exclusive of interest, administrative costs of collection, court costs and marshal fees).

        (2) If the overpayment is compromised and the compromise offer is less than the amount of interest, administrative costs of collection, court costs and marshal fees, the charge against entitlement will be at the appropriate rate for the elapsed period covered by the overpayment (exclusive of interest, administrative costs of collection, court costs and marshal fees).

        (3) If the overpayment is compromised and the compromise offer is equal to or greater than the amount of interest administrative costs of collection, court costs and marshal fees, the charge against entitlement will be determined by—

        (i) Subtracting from the sum paid in the compromise offer the amount attributable to interest, administrative costs of collection, court costs and marshal fees,

        (ii) Subtracting the remaining amount of the overpayment balance determined in paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section from the amount of the original overpayment (exclusive of interest, administrative costs of collection, court costs and marshal fees),

        (iii) Dividing the result obtained in paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section by the amount of the original overpayment (exclusive of interest, administrative costs of collection, court costs and marshal fees), and

        (iv) Multiplying the percentage obtained in paragraph (c)(3)(iii) of this section by the amount of the entitlement otherwise chargeable for the period of the original overpayment.

        (d)  A reservist may not interrupt a certified period of enrollment for the purpose of conserving entitlement. An institution of higher learning may not certify a period of enrollment for a fractional part of the normal term, quarter or semester if the reservist is enrolled for the entire term, quarter or semester. VA will make a charge for the entire period of certified enrollment, if the reservist is otherwise eligible for educational assistance, except when educational assistance is interrupted under any of the following conditions:

        (1) Enrollment is terminated;

        (2) The reservist cancels his or her enrollment, and does not negotiate an educational assistance check for any part of the certified period of enrollment;

        (3) The reservist interrupts his or her enrollment at the end of any term, quarter or semester within the certified period of enrollment, and does not negotiate a check for educational assistance for the succeeding term, quarter or semester; and

        (4) The reservist requests interruption or cancellation for any break when an institution of higher learning was closed during a certified period of enrollment, and VA continued payments under an established policy based upon an Executive Order of the President or an emergency situation. In such a case entitlement will be restored unless the reservist negotiated a check for educational assistance for the certified period and does not repay the amount received.

        (e)  When the criteria described in this paragraph are met, there is an exception to the charges against entitlement described in paragraph (b) of this section.

        (1) VA will make no charge against a reservist's entitlement when the reservist—

        (i) While not serving on active duty, had to discontinue pursuit of a course or courses as a result of being ordered to serve on active duty under sections 12301(a),(d),(g), 12302, or 12304 of title 10, U. S. Code; and

        (ii) Failed to receive credit or lost training time toward completion of the reservist's approved educational, professional or vocational objective as a result of having to discontinue his or her course pursuit.

        (2) The period for which receipt of educational assistance allowance is not charged against a reservist's entitlement shall not exceed the portion of the period of enrollment in the course or courses for which the reservist failed to receive credit or with respect to which the reservist lost training time.

#### § § 21.7610

        (a)  An individual must be pursuing an approved program of education in order to receive educational assistance.

        (b)  VA will approve a program of education selected by a reservist for payment of educational assistance under 10 U.S.C. chapter 1606 if—

        (1) The program accords with the definition of a program of education found in § 21.7520(b)(17) of this part,

        (2) It has an educational, professional or vocational objective (as defined in § 21.7520(b)(7) and (28) of this part), and

        (3) The courses and subjects in the program are approved for VA purposes as provided in § 21.7720 of this part.

        (4) The reservist is not already qualified for the objective of the program.

        § 21.7612   Programs of education combining two or more types of courses.

#### § § 21.7612

        An approved program may consist of courses offered by two educational institutions concurrently, or courses offered through class attendance and by television concurrently. An educational institution may contract the actual training to another educational institution, provided the course is approved by the State approving agency having approval jurisdiction over the educational institution actually providing the training.

        (a)  When a reservist cannot schedule his or her complete program at one educational institution, VA may approve a program of concurrent enrollment. When requesting such a program, the reservist must show that his or her complete program of education is not available at the educational institution in which he or she will pursue the major portion of his or her program (the primary educational institution), or that it cannot be scheduled within the period in which he or she plans to complete his or her program. A reservist who is limited in the types of courses he or she may pursue, as provided in § 21.7540 (b)(2) and (b)(3), may pursue courses only at an institution of higher learning. If such a reservist cannot complete his or her program at one institution of higher learning, VA may approve a concurrent enrollment only if both the educational institutions the reservist enrolls in are institutions of higher learning.

        (b)  In determining whether a reservist may pursue all or part of a program of education by television, VA will apply the provisions of § 21.4233(c).

        (2) Only a reservist who meets the requirements of § 21.7540(b)(1) may be paid educational assistance for an enrollment in an independent study course or unit subject without a simultaneous enrollment in a course or unit subject offered by resident training. The independent study course or unit subject must be accredited and lead to a standard college degree. Beginning with enrollments on or after December 27, 2001, a reservist may receive educational assistance for an independent study course that leads to a certificate.

        (B) Has remained continuously enrolled in the program of education of which the nonaccredited independent study course or unit subject forms a part from October 29, 1992, to the date the reservist enrolls in the nonaccredited independent study course or unit subject; or

        (ii)(A) Was enrolled in and receiving educational assistance for the nonaccredited independent study course or unit subject on October 29, 1992; and

        (B) Remains continuously enrolled in that course or unit subject.

        (4) Whether or not the reservist is enrolled will be determined by the regularly prescribed standards and practices of the educational institution offering the course or unit subject.

        (d)  VA will pay educational assistance for an enrollment in a course or subject leading to a graduate degree or certificate when the training occurs after November 29, 1993.

        (c)  VA will not pay educational assistance for an enrollment in any courses offered at an educational institution that uses advertising, sales, or enrollment practices that are erroneous, deceptive, or misleading by actual statement, omission, or intimation. VA will apply the provisions of § 21.4252(h) in making these decisions with regard to enrollments under 10 U.S.C. chapter 1606.

        (d)  (1) VA will not pay educational assistance for an enrollment in any course—

        (i) Which is avocational or recreational in character, or

        (ii) The advertising for which contains significant avocational or recreational themes.

        (2) VA presumes that the following courses are avocational or recreational in character unless the reservist justifies their pursuit to VA as provided in paragraph (3) of this section. The courses are:

        (i) Any photography course or entertainment course; or

        (ii) Any music course, instrumental or vocal, public speaking course, or course in dancing, sports or athletics, such as horseback riding, swimming, fishing, skiing, golf, baseball, tennis, bowling, sports officiating, or other sport or athletic courses, except courses of applied music, physical education, or public speaking which are offered by institutions of higher learning for credit as an integral part of a program leading to an educational objective; or

        (iii) Any other type of course which VA determines to be avocational or recreational.

        (3) To overcome a presumption that a course is avocational or recreational in character, the reservist must establish that the course will be of bona fide use in the pursuit of his or her present or contemplated business or occupation.

        (2) VA will not consider the hospital or field work phase of a nursing course, including a course leading to a degree in nursing, to be provided by an institution of higher learning unless—

        (i) The hospital or fieldwork phase is an integral part of the course;

        (ii) Completion of the hospital or fieldwork phase of the course is a prerequisite to the successful completion of the course;

        (iii) The student remains enrolled in the institution of higher learning during the hospital or fieldwork phase of the course; and

        (iv) The training is under the direction and supervision of the institution of higher learning.

Such a reservist may receive educational assistance while pursuing a course or courses leading to a graduate degree or graduate certificate (subject to the restrictions in § 21.7620(d)). Equivalent evidence of completion of study may include, but is not limited to, a copy of the reservist's transcript showing that he or she has received passing grades in all courses needed to obtain a baccalaureate degree at the institution of higher learning which he or she has been attending.

        (2) The date on which the reservist's progress becomes unsatisfactory according to the educational institution's regularly established standards of progress.

        (i)  If educational assistance is paid as the result of false or misleading statements, see § 21.7658 of this part.

        (j)  If an institution of higher learning and VA have conflicting interests as provided in § 21.4005 and § 21.7805 of this part, and VA does not grant the waiver, the date of discontinuance shall be 30 days after the date of the letter notifying the reservist.

        (k)  (1) The provisions of this paragraph apply to a reservist whose educational assistance must be discontinued or who becomes restricted to payment of educational assistance at a reduced rate under § 21.7639(d) of this part.

        (2) The reduced rate or discontinuance will be effective the latest of the following dates:

        (i) The first day on which all or part of the reservist's tuition and fees were paid by a Federal, State or local program,

        (m)  If the reservist's eligibility period ends while the reservist is receiving educational assistance, the date of discontinuance shall be the date on which eligibility ends as determined by § 21.7550 and § 21.7551 of this part.

        (n)  (1) If VA does not timely receive a required certification of attendance for a reservist enrolled in a course not leading to a standard college degree, VA will terminate payments effective the last date of the last period for which a certification of the reservist's attendance was received. If VA later receives the certification, VA will make any adjustment on the basis of facts found.

        (2) In the case of an advance payment, if VA does not receive verification of enrollment and certificate of delivery of the check within 60 days of the first day of the term, quarter, semester, or course for which the advance payment was made, VA will determine the actual facts and make an adjustment, if required. If the reservist failed to enroll, termination will be effective the beginning date of the enrollment period.

        (2) When an administrative error or error in judgment by VA, the Department of Defense, or the Department of Transportation is the sole cause of an erroneous award, the award will be reduced or terminated effective the date of last payment.

        (r)  If a reservist who is limited in the types of courses he or she may pursue, as provided in § 21.7540 (b)(2) and (b)(3), completes a course of instruction required for the award of a baccalaureate degree or the equivalent evidence of completion of study (see § 21.7622(f)), VA will discontinue educational assistance effective the day after the date upon which the required course of instruction was completed.

        (s)  If a reservist must forfeit his or her educational assistance due to fraud, the date of discontinuance of payment of educational assistance will be the later of—

        (1) The effective date of the award, or

        (v)  If the reservist is enrolled in a course offered in whole or in part by independent study, and the course loses its accreditation (or the educational institution offering the course loses its accreditation), the date of reduction or discontinuance will be the effective date of the withdrawal of accreditation by the accrediting agency, unless the provisions of § 21.7620 (c)(3) or (c)(4) apply.

        (w) [Reserved]

        (x)  If a reservist is entitled to an increase (“kicker”) in the monthly rate of basic educational assistance as provided in § 21.7636(b) and loses that entitlement, the effective date for the reduction in the monthly rate payable is the date, as determined by the Secretary of the military department concerned, that the reservist is no longer entitled to the increase (“kicker”).

        (y)  VA shall terminate educational assistance effective the first date for which the reservist received educational assistance when—

        (1) The service that formed a basis for establishing eligibility for educational assistance under 10 U.S.C. chapter 1606 included a period of active duty as described in § 21.7020(b)(1)(iv); and

#### § § 21.7636

        (a)  VA will publish the monthly rates of basic educational assistance payable under this section on the GI Bill education and training website each time there is an increase in the rates.

        (1)  Except as otherwise provided in this section or in § 21.7639, the monthly rate of basic educational assistance payable to a reservist pursuing institutional training will be the applicable rate provided in 10 U.S.C. 16131(b)(1), as increased each fiscal year in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 16131(b)(2). The rate of pursuit will be determined in accordance with § 21.4270.

        (2)  (i) The monthly rate of basic educational assistance payable to a reservist pursuing apprenticeship or other on-the-job training will be a percentage of the full-time rate determined in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. In accordance with 10 U.S.C. 16131(d)(1), VA will determine the monthly rate payable by multiplying the full-time monthly rate payable to the reservist by the applicable percentage based on the reservist's training period as follows:

        (ii) Full-time training will consist of the number of hours which constitute the standard workweek of the training establishment, but not less than 30 hours unless a lesser number of hours is established as the standard workweek for the particular establishment through bona fide collective bargaining between employers and employees.

        (3)  The monthly rate of basic educational assistance payable to a reservist pursuing cooperative training will be equal to the applicable full-time monthly rate determined in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.

        (b)  (1) The Secretary of the military department concerned may increase the amount of educational assistance stated in paragraph (a) of this section that is payable to a reservist who has a skill or specialty in which there is a critical shortage of personnel or for which it is difficult to recruit, or, in the case of critical units, retain personnel.

        (2) The Secretary of the military department concerned—

        (i) Will set the amount of the increase (“kicker”) for full-time training, but the increase (“kicker”) may not exceed $350 per month; and

        (ii) May set the amount of the increase (“kicker”) payable, for a reservist pursuing a program of education less than full time or pursuing an apprenticeship or other on-job training, at an amount less than the amount described in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section.

        (c)  VA may withhold final payment until VA receives proof of the reservist's enrollment and adjusts the reservist's account.

        § 21.7639   Conditions which result in reduced rates or no payment.

#### § § 21.7639

        The payment of educational assistance at the monthly rates established in § 21.7636 shall be subject to reduction, whenever the circumstances described in this section arise.

        (a)  (1) Withdrawal from a course or receipt of a nonpunitive grade affects payments to a reservist. VA will not pay benefits to a reservist for pursuit of a course from which the reservist withdraws or receives a nonpunitive grade which is not used in computing requirements for graduation unless the provisions of this paragraph are met.

        (i) The reservist withdraws because he or she is ordered to active duty; or

        (ii) Both of the following exist.

        (A) There are mitigating circumstances, and

        (B) The reservist submits a description of the circumstances in writing to VA either within one year from the date VA notifies the reservist that he or she must submit the mitigating circumstances, or at a later date if the reservist is able to show good cause why the one-year time limit should be extended to the date on which he or she submitted the description of the mitigating circumstances.

        (2) If VA considers that mitigating circumstances exist because the reservist withdrew during a drop-add period or because the withdrawal constitutes the first withdrawal of no more than six credits after May 31, 1989, the reservist is not subject to the reporting requirement found in paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(B) of this section.

        (b)  VA will pay no educational assistance to reservists who are incarcerated and who are training less than one-half time. In addition, VA will pay no educational assistance to a reservist who—

        (1) Is incarcerated in Federal, State or local penal institution for conviction of a felony, and

        (2) Is enrolled in a course—

        (i) For which there are no tuition and fees, or

        (ii) For which tuition and fees are being paid by a Federal program (other than one administered by VA) or by a State or local program, and

        (3) Is incurring no charge for the books, supplies and equipment necessary for the course.

        (c)  (1) VA will pay reduced educational assistance to a reservist who—

        (i) Is incarcerated in a Federal, State or local penal institution for conviction of a felony, and

        (ii) Is enrolled in a course—

        (A) For which the reservist pays some (but not all) of the charges for tuition and fees, or

        (B) For which a Federal program (other than one administered by VA) or a State or local program pays all the charges for tuition and fees, but for which the reservist must pay for books, supplies and equipment.

        (2) The monthly rate of educational assistance payable to such a reservist is the lesser of the following:

        (i) The monthly rate of the portion of tuition and fees that are not paid by a Federal program (other than one administered by VA) or a State or local program plus the monthly rate of any charges to the reservist for the cost of necessary supplies, books and equipment, or

        (ii) The monthly rate as stated in § 21.7636(a) and any increase payable under § 21.7636(b).

        (3) In determining the monthly rate stated in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this paragraph, VA will—

        (i) Add the portion of tuition and fees that are not paid by a Federal program (other than one administered by VA) for the reservist's enrollment period to the total cost to the reservist for the cost of necessary supplies, books and equipment, and

        (ii) Divide the figure obtained in paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this paragraph by the number of months and fractions of a month in the reservist's enrollment period.

        (d)(1) A reservist pursuing only independent study and whose enrollment begins after June 30, 1993, shall be paid educational assistance on the basis of his or her training time.

        (2) No payments may be made to a reservist who is limited in the types of courses he or she may pursue, as provided in § 21.7540(b)(2) and (b)(3), and who is pursuing independent study unless he or she is concurrently pursuing one or more courses offered through resident training at an institution of higher learning.

        (e)  A reservist who is pursuing a correspondence course or the correspondence portion of a correspondence-residence course shall be paid 55 percent of the established charge which the educational institution requires nonreservists to pay for the lessons—

        (1) Which the reservist has completed;

        (2) Which the educational institution has serviced; and

        (3) For which payment is due.

        (f)  (1) For any calendar month in which a reservist pursuing an apprenticeship or other on-job training program fails to complete 120 hours of training, VA will reduce proportionally—

        (i) The rates specified in § 21.7636(a)(2); and

        (ii) Any increase set by the Secretary of the military department concerned as described in § 21.7636(b).

        (2) In making the computations required by paragraph (f)(1) of this section, VA will round the number of hours worked to the nearest multiple of eight.

        (3) For the purpose of this paragraph, hours worked include only—

        (i) The training hours the reservist worked; and

        (ii) All hours of the reservist's related training which occurred during the standard workweek and for which the reservist received wages. (See § 21.7636(a)(2)(ii) as to the requirements for full-time training.)

        (g)  A reservist who is pursuing a flight training course shall be paid 60 percent of the established charge for tuition and fees (other than tuition and fees charged for or attributable to solo flying hours) which the flight school requires similarly circumstanced nonreservists enrolled in the same course to pay.

        (h)  A reservist may not receive educational assistance for any period for which he or she receives financial assistance under 10 U.S.C. 2107 as a member of the Senior Reserve Officers' Training Corps.

        (i)  A reservist who is limited in the types of courses he or she may pursue, as described in § 21.7540(b)(2) and (b)(3), may not receive educational assistance for instruction in a program of education unless it is offered at an institution of higher learning. The instruction must lead to an identifiable educational, professional, or vocational objective, but does not have to lead to a standard college degree.

        (a)  The certification of entrance or reentrance must clearly specify:

        (1) The course;

        (2) The starting and ending dates of the enrollment period;

        (3) The credit hours or clock hours being pursued by the reservist;

        (4) The amount of tuition, fees and the cost of books, supplies and equipment charged to a reservist who is incarcerated in a Federal, State or local prison or jail for conviction of a felony; and

        (5) Such other information as the Secretary may find is necessary to determine the reservist's monthly rate of educational assistance.

        (b)  (1) Educational institutions organized on a term, quarter or semester basis generally shall report enrollment for the term, quarter, semester, ordinary school year or ordinary school year plus summer term. If the certification covers two or more terms, the educational institution will report the dates for the break between terms if a term ends and the following term does not begin in the same or the next calendar month, or if the reservist elects not to be paid for the intervals between terms. The educational institution must submit a separate enrollment certification for each term, quarter or semester when the certification is for a reservist who is incarcerated in a Federal, State or local prison or jail for conviction of a felony.

        (2) Educational institutions organized on a year-round basis will report enrollment for the length of the course. The certification will include a report of the dates during which the educational institution closes for any interval designated in its approval data as breaks between school years.

        (3) When a reservist enrolls in independent study leading to a standard college degree concurrently with resident training, the educational institution's certification will include—

        (i) The enrollment date, and

        (ii) The ending date for the period being certified. If the educational institution has not prescribed maximum time for completion of the independent study portion of the enrollment, the certification must include an ending date for the independent study based on the educational institution's estimate for completion.

        (c)  (1) A reservist who is pursuing a course leading to a standard college degree must have his or her continued enrollment in and pursuit of the course verified for the entire enrollment period. Verification of continued enrollment will be made at least once a year and in the last month of enrollment if the enrollment period ends more than 3 months after the last verification. In the case of a reservist who completed, interrupted or terminated his or her course, any communication from the reservist or other authorized person notifying the VA of the reservist's completion of a course as scheduled or an earlier termination date, will be accepted to terminate payments accordingly.

        (2) The verification of pursuit will also include a report on the following items when applicable:

        (i) Continued enrollment in and pursuit of the course,

        (ii) Conduct and progress (See § 21.7653(c)),

        (iii) Date of interruption or termination of training (See § 21.7656(a)),

        (iv) Changes in number of credit hours or clock hours of attendance (See § 21.7656(a)), and

        (v) Any other changes or modifications in the course as certified at enrollment.

        § 21.7653   Progress, conduct, and attendance.

#### § § 21.7653

        (a)  In order to receive educational assistance for pursuit of a program of education, a reservist must maintain satisfactory progress. Progress is unsatisfactory if the reservist does not satisfactorily progress according to the regulatory prescribed standards of the educational institution he or she is attending.

        (b)  In order to receive educational assistance for pursuit of a program of education, a reservist must maintain satisfactory conduct according to the regularly prescribed standards and practices of the educational institution in which he or she is enrolled. If the reservist will no longer be retained as a student or will not be readmitted as a student by the educational institution in which he or she is enrolled, the VA will discontinue educational assistance, unless further development establishes that the educational institution's action is retaliatory.

        (c)  In order to receive educational assistance for pursuit of a program of education, a reservist must maintain satisfactory course attendance. VA will discontinue educational assistance if the reservist does not maintain satisfactory course attendance. Attendance is unsatisfactory if the reservist does not attend according to the regularly prescribed standards of the educational institution in which he or she is enrolled.

        (d)  At times the unsatisfactory progress, conduct, or course attendance of a reservist is caused by or results in his or her interruption or termination of training. If this occurs, the interruption or termination shall be reported in accordance with § 21.7656(a). If the reservist continues in training despite making unsatisfactory progress, the fact of his or her unsatisfactory progress must be reported to VA within the time allowed by paragraphs (d)(1), (d)(2), and (d)(3) of this section.

        (1) A reservist's progress may become unsatisfactory as a result of the grades he or she receives. The educational institution shall report such unsatisfactory progress to VA in time for VA to receive it before the earlier of the following dates is reached:

        (i) Thirty days from the date on which the school official who is responsible for determining whether a student is making progress first receives the final grade report which establishes that the reservist is not progressing satisfactorily; or

        (ii) Sixty days from the last day of the enrollment period during which the reservist earned the grades that caused him or her to meet the unsatisfactory progress standards.

        (2) If the unsatisfactory progress of the reservist is caused solely by any factors other than the grades which he or she receives, the educational institution shall report the unsatisfactory progress in time for VA to receive it within 30 days of the date on which the progress of the reservist becomes unsatisfactory.

        (3) The educational institution shall report the unsatisfactory conduct or attendance of the reservist to VA in time for VA to receive it within 30 days of the date on which the conduct or attendance of the reservist becomes unsatisfactory.

        (e)  In order for a reservist to receive educational assistance following discontinuance for unsatisfactory progress, conduct, or attendance, the provisions of this paragraph must be met.

        (1) The reservist's subsequent reentrance into a program of education may be for the same program, for a revised program, or for an entirely different program, depending on the cause of the discontinuance and removal of that cause.

        (2) A reservist may reenter following discontinuance because of unsatisfactory attendance, conduct, or progress when either of the following sets of conditions exists:

        (i) The reservist resumes enrollment at the same educational institution in the same program of education and the educational institution has both approved the reservist's reenrollment and certified it to VA; or

        (ii) In all other cases, VA determines that—

        (A) The cause of the unsatisfactory attendance, conduct, or progress in the previous program has been removed and is not likely to recur; and

        (B) The program which the reservist now proposes to pursue is suitable to his or her aptitudes, interests, and abilities.

#### § § 21.7654

        Except as provided in this section, a reservist must submit a verification to VA each month of his or her enrollment during the period for which the reservist is to be paid. This verification shall be in a form prescribed by the Secretary.

        (a)  A reservist does not have to submit a monthly verification as described in the introductory text of this section when the reservist—

        (1) Is enrolled in a correspondence course; or

        (2) Has received an advance payment for the training completed during a month.

        (b)  (1) The monthly verification for all reservists will include a report on the following items when applicable:

        (i) Continued enrollment in and actual pursuit of the course;

        (ii) The date of interruption or termination of training;

        (iii) Except as provided in § 21.7656(a), changes in the number of credit hours or in the number of clock hours of attendance;

        (iv) Nonpunitive grades; and

        (v) Any other changes or modifications in the course as certified at enrollment.

        (2) The verification of enrollment must:

        (i) Contain the information required for release of payment;

        (ii) If required or permitted by the Secretary to be submitted on paper, be signed by the reservist on or after the final date of the reporting period, or if permitted by the Secretary to be submitted by telephone or electronically in a manner designated by the Secretary, be submitted in the form and manner prescribed by the Secretary on or after the final date of the reporting period; and

        (iii) If submitted on paper, clearly show the date on which it was signed.

        (c)  (1) When a reservist is pursuing an apprenticeship or other on-job training, he or she must monthly certify training by reporting the number of hours worked.

        (2) The information provided by the reservist must be verified by the training establishment.

        § 21.7656   Other required reports.

#### § § 21.7656

        (a)  (1) A reservist enrolled full time in a program of education for a standard term, quarter, or semester must report without delay to VA:

        (i) A change in his or her credit hours or clock hours of attendance if that change would result in less than full-time enrollment;

        (ii) Any change in his or her pursuit that would result in less than full-time enrollment; and

        (iii) Any interruption or termination of his or her attendance.

        (2) A reservist not described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section must report without delay to VA:

        (i) Any change in his or her credit hours or clock hours of attendance;

        (ii) Any change in his or her pursuit; and

        (iii) Any interruption or termination of his or her attendance.

        (b)  When a reservist interrupts or terminates his or her training for any reason, including unsatisfactory conduct or progress, or when he or she changes the number of hours of credit or attendance, the educational institution must report this fact to VA.

        (1) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, an educational institution must report without delay to VA each time a reservist:

        (i) Interrupts or terminates his or her training for any reason; or

        (ii) Changes his or her credit hours or clock hours of attendance.

        (2) An educational institution does not need to report a change in a reservist's hours of credit or attendance when:

        (i) The reservist is enrolled full time in a program of education for a standard term, quarter, or semester before the change; and

        (ii) The reservist continues to be enrolled full time after the change.

        (3) If the change in status or change in number of credit hours or clock hours of attendance occurs on a day other than one indicated by paragraph (b)(4) or (b)(5) of this section, the educational institution will initiate a report of the change in time for VA to receive it within 30 days of the date on which the change occurs.

        (4) If the educational institution has certified the reservist's enrollment for more than one term, quarter or semester and the reservist interrupts his or her training at the end of a term, quarter or semester within the certified enrollment period, the educational institution shall report the change in status to VA in time for VA to receive the report within 30 days of the last officially scheduled registration date for the next term, quarter or semester.

        (5) If the change in status or change in the number of hours of credit or attendance occurs during the 30 days of a drop-add period, the educational institution must report the change in status or change in the number of hours of credit or attendance to VA in time for VA to receive the report within 30 days from the last date of the drop-add period or 60 days from the first day of the enrollment period, whichever occurs first.

        (c)  An educational institution may assign a nonpunitive grade for a course or subject in which the reservist is enrolled even though the reservist does not withdraw from the course or subject. When this occurs, the educational institution must report the assignment of the nonpunitive grade in time for VA to receive it before the earlier of the following dates is reached:

        (1) 30 days from the date on which the educational institution assigns the grade, or

        (2) 60 days from the last day of the enrollment period for which the nonpunitive grade is assigned.

      Course Assessment

        § 21.7670   Measurement of courses leading to a standard, undergraduate college degree.

#### § § 21.7670

        Except as provided in § 21.7672, VA will measure a reservist's courses as stated in this section.

        (a)  Unless 12 or 13 semester hours are full time as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, or unless paragraphs (d) or (e) of this section apply to measurement of the reservist's enrollment VA will measure a reservist's enrollment as follows:

        (1) 14 or more semester hours or the equivalent are full-time training,

        (2) 10 through 13 semester hours or the equivalent are three-quarter-time training;

        (3) 7 through 9 semester hours or the equivalent are half-time training; and

        (4) 1 through 6 semester hours or the equivalent are less than half-time training.

        (b)  (1) VA will consider that 13 semester hours or the equivalent are full-time training when the educational institution certifies that all undergraduate students enrolled for 13 semester hours or the equivalent are

        (i) Charged full-time tuition, or

        (ii) Considered full-time for other administrative purposes.

        (2) When 13 semester hours or the equivalent are full-time training—

        (i) 10 through 12 semester hours or the equivalent are three-quarter-time training;

        (ii) 7 through 9 semester hours or the equivalent are half-time training; and

        (iii) 1 through 6 semester hours or the equivalent are less than half-time training.

        (c)  (1) VA will consider that 12 semester hours or the equivalent are full-time training when the educational institution certifies that all undergraduate students enrolled for 12 semester hours or the equivalent are—

        (i) Charged full-time tuition, or

        (ii) Considered full time for other administrative purposes.

        (2) When 12 semester hours or the equivalent are full-time training—

        (i) 9 through 11 semester hours or the equivalent are three-quarter-time training;

        (ii) 6 through 8 semester hours or the equivalent are half-time training; and

        (iii) 1 through 5 semester hours or the equivalent are less than half-time training.

        (d)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, in administering benefits payable under 10 U.S.C. chapter 1606, VA shall apply the provisions of § 21.4272.

> [53 FR 34740, Sept. 8, 1988, as amended at 56 FR 9629, Mar. 7, 1991; 57 FR 57107, Dec. 3, 1992; 61 FR 29308, June 10, 1996; 62 FR 55762, Oct. 28, 1997]

        § 21.7672   Measurement of courses not leading to a standard college degree.

#### § § 21.7672

        (a)  (1) Courses not leading to a standard college degree may be measured on either a clock-hour basis, or a credit-hour basis or a combination of both. Factors which the Department of Veterans Affairs must include in determining the proper basis for measurement include whether the courses are accredited; whether the course could be credited toward a standard college degree; and whether the course is offered on a standard quarter or semester-hour basis.

        (2) In determining which is the correct basis for measuring a reservist's enrollment, VA will first examine whether credit-hour measurement is appropriate, as provided in paragraph (b) of this section.

        (3) If it is not appropriate to measure a reservist's enrollment on a credit-hour basis, VA will measure the enrollment on a clock-hour basis as described in paragraph (c) of this section.

        (b)  (1) When all the conditions of paragraph (b)(1) of this section are met, the Department of Veterans Affairs will—

        (i) Measure the reservist's enrollment in the same manner as collegiate undergraduate courses are measured in § 21.7670 (a), (b), and (c).

        (ii) Apply the provisions of § 21.4272(g) if one or more of the reservist's courses are offered during a nonstandard term.

        (2) For new enrollments beginning on or after July 1, 1993, when a course is offered by an institution of higher learning in residence on a standard quarter- or semester-hour basis, VA will measure a reservist's enrollment in a course not leading to a standard college degree on the same credit-hour basis as courses leading to a standard undergraduate degree, as provided in § 21.7670.

        (3) For new enrollments beginning on or after July 1, 1993, when a course is offered in residence on a standard quarter- or semester-hour basis by an educational institution which is not an institution of higher learning, VA also will measure on a credit-hour basis as provided in § 21.7670 a reservist's enrollment in a course not leading to a standard college degree, provided that the educational institution requires at least the same number of clock-hours of attendance as required in paragraph (c) of this section. If the educational institution does not require at least the same number of clock-hours of attendance as required in paragraph (c) of this section, VA will not apply the provisions of § 21.7670, but will measure the course according to paragraph (c) of this section.

        (4) VA will apply the provisions of § 21.4272(g) to new enrollments beginning on or after July 1, 1993, if one or more of the reservist's courses are offered during a nonstandard term.

        (c)  The provisions of this paragraph apply to all enrollments in courses not leading to a standard college degree. If VA concludes that the courses in which a reservist is enrolled do not qualify for credit-hour measurement, VA shall measure those courses as follows. (Supervised study shall be excluded from measurement of all courses to which this paragraph applies).

        (1) If shop practice is an integral part of the course—

        (i) Full-time training shall be 22 clock hours attendance with not more than 2  hours rest period allowance;

        (ii) Three-quarter-time training shall be 16 through 21 clock hours attendance with not more than 2 hours rest period allowance;

        (iii) Half-time training shall be 11 through 15 clock hours attendance with not more than 1  hours rest period allowance; and

        (iv) One-quarter-time training shall be 1 through 10 clock hours attendance. For attendance of 6 through 10 clock hours, there shall be not more than one quarter hour rest period allowance. For attendance of 1 through 5 clock hours, there shall be no rest period allowance.

        (2) If theory and class instruction predominates—

        (i) Full-time training is 18 clock hours net instruction;

        (ii) Three-quarter-time training is 13 through 17 clock hours net instruction;

        (iii) Half-time training is 9 through 12 clock hours net instruction; and

        (iv) Less than half-time training is 1 through 8 clock hours net instruction. In measuring net instruction for this paragraph there will be included customary intervals not to exceed 10 minutes between classes: however, supervised study must be excluded.

        § 21.7673   Measurement of concurrent enrollments.

#### § § 21.7673

        (a)  Where a reservist enrolls concurrently in courses offered by two schools and the standards for measurement of the courses pursued concurrently in the two schools are different, the Department of Veterans Affairs will measure the reservist's enrollment by converting the units of measurement for courses in the second school to their equivalent in units of measurement required for the courses in the program of education which the reservist is pursuing at the primary institution. This conversion will be accomplished as follows:

        (1) If VA measures the course at the primary institution on a credit-hour basis (including a course which does not lead to a standard college degree, which is being measured on a credit-hour basis as provided in § 21.7672(b)), and VA measures the courses at the second school on a clock-hour basis, the clock hours will be converted to credit hours.

        (2) If VA measures the courses pursued at the primary institution on a clock-hour basis, and VA measures the courses pursued at the second school on a credit-hour basis, including courses which qualify for credit-hour measurement on the basis of § 21.7672(b), VA will convert the credit hours to clock hours to determine the reservist's training time.

        (b)  If the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section require the Department of Veteran Affairs to convert clock hours, it will do so by—

        (1) Dividing the number of credit hours which the Department of Veterans Affairs considers to be full-time at the educational institution whose courses are measured on a credit-hour basis by the number of clock hours which are full-time at the educational institution whose courses are measured on a clock-hour basis; and

        (2) Multiplying each clock hour of attendance by the decimal determined in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. The Department of Veterans Affairs will drop all fractional hours.

        (c)  If the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section require the Department of Veterans Affairs to convert credit hours to clock hours, it will do so by—

        (1) Dividing the number of clock hours which the Department of Veterans Affairs considers to be full-time at the educational institution whose courses are measured on a clock-hour basis by the number of credit hours which are full-time at the educational institution whose courses are measured on a credit-hour basis; and

        (2) Multiplying each credit hour by the number determined in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. The Department of Veterans Affairs will drop all fractional hours.

        (d)  If VA measures the courses pursued at both institutions on either a clock-hour basis or a credit-hour basis, VA will measure the reservist's enrollment by adding together the units of measurement for the courses in the second school and the units of measurement for courses in the primary institution. The standard for full time will be the full-time standard for the courses at the primary institution.

#### § § 21.7674

        (a)  (1) Courses for the objective of registered nurse or registered professional nurse will be measured on the basis of credit hours or clock hours of attendance, whichever is appropriate. The clock hours of attendance may include academic class time, clinical training, and supervised study periods.

        (2) Courses offered by institutions of higher learning which lead to the objective of practical nurse, practical trained nurse, or licensed practical nurse will be measured on credit hours or clock hours of attendance per week whichever is appropriate.

        (b)  Programs approved in accordance with the provisions of § 21.7720(b)(9) will be measured on a clock-hour basis as provided in § 21.7672. However, the program will be regarded as full-time institutional training, provided the combined total of the classroom and other formal instruction portion of the program and the on-the-job portion of the program requires 30 or more clock hours of attendance per week.

        (c)  These courses will be measured in semester hours of credit or clock hours of attendance per week, whichever is appropriate.

        § 21.8014   Application.

#### § § 21.8014

        (a)  To participate in a vocational training program, the child of a Vietnam veteran or veteran with covered service in Korea (or the child's parent or guardian, an authorized representative, or a Member of Congress acting on behalf of the child) must file an application. An application is a request for an evaluation of the feasibility of the child's achievement of a vocational goal and, if a CP or VRC determines that achievement of a vocational goal is feasible, for participation in a vocational training program. The application may be in any form, but it must:

        (1) Be in writing over the signature of the applicant or the person applying on the child's behalf;

        (2) Provide the child's full name, address, and VA claim number, if any, and the parent Vietnam veteran or veteran with covered service in Korea's full name and Social Security number or VA claim number, if any; and

        (3) Clearly identify the benefit sought.

        (b)  For a child claiming eligibility based on having spina bifida, an application under this subpart may be filed at any time after September 30, 1997. For a child claiming eligibility based on a covered birth defect, an application under this subpart may be filed at any time after November 30, 2001.

      Basic Entitlement Requirements

        § 21.8020   Entitlement to vocational training and employment assistance.

#### § § 21.8020

        (a)  Under this subpart, for an eligible child to receive vocational training, employment assistance, and related rehabilitation services and assistance to achieve a vocational goal (to include employment), the following requirements must be met:

        (1) A CP or VRC must determine that achievement of a vocational goal by the child is reasonably feasible; and

        (2) The child and VR&E staff members must work together to develop and then agree to an individualized written plan of vocational rehabilitation identifying the vocational goal and the means to achieve this goal.

        (b)  An eligible child may receive the services and assistance described in § 21.8050(a).

        (1) The following sections in subpart A of this part apply to the provision of these services and assistance in a manner comparable to their application for a veteran under the 38 U.S.C. chapter 31 program:

        (i) Section 21.250(a) and (b)(2);

        (ii) Section 21.252;

        (iii) Section 21.254;

        (iv) Section 21.256 (not including paragraph (e)(2));

        (v) Section 21.257; and

        (vi) Section 21.258.

        (2) For purposes of this subpart, the requirements for application of § 21.257(e)(1) and (2) are deemed met for an individual in a self-employment program regardless of whether the individual is described in § 21.257(b), if the individual has been determined by VA to have limitations affecting employability arising from the effects of the individual's spina bifida and/or other covered birth defect(s) which are so severe as to necessitate selection of self-employment as the only reasonably feasible vocational goal for the individual.

        (c)  VA will provide employment services and assistance under paragraph (b) of this section only if the eligible child:

        (1) Has achieved a vocational objective;

        (2) Has voluntarily ceased vocational training under this subpart, but the case manager finds the child has attained sufficient skills to be employable; or

        (3) VA determines during evaluation that the child already has the skills necessary for suitable employment and does not need additional training, but to secure suitable employment the child does need the employment assistance that paragraph (b) of this section describes.

        (d)  If an eligible child has received employment assistance and becomes suitably employed, but VA later finds the child needs additional employment services and assistance, VA may provide the child with these services and assistance if, and to the extent, the child has remaining program entitlement.

        (e) —(1)  An eligible child will be entitled to receive 24 months of full-time training, services, and assistance (including employment assistance) or the part-time equivalent, as part of a vocational training program.

        (2)  VA may extend the basic 24-month entitlement period, not to exceed another 24 months of full-time program participation, or the part-time equivalent, if VA determines that:

        (i) The extension is necessary for the child to achieve a vocational goal identified before the end of the basic 24-month entitlement period; and

        (ii) The child can achieve the vocational goal within the extended period.

        (3)  VA will charge entitlement usage for training, services, or assistance (but not the initial evaluation, as described in § 21.8032) furnished to an eligible child under this subpart on the same basis as VA would charge for similar training, services, or assistance furnished a veteran in a vocational rehabilitation program under 38 U.S.C. chapter 31. VA may charge entitlement at a half-time, three-quarter-time, or full-time rate based upon the child's training time using the rate-of-pursuit criteria in § 21.8310. The provisions concerning reduced work tolerance under § 21.312, and those relating to less-than-half-time training under § 21.314, do not apply under this subpart.

        § 21.8022   Entry and reentry.

#### § § 21.8022

        (a)  VA may not enter a child into a vocational training program or provide an evaluation or any training, services, or assistance under this subpart before the date VA first receives an application for a vocational training program filed in accordance with § 21.8014.

        (b)  If an eligible child interrupts or ends pursuit of a vocational training program and VA subsequently allows the child to reenter the program, the date of reentrance will accord with the facts, but may not precede the date VA receives an application for the reentrance.

      Evaluation

        § 21.8030   Requirement for evaluation of child.

#### § § 21.8030

        (a)  The VR&E Division will evaluate each child who:

        (1) Applies for a vocational training program; and

        (2) Has been determined to be an eligible child as defined in § 21.8010.

        (b)  The evaluation has two purposes:

        (1) To ascertain whether achievement of a vocational goal by the child is reasonably feasible; and

        (2) If a vocational goal is reasonably feasible, to develop an individualized plan of integrated training, services, and assistance that the child needs to prepare for and participate in vocational training or employment.

        § 21.8032   Evaluations.

#### § § 21.8032

        (a)  The scope and nature of the evaluation under this program will be comparable to an evaluation of the reasonable feasibility of achieving a vocational goal for a veteran under 38 U.S.C. chapter 31 and §§ 21.50(b)(3) and 21.53(b) and (d).

        (b)  As a part of the evaluation of reasonable feasibility of achieving a vocational goal, VA may provide the following specific services, as appropriate:

        (1) Assessment of feasibility by a CP or VRC;

        (2) Review of feasibility assessment and of need for special services by the Vocational Rehabilitation Panel;

        (3) Provision of medical, testing, and other diagnostic services to ascertain the child's capacity for training and employment; and

        (4) Evaluation of employability by professional staff of an educational or rehabilitation facility, for a period not to exceed 30 days.

        (c)  A CP or VRC will make all determinations as to the reasonable feasibility of achieving a vocational goal.

      Services and Assistance to Program Participants

        § 21.8050   Scope of training, services, and assistance.

#### § § 21.8050

        (a)  VA may provide to vocational training program participants:

        (1) Vocationally oriented training, services, and assistance, to include:

        (i) Training in an institution of higher education if the program is predominantly vocational; and

        (ii) Tuition, fees, books, equipment, supplies, and handling charges.

        (2) Employment assistance including:

        (i) Vocational, psychological, employment, and personal adjustment counseling;

        (ii) Services to place the individual in suitable employment and post-placement services necessary to ensure satisfactory adjustment in employment; and

        (iii) Personal adjustment and work adjustment training.

        (3) Vocationally oriented independent living services only to the extent that the services are indispensable to the achievement of the vocational goal and do not constitute a significant portion of the services to be provided.

        (4) Other vocationally oriented services and assistance of the kind VA provides veterans under the 38 U.S.C. chapter 31 program, except as paragraph (c) of this section provides, that VA determines the program participant needs to prepare for and take part in vocational training or in employment.

        (b)  VA will provide either directly or by contract, agreement, or arrangement with another entity, and at no cost to the beneficiary, the vocationally oriented training, other services, and assistance that VA approves for the individual child's program under this subpart. Authorization and payment for approved services will be made in a comparable manner to that VA provides for veterans under the 38 U.S.C. chapter 31 program.

        (c)  VA may not provide to a vocational training program participant any:

        (1) Loan;

        (2) Subsistence allowance;

        (3) Automobile adaptive equipment;

        (4) Training at an institution of higher education in a program of education that is not predominantly vocational in content;

        (5) Employment adjustment allowance;

        (6) Room and board (other than for a period of 30 days or less in a special rehabilitation facility either for purposes of an extended evaluation or to improve and enhance vocational potential);

        (7) Independent living services, except those that are incidental to the pursuit of the vocational training program.

      Duration of Vocational Training

        § 21.8070   Basic duration of a vocational training program.

#### § § 21.8070

        (a)  The duration of a vocational training program, as paragraphs (e)(1) and (e)(2) of § 21.8020 provide, may not exceed 24 months of full-time training, services, and assistance or the part-time equivalent, except as § 21.8072 allows.

        (b)  While preparing the individualized written plan of vocational rehabilitation, the CP or VRC will estimate the time the child needs to complete a vocational training program.

        (c)  The child will receive training, services, and assistance, as § 21.8120 describes, for a period that VA determines the child needs to reach the level employers generally recognize as necessary for entry into employment in a suitable occupational objective.

        (d)  To qualify for employment in a particular occupation, the child may need training that exceeds the amount a person generally needs for employment in that occupation. VA will provide the necessary additional training under one or more of the following conditions:

        (1) Training requirements for employment in the child's vocational goal in the area where the child lives or will seek employment exceed those job seekers generally need for that type of employment;

        (2) The child is preparing for a type of employment in which he or she will be at a definite disadvantage in competing with nondisabled persons and the additional training will offset the competitive disadvantage;

        (3) The choice of a feasible occupation is limited, and additional training will enhance the child's employability in one of the feasible occupations; or

        (4) The number of employment opportunities within a feasible occupation is restricted.

        (e)  In estimating the length of the training period the eligible child needs, the CP or VRC must determine that:

        (1) The proposed vocational training would not normally require a person without a disability more than 24 months of full-time pursuit, or the part-time equivalent, for successful completion; and

        (2) The program of training and other services the child needs, based upon VA's evaluation, will not exceed 24 months or the part-time equivalent. In calculating the proposed program's length, the CP or VRC will follow the procedures in § 21.8074(a).

        (f)  If the total period the child would require for completion of an initial vocational training program in paragraph (e) of this section is more than 24 months, or the part-time equivalent, the CP or VRC must work with the child to select another suitable initial vocational goal.

        § 21.8072   Authorizing training, services, and assistance beyond the initial individualized written plan of vocational rehabilitation.

#### § § 21.8072

        (a)  VA may authorize an extension of a vocational training program when necessary to provide additional training, services, and assistance to enable the child to achieve the vocational or employment goal identified before the end of the child's basic entitlement period, as stated in the individualized written plan of vocational rehabilitation under § 21.8080. A change from one occupational objective to another in the same field or occupational family meets the criterion for prior identification in the individualized written plan of vocational rehabilitation.

        (b)  (1) Except as paragraph (b)(2) of this section provides, VA may authorize additional training, limited to the use of remaining program entitlement including any allowable extension, for an eligible child who previously participated in vocational training under this subpart. The additional training must:

        (i) Be designed to enable the child to complete the prior vocational goal or a different vocational goal; and

        (ii) Meet the same provisions as apply to training for new participants.

        (2) An eligible child who has previously achieved a vocational goal in a vocational training program under this subpart may not receive additional training under paragraph (b)(1) of this section unless a CP or VRC sets aside the child's achievement of that vocational goal under § 21.8284.

        (c)  A CP or VRC may approve extensions of the vocational training program the child is pursuing up to the maximum program limit of 48 months if the CP or VRC determines that the child needs the additional time to successfully complete training and obtain employment, and the following conditions are met:

        (1) The child has completed more than half of the planned training; and

        (2) The child is making satisfactory progress.

        § 21.8074   Computing the period for vocational training program participation.

#### § § 21.8074

        (a)  To compute the number of months and days of an eligible child's participation in a vocational training program:

        (1) Count the number of actual months and days of the child's:

        (i) Pursuit of vocational education or training;

        (ii) Receipt of extended evaluation-type services and training, or services and training to enable the child to prepare for vocational training or employment, if a veteran in a 38 U.S.C. chapter 31 program would have received a subsistence allowance while receiving the same type of services and training; and

        (iii) Receipt of employment and post-employment services (any period of employment or post-employment services is considered full-time program pursuit).

        (2) Do not count:

        (i) The initial evaluation period;

        (ii) Any period before the child enters a vocational training program under this subpart;

        (iii) Days of authorized leave; and

        (iv) Other periods during which the child does not pursue training, such as periods between terms.

        (3) Convert part-time training periods to full-time equivalents.

        (4) Total the months and days under paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(3) of this section. This sum is the period of the child's participation in the program.

        (b)  Computation of the program participation period under this section will be consistent with the principles for charging entitlement under § 21.8020.

      Individualized Written Plan of Vocational Rehabilitation

        § 21.8080   Requirement for an individualized written plan of vocational rehabilitation.

#### § § 21.8080

        (a)  A CP or VRC will work in consultation with each child for whom a vocational goal is feasible to develop an individualized written plan of vocational rehabilitation services and assistance to meet the child's vocational training needs. The CP or VRC will develop this individualized written plan of vocational rehabilitation in a manner comparable to the rules governing the development of an individualized written rehabilitation plan (IWRP) for a veteran for 38 U.S.C. chapter 31 purposes, as §§ 21.80, 21.84, 21.88, 21.90, 21.92, 21.94 (a) through (d), and 21.96 provide.

        (b)  If training is necessary, the CP or VRC will explore a range of possibilities, to include paid and unpaid on-job training, institutional training, and a combination of on-job and institutional training to accomplish the goals of the program. Generally, an eligible child's program should include on-job training, or a combination of on-job and institutional training, when this training:

        (1) Is available;

        (2) Is as suitable as using only institutional training for accomplishing the goals of the program; and

        (3) Will meet the child's vocational training program needs.

        § 21.8082   Inability of child to complete individualized written plan of vocational rehabilitation or achieve vocational goal.

#### § § 21.8082

        (a)  After a vocational training program has begun, the VR&E case manager may determine that the eligible child cannot complete the vocational training program described in the child's individualized written plan of vocational rehabilitation within the time limits of the individualized written plan of vocational rehabilitation or cannot achieve the child's identified vocational goal. Subject to paragraph (b) of this section, VR&E may assist the child in revising or selecting a new individualized written plan of vocational rehabilitation or goal.

        (b)  Any change in the eligible child's individualized written plan of vocational rehabilitation or vocational goal is subject to the child's continuing eligibility under the vocational training program and the provisions governing duration of a vocational training program in §§ 21.8020(e) and 21.8070 through 21.8074.

        (c)  (1) The individualized written plan of vocational rehabilitation or vocational goal may be changed under the same conditions as provided for a veteran under § 21.94 (a) through (d), and subject to § 21.8070 (d) through (f), if:

        (i) The CP or VRC determines that achievement of a vocational goal is still reasonably feasible and that the new individualized written plan of vocational rehabilitation or goal is necessary to enable the eligible child to prepare for and participate in vocational training or employment; and

        (ii) Reentrance is authorized under § 21.8284 in a case when the child has completed a vocational training program under this subpart.

        (2) A CP or VRC may approve a change of vocational goal from one field or occupational family to another field or occupational family if the child can achieve the new goal:

        (i) Before the end of the basic 24-month entitlement period that § 21.8020(e)(1) describes; or

        (ii) Before the end of any allowable extension under §§ 21.8020(e)(2) and 21.8072 if the new vocational goal in another field or occupational family was identified during the basic 24-month entitlement period.

        (3) A change from one occupational objective to another in the same field or occupational family does not change the planned vocational goal.

        (4) The child must have sufficient remaining entitlement to pursue the new individualized written plan of vocational rehabilitation or goal, as § 21.8020 provides.

        (d)  If the eligible child elects to terminate the planned vocational training program, he or she will receive the assistance that § 21.80(d) provides in identifying other resources through which to secure the desired training or employment.

      Counseling

        § 21.8100   Counseling.

#### § § 21.8100

        An eligible child requesting or receiving services and assistance under this subpart will receive professional counseling by VR&E and other qualified VA staff members, and by contract counseling providers, as necessary, in a manner comparable to VA's provision of these services to veterans under the 38 U.S.C. chapter 31 program, as §§ 21.100 and 21.380 provide.

      Vocational Training, Services, and Assistance

        § 21.8120   Vocational training, services, and assistance.

#### § § 21.8120

        (a)  An eligible child may receive training, services, and assistance to enable the child to prepare for and participate in vocational training or employment.

        (b)  VA and the child will select vocationally oriented courses of study and training, completion of which usually results in a diploma, certificate, degree, qualification for licensure, or direct placement in employment. The educational and training services to be provided include:

        (1) Remedial, deficiency, and refresher training; and

        (2) Training that leads to an identifiable vocational goal. Under this program, VA may authorize all forms of programs that §§ 21.122 through 21.132 describe. This includes education and training programs in institutions of higher education. VA may authorize the education and training at an undergraduate or graduate degree level, only if the degree program is predominantly vocational in nature. For an eligible child to participate in a graduate degree program, the graduate degree must be a requirement for entry into the child's vocational goal. For example, a master's degree is required to engage in social work. The program of training is predominantly vocational in content if the majority of the instruction provides the technical skills and knowledge employers generally regard as specific to, and required for, entry into the child's vocational goal.

        (c)  The CP or VRC will consider the cost of training in selecting a facility when:

        (1) There is more than one facility in the area in which the child resides that:

        (i) Meets the requirements for approval under §§ 21.290 through 21.298 (except as provided by § 21.8286(b)),

        (ii) Can provide the training, services and other supportive assistance the child's individualized written plan of vocational rehabilitation specifies, and

        (iii) Is within reasonable commuting distance; or

        (2) The child wishes to train at a suitable facility in another area, even though a suitable facility in the area where the child lives can provide the training. In considering the costs of providing training in this case, VA will use the provisions of § 21.120 (except 21.120(a)(3)), § 21.370 (however, the words “under § 21.282” in § 21.370(b)(2)(iii)(B) do not apply), and § 21.372 in a manner comparable to that for veterans under the 38 U.S.C. chapter 31 program.

        (d)  If suitable vocational training courses are not available in the area in which the child lives, or if they are available but not accessible to the child, VA may make other arrangements. These arrangements may include, but are not limited to:

        (1) Transportation of the child, but not the child's family, personal effects, or household belongings, to another area where necessary services are available; or

        (2) Use of an individual instructor to provide necessary training in a manner comparable to that for veterans under the 38 U.S.C. chapter 31 program, as § 21.146 describes.

      Evaluation and Improvement of Vocational Potential

        § 21.8140   Evaluation and improvement of vocational potential.

#### § § 21.8140

        (a)  A CP or VRC may use the services that paragraph (d) of this section describes to:

        (1) Evaluate vocational training and employment potential;

        (2) Provide a basis for planning:

        (i) A program of services and assistance to improve the eligible child's preparation for vocational training and employment; or

        (ii) A vocational training program;

        (3) Reevaluate the vocational training feasibility of an eligible child participating in a vocational training program; and

        (4) Remediate deficiencies in the child's basic capabilities, skills, or knowledge to give the child the ability to participate in vocational training or employment.

        (b)  A CP or VRC may authorize the services described in paragraph (d) of this section, except those in paragraph (d)(4) of this section, for delivery during:

        (1) An initial or extended evaluation; or

        (2) Pursuit of a vocational training program.

        (c)  The duration of services needed to improve vocational training and employment potential, furnished on a full-time basis either as a preliminary part or all of a vocational training program, may not exceed 9 months. If VA furnishes these services on a less than full-time basis, the duration will be for the period necessary, but may not exceed the equivalent of 9 months of full-time training.

        (d)  Evaluation and improvement services include:

        (1) Diagnostic services;

        (2) Personal and work adjustment training;

        (3) Referral for medical care and treatment pursuant to §§ 17.900 through 17.905 of this title for the spina bifida, covered birth defects, or related conditions;

        (4) Vocationally oriented independent living services indispensable to pursuing a vocational training program;

        (5) Language training, speech and voice correction, training in ambulation, and one-hand typewriting;

        (6) Orientation, adjustment, mobility and related services; and

        (7) Other appropriate services to assist the child in functioning in the proposed training or work environment.

        (e)  The provisions of § 21.140 do not apply to this subpart. Subject to the provisions of this subpart, the following provisions apply to the vocational training program under this subpart in a manner comparable to that for veterans under the 38 U.S.C. chapter 31 program: § 21.142(a) and (b); § 21.144; § 21.146; § 21.148(a) and (c); § 21.150 other than paragraph (b); § 21.152 other than paragraph (b); § 21.154 other than paragraph (b); and § 21.156.

      Supplies

        § 21.8210   Supplies.

#### § § 21.8210

        (a)  VA will provide the child with the supplies that the child needs to pursue training, to obtain and maintain employment, and otherwise to achieve the goal of his or her vocational training program.

        (b)  VA may provide books, tools, and other supplies and equipment that VA determines are necessary for the child's vocational training program and are required by similarly circumstanced veterans pursuing such training under 38 U.S.C. chapter 31.

        (c)  VA may provide supplies to an eligible child receiving:

        (1) An initial or extended evaluation;

        (2) Vocational training, services, and assistance to reach the point of employability; or

        (3) Employment services.

        (d)  The provisions of §§ 21.212 through 21.224 apply to children pursuing a vocational training program under this subpart in a comparable manner as VA provides supplies to veterans under 38 U.S.C. chapter 31, except the following portions:

        (1) Section 21.216(a)(3) pertaining to special modifications, including automobile adaptive equipment;

        (2) Section 21.220(a)(1) pertaining to advancements from the revolving fund loan;

        (3) Section 21.222(b)(1)(x) pertaining to discontinuance from an independent living services program.

      Program Costs

        § 21.8260   Training, services, and assistance costs.

#### § § 21.8260

        The provisions of § 21.262 pertaining to reimbursement for training and other program costs apply, in a comparable manner as provided under the 38 U.S.C. chapter 31 program for veterans, to payments to facilities, vendors, and other providers for training, supplies, and other services they deliver under this subpart.

      Vocational Training Program Entrance, Termination, and Resources

        § 21.8280   Effective date of induction into a vocational training program.

#### § § 21.8280

        Subject to the limitations in § 21.8022, the date an eligible child is inducted into a vocational training program will be the date the child first begins to receive training, services, or assistance under an individualized written plan of vocational rehabilitation.

        § 21.8282   Termination of a vocational training program.

#### § § 21.8282

        A case manager may terminate a vocational training program under this subpart for cause, including lack of cooperation, failure to pursue the individualized written plan of vocational rehabilitation, fraud, administrative error, or finding that the child no longer has a covered birth defect. An eligible child for whom a vocational goal is reasonably feasible remains eligible for the program subject to the rules of this subpart unless the child's eligibility for or entitlement to a vocational training program under this subpart resulted from fraud or administrative error or unless VA finds the child no longer has a covered birth defect. The effective date of termination will be the earliest of the following applicable dates:

        (a)  If an eligible child establishes eligibility for or entitlement to benefits under this subpart through fraud, VA will terminate the award of vocational training and rehabilitation as of the date VA first began to pay benefits.

        (b)  If an eligible child who is not entitled to benefits under this subpart receives those benefits through VA administrative error, VA will terminate the award of benefits as of the first day of the calendar month beginning at least 60 days after notifying the child of the proposed termination. This 60-day period may not result in the entrance of the child into a new quarter, semester, or other term of training unless VA has already obligated payment for the training.

        (c)  If VA finds that a child no longer has a covered birth defect, VA will terminate the award of benefits effective the last day of the month in which such determination becomes final.

        (d)  If reasonable VR&E efforts to motivate an eligible child do not resolve a lack of cooperation or failure to pursue an individualized written plan of vocational rehabilitation, VA will terminate the award of benefits as of the first day of the calendar month beginning at least 60 days after notifying the child of the proposed termination. This 60-day period may not result in the entrance of the child into a new quarter, semester, or other term of training. VA will deobligate payment for training in the new quarter, semester, or other term of training.

        § 21.8284   Additional vocational training.

#### § § 21.8284

        VA may provide an additional period of training or services under a vocational training program to an eligible child who has completed training for a vocational goal and/or been suitably employed under this subpart, if the child is otherwise eligible and has remaining program entitlement as provided in § 21.8072(b), only under one of the following conditions:

        (a) Current facts, including any relevant medical findings, establish that the child's disability has worsened to the extent that he or she can no longer perform the duties of the occupation which was the child's vocational goal under this subpart;

        (b) The occupation that was the child's vocational goal under this subpart is now unsuitable;

        (c) The vocational training program services and assistance the child originally received are now inadequate to make the child employable in the occupation which he or she sought to achieve;

        (d) Experience has demonstrated that VA should not reasonably have expected employment in the objective or field for which the child received vocational training program services and assistance; or

        (e) Technological change that occurred after the child achieved a vocational goal under this subpart now prevents the child from:

        (1) Performing the duties of the occupation for which VA provided training, services, or assistance, or in a related occupation; or

        (2) Securing employment in the occupation for which VA provided training, services, or assistance, or in a related occupation.

        § 21.8286   Training resources.

#### § § 21.8286

        (a)  The provisions of § 21.146 and §§ 21.290 through 21.298 apply to children pursuing a vocational training program under this subpart in a comparable manner as for veterans under the 38 U.S.C. chapter 31 program, except as paragraph (b) of this section specifies.

        (b)  The provisions of § 21.294(b)(1)(i) and (b)(1)(ii) pertaining to independent living services do not apply to this subpart. The provisions of § 21.294(b)(1)(iii) pertaining to authorization of independent living services as a part of an individualized written plan of vocational rehabilitation apply to children under this subpart in a comparable manner as for veterans under the 38 U.S.C. chapter 31 program only to the extent § 21.8050 allows.

      Rate of Pursuit

        § 21.8310   Rate of pursuit.

#### § § 21.8310

        (a)  VA will approve an eligible child's pursuit of a vocational training program at a rate consistent with his or her ability to successfully pursue training, considering:

        (1) Effects of his or her disability;

        (2) Family responsibilities;

        (3) Travel;

        (4) Reasonable adjustment to training; and

        (5) Other circumstances affecting the child's ability to pursue training.

        (b)  An eligible child should pursue a program of vocational training with as little interruption as necessary, considering the factors in paragraph (a) of this section.

        (c)  VR&E staff members will consult with the child when determining the rate and continuity of pursuit of a vocational training program. These staff members will also confer with the medical consultant and the Vocational Rehabilitation Panel described in §§ 21.60 and 21.62, as necessary. This rate and continuity of pursuit determination will occur during development of the individualized written plan of vocational rehabilitation, but may change later, as necessary to enable the child to complete training.

        (d)  VA will measure the rate of pursuit in a comparable manner to rate of pursuit measurement under § 21.310 for veterans under the 38 U.S.C. chapter 31 program.

      Authorization of Services

        § 21.8320   Authorization of services.

#### § § 21.8320

        The provisions of § 21.326, pertaining to the commencement and termination dates of a period of employment services, apply to children under this subpart in a manner comparable to that provided for veterans under the 38 U.S.C. chapter 31 program. References in that section to an individualized employment assistance plan or IEAP are considered as referring to the child's individualized written plan of vocational rehabilitation under this subpart.

      Leaves of Absence

        § 21.8340   Leaves of absence.

#### § § 21.8340

        (a)  The purpose of the leave system is to enable the child to maintain his or her status as an active program participant.

        (b)  The VR&E case manager may grant the child leaves of absence for periods during which the child fails to pursue a vocational training program. For prolonged periods of absence, the VR&E case manager may approve leaves of absence only if the case manager determines the child is unable to pursue a vocational training program through no fault of the child.

        (c)  During a leave of absence, VA suspends the running of the basic 24-month period of entitlement, plus any extensions thereto, until the child resumes the program.

      Satisfactory Conduct and Cooperation

        § 21.8360   Satisfactory conduct and cooperation.

#### § § 21.8360

        The provisions for satisfactory conduct and cooperation in §§ 21.362 and 21.364, except as otherwise provided in this section, apply to children under this subpart in a manner comparable to the way they apply to veterans under the 38 U.S.C. chapter 31 program. If an eligible child fails to meet these requirements for satisfactory conduct or cooperation, the VR&E case manager will terminate the child's vocational training program. VA will not grant an eligible child reentrance to a vocational training program unless the reasons for unsatisfactory conduct or cooperation have been removed.

      Transportation Services

        § 21.8370   Authorization of transportation services.

#### § § 21.8370

        (a)  VA authorizes transportation services necessary for an eligible child to pursue a vocational training program. The sections in subpart A of this part that are referred to in this paragraph apply to children under this subpart in a manner comparable to the way they apply to veterans under the 38 U.S.C. chapter 31 program. Transportation services include:

        (1) Transportation for evaluation or counseling under § 21.376;

        (2) Intraregional travel under § 21.370 (except that assurance that the child meets all basic requirements for induction into training will be determined without regard to the provisions of § 21.282) and interregional travel under § 21.372;

        (3) Special transportation allowance under § 21.154; and

        (4) Commuting to and from training and while seeking employment, subject to paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section.

        (b)  For transportation services that VA authorizes, VA will normally pay in arrears and in the same manner as tuition, fees, and other services under this program.

        (c)  VA may pay for transportation during the period of vocational training and the first 3 months the child receives employment services. VA may reimburse the child's costs, not to exceed $200 per month, of commuting to and from training and seeking employment if he or she requests this assistance and VA determines, after careful examination of the child's situation and subject to the limitations in paragraph (d) of this section, that the child would be unable to pursue training or employment without this assistance. VA may:

        (1) Reimburse the facility at which the child is training if the facility provided transportation or related services; or

        (2) Reimburse the child for his or her actual commuting expense if the child paid for the transportation.

        (d)  Payment of commuting expenses under paragraph (a)(4) of this section may not be made for any period when the child:

        (1) Is gainfully employed;

        (2) Is eligible for, and entitled to, payment of commuting costs through other VA and non-VA programs; or

        (3) Can commute to school with family, friends, or fellow students.

        (e)  VA must receive supportive documentation with each request for reimbursement. The individualized written plan of vocational rehabilitation will specify whether VA will pay monthly or at a longer interval.

        (f)  If a child is eligible for reimbursement of transportation services both under this section and under § 21.154, the child will receive only the benefit under § 21.154.

      Additional Applicable Regulations

        § 21.8380   Additional applicable regulations.

#### § § 21.8380

        The following regulations are applicable to children in this program in a manner comparable to that provided for veterans under the 38 U.S.C. chapter 31 program: §§ 21.380, 21.412, 21.414 (except (c), (d), and (e)), 21.420, and 21.430.

#### § § 21.9535

        (ii) The medical evidence clearly establishes that the individual was prevented from initiating or completing the chosen program of education within the original period of eligibility because of a physical or mental disability that did not result from the individual's willful misconduct. VA will not consider the disabling effects of chronic alcoholism to be the result of willful misconduct. VA will not consider an individual's disability for a period of 30 days or less as having prevented the individual from initiating or completing a chosen program, unless the evidence establishes that the individual was prevented from enrolling or reenrolling in the chosen program or was forced to discontinue attendance due to the short-term disability.

        (2)  An individual's extended period of eligibility shall be for the length of time that the individual was prevented from initiating or completing his or her chosen program of education. This will be determined as follows—

        (i) If the individual is pursuing a program of education organized on a term, quarter, or semester basis, his or her extended period of eligibility shall contain the same number of days as the number of days from the date the individual was prevented from initiating or completing training during his or her original period of eligibility to the earliest of—

        (A) The date the individual's training became medically feasible; or

        (B) The last date of the individual's original period of eligibility as determined in § 21.9530.

        (b)(1) An individual who, as of August 1, 2009, has used entitlement under 38 U.S.C. chapter 30, but retains unused entitlement under that chapter, makes an irrevocable election to receive educational assistance under the provisions of 38 U.S.C. chapter 33 instead of educational assistance under the provisions of chapter 30, will be limited to one month (or partial month) of entitlement under chapter 33 for each month (or partial month) of unused entitlement under chapter 30 (including any months of chapter 30 entitlement previously transferred to a dependent that the individual has revoked).

        (2) An individual, who as of August 1, 2009, was eligible under 38 U.S.C. chapter 30, had not used any entitlement under that program, was making contributions towards chapter 30, or was a servicemember who would have been eligible for chapter 30 if he or she had not declined participation, will receive 36 months of entitlement under chapter 33.

        (c) Except as provided in §§ 21.9560(d), 21.9570(m), and 21.9635(o), no individual is entitled to more than 36 months of full-time educational assistance under 38 U.S.C. chapter 33.

        § 21.9555   Entitlement to supplemental educational assistance.

#### § § 21.9555

        In determining the entitlement of an individual who is eligible for supplemental educational assistance, VA will—

        (b) Credit the individual with the same number of months and days of entitlement to supplemental educational assistance as the number calculated in paragraph (a) of this section.

        § 21.9560   Entitlement charges.

#### § § 21.9560

        (a)  Except as provided in paragraphs (c) through (f) of this section, VA will base entitlement charges on the principle that an eligible individual who is paid educational assistance for one day of full-time pursuit should be charged one day of entitlement.

        (b)  (1) VA will make a charge against entitlement as follows:

        (i)  If the individual is pursuing a program of education on a full-time basis, the entitlement charge will be one of the following—

        (A) During any period for which VA pays established charges to the institution of higher learning on the individual's behalf, the entitlement charge will be one day for each day of the certified enrollment period;

        (B) During any period for which VA does not pay established charges to the institution of higher learning on the individual's behalf but pays a monthly housing allowance to the individual, the entitlement charge will be one day for each day of the certified enrollment period and/or interval period for which the individual receives the monthly housing allowance; or

        (C) During any period for which VA does not pay established charges to the institution of higher learning on the individual's behalf or a monthly housing allowance to the individual but makes a lump sum payment to the individual for books, supplies, equipment, and other educational costs, VA will make an entitlement charge of 1 day for every $41.67 paid, with any remaining amount rounded to the nearest amount evenly divisible by $41.67.

        (ii)  If the individual is pursuing a program of education on a less than a full-time basis, the entitlement charge will be one of the following—

        (A) During any period for which VA pays established charges to the institution of higher learning on the individual's behalf, the individual will be charged a percentage of a day for each day of the certified enrollment period determined by dividing the number of course hours the individual is pursuing by the number of course hours required for full-time pursuit (rounded to the nearest hundredth);

        (B) During any period for which VA does not pay established charges to the institution of higher learning on the individual's behalf but pays a monthly housing allowance to the individual, the individual will be charged a percentage of a day for each day of the certified enrollment period and/or interval period for which the individual receives the monthly housing allowance determined by dividing the number of course hours the individual is pursuing by the number of course hours required for full-time pursuit (rounded to the nearest hundredth); or

        (C) During any period for which VA does not pay established charges to the institution of higher learning on the individual's behalf or a monthly housing allowance to the individual but makes a lump sum payment to the individual for books, supplies, equipment, and other educational costs, VA will make an entitlement charge of 1 day for every $41.67 paid, with any remaining amount rounded to the nearest amount evenly divisible by $41.67.

        (2) If the individual changes his or her rate of pursuit after the beginning date of the award, VA will—

        (i) Divide the certified enrollment period into separate periods of time so that the individual's rate of pursuit is constant within each period; and

        (ii) Compute the rate of pursuit separately for each time period.

        (c)  If an individual elected 38 U.S.C. chapter 33 by relinquishing educational assistance under another program but receives educational assistance for a program of education that is approved under the relinquished chapter but not approved under 38 U.S.C. chapter 33, VA will make a charge against entitlement equivalent to the entitlement charge—

        (1) That would be made under the provisions of § 21.7076, if the individual relinquished eligibility under 38 U.S.C. chapter 30;

        (2) That would be made under the provisions of § 21.7576 if the individual relinquished eligibility under 10 U.S.C. chapter 1606; or

        (3) That would be made under 10 U.S.C. chapter 1607 if the individual relinquished eligibility under 10 U.S.C. chapter 1607.

        (d)  VA will not make a charge against an individual's entitlement—

        (1) For an approved licensing or certification test as provided under § 21.9665; or

        (4) For pursuit of a course or courses when the individual—

        (i) Had to discontinue the course or courses as a result of being ordered to—

        (A) Active duty service under 10 U.S.C. 688, 12301(a), 12301(d), 12301(g), 12302, or 12304; or

        (B) A new duty location or assignment or to perform an increased amount of work; and

        (ii) Did not receive credit or lost training time for any portion of the period of enrollment in the course or courses for which the eligible individual was pursuing to complete his or her approved educational, professional, or vocational objective as a result of having to discontinue pursuit.

        (e)  An individual may not interrupt a certified period of enrollment for the purpose of conserving entitlement. An institution of higher learning may not certify a period of enrollment for a fractional part of the normal term, quarter, or semester if the individual is enrolled for the entire term, quarter, or semester. VA will make a charge against entitlement for the entire period of certified enrollment, if the individual is otherwise eligible for educational assistance, except when educational assistance is interrupted for any of the following conditions:

        (1) Enrollment is terminated;

        (2) The individual cancels his or her enrollment and does not negotiate a check or receive a direct deposit for educational assistance provided under this chapter for any part of the certified period of enrollment;

        (3) The individual interrupts his or her enrollment at the end of any term, quarter, or semester within a certified period of enrollment and does not negotiate a check or receive a direct deposit for educational assistance provided under this chapter for the succeeding term, quarter, or semester; or

        (4) The individual requests interruption or cancellation for any break when a school was closed during a certified period of enrollment, and VA continued payments under an established policy based upon an Executive Order of the President or an emergency situation regardless of whether or not the individual negotiated a check or received a direct deposit for educational assistance provided under this chapter for any part of the certified enrollment period.

        (f)  VA will make a charge against entitlement for an overpayment only if the overpayment is discharged in bankruptcy, is waived and not recovered, or is compromised.

        (1) If the overpayment is discharged in bankruptcy or is waived and not recovered, the charge against entitlement will be the appropriate rate for the elapsed period covered by the overpayment (exclusive of interest, administrative costs of collection, court costs and marshal fees).

        (2) If the overpayment is compromised and the compromise offer is less than the amount of interest, administrative costs of collection, court costs and marshal fees, the charge against entitlement will be at the appropriate rate for the elapsed period covered by the overpayment (exclusive of interest, administrative costs of collection, court costs and marshal fees).

        (3) If the overpayment is compromised and the compromise offer is equal to or greater than the amount of interest, administrative costs of collection, court costs and marshal fees, the charge against entitlement will be determined by—

        (i) Subtracting from the sum paid in the compromise offer the amount attributable to interest, administrative costs of collection, court costs and marshal fees;

        (ii) Subtracting the remaining amount of the overpayment balances as determined in paragraph (f)(3)(i) of this section from the amount of the original overpayment (exclusive of interest, administrative costs of collection, course costs and marshal fees);

        (iii) Dividing the result obtained in paragraph (f)(3)(ii) of this section from the amount of the original overpayment (exclusive of interest, administrative costs of collection, court costs and marshal fees); and

        (iv) Multiplying the percentage obtained in paragraph (f)(3)(iii) of this section by the amount of entitlement otherwise chargeable for the period of the original overpayment.

        (ii) Discontinuing the dependent's monthly housing allowance effective as of the date the dependent's months and days of entitlement exhausts.

        (l)  (1) Dependents are not eligible for transferred entitlement if the transferor fails to complete the amount of service he or she agreed to serve in the Armed Forces in order to participate in the transferability program, unless—

        (i) The transferor did not complete the service due to:

        (A) His or her death;

        (1) May receive educational assistance payable under this section and educational assistance payable based on their own active duty service for the same course; and

        (2) Are not subject to the 48 months limit on training provided for in § 21.4020 when combining transferred entitlement with their own entitlement earned under 38 U.S.C. chapter 33 as long as the only educational assistance paid is under 38 U.S.C. chapter 33. If the dependent is awarded educational assistance under another program listed in § 21.4020 (other than 38 U.S.C. chapter 33), the 48 months limit on training will apply.

        (3) If the eligible individual receives an advance payment of the monthly housing allowance pursuant to § 21.9680(b)(2) and dies before the period covered by the advance payment ends, the discontinuance date of educational assistance shall be the last date of the period covered by the advance payment.

        (4) For all other payments, if the eligible individual dies while pursuing a program of education, the discontinuance date of educational assistance will be the end of the month during which the individual last attended.

        (b)  In the first instance of a withdrawal from a course or courses for which the eligible individual received educational assistance, VA will consider mitigating circumstances to exist with respect to the withdrawal of a course or courses totaling no more than six semester hours or the equivalent. In determining whether a withdrawal is the first instance of withdrawal, VA will not consider a course or courses dropped during an institution of higher learning's drop-add period in accordance with § 21.4200(l). If mitigating circumstances are considered to exist in accordance with this paragraph, VA will terminate or reduce educational assistance effective the end of the month during which the withdrawal occurred.

        (2) If the eligible individual withdraws from all courses with mitigating circumstances or withdraws from all courses for which a punitive grade is or will be assigned, VA will terminate educational assistance for—

        (i) Residence training effective the last date of attendance; and

        (ii) Independent study or distance learning effective on the official date of change in status under the practices of the institution of higher learning.

        (3) When an eligible individual withdraws from an approved correspondence course offered by an institution of higher learning, VA will terminate educational assistance effective the date the last lesson was serviced.

        (d)  If the eligible individual reduces the rate of pursuit by withdrawing from one or more courses in a program of education but continues training in one or more courses, VA will apply the provisions of this paragraph.

        (1) If the reduction in the rate of pursuit occurs other than on the first date of the term, VA will reduce the eligible individual's educational assistance effective the end of the month during which the reduction occurred when the circumstances in either paragraphs (d)(1)(i) or (d)(1)(ii) apply—

        (i) A nonpunitive grade is assigned for the course from which the eligible individual withdraws and the withdrawal occurs with mitigating circumstances.

        (ii) A punitive grade is assigned for the course from which the eligible individual withdraws.

        (2) VA will reduce educational assistance effective the first date of the enrollment in which the reduction occurs when—

        (i) The reduction occurs on the first date of the term; or

        (ii) A nonpunitive grade is assigned for the course from which the eligible individual withdraws, and—

        (A) The eligible individual does not withdraw because he or she is called to active duty service, or in the case of an individual serving on active duty, he or she is not ordered to a new duty location or assignment, or is not ordered to perform an increased amount of work, and

        (B) The withdrawal occurs without mitigating circumstances.

        (3) An eligible individual enrolled in several courses within a program of education, who reduces his or her rate of pursuit by completing one or more of the courses while continuing training in others, may receive an interval payment based on the total number of enrolled courses he or she completed if the requirements of § 21.9680(b)(5) are met. If those requirements are not met, VA will reduce the eligible individual's educational assistance effective the end of the month during which the individual completed each course (or courses).

        (e)  If an eligible individual's course or period of enrollment ends, the effective date of reduction or discontinuance of the individual's award of educational assistance will be the ending date of the course or period of enrollment as certified by the institution of higher learning.

        (f)  (1) If an eligible individual does not officially withdraw from a particular course and the individual receives a nonpunitive grade for that course, VA will reduce the individual's educational assistance effective the first date of enrollment for the term in which the grade applies unless mitigating circumstances are found.

        (2) If an eligible individual does not officially withdraw from a particular course and the individual receives a nonpunitive grade for that course, VA will reduce the individual's educational assistance effective the end of the month during which the student last attended when mitigating circumstances are found.

        (3) If an eligible individual receives an incomplete grade for a course or courses, VA will delay creating an overpayment for such course or courses to allow the individual an opportunity to complete the course or courses. However, if the incomplete grade is not replaced with a punitive grade, VA will reduce the individual's educational assistance in accordance with paragraph (f)(1) or (2) of this section effective the earliest of—

        (i) The last date permitted by the IHL to complete the course;

        (ii) The date the IHL permanently assigns a nonpunitive grade;

        (2) The end of the month during which VA made the decision to discontinue payments under § 21.9630 or § 21.4210(d) and (g), if the Director of the VA Regional Processing Office of jurisdiction did not suspend payments before the discontinuance.

        (h)  If a State approving agency disapproves a program of education in which an eligible individual is enrolled, the discontinuance date of payment of educational assistance will be—

        (2) The end of the month in which the disapproval occurred, provided that the Director of the VA Regional Processing Office of jurisdiction did not suspend payments before the disapproval.

        (j)  If an eligible individual's progress is unsatisfactory, his or her educational assistance will be discontinued effective the earlier of the following:

        (1) The end of the month during which the institution of higher learning discontinues the eligible individual's enrollment; or

        (k)  Payments may not be based on false or misleading statements, claims, or reports. If educational assistance is paid as the result of an individual submitting false or misleading statements, claims, or reports, VA will apply the provisions of § 21.4006 and 21.4007 in the same manner as they apply to veterans under 38 U.S.C. chapter 30.

        (l) If a conflict of interest exists between an officer or employee of VA and an institution of higher learning, or an officer or employee of a State approving agency and an institution of higher learning, as provided in § 21.4005, and VA does not grant a waiver, the discontinuance date of educational assistance will be 30 days after the date of the letter notifying the eligible individual of the conflicting interests.

        (m)  (1) The provisions of this paragraph apply to an eligible individual whose educational assistance must be discontinued or who becomes restricted to payment of educational assistance at a reduced rate under § 21.9675(c) (based on incarceration in a Federal, State, local, or other penal institution or correctional facility due to a felony conviction).

        (2) The reduced rate or discontinuance will be effective the latest of the following—

        (i) The first day of the enrollment period for which all or part of the eligible individual's tuition and fees were paid by a Federal (other than one administered by VA), State, or local program;

        (ii) The first day of the enrollment period in which the eligible individual is incarcerated in a Federal, State, local, or other penal institution or correctional facility; or

        (iii) The beginning date of the award as determined by § 21.9625.

        (i) For established charges, the last date of the certified enrollment period,

        (ii) For the monthly housing allowance, the end of the month during which the reduction or withdrawal occurred, and

        (iii) For the “book stipend”, the last date of the period covered by the book stipend payment.

        (2) If an individual enrolled in an institution of higher learning that does not regularly operate on the quarter or semester system exhausts his or her entitlement under 38 U.S.C. chapter 33 after the individual has completed more than half of the course, the ending date will be the earlier of the following—

        (i) The last day of the course, or

        (ii) 12 weeks from the day the entitlement is exhausted.

        (3) If an individual enrolled in an institution of higher learning that does not regularly operate on the quarter or semester system exhausts his or her entitlement under 38 U.S.C. chapter 33 before the individual has completed more than half of the course, the effective ending date will be the date the entitlement was exhausted.

        (q)  (1) If VA does not receive the required verification of attendance in a timely manner for an eligible individual enrolled in a course or courses at an institution of higher learning in a program of education not leading to a standard college degree, VA will terminate payments effective the last date of the last period for which verification of the eligible individual's attendance was received. If VA later receives the verification, VA will make any adjustment on the basis of the facts found.

        (2) If VA does not receive verification of enrollment within 60 days of the first day of the term, quarter, semester, or course for which the advance payment was made, VA will determine the actual facts and make an adjustment, if required.

        (r)  (1) When an administrative error or error in judgment by VA, the Department of Defense, or the Department of Homeland Security with respect to the Coast Guard when it is not operating as a service in the Navy, is the sole cause of an erroneous award, the award will be reduced or terminated effective the date of last payment.

        (2) When a payee receives an erroneous award of educational assistance as the result of providing false information or withholding information necessary to determine eligibility to the award, the effective date of the reduction or discontinuance will be the effective date of the award, or the day before the act, whichever is later. The date of the reduction or discontinuance will not be before the last date on which the individual was entitled to payment of educational assistance.

        (s)  If an eligible individual must forfeit his or her educational assistance due to fraud, the ending date of payment of educational assistance will be the later of—

        (u) If there is a change in the applicable law or VA issue, or in VA's application of the law or issue, VA will use the provisions of § 3.114(b) of this chapter to determine the ending date of the eligible individual's educational assistance.

        (v)  If an eligible individual is entitled to an increase (“kicker”) in the monthly rate of educational assistance due to service in the Selected Reserve and loses that entitlement, the effective date for the reduction in the monthly rate payable is the date that the Secretary of the military department concerned determines that the eligible individual is no longer eligible to the increase (“kicker”).

        (x)  If the eligible individual is enrolled in a course offered in whole or in part by independent study, and the course loses its accreditation (or the institution of higher learning offering the course loses its accreditation), the date of reduction or discontinuance will be the effective date of the withdrawal of accreditation by the accrediting agency.

        (y)  The ending date of an award of educational assistance to a dependent who exhausts the entitlement transferred to him or her is the date he or she exhausts the entitlement.

        (z)  If the transferor revokes a transfer of unused entitlement, the date of discontinuance for the dependent's entitlement is the effective date of the revocation of transfer as determined under § 21.9570.

        (aa)  VA will discontinue each award of educational assistance given to a dependent, effective the first date of each such award when—

        (1) The transferor fails to complete the additional active duty service requirement that afforded him or her the opportunity to transfer entitlement of educational assistance; and

        (2) The military department discharges the transferor for a reason other than one of the reasons stated in § 21.9570.

        (bb)  If an eligible individual's educational assistance must be discontinued for any reason other than those stated in paragraphs (a) through (aa) of this section, VA will determine the ending date of educational assistance based on the facts found.

#### § § 21.9636

        § 21.9640   Rates of payment of educational assistance.

#### § § 21.9640

        (a)  Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, VA will apply the applicable percentage of the maximum amounts payable under this section for pursuit of an approved program of education, in accordance with the following table—

        (b)  An individual, other than one on active duty, who is pursuing a program of education at more than one-half time (at a rate of pursuit greater than 50 percent) and who—

        (1) Is enrolled at an institution of higher learning located in the United States, or at a branch of such institution that is located outside the United States, may receive—

        (i) A lump sum amount for established charges paid directly to the institution of higher learning for the entire quarter, semester, or term, as applicable. The amount payable will be the sum of the lower amount of tuition as determined in paragraph (b)(1)(i)(A) and the lower amount of fees as determined in paragraph (b)(1)(i)(B) of this section.

        (A) The amount of tuition payable is the lesser of—

        () The actual amount of tuition charged by the institution of higher learning; or

        () The maximum amount of tuition regularly charged per credit hour to full-time undergraduate in-State students by the public institution of higher learning having the highest rate of regularly-charged tuition per credit hour in the State in which the individual is enrolled or, if the individual is enrolled at a branch located outside the United States, in the State where the main campus of the institution of higher learning is located, multiplied by the number of credit hours in which the individual is enrolled.

        (B) The amount of fees payable is the lesser of—

        () The actual amount of fees charged by the institution of higher learning; or

        () The maximum amount of fees regularly charged full-time undergraduate in-State students in a term, quarter, or semester by the public institution of higher learning having the highest rate of regularly-charged fees in a term, quarter, or semester in the State in which the individual is enrolled or, if the individual is enrolled at a branch located outside the United States, in the State where the main campus of the institution of higher learning is located.

        (C) The lesser amount of paragraph (b)(1)(i)(A) or (B) of this section, divided by the number of days in the individual's quarter, semester, or term, as applicable, to determine the individual's daily rate which will then be multiplied by the individual's remaining months and days of entitlement to educational assistance in accordance with § 21.4020 and § 21.9635(o);

        (ii) Except for individuals pursuing a program of education offered entirely through distance learning, a monthly housing allowance. The monthly housing allowance will be equal to the monthly amount of the basic allowance for housing payable under 37 U.S.C. 403 for a member of the military with dependents in pay grade E-5 using the ZIP code area in which all, or a majority, of the primary institution of higher learning in which the individual is enrolled is located or, if the individual is only pursuing distance learning courses at the primary institution of higher learning, the ZIP code area in which all, or a majority of the institution of higher learning in which the individual is enrolled in one or more resident courses is located; and

        (A) The amount of tuition payable is the lesser of—

        () The actual amount of tuition charged by the institution of higher learning (converted into United States dollars); or

If a school closing that is or may be temporary occurs during an interval, VA will apply any applicable provisions in paragraphs (b)(5)(i) through (b)(5)(v) of this section concerning intervals and in paragraph (5)(vi) of this section concerning temporary school closings. For the purposes of this paragraph, interval means a period without instruction between consecutive school terms, quarters, or semesters or a period without instruction between a summer term and a term, quarter, or semester. (See definitions of divisions of the school year in § 21.4200(b).)

        (i)  In determining whether a student will be paid for an interval, VA will first review the provisions of paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section. If none of the provisions apply, VA will review the provisions of paragraphs (b)(5)(iii), (iv), and (v) of this section to determine if payments may be made for the interval. In determining the length of a summer term, VA will disregard a fraction of a week consisting of 3 days or less, and will consider 4 days or more to be a full week.

        (ii)  VA will make no payment for an interval if—

        (A) The individual's rate of pursuit is one-half time or less on the last day of the certified enrollment period preceding the interval;

        (B) The individual is on active duty;

        (C) The individual requests, prior to authorization of an award or prior to negotiating a check or receiving a direct deposit for educational assistance, that no benefits be paid for the interval period;

        (D) The individual's entitlement applicable to such payment will be exhausted by receipt of such payment, and it is to the advantage of the individual not to receive payment;

        (E) The interval occurs between school years at a school that is not organized on a term, quarter, or semester basis; or

        (F) The individual withdraws from all courses in the term, quarter, semester, or summer session preceding the interval, or discontinues training before the scheduled start of an interval in an institution of higher learning not organized on a term, quarter, or semester basis.

        (iii)  If the individual transfers from one approved school for the purpose of enrolling in and pursuing a similar program of education at the second school, VA may make payments for an interval that does not exceed 30 days. If the student does not enroll in a similar program of education at the second school, VA may not make payments for the interval.

        (iv)  (A) If the individual remains enrolled at the same school, VA may make payment for an interval which does not exceed 8 weeks and which occurs between:

        () Semesters or quarters,

        () A semester or quarter and a term that is at least as long as the interval,

        () A semester or quarter and a summer term that is at least as long as the interval,

        () Consecutive terms (other than semesters or quarters) provided that both terms are at least as long as the interval, or

        () A term and summer term provided that both the term and the summer term are at least as long as the interval.

        (B) If the individual remains enrolled at the same school, VA may make payment for an interval that does not exceed 30 days and that occurs between summer sessions within a summer term.

        (v)  (A) If a student is enrolled in overlapping enrollment periods whether before or after an interval (either at the same or different schools), VA will determine whether the student is entitled to payment for the interval between the overlapping enrollment periods, and which dates the interval and enrollment periods will be considered to begin and end, as follows:

        () By treating the ending date of each enrollment period as though it were the individual's last date of training before the interval,

        () By treating the beginning date of each enrollment period as though it were the individual's first date of training after the interval,

        () By examining the interval payment that would be made to the individual on the basis of the various combinations of beginning and ending dates, and

        () By choosing the ending date and beginning date that result in the highest payment rate as the start and finish of the interval for VA measurement purposes.

        (B) VA will not reduce the interval rate of payment as a result of training the individual may take during the interval, but VA will increase the interval rate of payment if warranted by such training.

        (vi)  VA may authorize payment for temporary school closings that are due to emergencies (including strikes) or established policy based upon an Executive Order of the President. If a school closing that is or may be temporary occurs in whole or in part during an interval, VA will first review the provisions of paragraph (b)(5)(ii) through (v) of this section to determine if payment may be continued during the interval.

        (A) If payment would not be inconsistent with the provisions of paragraph (b)(5)(ii) through (v) of this section, a determination to authorize payment for a period of a temporary school closing, or to not authorize payment if it appears that either the school closing will not be temporary or payment would not otherwise be in accord with this section, or both, will be made by:

        () The Director of the VA Regional Processing Office of jurisdiction if:

        () The reason for the school clos_i_ng does not result in the closing of a school or schools in the jurisdiction of the Director of another VA Regional Processing Office, and

        () If the reason for the closing is a strike, and the strike lasts, or is anticipated to last, 30 days or less.

        () The Director of Education Service if:

        () The reason for the school clos_i_ng results in the closing of schools in the jurisdiction of more than one Director of a VA Regional Processing Office, or

        () The reason for the closing is a strike, and the strike lasts, or is anticipated to last, more than 30 days.

        (B) A school that disagrees with a decision made under paragraph (b)(5)(vi) of this section may request an administrative review. The review request must be submitted in writing and received by the Director of the VA Regional Processing Office of jurisdiction within one year of the date of VA's letter notifying the school of the decision. A review of the decision will include the evidence of record and any other pertinent evidence the school may wish to submit. The affirmation or reversal of the initial decision based on an administrative review is final. The review will be conducted by the—

        () Director, Education Service, if the Director of the VA Regional Processing Office of jurisdiction made the initial decision to continue or discontinue payments; or

        () Under Secretary for Benefits, if the Director, Education Service, made the initial decision to continue or discontinue payments.

        (c)  VA will make the $500 rural relocation benefit payment after—

        (1) The educational institution has certified the individual's enrollment as provided in § 21.9680;

#### § § 21.9691

        § 21.9695   Overpayments.

#### § § 21.9695

        (a)  In administering educational assistance payable under 38 U.S.C. chapter 33, VA will apply the provisions of §§ 21.4008 and 21.4009 to eligible individuals and, when appropriate, to institutions of higher learning.

        (b)  (1) An overpayment of educational assistance paid to an eligible individual constitutes a liability of that individual unless—

        (i) The overpayment was waived as provided in §§ 1.957 and 1.962 of this chapter, or

        (ii) The overpayment results from an administrative error or an error in judgment. See § 21.9635(r).

        (2) An overpayment of educational assistance paid to the institution of higher learning on behalf of an eligible individual constitutes a liability of the individual unless the individual never attended the term, quarter, or semester certified by the institution of higher learning. If the individual never attended the term, quarter, or semester certified by the institution of higher learning, the institution must return to VA all educational assistance received under the provisions of 38 U.S.C. chapter 33 on behalf of the individual for such term, quarter, or semester.

        (3) The amount of the overpayment of educational assistance paid to the eligible individual, or paid to the institution of higher learning on behalf of the eligible individual, constitutes a liability of the institution of higher learning if VA determines that the overpayment is the result of willful or negligent—

        (i) False certification by the institution of higher learning; or

        (ii) Failure to certify excessive absences from a course, discontinuance of a course, or interruption of a course by the eligible individual.

        (iii) In determining whether an overpayment resulting from the actions listed in paragraphs (b)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section should be recovered from an institution of higher learning, VA will apply the provisions of § 21.4009 (except paragraph (a)(1)) to overpayments of educational assistance under 38 U.S.C. chapter 33.

        (4) VA will determine the amount of an overpayment as follows—

        (i) For an individual who does not complete one or more courses in the certified period of enrollment for which he or she received payment, and who does not substantiate mitigating circumstances for not completing such course or courses, VA will establish an overpayment equal to the amount of educational assistance paid for the course or courses not completed during that certified period of enrollment.

        (ii) For an individual who does not complete one or more courses in the certified period of enrollment, but who substantiates mitigating circumstances for not completing such course or courses, VA will prorate the amount of educational assistance to which he or she is entitled.

        (A) VA will determine the prorated amount of the established charges by dividing the amount the individual was paid for the course or courses not completed by the number of days in the certified enrollment period, and multiplying the result by the number of days from the beginning date of the enrollment period through the last date of attendance. The result of this calculation will equal the amount the individual is due. The difference between the amount of educational assistance paid and the amount of educational assistance the individual is due for the course or courses not completed will be established as an overpayment.

        (B) VA will determine the prorated amount of the monthly housing allowance by determining the amount the individual was entitled to while enrolled and subtracting that amount from the total amount paid. The difference between the amount of the monthly housing allowance paid and the amount of the monthly housing allowance the individual is due will be established as an overpayment.

        (C) Individuals who have substantiated mitigating circumstances will not be charged an overpayment for the lump sum payment for books, supplies, equipment, and other educational costs (“book stipend”).

        § 21.9700   Yellow Ribbon Program.

#### § § 21.9700

        (a)  The “Yellow Ribbon G.I. Education Enhancement Program”, known as the “Yellow Ribbon Program,” permits an institution of higher learning (IHL), at the IHL's option, to enter into an agreement with VA to allow the two parties to provide matching funds to cover a portion of the outstanding amount of established charges not covered under 38 U.S.C. chapter 3313(c)(1)(A).

        (b)  This program is only available to individuals entitled to the 100 percent educational assistance rate (based on service requirements) as shown in the chart in § 21.9640(a) or to their designated dependents using entitlement transferred under § 21.9570, who are pursuing training at an eligible IHL.

        (c)  This program is only available at IHLs located in the United States or at a branch of such IHL that is located outside the United States.

        (d)  VA will enter into an agreement with an eligible IHL located in the United States seeking to participate in the Yellow Ribbon Program based on a general agreement format developed by VA in which the IHL must agree to—

        (1) Provide contributions to eligible individuals who apply for such program at that institution (in a manner prescribed by the institution) on a first-come-first-served basis, regardless of the rate at which the individual is pursuing training (, full-time versus less than full-time), during the academic year;

        (2) Provide contributions during the current academic year and all subsequent academic years in which the IHL participates in the Yellow Ribbon Program and the student maintains satisfactory progress, conduct, and attendance according to the regularly prescribed standards of the institution;

        (3) Limit contributions made on behalf of a participant to funds under the unrestricted control of the IHL (e.g., a scholarship sent directly to an IHL on behalf of an individual or specific group of individuals from a third party may not be included in Yellow Ribbon Program contributions). Funds received directly or indirectly from Federal sources may not be counted toward contributions;

        (4) State the maximum number of individuals for whom contributions will be made during the academic year;

        (5) State the manner (whether by direct grant, scholarship, or otherwise) contributions will be made under the Yellow Ribbon Program;

        (6) State the maximum dollar amount of contributions that may be provided on behalf of any particular individual during the academic year regardless of the rate at which the individual is pursuing training. IHLs may specify different contributions amounts—

        (i) Based on student status ( , undergraduate, graduate, doctoral), or

        (ii) For each subelement of the institution (, college or professional school). The maximum amount specified for each subelement of the IHL will apply to all programs and disciplines offered under such subelement.

        (7) Provide the maximum amount of contributions payable toward the unmet established charges to all participating individuals during each term, quarter, or semester the individual is enrolled if the IHL's total contribution toward the individual's unmet established charges for the term, quarter, or semester, do not exceed the maximum dollar amount payable during the academic year as specified in paragraph (d)(6) of this section.

        (e)  IHLs with multiple campuses may enter into a single Yellow Ribbon Program Agreement if all participating branches and extensions—

        (1) Are listed in the agreement;

        (2) Are subject to the authority of the authorizing official signing the Yellow Ribbon Program Agreement; and

        (3) Have a certifying official or other employee who meets the requirements of § 21.4266(f)(3)(ii) and who has access to the terms of the Yellow Ribbon Program Agreement.

        (f)  VA will match each dollar provided by the school on behalf of an individual; however, the combined amount of contributions under the Yellow Ribbon Program may not exceed the remaining amount of established charges not covered under 38 U.S.C. chapter 3313(c)(1)(A).

        (g)  The most current list of colleges and universities participating in the Yellow Ribbon Program will be available at VA's GI Bill Web site at  The list will include specific information on each school's agreement with VA.

      Pursuit of Courses

        § 21.9710   Pursuit.

#### § § 21.9710

        Except for an eligible individual seeking tuition assistance top-up or reimbursement for taking an approved licensing or certification test, an individual's educational assistance depends upon his or her pursuit of a program of education. Verification of this pursuit is accomplished by various certifications.

        § 21.9715   Advance payment certification.

#### § § 21.9715

        All certifications required by this section shall be in a form specified by the Secretary and shall contain such information as specified by the Secretary. An advance payment under this chapter is only permissible to an individual whose rate of pursuit is greater than half-time, and who is entitled to the monthly housing allowance as provided in § 21.9640(b)(1)(ii) or (b)(2)(ii).

        (a)  In order for an individual to receive an advance payment of the monthly housing allowance, an application or other document must be signed by the individual or the enrollment certification must be signed by an authorized official of the institution of higher learning.

        (b)  All verifications required by this paragraph shall be in a form specified by the Secretary and shall contain such information as specified by the Secretary.

        (1) For each eligible individual receiving an advance payment, an institution of higher learning must—

        (i) Verify enrollment for the individual; and

        (ii) Verify the delivery of the advance payment check to the individual.

        (2) Once the institution of higher learning has initially verified the enrollment of the individual, the individual, not the institution of higher learning, must make subsequent verifications in order to release further payment for that enrollment as provided in § 21.9730.

        § 21.9720   Certification of enrollment.

#### § § 21.9720

        Except as stated in § 21.9680, an institution of higher learning must certify an eligible individual's enrollment before he or she may receive educational assistance.

        (a)  VA does not, as a condition of payment of tuition assistance top-up or advance payment, require institutions of higher learning to certify the enrollments of eligible individuals who either are seeking tuition assistance top-up or, in the cases described in § 21.9715, are seeking an advance payment. VA does not require organizations or entities offering a licensing or certification test to certify that the eligible individual took the test. In all other cases, the institution of higher learning must certify the eligible individual's enrollment before he or she may receive educational assistance. This certification must be in a form specified by the Secretary and contain such information as specified by the Secretary.

        (b)  (1) Institutions of higher learning that offer courses on a term, quarter, or semester basis will report enrollment for the term, quarter, semester, ordinary school year, or ordinary school year plus summer term. If the certification covers two or more terms, the institution of higher learning will report each term, quarter, or semester separately.

        (2) Institutions of higher learning organized on a year-round basis that do not offer courses on a term, quarter, or semester basis will report enrollment for the length of the course. The certification will include a report of the dates during which the institution of higher learning closes for any intervals designated in its approval data as breaks between school years.

        (3) When an eligible individual enrolls in a distance learning program leading to a standard college degree, the institution of higher learning's certification will include—

        (i) The enrollment date; and

        (ii) The ending date for the period being certified. If the institution of higher learning has no prescribed maximum time for completion, the certification must include an ending date based on the educational institution's estimate for completion.

        § 21.9721   xxx

#### § § 21.9721

        § 21.9725   Progress and conduct.

#### § § 21.9725

        (a)  In order to receive payments of educational assistance under 38 U.S.C. chapter 33 for pursuit of a program of education, an individual must maintain satisfactory progress. VA will discontinue payments of educational assistance if the individual does not maintain satisfactory progress. Progress is unsatisfactory if the individual does not satisfactorily progress according to the regularly prescribed standards of the institution of higher learning he or she is attending.

        (b)  In order to receive educational assistance for pursuit of a program of education, an individual must maintain satisfactory conduct according to the regularly prescribed standards and practices of the institution of higher learning in which he or she is enrolled. If the individual will no longer be retained as a student or will not be readmitted as a student by the institution of higher learning in which he or she is enrolled, VA will discontinue educational assistance, unless further development establishes that the institution of higher learning's action is wrongfully retaliatory in nature.

        (c)  In order to receive educational assistance for pursuit of a program of education, an individual must maintain satisfactory attendance. VA will discontinue educational assistance if the individual does not maintain satisfactory attendance. Attendance is unsatisfactory if the individual does not attend according to the regularly prescribed standards of the institution of higher learning in which he or she is enrolled.

        (d)  (1) An eligible individual may be reentered following discontinuance because of unsatisfactory attendance, conduct, or progress when either:

        (i) The individual resumes enrollment at the same institution of higher learning in the same program of education and the institution of higher learning has both approved the individual's reenrollment and certified it to VA; or

        (ii) VA determines that—

        (A) The cause of the unsatisfactory attendance, conduct or progress has been removed, and

        (B) The program that the individual now proposes to pursue is suitable to his or her aptitudes, interests, and abilities.

        (2) Reentrance may be for the same program, a revised program, or an entirely different program depending on the cause of the discontinuance and the removal of that cause.

        § 21.9735   Other required reports.

#### § § 21.9735

        VA will apply the provisions of § 21.7156 to individuals and institutions of higher learning under 38 U.S.C. chapter 33 as those provisions are applied to veterans and educational institutions under 38 U.S.C. chapter 30.

        § 21.9740   False, late, or missing reports.

#### § § 21.9740

        (a)  Payments may not be based on false or misleading statements, claims or reports. VA will apply the provisions of §§ 21.4006 and 21.4007 to any individual who submits false or misleading claims, statements, or reports in connection with benefits payable under 38 U.S.C. chapter 33 in the same manner as they are applied to people who make similar false or misleading claims for benefits payable under 38 U.S.C. chapter 36.

        (b)  (1) VA may hold an institution of higher learning liable for overpayments that result from the institution of higher learning's willful or negligent failure to report excessive absences from a course, discontinuance of a course, or interruption of a course by an individual or from willful or negligent false certification by the institution of higher learning. See § 21.9695(b).

        (2) If an institution of higher learning willfully and knowingly submits a false report or certification, VA may disapprove that institution of higher learning's programs of education for further enrollments and may discontinue educational assistance to eligible individuals already enrolled. In doing so, VA will apply §§ 21.4210 through 21.4216.

        § 21.9745   Reporting fee.

#### § § 21.9745

        In determining the amount of the reporting fee payable to institutions of higher learning for furnishing required reports, VA will apply the provisions of § 21.4206 in the same manner as they are applied in the administration of 38 U.S.C. chapter 36.

      Course Assessment

        § 21.9750   Course measurement.

#### § § 21.9750

        VA will calculate an individual's rate of pursuit of an approved program of education during the individual's period of enrollment in accordance with this section. For the purpose of this chapter, VA will consider any rate of pursuit higher than 50 percent to be more than one-half time training.

        (a)  If the courses are measured in credit hours, then the number of credit hours the individual is taking in a term, quarter, or semester will be divided by the minimum number of credit hours considered to be full-time pursuit in a term, quarter, or semester at the institution of higher learning as provided in paragraph (c) of this section. The resulting percentage will be the individual's rate of pursuit.

        (b)  If the courses are measured in clock hours, VA will—

        (1) Convert the clock hours to equivalent credit hours by—

        (i) Adding the total number of clock hours pursued during the term, quarter or semester;

        (ii) Dividing the sum of paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section by the total number of weeks in the term; and

        (iii) Multiplying the result of paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section rounded to the nearest hundredth by—

        (A) If the institution of higher learning measures courses using both credit and clock hours, the decimal determined by dividing the number of credit hours considered full-time at the institution by the number of clock hours considered full-time at the institution.

        (B) If the institution of higher learning only measures courses using clock hours, the decimal determined by dividing 14 credit hours by the number of clock hours considered full-time at the institution.

        (2) Divide the result of paragraph (b)(1) rounded to the nearest hundredth by the minimum number of credit hours considered to be full-time pursuit in a term, quarter, or semester as provided in paragraph (c) of this section. The resulting percentage will be the individual's rate of pursuit.

        (c) Fourteen credit hours are full-time unless the institution of higher learning certifies that all undergraduate students enrolled for 13 credit hours, or for 12 credit hours, are charged full-time tuition or are considered full-time for other administrative purposes.

        (d)  If an individual using transferred entitlement is eligible for pursuit of a secondary school diploma or equivalency certificate, VA will determine the rate of pursuit in accordance with this paragraph. For individuals pursuing high school courses measured in—

        (1) Credit hours, VA will use the formula in paragraph (a) of this section.

        (2) Clock hours, VA will use the formula in paragraph (b) of this section.

        (3) Units, VA will convert the units to credit hours as follows—

        (i) Divide the total number of units required for the program of education by 4 (the number of ordinary school years generally required for completion);

        (ii) Round the result of paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section to the nearest whole number.

        (iii) Multiply the result of paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section by:

        (A) 1.0 to determine the number of units required for a rate of pursuit equal to 100 percent. This number is equivalent to 14 credit hours;

        (B) .75 to determine the number of units required for a rate of pursuit equal to 75 percent. An individual will be considered to be enrolled in 10.5 credit hours for any number of units equal to or greater than the number determined in this paragraph but less than the number determined in paragraph (d)(3)(iii)(A) of this section;

        (C) .50 to determine the number of units required for a rate of pursuit equal to 50 percent. An individual will be considered to be enrolled in 7 credit hours for any number of units equal to or greater than the number determined in this paragraph but less than the number determined in paragraph (d)(3)(iii)(B) of this section;

        (D) .25 to determine the number of units required for a rate of pursuit equal to 25 percent. An individual will be considered to be enrolled in 3.5 credit hours for any number of units up to the number determined in paragraph (d)(3)(iii)(C) of this section.

An assurance of compliance with these Title IX regulations shall not be satisfactory to the designated agency official if the applicant or recipient to whom such assurance applies fails to commit itself to take whatever remedial action is necessary in accordance with § 23.110(a) to eliminate existing discrimination on the basis of sex or to eliminate the effects of past discrimination whether occurring prior to or subsequent to the submission to the designated agency official of such assurance.

      (b)  (1) In the case of Federal financial assistance extended to provide real property or structures thereon, such assurance shall obligate the recipient or, in the case of a subsequent transfer, the transferee, for the period during which the real property or structures are used to provide an education program or activity.

      § 23.125   Effect of other requirements.

#### § § 23.125

      (a)  The obligations imposed by these Title IX regulations are independent of, and do not alter, obligations not to discriminate on the basis of sex imposed by Executive Order 11246, 3 CFR, 1964-1965 Comp., p. 339; as amended by Executive Order 11375, 3 CFR, 1966-1970 Comp., p. 684; as amended by Executive Order 11478, 3 CFR, 1966-1970 Comp., p. 803; as amended by Executive Order 12087, 3 CFR, 1978 Comp., p. 230; as amended by Executive Order 12107, 3 CFR, 1978 Comp., p. 264; sections 704 and 855 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 295m, 298b-2); Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000e ); the Equal Pay Act of 1963 (29 U.S.C. 206); and any other Act of Congress or Federal regulation.

      (b)  The obligation to comply with these Title IX regulations is not obviated or alleviated by any State or local law or other requirement that would render any applicant or student ineligible, or limit the eligibility of any applicant or student, on the basis of sex, to practice any occupation or profession.

      (c)  The obligation to comply with these Title IX regulations is not obviated or alleviated by any rule or regulation of any organization, club, athletic or other league, or association that would render any applicant or student ineligible to participate or limit the eligibility or participation of any applicant or student, on the basis of sex, in any education program or activity operated by a recipient and that receives Federal financial assistance.

Such notification shall contain such information, and be made in such manner, as the designated agency official finds necessary to apprise such persons of the protections against discrimination assured them by Title IX and these Title IX regulations, but shall state at least that the requirement not to discriminate in education programs or activities extends to employment therein, and to admission thereto unless §§ 23.300 through 23.310 do not apply to the recipient, and that inquiries concerning the application of Title IX and these Title IX regulations to such recipient may be referred to the employee designated pursuant to § 23.135, or to the designated agency official.

      (2) Each recipient shall make the initial notification required by paragraph (a)(1) of this section within 90 days of September 29, 2000 or of the date these Title IX regulations first apply to such recipient, whichever comes later, which notification shall include publication in:

      (i) Newspapers and magazines operated by such recipient or by student, alumnae, or alumni groups for or in connection with such recipient; and

Such opportunities may be derived from either domestic or foreign sources.

      (d)  (1) This paragraph (d) applies to any recipient that requires participation by any applicant, student, or employee in any education program or activity not operated wholly by such recipient, or that facilitates, permits, or considers such participation as part of or equivalent to an education program or activity operated by such recipient, including participation in educational consortia and cooperative employment and student-teaching assignments.

      (2) Such recipient:

      (A) Proportionate in quantity; and

      (B) Comparable in quality and cost to the student.

#### § § 23.415

      (a) A recipient shall not provide any course or otherwise carry out any of its education program or activity separately on the basis of sex, or require or refuse participation therein by any of its students on such basis, including health, physical education, industrial, business, vocational, technical, home economics, music, and adult education courses.

Recipients shall develop and use internal procedures for ensuring that such materials do not discriminate on the basis of sex. Where the use of a counseling test or other instrument results in a substantially disproportionate number of members of one sex in any particular course of study or classification, the recipient shall take such action as is necessary to assure itself that such disproportion is not the result of discrimination in the instrument or its application.

      (i) Students are selected for award of financial assistance on the basis of nondiscriminatory criteria and not on the basis of availability of funds restricted to members of a particular sex;

      (ii) An appropriate sex-restricted scholarship, fellowship, or other form of financial assistance is allocated to each student selected under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section; and

      (iii) No student is denied the award for which he or she was selected under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section because of the absence of a scholarship, fellowship, or other form of financial assistance designated for a member of that student's sex.

      (b)  (1) A recipient shall not discriminate against any student, or exclude any student from its education program or activity, including any class or extracurricular activity, on the basis of such student's pregnancy, childbirth, false pregnancy, termination of pregnancy, or recovery therefrom, unless the student requests voluntarily to participate in a separate portion of the program or activity of the recipient.

      (2) A recipient may require such a student to obtain the certification of a physician that the student is physically and emotionally able to continue participation as long as such a certification is required of all students for other physical or emotional conditions requiring the attention of a physician.

      (3) A recipient that operates a portion of its education program or activity separately for pregnant students, admittance to which is completely voluntary on the part of the student as provided in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, shall ensure that the separate portion is comparable to that offered to non-pregnant students.

      (4) Subject to § 23.235(d), a recipient shall treat pregnancy, childbirth, false pregnancy, termination of pregnancy and recovery therefrom in the same manner and under the same policies as any other temporary disability with respect to any medical or hospital benefit, service, plan, or policy that such recipient administers, operates, offers, or participates in with respect to students admitted to the recipient's educational program or activity.

      (5) In the case of a recipient that does not maintain a leave policy for its students, or in the case of a student who does not otherwise qualify for leave under such a policy, a recipient shall treat pregnancy, childbirth, false pregnancy, termination of pregnancy, and recovery therefrom as a justification for a leave of absence for as long a period of time as is deemed medically necessary by the student's physician, at the conclusion of which the student shall be reinstated to the status that she held when the leave began.

      § 23.450   Athletics.

#### § § 23.450

      (a)  No person shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, be treated differently from another person, or otherwise be discriminated against in any interscholastic, intercollegiate, club, or intramural athletics offered by a recipient, and no recipient shall provide any such athletics separately on such basis.

      (b)  Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section, a recipient may operate or sponsor separate teams for members of each sex where selection for such teams is based upon competitive skill or the activity involved is a contact sport. However, where a recipient operates or sponsors a team in a particular sport for members of one sex but operates or sponsors no such team for members of the other sex, and athletic opportunities for members of that sex have previously been limited, members of the excluded sex must be allowed to try out for the team offered unless the sport involved is a contact sport. For the purposes of these Title IX regulations, contact sports include boxing, wrestling, rugby, ice hockey, football, basketball, and other sports the purpose or major activity of which involves bodily contact.

      (c)  (1) A recipient that operates or sponsors interscholastic, intercollegiate, club, or intramural athletics shall provide equal athletic opportunity for members of both sexes. In determining whether equal opportunities are available, the designated agency official will consider, among other factors:

      (i) Whether the selection of sports and levels of competition effectively accommodate the interests and abilities of members of both sexes;

      (ii) The provision of equipment and supplies;

      (iii) Scheduling of games and practice time;

      (iv) Travel and per diem allowance;

      (viii) Provision of medical and training facilities and services;

      (ix) Provision of housing and dining facilities and services;

      (x) Publicity.

      (2) For purposes of paragraph (c)(1) of this section, unequal aggregate expenditures for members of each sex or unequal expenditures for male and female teams if a recipient operates or sponsors separate teams will not constitute noncompliance with this section, but the designated agency official may consider the failure to provide necessary funds for teams for one sex in assessing equality of opportunity for members of each sex.

      (d)  A recipient that operates or sponsors interscholastic, intercollegiate, club, or intramural athletics at the elementary school level shall comply fully with this section as expeditiously as possible but in no event later than one year from September 29, 2000. A recipient that operates or sponsors interscholastic, intercollegiate, club, or intramural athletics at the secondary or postsecondary school level shall comply fully with this section as expeditiously as possible but in no event later than three years from September 29, 2000.

      general provisions

        § 36.4203   Eligibility of the veteran for the manufactured home loan benefit under 38 U.S.C. 3712.

#### § § 36.4203

        (a) To be eligible for the manufactured home loan benefit a veteran must have loan guaranty entitlement for manufactured home purposes available for use. Notwithstanding the provisions of § 36.4205(e), the Secretary may exclude the amount of guaranty entitlement used for any guaranteed manufactured home loan provided:

        (1) The property which served as security for the loan has been disposed of by the veteran, or has been destroyed by fire or other natural hazard; and

        (2)(i) The loan has been repaid in full or the Secretary has been released from liability as to the loan, or if the Secretary has suffered a loss on said loan, such loss has been paid in full; or

        (ii) A veteran-transferee has agreed to assume the outstanding balance on the loan and consented to the use of his or her entitlement to the extent the entitlement of the veteran-transferor had been used originally, and the veteran-transferee otherwise meets the requirements of 38 U.S.C. chapter 37.

        (3) In a case in which the veteran still owns a property purchased with a VA-guaranteed loan, the Secretary may, one time only, restore entitlement if:

        (i) The loan has been repaid in full, or, if the Secretary has suffered a loss on the loan, the loss has been paid in full; or

        (ii) The Secretary has been released from liability as to the loan and, if the Secretary has suffered a loss on the loan, the loss has been paid in full.

        (4) The Secretary may, in any case involving circumstances deemed appropriate, waive either or both of the requirements set forth in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2)(i) of this section.

        (b) A veteran may use his or her remaining home loan guaranty entitlement for any purpose authorized by 38 U.S.C. 3710, 3711, or 3712 except that a veteran who has purchased a manufactured home unit may not purchase a second manufactured home unit until the unit which secured the first loan has been disposed of by the veteran or has been destroyed by fire or other natural hazard.

        (c) The available entitlement of a veteran will be determined by the Secretary as of the date of receipt of an application for guaranty of a manufactured home loan or loan report. Such date of receipt shall be the date the application or loan report is date stamped into the Department of Veterans Affairs. Eligibility derived from the most recent period of service (1) shall cancel any unused entitlement derived from any earlier period of service, and (2) shall be reduced by the amount by which entitlement from service during any earlier period has been used to obtain a direct, guaranteed, or insured loan:

        (i) On property which the veteran owns at the time of application; or

        (ii) As to which the Secretary has incurred actual liability or loss, unless in the event of loss or the incurrence and payment of such liability by the Secretary the resulting indebtedness of the veteran to the United States has been paid in full.

        (g) An itemized list of all items included in the manufactured home loan as enumerated in § 36.4232 shall be provided to both the purchaser and the Secretary. At the time of loan origination an independent fee inspection shall be conducted to assure that all items included in the loan amount are accounted for and in place. A similar inspection will be conducted in the event of repossession immediately prior to repossession. The costs of the fee inspections may be included in the loan amount or the claim amount and charged to the borrower pursuant to the provisions of § 36.4232 (a) and (b).

        (h) The cost of the transaction which cannot be paid from the proceeds of the loan must be paid by the veteran in cash from the veteran's own resources. Except for interest rate reduction refinancing loans pursuant to paragraph (a)(7) of this section or loans to refinance a manufactured home and to buy a lot pursuant to paragraph (a)(8) of this section, closing costs and prepaid items incident to the real estate portion of any manufactured home loan must be paid in cash and may not be included in the loan amount.

        § 36.4205   Computation of guaranty.

#### § § 36.4205

        (a) The amount of guaranty in respect to a loan guaranteed under 38 U.S.C. 3712 shall be forty (40) percent of the original principal amount of the loan or $20,000, whichever is less. With respect to a loan guaranteed under 38 U.S.C. 3712(a)(1)(F), the dollar amount of guaranty may not exceed the original dollar amount of guaranty on the loan being refinanced. With respect to a loan guaranteed under 38 U.S.C. 3712(a)(1)(G), the dollar amount of guaranty previously used to obtain a manufactured unit loan may be transferred pursuant to § 36.4224(b) for use in refinancing the unit when simultaneously acquiring a lot.

        (b) Subject to the provisions of paragraph (c) of § 36.4203, the following formulas will determine the amount of guaranty entitlement which remains available to an eligible veteran after prior use of entitlement:

        (1) If a veteran previously secured a nonrealty (business) loan, the amount of nonrealty entitlement used is doubled and subtracted from $36,000. The sum remaining is the amount of available entitlement for use not to exceed $20,000 for manufactured home purposes.

        (2) If a veteran previously secured a realty (home) loan, the amount of realty (home) loan entitlement used is subtracted from $36,000. The sum remaining is the amount of available entitlement for use not to exceed $20,000 for manufactured home purposes.

        (3) If a veteran previously secured a manufactured home loan, the amount of entitlement used for manufactured home purposes is subtracted from $36,000. The sum remaining is the amount of available entitlement for use for home loan purposes only. To determine the amount of additional entitlement available for manufactured home purposes, the amount of entitlement previously used for manufactured home purposes is subtracted from $20,000. Except for manufactured home loans to be obtained pursuant to 38 U.S.C. 3712(a)(1)(F) or (G), the sum remaining is the amount of available entitlement for use for manufactured home purposes.

        (c) For the purpose of computing the remaining guaranty benefit to which a veteran is entitled, manufactured home and manufactured home lot loans guaranteed prior to October 1, 1978, shall be taken into consideration as if made subsequent thereto, and the veteran's entitlement will be reduced by the amount of the Secretary's guaranty issued in the particular loan transaction.

        (d) A guaranty is reduced or increased pro rata with any deduction or increase in the amount of the guaranteed indebtedness, but in no event will the amount payable on a guaranty exceed the amount of the original guaranty or the percentage of the indebtedness corresponding to that of the original guaranty.

        (e) The amount of any guaranty for a manufactured home or manufactured home lot loan shall be charged against the original or remainder of the borrower's guaranty benefit available for manufactured home purposes. Complete or partial liquidation, by payment or otherwise, of the veteran's guaranteed indebtedness does not increase the remainder of the guaranty benefit, if any, otherwise available to the veteran. When the maximum guaranty available legally to a veteran for manufactured home purposes shall have been granted, no further guaranty for manufactured home purposes shall be available to the veteran.

        (f)(1) The amount of guaranty entitlement, available and unused, of an eligible unremarried surviving spouse (whose eligibility does not result from his or her own service) is determinable in the same manner as in the case of any veteran, and any entitlement which the decedent (who was his or her spouse) used shall be disregarded. A certificate as to the eligibility of such surviving spouse, issued by the Secretary, shall be a condition precedent to the guaranty or insurance of any loan made to a surviving spouse in such capacity.

        (2) For the purpose of obtaining an interest rate reduction refinancing loan pursuant to 38 U.S.C. 3712(a)(1)(F), an unmarried surviving spouse who was a co-obligor under an existing Department of Veterans Affairs guaranteed loan shall be considered to be eligible for the 38 U.S.C. 3712(a)(1)(F) benefit.

        (g) Any evidence of guaranty issued by the Secretary in respect to such loan shall be conclusive evidence of the eligibility of the loan for guaranty and of the amount of such guaranty,  That the Secretary may establish against the original lender, defenses based on fraud or material misrepresentation and that the Secretary may by regulations in force at the date of such issuance establish partial defenses to the amount payable on the guaranty.

        § 36.4206   Underwriting standards, occupancy, and non-discrimination requirements.

#### § § 36.4206

        (a) Except for refinancing loans pursuant to 38 U.S.C. 3712(a)(1)(F), no loan shall be guaranteed unless the terms of repayment bear a proper relationship to the veteran's present and anticipated income and expenses, and the veteran is a satisfactory credit risk, as determined by use of the standards in § 36.4337 of this part.

        (b) Use of the standards in § 36.4337 of this part for underwriting manufactured home loans will be waived only in extraordinary circumstances.

        (c) The lender responsibilities contained in § 36.4337 of this part and the certification required and penalties to be assessed under § 36.4337A of this part against lenders making false certifications also apply to lenders originating VA guaranteed manufactured home loans under the authority of 38 U.S.C. 3712.

        (d) No loan shall be guaranteed pursuant to 38 U.S.C. 3712(a)(1) unless:

        (1) The veteran certifies, in such form as the Secretary shall prescribe, that he or she will _personally occupy the property as his or her home_ or, if the veteran is on active duty status as a member of the Armed Forces and is for that reason unable to occupy the property, the veteran's spouse must certify that he or she will personally occupy the property as his or her home. For the purposes of this section, the words  mean that the veteran as of the date of his or her certification actually lives in the property personally as his or her residence or actually intends upon completion of the loan and acquisition of the manufactured home to move into the home personally within a reasonable time and to utilize the home as his or her residence.

        (2) The veteran certifies, in such form as the Secretary shall prescribe that:

        (i) Neither the veteran, nor anyone authorized to act for the veteran, will refuse to sell or rent, after the making of a bona fide offer, or refuse to negotiate for the sale or rental of, or otherwise make unavailable or deny the dwelling or property covered by this loan to any person because of race, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status, or national origin;

        (ii) The veteran recognizes that any restrictive covenant on the property relating to race, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status, or national origin is illegal and void and any such covenant is specifically disclaimed; and

        (iii) The veteran understands that civil action for preventive relief may be brought by the Attorney General of the United States in any appropriate U.S. district court against any person responsible for a violation of the applicable law.

        § 36.4208   Manufactured home location standards.

#### § § 36.4208

        (a) Any rental site on which a manufactured home to be purchased with a guaranteed loan will be placed must qualify as an acceptable rental site as follows:

        (1) Be located within a manufactured home park or subdivision which is acceptable to the Department of Veterans Affairs; or

        (2) Be a site which is not within a manufactured home park or subdivision provided that (i) the site is determined by the Department of Veterans Affairs to be an acceptable rental site, or (ii) in the absence of a determination by the Department of Veterans Affairs in respect to such site the manufactured home purchaser and the dealer certify to the Secretary as follows:

        (A) Placement of the manufactured home on the site or lot is not a violation of zoning laws or other local requirements applicable to manufactured homes;

        (B) The site or lot is served by water and sanitary facilities which are approved by the local public authority and which are acceptable to the Department of Veterans Affairs;

        (C) The site or lot is served by an all-weather street or road;

        (D) The site or lot is not known to be subject to conditions that may be hazardous to the health or safety of the manufactured home occupants or that may endanger the manufactured home; and

        (E) The site is free from, and the location of the manufactured home thereon will not substantially contribute to, adverse scenic or environmental conditions.

        (b) No manufactured home purchased with a guaranteed loan may be placed on a lot owned by an eligible veteran or on a lot to be purchased or improved with the proceeds of a guaranteed manufactured home loan unless the lot owned or to be so purchased or improved is determined by the Department of Veterans Affairs to be an acceptable manufactured home site.

        (c) A manufactured home park or subdivision which is not approved by the Federal Housing Administration will be acceptable to the Department of Veterans Affairs for the purpose of 38 U.S.C. 3712 if the Secretary determines that the park or subdivision, whether existing or proposed, (1) is designed to encourage the maintenance and development of manufactured home sites which will be free from, and not substantially contribute to, adverse scenic and environmental conditions, and (2) complies otherwise with the applicable standards for planning, construction, and general acceptability prescribed by the Secretary.

        § 36.4209   Reporting requirements.

#### § § 36.4209

        (a) Each loan proposed for guaranty under 38 U.S.C. 3712 shall, unless otherwise provided in the § 36.4200 series, be submitted to the Secretary for approval prior to closing. The Secretary upon determining any such proposed loan to be eligible for guaranty will issue a certificate of commitment.

        (b) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, a certificate of commitment shall entitle the holder to the issuance of the evidence of guaranty upon the ultimate actual payment of the full proceeds of the loan for the purposes described in the original report and upon the submission within 60 days thereafter of a supplemental report showing such fact and:

        (1) That the loan conforms to the terms of the certificate of commitment;

        (2) The identity of all property purchased therewith, including the itemized list required by § 36.4204(f);

        (3) That all property purchased with the proceeds of the loan has been encumbered as required by the § 36.4200 series;

        (4) In respect to any property purchased with the loan proceeds as to which the Secretary issued a certificate of reasonable value which was conditioned upon completion of any construction, repairs, alterations or improvements not inspected and approved subsequent to completion by a compliance inspector designated by the Secretary that such construction, repairs, alterations or improvements have been completed according to the plans and specifications upon which such reasonable value was based; and

        (5) That the loan conforms otherwise to the applicable provisions of 38 U.S.C. chapter 37 and § 36.4200 series.

        (c) A deviation of more than five (5) percent between the estimates upon which the certificate of commitment was issued and the report of final payment of the proceeds of the loan, or a change in the identity of the property acquired by the veteran with the loan proceeds will invalidate the certificate of commitment, unless such deviation or change is approved by the Secretary.

        (d) Upon the failure of the lender to report in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, the certificate of commitment shall have no further effect;  That if the loan otherwise meets the requirements of this section, said certificate of commitment may be given effect by the Secretary, notwithstanding the report is received after the date otherwise required.

        (e) Subject to compliance with the regulations concerning guaranty of manufactured home loans to veterans, the Certificate of Guaranty will be issuable within the available entitlement of the veteran on the basis of the loan reported, except for refinancing loans for interest rate reductions. No certificate of commitment shall be issued, and no loan shall be guaranteed, unless the lender, the veteran, and the loan are shown to be eligible; nor shall guaranty be issued on any manufactured home loan unless the Secretary determines that there has been compliance by the veteran with the certification requirements of 38 U.S.C. 3712(e)(5).

        (f) Any amount of the loan that is disbursed for an ineligible purpose shall be excluded in computing the amount of guaranty.

        (g) Approval by the Secretary pursuant to 38 U.S.C. 3712(c)(1) is required before a lender may close manufactured home loans or manufactured home lot loans on the automatic basis. Evidence of guaranty will be issuable if the loan closed on the automatic basis is reported to the Secretary within 60 days of full disbursement, and upon certification of the lender that no default exists thereunder which has continued for more than 30 days and that the loan complies with paragraphs (b)(2), (3), (4), and (5), (e), and (f) of this section. Upon the failure of the lender to report in accordance with this paragraph the loan will not be eligible for guaranty unless the lender submits with the report a certification that the loan is not in default and an explanation as to why the loan was not timely reported.

        (h) With respect to any loan for which a commitment was made on or after March 1, 1988, the Secretary must be notified whenever the holder receives knowledge of disposition of a manufactured home and/or lot securing a Department of Veterans Affairs guaranteed loan.

        (1) If the seller applies for prior approval of the assumption of the loan, then:

        (i) A holder (or its authorized servicing agent) who is an automatic lender must examine the creditworthiness of the purchaser and determine compliance with the provisions of 38 U.S.C. 3714. The creditworthiness review must be performed by the party that has automatic authority. If both the holder and its servicing agent are automatic lenders, then they must decide between themselves which one will make the determination of creditworthiness, whether the loan is current and whether there is a contractual obligation to assume the loan, as required by 38 U.S.C. 3714. If the actual loan holder does not have automatic authority and its servicing agent is an automatic lender, then the servicing agent must make the determinations required by 38 U.S.C. 3714 on behalf of the holder. The actual holder will remain ultimately responsible for any failure of its servicing agent to comply with the applicable law and Department of Veterans Affairs regulations.

        (A) If the assumption is approved and the transfer of the security is completed, then the notice required by this paragraph shall consist of the credit package (unless previously provided in accordance with paragraph (h)(1)(i)(B) of this section) and a copy of the executed deed, bill of sale, transfer of equity agreement, and/or assumption agreement as required by the VA office of jurisdiction. The notice shall be submitted to the Department of Veterans Affairs with the Department of Veterans Affairs receipt for the funding fee provided for in § 36.4232(e)(3) or § 36.4254(d)(3) of this part.

        (B) If the application for assumption is disapproved, the holder shall notify the seller and the purchaser that the decision may be appealed to the Department of Veterans Affairs office of jurisdiction within 30 days. The holder shall make available to that Department of Veterans Affairs office all items used by the holder in making the holder's decision in case the decision is appealed to the Department of Veterans Affairs. If the application remains disapproved after 60 days (to allow time for appeal to and review by the Department of Veterans Affairs) then the holder must refund $50 of any fee previously collected under the provisions of § 36.4275(a)(3)(iii) of this part. If the application is subsequently approved and the sale is completed, then the holder (or its authorized servicing agent) shall provide the notice described in paragraph (h)(1)(i)(A) of this section.

        (C) In performing the requirements of paragraphs (h)(1)(i)(A) or (h)(1)(i)(B) of this section the holder must complete its examination of the creditworthiness of the prospective purchaser and advise the seller of its decision no later than 45 days after the date of receipt by the holder of a complete application package for the approval of the assumption. The 45-day period may be extended by an interval not to exceed the time caused by delays in processing of the application which are documented as beyond the control of the holder, such as employers or depositories not responding to requests for verifications, which were timely forwarded, or followups on those requests.

        (ii) If neither the holder nor its authorized servicing agent is an automatic lender, the notice to the Department of Veterans Affairs shall include:

        (A) Advice regarding whether the loan is current or in default;

        (B) A copy of the purchase contract; and

        (C) A complete credit package developed by the holder which the Secretary may use for determining the creditworthiness of the purchaser.

        (D) The notice and documents required by this section must be submitted to the Department of Veterans Affairs office of jurisdiction no later than 35 days after the date of receipt by the holder of a complete application package for the approval of the assumption, subject to the same extensions as provided in paragraph (h)(1)(i) of this section. If the assumption is not automatically approved by the holder or its authorized agent pursuant to the automatic authority provisions, $50 of any fee collected in accordance with § 36.4275(a)(3)(iii) of this part must be refunded. If the Department of Veterans Affairs does not approve the assumption, the holder will be notified and an additional $50 of any fee collected under § 36.4275(a)(3)(iii) of this part must be refunded following expiration of the 30-day appeal period set out in paragraph (h)(1)(i)(B) of this section. If such an appeal is made to the Department of Veterans Affairs, then the review will be conducted at the Department of Veterans Affairs office of jurisdiction by an individual who was not involved in the original disapproval decision. If the application for assumption is approved and the transfer of the security is completed, then the holder (or its authorized servicing agent) shall provide the notice required in paragraph (h)(1)(i)(A) of this section.

        (2) If the seller fails to notify the holder before disposing of property securing the loan, the holder shall notify the Secretary within 60 days after learning of the transfer. Such notice shall advise whether or not the holder intends to exercise its option to immediately accelerate the loan or whether an opportunity will be extended to the transferor and transferee to apply for retroactive approval of the assumption under the terms of this paragraph

        § 36.4210   Joint loans.

#### § § 36.4210

        (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the prior approval of the Secretary is required in respect to any manufactured home loan to be made to two or more borrowers who become jointly and severally liable, or jointly liable therefor, and who will acquire an undivided interest in the property to be purchased or who will otherwise share in the proceeds of the loan, or in respect to any loan to be made to an eligible veteran whose interest in the property owned, or to be acquired with the loan proceeds, is an undivided interest only. The amount of the guaranty shall be computed in such cases only on that portion of the loan allocable to the eligible veteran which, taking into consideration all relevant factors, represents the proper contribution of the veteran to the transaction. Such loans shall be secured to the extent required by 38 U.S.C. chapter 37 and the regulations concerning guaranty of manufactured home loans to veterans.

        (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section, the joinder of the spouse of a veteran-borrower in the ownership of property shall not require prior approval or preclude the issuance of a guaranty based upon the entire amount of the loan. If both spouses be eligible veterans, either or both, within permissible maxima, may utilize available guaranty entitlement.

        (c) For the purpose of determining the rights and the liabilities of the Secretary with respect to a loan subject to paragraph (a) of this section, credits legally applicable to the entire loan shall be applied as follows:

        (1) Prepayments made expressly for credit to that portion of the indebtedness allocable to the veteran shall be applied to such portion of the indebtedness. All other payments shall be applied ratably to those portions of the loan allocable respectively to the veteran and to the other debtors.

        (2) Proceeds of the sale or other liquidation of the security shall be applied ratably to the respective portions of the loan, such portion of the proceeds as represents the interest of the veteran being applied to that portion of the loan allocable to such veteran.

        § 36.4211   Amortization—prepayment.

#### § § 36.4211

        (a) To be eligible for guaranty under 38 U.S.C. 3712 a loan shall be amortized fully within the term of the loan in accordance with any generally recognized plan of amortization requiring approximately equal monthly payments. The loan shall not be payable on demand or at sight or presentation, or at a time not specified or computable from the language in the evidence of indebtedness, or on a renewal basis at the option of the holder. The first payment may be deferred not longer than 2 months from the date the loan is closed.

        (b) No guaranteed loan security instrument shall contain any provision giving the holder a right to declare the loan due or otherwise to declare a default if the holder “shall feel insecure” or upon the occurrence of any similar condition at the holder's option, without regard to any act or omission by the debtor.

        (c) The debtor shall have the right, without penalty or fee, to prepay all or not less than one installment of the indebtedness at any time. Credit for any partial prepayment made on other than an installment due date may be postponed to the next installment due date. The holder and the debtor may agree at any time that any prepayment not previously applied in satisfaction of matured installments shall be reapplied for the purpose of curing or preventing any subsequent default. Any prepayment in full of the indebtedness (unpaid principal balance plus earned interest) shall be credited on the date received. In determining the amount required to prepay the indebtedness in full the holder of the loan shall exclude all unearned interest or discount.

        (d) Subject to paragraph (a) of this section any amounts which under the terms of a loan do not become due and payable on or before the last maturity date permissible for loans of its class under the limitations contained in § 36.4204 shall automatically fall due on such date.

        § 36.4212   Interest rates and late charges.

#### § § 36.4212

        (a) In guaranteeing or insuring loans under 38 U.S.C. chapter 37, the Secretary may elect to require that such loans either bear interest at a rate that is agreed upon by the veteran and the lender, or bear interest at a rate not in excess of a rate established by the Secretary. The Secretary may, from time to time, change that election by publishing a notice in the  Provided, however, that the interest rate of a loan for the purpose of an interest rate reduction under 38 U.S.C. 3712(a)(1)(F) must be less than the interest rate of the VA loan being refinanced. This paragraph (a) does not apply in the case of an adjustable rate mortgage being refinanced with a fixed rate loan.

        (b) For loans bearing an interest rate agreed upon by the veteran and the lender, the veteran may pay reasonable discount points in connection with the loan. The discount points may not be included in the loan amount, except for interest rate reduction refinancing loans under 38 U.S.C. 3712(a)(1)(F).

        (c) The rate of interest in instruments securing the indebtedness for all loans may be expressed in terms of add-on or discount.

        (d) Interest in excess of the rate reported by the lender when requesting evidence of guaranty or insurance shall not be payable on any advance, or in the event of any delinquency or default;  that a late charge not in excess of an amount equal to 4 percent of any installment paid more than 15 days after due date shall not be considered a violation of this limitation.

        (e) Adjustable rate mortgage loans which comply with the requirements of this paragraph are eligible for guaranty.

        (1)  Changes in the interest rate charged on an adjustable rate mortgage must correspond to changes in the weekly average yield on one year (52 week) Treasury bills adjusted to a constant maturity. Yields on one year Treasury bills at “constant maturity” are interpolated by the United States Treasury from the daily yield curve. This curve, which relates the yield on the security to its time to maturity, is based on the closing market bid yields on actively traded one year Treasury bills in the over-the-counter market. The weekly average one year constant maturity Treasury bill yields are published by the Federal Reserve Board of the Federal Reserve System. The Federal Reserve Statistical Release Report H.15 (519) is released each Monday. These one year constant maturity Treasury bill yields are also published monthly in the Federal Reserve Bulletin, published by the Federal Reserve Board of the Federal Reserve System, as well as quarterly in the Treasury Bulletin, published by the Department of the Treasury.

        (2)  Interest rate adjustments must occur on an annual basis, except that the first adjustment may occur not sooner than 12 months nor later than 18 months from the date of the borrower's first mortgage payment. The adjusted rate will become effective the first day of the month following the adjustment date; the first monthly payment at the new rate will be due on the first day of the following month. To set the new interest rate, the lender will determine the change between the initial (, base) index figure and the current index figure. The initial index figure shall be the most recent figure available before the date of mortgage loan origination. The current index figure shall be the most recent index figure available 30 days before the date of each interest rate adjustment.

        (3)  Interest rate changes may only be implemented through adjustments to the borrower's monthly payments.

        (4)  The initial contract interest rate of an adjustable rate mortgage shall be agreed upon by the lender and the veteran. The rate must be reflective of adjustable rate lending. Annual adjustments in the interest rate shall be set at a certain spread or margin over the interest rate index prescribed in paragraph (e)(1) of this section. Except for the initial rate, this margin shall remain constant over the life of the loan. Annual adjustments to the contract interest rate shall correspond to annual changes in the interest rate index, subject to the following conditions and limitations:

        (i) No single adjustment to the interest rate may result in a change in either direction of more than one percentage point from the interest rate in effect for the period immediately preceding that adjustment. Index changes in excess of one percentage point may not be carried over for inclusion in an adjustment in a subsequent year. Adjustments in the effective rate of interest over the entire term of the mortgage may not result in a change in either direction of more than five percentage points from the initial contract interest rate.

        (ii) At each adjustment date, changes in the index interest rate, whether increases or decreases, must be translated into the adjusted mortgage interest rate, rounded to the nearest one-eighth of one percent, up or down. For example, if the margin is 2 percent and the new index figure is 6.06 percent, the adjusted mortgage interest rate will be 8 percent. If the margin is 2 percent and the new index figure is 6.07 percent, the adjusted mortgage interest rate will be 8  percent.

        (5)  The lender shall explain fully and in writing to the borrower, no later than on the date upon which the lender provides the prospective borrower with a loan application, the nature of the obligation taken. The borrower shall certify in writing that he or she fully understands the obligation and a copy of the signed certification shall be placed in the loan folder and included in the loan submission to VA. Such lender disclosure must include the following items:

        (i) The fact that the mortgage interest rate may change, and an explanation of how changes correspond to changes in the interest rate index;

        (ii) Identification of the interest rate index, its source of publication and availability;

        (iii) The frequency (, annually) with which interest rate levels and monthly payments will be adjusted, and the length of the interval that will precede the initial adjustment; and

        (iv) A hypothetical monthly payment schedule that displays the maximum potential increases in monthly payments to the borrower over the first five years of the mortgage, subject to the provisions of the mortgage instrument.

        (6)  At least 25 days before any adjustment to a borrower's monthly payment may occur, the lender must provide a notice to the borrower which sets forth the date of the notice, the effective date of the change, the old interest rate, the new interest rate, the new monthly payment amount, the current index and the date it was published, and a description of how the payment adjustment was calculated. A copy of the annual disclosure shall be made a part of the lender's permanent record on the loan.

        (a) The holder shall maintain a record of the amounts of payments received on the obligation and disbursements chargeable thereto and the dates thereof. This record shall be maintained until the Secretary ceases to be liable as guarantor of the loan. For the purpose of any accounting with the Secretary or computation of claim against the Secretary, any holder who fails to maintain such record shall be presumed to have received on the dates due all sums which by the terms of the contract are payable prior to date of claim, and the burden of going forward with evidence and of ultimate proof of the contrary shall be on such holder.

        (b) The lender shall retain copies of all loan origination records on VA guaranteed loan for at least one year from the date of loan closing. Loan origination records include the loan application, including any preliminary application, verifications of employment and deposit, all credit reports, including preliminary credit reports, copies of each sales contract and addendums, letters of explanation for adverse credit items, discrepancies and the like, direct references from creditors, correspondence with employers, appraisal reports, reports on other inspections of the property, and all closing papers and documents.

The costs of such required insurance coverage may be paid for by the veteran. Only the costs for one year may be included in the loan amount.

        (1) Flood insurance will be required on any manufactured home, building or personal property securing a loan at any time during the term of the loan that such security is located in an area identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency as having special flood hazards and in which flood insurance has been made available under the National Flood Insurance Act, as amended. The amount of flood insurance must be at least equal to the lesser of the outstanding principal balance of the loan or the maximum limit of coverage available for the particular type of property under the National Flood Insurance Act, as amended. The Secretary cannot guarantee a loan for the acquisition or construction of property located in an area identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency as having special flood hazards unless the community in which such area is situated is then participating in the National Flood Insurance Program.

        (2) Broad Lender's Protection Insurance or its equivalent is required to protect against loss for any items missing from the manufactured home at time of repossession and to cover repossession expenses including, but not limited to, breakdown and transport charges, permit and export fees, and an amount, limited by the Secretary, of unpaid park rent.

        (b) All monies under such policies covering payment of insured losses shall be applied to restoration of the security or to the loan balance.

        § 36.4223   Interest rate reduction refinancing loan.

#### § § 36.4223

        (a) A veteran may refinance [38 U.S.C. 3712(a)(1)(F)] an existing Department of Veterans Affairs guaranteed loan to reduce the interest rate payable on the Department of Veterans Affairs loan provided the following requirements are met:

        (1) The loan application must be submitted to the Secretary for prior approval unless the veteran is not charged a discount, in which case the loan application may be processed on the automatic basis;

        (2) The loan must be secured by the same real property and/or personal property as the loan being refinanced and the veteran must own the manufactured home and/or manufactured home lot securing the loan; and

        (i) Presently occupy or have previously occupied the manufactured home, a manufactured home on the lot securing the loan, or the manufactured home and the lot securing the loan as his or her home and must certify in such form as the Secretary shall prescribe that the veteran presently or has previously so occupied the manufactured home or a manufactured home on the lot; or

        (ii) When a veteran is on Active Duty status as a member of the Armed Forces and is unable to occupy the manufactured home or a manufactured home on the lot securing the loan as a home because of such status, the veteran's spouse must occupy or must have previously occupied the manufactured home or a manufactured home on the lot as the spouse's home and must certify such occupancy in such form as the Secretary shall prescribe.

        (3) The amount of the refinancing loan may not exceed an amount equal to the sum of the balance of the loan being refinanced and such closing costs as authorized in § 36.4232 or § 36.4254, as appropriate, and a discount not to exceed 2 percent of the loan amount;

        (4) The dollar amount of the guaranty of the 38 U.S.C. 3712(a)(1)(F) loan may not exceed the greater of the original guaranty amount of the loan being refinanced, or 25 percent of the loan; and

        (5) The term of the refinancing loan 38 U.S.C. 3712(a)(1)(F) may not exceed the original term of the loan being refinanced.

        (b) Notwithstanding any other regulatory provision, the interest rate reduction refinancing loan may be guaranteed without regard to the amount of guaranty entitlement for manufactured home purposes available for use by the veteran, and the amount of the veteran's remaining guaranty entitlement for manufactured home purposes shall not be charged for an interest rate reduction refinancing loan. The interest rate reduction refinancing loan will be guaranteed with the entitlement used by the veteran to obtain the loan being refinanced. The veteran's loan guaranty entitlement used originally for a purpose as enumerated in 38 U.S.C. 3712(a)(1)(A) through (E) or (G) and subsequently transferred for use on an interest rate reduction refinancing loan (38 U.S.C. 3712(a)(1)(F)) shall be eligible for restoration when the interest rate reduction refinancing loan or subsequent interest rate reduction refinancing loan on the same property meets the requirements of § 36.4203(a).

        § 36.4224   Refinancing existing manufactured home loan including purchase of lot.

#### § § 36.4224

        (a) A veteran may refinance (38 U.S.C. 3712(a)(1)(G)) an existing purchase money lien on a manufactured home owned and occupied by the veteran as his or her home in conjunction with a loan to acquire a suitable lot on which that manufactured home is or will be located provided the following requirements are met.

        (1) The loan application must be submitted to the Secretary for prior approval;

        (2) The loan must be secured by the same manufactured home which is being refinanced and the real property on which the manufactured home is or will be located.

        (3) The amount of the loan may not exceed an amount equal to the sum of the balance of the loan being refinanced; the purchase price, not to exceed the reasonable value of the lot, as authorized in § 36.4252; the costs of necessary site preparation of the lot as determined by the Secretary; a reasonable discount as authorized in § 36.4204(d)(8) with respect to that portion of the loan used to refinance the existing purchase money lien on the manufactured home, and closing costs as authorized in § 36.4232 or § 36.4254, as appropriate.

        (b) If the loan being refinanced was guaranteed by the Department of Veterans Affairs, the portion of the loan made for the purpose of refinancing an existing purchase money manufactured home loan may be guaranteed without regard to the outstanding guaranty entitlement available for use by the veteran, and the veteran's guaranty entitlement shall not be charged as a result of any guaranty provided for the refinancing portion of the loan. For the purposes enumerated in 38 U.S.C. 3702(b) the refinancing portion of the loan shall be considered to have been obtained with the guaranty entitlement used to obtain the VA-guaranteed loan being refinanced. Guaranty for the refinancing loan shall be computed by first applying to the loan a combined total of the guaranty entitlement used to obtain the VA-guaranteed loan being refinanced and second any additional guaranty entitlement available to the veteran for manufactured home purposes, up to a maximum of $20,000 or forty (40) percent of the original principal amount of the loan, whichever is less.

        § 36.4225   Authority to close manufactured home loans on the automatic basis.

#### § § 36.4225

        (a) Supervised lenders of the classes described in 38 U.S.C. 3702(d) (1) and (2) are authorized by statute to process VA guaranteed manufactured home loans on the automatic basis. This category of lenders includes any Federal land bank, national bank, State bank, private bank, building and loan association, insurance company, credit union or mortgage and loan company that is subject to examination and supervision by an agency of the United States or of any State or by any State.

        (b) Nonsupervised lenders of the class described in 38 U.S.C. 3702(d)(3) must apply to the Secretary for authority to process manufactured home loans on the automatic basis. The following minimum requirements must be met:

        (1)  A minimum of $50,000 of working capital must be maintained. Working capital is defined as the excess of current assets over current liabilities. Current assets are defined as cash or other assets that could readily be converted into cash within 1 year on the normal accounting or business cycle. Current liabilities are defined as obligations that would be paid within a year on a normal accounting or business cycle. The lender's latest financial statements (profit and loss statements and balance sheets), audited and certified by a CPA (certified public accountant), must accompany the application. If the date of the financial statement precedes that of the application by more than 6 months, the lender-applicant must also attach a copy of its latest internal quarterly report. In addition, the lender-applicant must agree that if the application is approved, the applicant will provide within 120 days following the end of each of its fiscal years an audited financial statement to the Executive Director, Loan Guaranty Service for review.

        (2)  The firm must have been actively engaged in originating manufactured home loans for at least the last 2 years. Alternately, each principal officer of the firm who is actively involved in managing origination functions must have a minimum of 2 recent years' total experience in the field of VA manufactured home mortgages in managerial functions in either the present company of employment or in companies other than that of his or her present employment. In either case, every principal officer (president and vice presidents) must submit a resume of his or her experience in the mortgage lending field. Should the secretary and/or treasurer participate in the management of origination functions, they too must submit a resume and meet the minimum experience requirement if the company does not meet the experience requirement. Should the lender or any of its directors or officers ever have been debarred or suspended by any Federal agency or department or any of its directors or officers have been a director or officer of any other lender or corporation that was so suspended, or if the lender-applicant ever had a servicing contract with an investor terminated for cause, a statement of the facts must also be submitted. Lender-applicants will submit individual requests for each branch office they wish to have approved. The parent organization must agree to accept full responsibility for the actions of branch offices.

        (3)  If it is proposed that all loans to be made by the lender will be submitted to its home office for approval or rejection, the lender must have at least one full-time designated underwriter in its home office. If the loans will be approved or rejected by branch managers, the lender must have at least one full-time designated underwriter in each branch. In either event, the designated underwriters must be identified and a resume on each submitted to VA. The underwriters should have at least three years of experience in consumer installment finance. If changes in underwriting personnel occur, the lender must notify VA.

        (4)  The identity of the source(s) of warehouse lines of credit must be revealed to VA and the applicant must agree that VA may contact the named source(s) for the purpose of verifying the information.

        (5)  If the lender-applicant customarily sells the manufactured home loans it originates, it must provide a listing of all permanent investors to whom the loans are sold, including the investor's address, telephone number and names of persons to contact.

        (6)  The lender-applicant must designate one employee to act as liaison on its behalf with the VA. If possible, the lender-applicant should select employees other than VA approved underwriters to act as liaison. Officers from branch or regional offices should also be appointed to act as liaison with local VA offices. The lender must notify VA of any changes in liaison personnel.

        (7)  The lender-applicant must certify to VA that it will not close loans on an automatic basis as a courtesy or accommodation for other mortgage lenders whether or not such lenders are themselves approved to close on an automatic basis. The lender must agree that the processing of forms other than the initial credit application will not be delegated to the dealer or developer.

        (8)  A lender approved for automatic processing may not close manufactured home loans on the automatic basis involving any dealership or manufacturer in which it has a financial interest or which it owns, is owned by, or with which it is affiliated. This restriction may be eliminated for lenders that can provide documentation which demonstrates to VA's satisfaction that (i) the lender and the manufacturer and/or dealer are separate entities that operate independently for each other, and (ii) the percentage of all VA manufactured home loans originated by the lender during at least a one-year period on which payments are past due 90 days or more is no higher than the national average for the same period for all mortgage loans.

        (9)  A lender using an agent to perform a portion of the work involved in originating and closing a VA guaranteed loan on an automatic basis must take full responsibility by certification or corporate resolution for all acts, errors and omissions of the agent and its employees. Any such acts, errors or omissions will be treated as those of the lender and appropriate sanctions may be imposed against the lender and its agent.

        (10)  If approved, lenders must use their automatic authority to the maximum extent possible. Any lender with automatic authority who submits a loan on the prior approval basis will be required to submit an explanation from the designated underwriter as to why the loan was not closed automatically. Such a statement will not be needed for loans that must be processed on the prior approval basis, e.g., joint loans.

        (11)  Lender-applicants meeting the requirements of this section will be approved to close loans on an automatic basis for a 1-year probationary period. Poor underwriting and/or consistently careless processing by the lender during the probationary period will be a basis for withdrawal of automatic authority.

        (12)  In order to be approved as a nonsupervised lender for automatic processing authority, the lender must implement a written quality control system which ensures compliance with VA requirements. The lender must agree to furnish findings under its system to VA on demand. The elements of the quality control system must include the following:

        (i)  Each office of the lender shall maintain copies of VA credit standards and all available VA underwriting guidelines.

        (ii)  The system should ensure the effective corrective measures are taken promptly when deficiencies in loan originations are identified by either the lender or VA. Any cases involving major discrepancies which are discovered under the system must be reported to VA.

        (iii)  The quality control system should be independent of the loan production function.

        (iv)  The review of understanding decisions and certifications must include compliance with VA underwriting requirements, sufficiency of documentation and soundness of underwriting judgments.

        (c) A lender approved to close loans on the automatic basis who subsequently fails to meet the requirements of this section must report the circumstances surrounding the deficiency and the remedial action to be taken to cure it to VA.

        (d) To participate in VA's automatic program nonsupervised lenders of the class described in paragraph 3702(d)(3) of title 38 U.S. Code shall pay fees as follows:

        (1) $500 for new applications;

        (2) $200 for reinstatement of lapsed or terminated automatic authority;

        (3) $100 for each underwriter approval;

        (4) $100 for each agent approval;

        (5) $100 for each regional underwriting office approval;

        (6) A minimum fee of $100 for any other VA administrative action pertaining to a lender's participation in ALP;

        (7) $200 annually for certification of home offices;

        (8) $100 annually for certification of regional offices; and

        (9) $100 annually for each agent renewal.

        (e) Supervised lenders of the classes described in paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) of 38 U.S. Code 3702 participating in VA's Loan Guaranty Program shall pay fees as follows:

        (1) $100 fee for each agent approval; and

        (2) $100 annually for each agent renewal.

        (f) Lenders participating in VA's Lender Appraisal Processing Program shall pay a fee of $100 for approval of each staff appraisal reviewer.

        § 36.4226   Withdrawal of authority to close manufactured home loans on the automatic basis.

#### § § 36.4226

        (a)(1) As provided in 38 U.S.C. 3702(e), the authority of any lender to close manufactured home loans on the automatic basis may be withdrawn by the Secretary at any time upon 30 days notice. The automatic processing authority of both supervised and nonsupervised lenders may be withdrawn for engaging in practices which are imprudent from a lending standpoint or which are prejudicial to the interests of veterans or the Government but are of a lesser degree than would warrant complete debarment or suspension of the lender from participation in the program.

        (2) Automatic processing authority may be withdrawn for failure to meet basic qualifying criteria. For non-supervised lenders, this includes lack of a designated underwriter, failure to maintain $50,000 working capital and/or failure to file required financial statements. For supervised lenders this includes loss of status as an entity subject to examination and supervision by a Federal or State supervisory agency as required by 38 U.S.C. 3702(d). During the 1 year probationary period for newly approved automatic lenders, automatic authority may be withdrawn based upon poor underwriting or consistently careless processing by the lender, as determined by VA.

        (3) Automatic processing authority may also be withdrawn based on any of the causes for debarment set forth in 2 CFR parts 180 and 801.

        (b) Authority to close manufactured home loans on the automatic basis may also be temporarily withdrawn for a period of time under the following schedule.

        (1) Withdrawal for 60 days:

        (i) Automatic loan submissions show deficiencies in credit underwriting, such as use of unstable sources of income to qualify the borrower, ignoring significant adverse credit items affecting the applicant's creditworthiness, etc., after such deficiencies have been repeatedly called to the lender's attention;

        (ii) Employment or deposit verifications are handcarried by applicants or otherwise improperly permitted to pass through the hands of a third party;

        (iii) Automatic loan submissions are consistently incomplete after such deficiencies have been repeatedly called to the lender's attention by VA; or

        (iv) There are continued instances of disregard of VA requirements after they have been called to the lender's attention.

        (2) Withdrawal for 180 days:

        (i) Loans are closed automatically which conflict with VA credit standards and which would not have been made by a lender acting prudently;

        (ii) The lender fails to disclose to VA significant obligations or other information so material to the veteran's ability to repay the loan that undue risk to the Government results;

        (iii) Employment or deposit verifications are allowed to be handcarried by applicant or otherwise mishandled, resulting in the submission of significant misinformation to VA;

        (iv) Substantiated complaints are received that the lender misrepresented VA requirements to veterans to the detriment of their interests (e.g., veteran was dissuaded from seeking a lower interest rate based on lender's incorrect advice that such options were precluded by VA requirements);

        (v) Closing documentation shows instances of improper charges to the veteran after the impropriety of such charges has been called to the lender's attention by VA, or refusal to refund such charges after notification by VA; or

        (vi) There are other instances of lender actions which are prejudicial to the interests of veterans, such as deliberate delays in scheduling loan closings.

        (3) Withdrawal for a period from one year to three years:

        (i) The lender fails to properly disburse loans (e.g., loan disbursement checks returned due to insufficient funds); or

        (ii) There is involvement by the lender in the improper use of a veteran's entitlement (e.g., knowingly permitting the veteran to violate occupancy requirements, lender involvement in sale of veteran's entitlement).

        (4) A continuation of actions that have led to previous withdrawal of automatic authority justifies withdrawal of automatic authority for the next longer period of time.

        (5) Withdrawal of automatic processing authority does not prevent a lender from processing VA guaranteed manufactured home loans on the prior approval basis.

        (6) Action by VA to remove a lender's automatic authority does not prevent VA from also taking debarment or suspension action based on the same conduct by the lender.

        (7) VA field facilities are authorized to withdraw automatic privileges for 60 days, based on any of the violations set forth in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(3) of this section, for nonsupervised lenders without operations in other stations' jurisdictions. All determinations regarding withdrawal of automatic authority for longer periods of time or multi-jurisdictional lenders must be made in Central Office.

        (c) VA will provide 30 days notice of withdrawal of automatic authority in order to enable the lender to either close or obtain prior approval for a loan on which processing has begun. There is no right to a formal hearing to contest the withdrawal of automatic processing privileges. However, if within 15 days after receiving notice the lender requests an opportunity to contest the withdrawal, the lender may submit in person, in writing, or through a representative, information and argument in opposition to the withdrawal.

        (d) If the lender's submission in opposition raises a dispute over facts material to the withdrawal of automatic authority, the lender will be afforded an opportunity to appear with a representative, submit documentary evidence, present witnesses, and confront any witnesses VA presents. The Under Secretary for Benefits will appoint a hearing officer or panel to conduct the hearing.

        (e) A transcribed record of the proceedings shall be made available at cost to the lender, upon request, unless the requirement for a transcript is waived by mutual agreement.

        (f) In actions based upon a conviction or civil judgment, or in which there is no genuine dispute over material facts, the Under Secretary for Benefits shall make a decision on the basis of all the information in the administrative record, including any submissions made by the lender.

        (g) In actions in which additional proceedings are necessary to determine disputed material facts, written findings of fact will be prepared by the hearing officer or panel. The Under Secretary for Benefits shall base the decision on the facts as found, together with any information and argument submitted by the lender and any other information in the administrative record.

        (8) The actual amount charged for flood zone determinations, including a charge for a life-of-the-loan flood zone determination service purchased at the time of loan origination, if made by a third party who guarantees the accuracy of the determination. A fee may not be charged for a flood zone determination made by a Department of Veterans Affairs appraiser or for the lender's own determination.

        (b) Any charge against the borrower properly made under paragraph (a) of this section may be included in the loan and paid out of the proceeds of the loan provided the total loan amount does not exceed 145 percent of the manufacturer's invoice.

        (c)(1) Costs of a credit report (except for 38 U.S.C. 3712(a)(1)(F) or (G) refinancing loans) such additional insurance as the veteran may desire, and any other expenses normally charged to a manufactured home purchaser under local customs may be paid by the borrower other than from the loan proceeds.

A fee of 1 percent of the total amount must be paid in a manner prescribed by the Secretary before a manufactured home unit loan will be eligible for guaranty. Provided, however, that the fee shall be 0.50 percent of the total loan amount for interest rate reduction refinancing loans guaranteed under 38 U.S.C. 3712(a)(1)(F). All or part of the fee may be paid in cash at loan closing or all or part of the fee may be included in the loan without regard to the reasonable value of the property or the computed maximum loan amount, as appropriate. In computing the fee, the lender shall disregard any amount included in the loan to enable the borrower to pay such fee.

        (2) Subject to the limitations set out in paragraph (e)(5) of this section, a fee of one-half of one percent of the loan balance must be paid to the Secretary in a manner prescribed by the Secretary by a person assuming a loan to which section 3714 of chapter 37 of 38 U.S.C. applies.

If payment of the 1 percent fee is more than 30 days after loan closing, interest will be assessed at a rate set in conformity with the Department of Treasury's Fiscal Requirements Manual. This interest charge is in addition to the 4 percent late charge, but the late charge is not included in the amount on which interest is computed. This interest charge is to be calculated on a daily basis beginning on the date of closing, although the interest will be assessed only on funding fee payments received more than 30 days after closing.

        (4) The lender is required to pay to the Secretary electronically through the Automated Clearing House (ACH) system the fees described in paragraphs (e)(1) and (e)(2) of this section and any late fees and interest due on them.

        (5) The fee described in paragraphs (e)(1) and (e)(2) of this section shall not be collected from a veteran who is receiving compensation (or who but for the receipt of retirement pay would be entitled to receive compensation) or from a surviving spouse described in section 3701(b)(2) of title 38, United States Code.

In determining whether a loan for the purchase or improvement of a manufactured home lot is secured by a first lien the Secretary may also disregard a superior lien created by a duly recorded covenant running with the realty in favor of a private entity to secure an obligation to such entity for the homeowner's share of the costs of the management, operation, or maintenance of property, services or programs within and for the benefit of the development or community in which the veteran's realty is located, if the Secretary determines that the interests of the veteran-borrower and of the Government will not be prejudiced by the operation of such covenant. In respect to any such superior lien created after June 6, 1969, the Secretary's determination must have been made prior to the recordation of the covenant.

        (f) In the case of a combination loan or a loan to purchase a lot upon which a manufactured home owned by the veteran will be placed it shall be the responsibility of the lender that the veteran initially obtains or has an estate in the land constituting the manufactured home lot meeting the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section and to obtain and retain a security interest thereon meeting the requirements of paragraph (d) of this section.

        (g) In the case of a combination loan to purchase a manufactured home lot and to refinance an existing purchase money loan on a manufactured home unit which is or will be located on the lot to be purchased, it shall be the responsibility of the lender to assure that the veteran obtains or retains an estate in the manufactured home and in the land meeting the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section and § 36.4234. The lender must also obtain and retain a first lien or the equivalent thereof on the estate of the veteran in both the manufactured home and in the lot on which the manufactured home is located.

        § 36.4254   Fees and charges.

#### § § 36.4254

        (a) Except as provided in § 36.4232 fees and charges incident to origination of a combination loan or a loan to purchase a lot upon which a manufactured home owned by the veteran will be placed which may be paid by the veteran shall be limited, with respect to the real estate portion of the loan, to reasonable and customary amounts for any of the following:

        (1) Fees of the Department of Veterans Affairs appraiser and of compliance inspectors designated by the Department of Veterans Affairs, except appraisal fees incurred for the predetermination of reasonable value requested by others than veteran or lender,

        (2) Recording fees and recording taxes or other charges incident to recordation,

        (3) Credit report,

        (4) That portion of taxes, assessments, and other similar items for the current year chargeable to the borrower and an initial deposit (lump-sum payment) for any tax and insurance account,

        (5) Survey, if required by lender or veteran,

        (6) Title examination and title insurance, if any,

        (7) The actual amount charged for flood zone determinations, including a charge for a life-of-the-loan flood zone determination service purchased at the time of loan origination, if made by a third party who guarantees the accuracy of the determination. A fee may not be charged for a flood zone determination made by a Department of Veterans Affairs appraiser or for the lender's own determination, and

        (8) Such other items as may be authorized in advance by the Under Secretary for Benefits as appropriate for inclusion under this paragraph as proper local variances.

        (b) A lender may charge and the veteran may pay a flat charge not exceeding one (1) percent of the amount of the loan less the portion thereof allocated to the manufactured home:  That such flat charge shall be in lieu of all other charges relating to costs of origination not expressly specified and allowed in this schedule.

        (c) Except for a refinancing loan pursuant to 38 U.S.C. 3712(a)(1)(F) or (G) fees and charges specified in this section may not be included in the loan.

        (d)(1) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (c) of this section and subject to the limitations set out in paragraphs (d)(4) and (d)(5) of this section, a fee must be paid to the Secretary. A fee of 1 percent of the total loan amount must be paid to the Secretary before a combination manufactured home and lot loan (or a loan to purchase a lot upon which a manufactured home owned by the veteran will be placed) will be eligible for guaranty. Provided, however, that the fee shall be 0.50 percent of the total loan amount for interest rate reduction refinancing loans guaranteed under 38 U.S.C. 3712(a)(1)(F). All or part of such fee may be paid in cash at loan closing or all or part of the fee may be included in the loan without regard to the reasonable value of the property or the computed maximum loan amount, as appropriate. In computing the fee, the lender will disregard any amount included in the loan to enable the borrower to pay such fee.

        (2) Subject to the limitations set out in paragraphs (d)(3) and (d)(4) of this section, a fee of one-half of one percent of the loan balance must be paid to the Secretary in a manner prescribed by the Secretary by a person assuming a loan to which section 3714 of chapter 37 of 38 U.S.C. applies. The instrument securing such a loan shall contain a provision describing the right of the holder to collect this fee as trustee for the Department of Veterans Affairs. The loan holder shall list the amount of this fee in every assumption statement provided and include a notice that the fee must be paid to the holder immediately following loan settlement. The fee must be transmitted to the Secretary within 15 days of receipt by the holder of notice of the transfer.

        (3) The lender is required to pay to the Secretary the fee described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section within 15 days after loan closing. Any lender closing a loan, subject to the limitations set out in paragraphs (d)(4) and (d)(5) of this section, who fails to submit timely payment of this fee will be subject to a late charge equal to 4 percent of the total fee due. If payment of the 1 percent fee is made more than 30 days after loan closing, interest will be assessed at a rate set in conformity with the Department of Treasury's Fiscal Requirements Manual. This interest charge is in addition to the 4 percent late charge, but the late charge is not included in the amount on which interest is computed. This interest charge is to be calculated on a daily basis beginning on the date of closing, although the interest will be assessed only on funding fee payments received more than 30 days after closing.

        (4) The lender is required to pay to the Secretary electronically through the Automated Clearing House (ACH) system the fees described in paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) of this section and any late fees and interest due on them. This shall be paid to a collection agent by operator-assisted telephone, terminal entry, or CPU-to-CPU transmission. The collection agent will be identified by the Secretary. The lender shall provide the collection agent with the following: authorization for payment of the funding fee (including late fees and interest) along with the following information: VA lender ID number; four-digit personal identification number; dollar amount of debit; VA loan number; OJ (office of jurisdiction) code; closing date; loan amount; information about whether the payment includes a shortage, late charge, or interest; veteran name; loan type; sale amount; downpayment; whether the veteran is a reservist; and whether this is a subsequent use of entitlement. For all transactions received prior to 8:15 p.m. on a workday, VA will be credited with the amount paid to the collection agent at the opening of business the next banking day.

        (5) The fee described in paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) of this section shall not be collected from a veteran who is receiving compensation or who but for the receipt of retirement pay would be entitled to receive compensation) or from a surviving spouse described in section 3701(b)(2) of title 38 U.S.C.

        (6) Collection of the loan fee in this paragraph does not apply to loans closed prior to August 17, 1984, between October 1, and October 15, 1987, inclusive, between November 16 and December 20, 1987, inclusive, nor to loans closed after September 30, 1989.

#### § § 36.4255

        (a) A loan to finance all or part of the cost of acquisition by the veteran of a lot on which to place a manufactured home owned by the veteran shall be eligible for guaranty,  That:

        (1) The veteran will acquire title to such lot that conforms to the requirements of § 36.4253(a),

        (2) The loan is secured as required by § 36.4253(d),

        (3) The lot is determined by the Secretary to be an acceptable manufactured homesite pursuant to § 36.4208,

        (4) The portion of the loan allocated to acquisition of the lot does not exceed the reasonable value of the lot as determined by the Secretary,

        (5) The loan conforms otherwise to the requirements of the § 36.4200 series.

        (b) The cost of lot acquisition which will not be paid from the proceeds of the loan must be paid by the veteran in cash from his or her own resources.

        (c) For the purpose of this section, acquisition of a manufactured home lot includes:

        (1) The refinancing of the balance owed by the veteran as purchaser under an existing real estate installment contract, and

        (2) The refinancing of existing mortgage loans or other liens which are secured of record on a manufactured home lot owned by the veteran.

      servicing, liquidation of security and claim

        § 36.4275   Events constituting default and acceptability of partial payments.

#### § § 36.4275

        (a) Except as provided in paragraphs (a)(1), (a)(2) and (a)(3) of this section, the conveyance of or other transfer of title to property by operation of law or otherwise, after the creation of a lien thereon to secure a loan which is guaranteed in whole or in part by the Secretary, shall not constitute an event of default, or acceleration of maturity, elective or otherwise, and shall not of itself terminate or otherwise affect the guaranty.

        (1) The Secretary may issue guaranty on loans in which a State, Territorial, or local governmental agency provides assistance to a veteran for the acquisition of a mobile home or lot. Such loans will not be considered ineligible for guaranty if the State, Territorial, or local authority, by virtue of its laws or regulations or by virtue of Federal law, requires the acceleration of maturity of the loan upon the sale or conveyance of the security property to a person ineligible for assistance from such authority.

        (2) At the time of application for a loan assisted by a State, Territorial, or local governmental agency, the veteran-applicant must be fully informed and consent in writing to the housing authority restrictions. A copy of the veteran's consent statement must be forwarded with the loan application or the report of a loan processed on the automatic basis.

        (3) Any housing loan which is financed under 38 U.S.C. chapter 37 and to which section 3714 of that chapter applies, shall include a provision in the security instrument that the holder may declare the loan immediately due and payable upon transfer of the property securing such loan to any transferee unless the acceptability of the assumption of the loan is established pursuant to section 3714.

        (i) A holder may not exercise its option to accelerate a loan upon:

        (A) The creation of a lien or other encumbrance subordinate to the lender's security instrument which does not relate to a transfer of rights of occupancy in the property;

        (B) The creation of a purchase money security interest for household appliances;

        (C) A transfer by devise, descent, or operation of law on the death of a joint tenant or tenant by the entirety;

        (D) The granting of a leasehold interest of three years or less not containing an option to purchase;

        (E) A transfer to a relative resulting from the death of a borrower;

        (F) A transfer where the spouse or children of the borrower become joint owners of the property with the borrower;

        (G) A transfer resulting from a decree of a dissolution of marriage, legal separation agreement, or from an incidental property settlement agreement by which the spouse of the borrower becomes the sole owner of the property. In such a case the borrower shall have the option of applying directly to the Department of Veterans Affairs regional office of jurisdiction for a release of liability in accordance with § 36.4285 of this part; or

        (H) A transfer into an inter vivos trust in which the borrower is and remains a beneficiary and which does not relate to a transfer of rights of occupancy in the property.

        (ii) Any instrument evidencing the loan (, the retail installment contract, promissory note and/or mortgage or deed of trust) shall bear in a conspicuous position in capital letters on the first page of the document in type at least 2  times larger in height than the regular type on such page the following warning: “THIS LOAN IS NOT ASSUMABLE WITHOUT THE APPROVAL OF THE DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS OR ITS AUTHORIZED AGENT.” Due to the difficulty in obtaining some commercial type sizes which are exactly 2  times larger in height than other sizes, minor deviations will be permitted based on commercially available type sizes nearest to 2  times the size of the print on the document. A similar warning in regular size type must appear on every assumption statement provided on a loan to which this paragraph applies.

        (iii) On any loan to which 38 U.S.C. 3714 applies, the holder may charge a reasonable fee, not to exceed the lesser of (A) $300 and the actual cost of any credit report required, or (B) any maximum prescribed by applicable state law, for processing an application for assumption and changing its records. A provision authorizing the collection by the holder of this fee shall be contained in the instrument securing the loan.

        (b) The inclusion in the guaranteed obligation of a provision contrary to the provisions of this section or § 36.4211 shall not impair the right of the holder to payment of the guaranty provided that:

        (1) Default was declared or maturity was accelerated under some other provision of the note, mortgage, or other loan instrument, or

        (2) Activation or enforcement of such provision is warranted under § 36.4280, or

        (3) The prior approval of the Secretary was obtained.

        (c) If the title to real property or a leasehold interest therein which secures a manufactured home loan guaranteed after December 22, 1970, is restricted against sale or occupancy on the ground of race, color, religion, or national origin, by restrictions created and filed of record by the borrower subsequent to that date, such action, at the election of the holder, shall constitute an event of default entitling the holder to declare the unpaid balance of the loan immediately due and payable.

        (d) The holder of any guaranteed obligation shall have the right, notwithstanding the absence of express provision therefor in the instruments evidencing the indebtedness, to accelerate the maturity of such obligation at any time after the continuance of any default for the period specified in § 36.4280.

        (e) If sufficient funds are tendered to bring a delinquency current at any time prior to repossession or foreclosure of the manufactured home the holder shall be obligated to accept the funds in payment of the delinquency, unless the prior approval of the Secretary is obtained to do otherwise.

        (f) A partial payment is a remittance on a loan in default (as defined in § 36.4202(c)) of any amount less than the full amount due under the terms of the loan and security instruments at the time the remittance is tendered.

        (1) Except as provided in paragraph (f)(2) of this section, or upon the express waiver of the Secretary, the holder shall accept any partial payment and either apply it to the obligor's account or identify it with the obligor's account and hold it in a special account pending disposition. When partial payments held for disposition aggregate a full monthly installment, including escrow, they shall be applied to the obligor's account.

        (2) A partial payment may be returned to the obligor within 10 calendar days from date of receipt of such payment, with a letter of explanation only if one or more of the following conditions exist:

        (i) The property is wholly or partially tenant-occupied and rental payments are not being remitted to the holder for application to the loan account;

        (ii) The payment is less than one full monthly installment, including escrows and late charge, if applicable, unless the lesser payment amount has been agreed to under a written repayment plan;

        (iii) The payment is less than 50 percent of the total amount then due, unless the lesser payment amount has been agreed to under a written repayment plan;

        (iv) The payment is less than the amount agreed to in a written repayment plan;

        (v) The amount tendered is in the form of a personal check and the holder has previously notified the obligor in writing that only cash or certified remittances are acceptable;

        (vi) A delinquency of any amount has continued for at least 6 months since the account first became delinquent and no written repayment plan has been arranged;

        (vii) Foreclosure and/or repossession has been commenced by the taking of the first action required for foreclosure/repossession under local law;

        (viii) The holder's lien position would be jeopardized by acceptance of the partial payment.

        (3) A failure by the holder to comply with the provisions of this paragraph may result in a partial or total loss of guaranty or insurance pursuant to § 36.4286(b), but such failure shall not constitute a defense to any legal action to terminate the loan.

        § 36.4276   Advances and other charges.

#### § § 36.4276

        (a) A holder may advance any reasonable amount necessary and proper for the maintenance or repair of the security, or for the payment of accrued taxes, special assessments or other charges which constitute prior liens, or premiums on fire or other hazard insurance against loss of or damage to such property and any such advance so made may be added to the guaranteed indebtedness. A holder may also advance the one-half of one percent funding fee due on a transfer under 38 U.S.C. 3714 when this is not paid at the time of transfer. All security instruments for loans to which 38 U.S.C. 3714 applies must include a clause authorizing an advance for this purpose if it is not paid at the time of transfer.

        (b) In addition to advances allowable under paragraph (a) of this section, the holder may charge against the proceeds of the sale of the security; against gross amounts collected; or, in the computation of a claim under the guaranty, if lawfully authorized by the loan agreement and subject to § 36.4284, any of the following items actually paid:

        (1) Any expense which is reasonably necessary for preservation of the security,

        (2) Court costs in a foreclosure or other proper judicial proceeding involving the security,

        (3) Other expenses reasonably necessary for collecting the debt, or repossession or liquidation of the security, including a reasonable sales commission to the dealer or sales broker for resale of the security,

        (4) Reasonable trustee's fees or commissions paid incident to the sale of real property,

        (5) Reasonable amount for legal services actually performed not to exceed 10 percent of the unpaid indebtedness as of the date of the first uncured default, or $850 whichever is less. In no event may the combined total of the amounts claimed for trustee's fees and legal services (paragraphs (b)(4) and (5) of this section) exceed $850.

        (6) The cost of a credit report(s) on the debtor(s), which is (are) to be forwarded to the Secretary in connection with the claim,

        (7) Reasonable and customary costs of property inspections,

        (8) Any other expense or fee that is approved in advance by the Secretary.

        (c) In claims filed under § 36.4283(f)(4) of this part, the following costs and expenditures actually incurred and paid may be included in the computation of the indebtedness:

        (1) Property preservation or repair costs incurred prior to the date of the liquidation appraisal, to the extent that they contributed to the minimum selling price of the property as determined by the Secretary, and subject to the limitation that they do not exceed the actual cost incurred by the holder, and,

        (2) Costs of loan termination, including, but not limited to:

        (i) The reasonable and customary expense of transporting the home to the site where it will be repaired and/or resold;

        (ii) The cost of the liquidation appraisal;

        (iii) A reasonable amount for legal services actually performed and trustee fees, not to exceed a total of $700;

        (iv) Court costs in a foreclosure or other judicial proceeding involving the security;

        (v) Any other expenses reasonably necessary for repossession of the security or other termination of the loan; and,

        (vi) Any other expense or fee that is approved in advance by the Secretary.

        § 36.4277   Release of security.

#### § § 36.4277

        (a) Except upon full payment of the indebtedness the holder shall not release a lien or other right in or to property held as security for a guaranteed loan, or grant a fee or other interest in such property, without the prior approval of the Secretary, unless in the opinion of the holder such release does not involve a decrease in the value of the security in excess of $500:  That the aggregate of the reduction in the original value of the security resultant from such releases without the Secretary's prior approval does not exceed $500.

        (b) Except upon full payment of the indebtedness or upon the prior approval of the Secretary, the holder shall not release a lien under paragraph (a) of this section unless the consideration received for the release is commensurate with the fair market value of the property released and the entire consideration is applied to the indebtedness, or if encumbrance on other property is accepted in lieu of that released it shall be the holder's duty to acquire such lien on property of substantially equal value which is reasonably capable of serving the purpose for which the property released was utilized.

        (c) Failure of the holder to comply with the provisions of this section shall not in itself affect the validity of the title of a purchaser to the property released.

        (d) The holder shall notify the Secretary of any such release or substitution of security within 30 days after completion of such transaction.

        (e) The release of the personal liability of any obligor on a guaranteed obligation resultant from the act or omission of any holder without the prior approval of the Secretary shall release the obligation of the Secretary as guarantor, except when such act or omission consists of

        (1) Failure to establish the debt as a valid claim against the assets of the estate of any deceased obligor, provided no lien for the guaranteed debt is thereby impaired or destroyed; or

        (2) An election and appropriate prosecution of legally available effective remedies with respect to the repossession or the liquidation of the security in any case, irrespective of the identity or the survival of the original or of any subsequent debtor, if holder shall have given such notice as required by § 36.4280 and if, after receiving such notice, the Secretary shall have failed to notify the holder within 15 days to proceed in such manner as to effectively preserve the personal liability of the parties liable, or such of them as the Secretary indicates is such notice to the holder; or

        (3) The release of an obligor, or obligors, from liability on an obligation secured by a lien on property, which release is an incident of and contemporaneous with the sale of such property to an eligible veteran who assumed such obligation, which assumed obligation is guaranteed on his or her account pursuant to 38 U.S.C. 3712; or

        (4) The release of an obligor or obligors as provided in § 36.4279.

        (5) The release of an obligor, or obligors, incident to the sale of property which the holder is authorized to approve under the provisions of 38 U.S.C. 3714.

        § 36.4278   Servicing procedures for holders.

#### § § 36.4278

        (a)  The holder of a loan guaranteed or insured by the Secretary shall develop and maintain a loan servicing program which follows accepted industry standards for servicing of similar type conventional loans. The loan servicing program established pursuant to this section may employ different servicing approaches to fit individual borrower circumstances and avoid establishing a fixed routine. However, it must incorporate each of the provisions specified in paragraphs (b) through (l) of this section.

        (b)  (1) Loan holders shall establish procedures to provide loan information to borrowers, arrange for individual loan consultations upon request and maintain controls to assure prompt responses to inquiries. One or more of the following means of making information readily available to borrowers is required:

        (i) An office staffed with trained servicing personnel with access to loan account information located within 200 miles of the property.

        (ii) Toll-free telephone service or acceptance of collect telephone calls at an office capable of providing needed information.

        (2) All borrowers must be informed of the system available for obtaining answers to loan inquiries, the office from which the needed information may be obtained, and reminded of the system at least annually.

        (c)  Within 60 days after the end of each calendar year, the holder shall furnish to the borrower a statement of the interest paid and, if applicable, a statement of the taxes disbursed from the escrow account during the preceding year. At the borrower's request, the holder shall furnish a statement of the escrow account sufficient to enable the borrower to reconcile the account.

        (d)  Whenever servicing of a loan guaranteed or insured by the Secretary is transferred from one holder to another, notice of such transfer by both the transferor and transferee, the form and content of such notice, the timing of such notice, the treatment of payments during the period of such transfer, and damages and costs for failure to comply with these requirements shall be governed by the pertinent provisions of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act as administered by the Department of Housing and Urban Development.

        (e)  A holder of a loan guaranteed or insured by the Secretary may collect periodic deposits from the borrower for taxes and/or insurance on the security and maintain a tax and insurance escrow account provided such a requirement is authorized under the terms of the security instruments. In maintaining such accounts, the holder shall comply with the pertinent provisions of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act.

        (f)  In addition to the requirements of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act concerning the duties of the loan servicer to respond to borrower inquiries, to protect the borrower's credit rating during a payment dispute period, and to pay damages and costs for noncompliance, holders shall establish a system for servicing delinquent loans which ensures that prompt action is taken to collect amounts due from borrowers and minimize the number of loans in a default status. The holder's servicing system must include the following:

        (1) An accounting system which promptly alerts servicing personnel when a loan becomes delinquent;

        (2) A collection staff which is trained in techniques of loan servicing and counseling delinquent borrowers to advise borrowers how to cure delinquencies, protect their equity and credit rating and, if the default is insoluble, pursue alternatives to foreclosure;

        (3) Procedural guidelines for individual analysis of each delinquency;

        (4) Instructions and appropriate controls for sending delinquent notices, assessing late charges, handling partial payments, maintaining servicing histories and evaluating repayment proposals;

        (5) Management review procedures for evaluating efforts made to collect the delinquency and the response from the borrower before a decision is made to initiate action to liquidate a loan;

        (6) Procedures for reporting delinquencies of 90 days or more and loan terminations to major consumer credit bureaus as specified by the Secretary and for informing borrowers that such action will be taken; and,

        (7) Controls to ensure that all notices required to be given to the Secretary on delinquent loans are provided timely and in such form as the Secretary shall require.

        (g)  (1) Holders should employ collection techniques which provide flexibility to adapt to the individual needs and circumstances of each borrower. A variety of collection techniques may be used based on the holder's determination of the most effective means of contact with borrowers during various stages of delinquency. However, at a minimum, the holder's collection procedures must include the following actions:

        (i) A written delinquency notice to the borrower(s) requesting immediate payment if a loan installment has not been received within 17 days after the due date. This notice must be mailed no later than the 20th day of the delinquency and state the amount of the payment and of any late charges that are due.

        (ii) An effort, concurrent with the written delinquency notice, to establish contact with the borrower(s) by telephone. When talking with the borrower(s), the holder should attempt to determine why payment was not made and emphasize the importance of remitting loan installments as they come due.

        (iii) A letter to the borrower(s) if payment has not been received within 30 days after it is due and telephone contact could not be made. This letter should emphasize the seriousness of the delinquency and the importance of taking prompt action to resolve the default. It should also notify the borrower(s) that the loan is in default, state the total amount due and advise the borrower(s) how to contact the holder to make arrangements for curing the default.

        (iv) In the event the holder has not established contact with the borrower(s) and has not determined the financial circumstances of the borrower(s) or established a reason for the default or obtained agreement to a repayment plan from the borrower(s), then a face-to-face interview with the borrower(s) or a reasonable effort to arrange such a meeting is required.

        (2) The holder must provide a valid explanation of any failure to perform these collection actions when reporting loan defaults to the Secretary. A pattern of such failure may be a basis for sanctions under 38 CFR 36.4216.

        (h)  When personal contact with the borrower(s) is established, the holder shall solicit sufficient information to properly evaluate the prospects for curing the default and whether the granting of forbearance or other relief assistance would be appropriate. At a minimum, the holder must make a reasonable effort to establish the following facts:

        (1) The reason for the default and whether the reason is a temporary or permanent condition;

        (2) The present income and employment of the borrower(s);

        (3) The current monthly expenses of the borrower(s) including household and debt obligations;

        (4) The current mailing address and telephone number of the borrower(s); and,

        (5) A realistic and mutually satisfactory arrangement for curing the default.

        (i)  (1) The holder shall make an inspection of the property securing the loan whenever it becomes aware that the physical condition of the security may be in jeopardy. Unless a repayment agreement is in effect, a property inspection shall also be made:

        (i) Before the 60th day of delinquency or before initiating action to liquidate a loan, whichever is earlier; and

        (ii) At least once each month after liquidation proceedings have been started unless servicing information shows the property remains owner-occupied.

        (2) Whenever a holder obtains information which indicates that a property securing a loan is abandoned, it shall make appropriate arrangements to protect the property from vandalism and the elements. Thereafter, the holder shall schedule inspections at least monthly to prevent unnecessary deterioration due to vandalism, or neglect. With respect to any loan more than 30 days delinquent, a property abandonment must be reported to the Secretary and appropriate action initiated under 36.4280(e) within 15 days after the holder confirms the property is abandoned.

        (j)  The holder shall maintain individual file records of collection action on delinquent loans and make such records available to the Secretary for inspection on request. Such collection records shall show:

        (1) The dates and content of letters and notices which were mailed to the borrower(s);

        (2) Dated summaries of each personal servicing contact and the result of same;

        (3) The indicated reason(s) for default; and

        (4) The date and result of each property inspection.

        (k)  A summary of collection efforts, the information obtained through such efforts and the holder's evaluation of the reason for the default and prospects for resolution of the default must be included in any notice provided to the Secretary pursuant to § 36.4280.

        (l)  No later than 180 days after the effective date of this regulation, each loan holder shall establish internal controls to periodically assess the quality of the servicing performed on loans guaranteed by the Secretary and assure that all requirements of this section are being met. Those procedures must provide for a review of the holder's servicing activities at least annually and include an evaluation of delinquency and foreclosure rates on loans in its portfolio which are guaranteed by the Secretary. As part of its evaluation of delinquency and foreclosure rates, the holder shall:

        (1) Collect and maintain appropriate data on delinquency and foreclosure rates to enable the holder to evaluate the effectiveness of its collection efforts;

        (2) Determine how its VA delinquency and foreclosure rates compare with rates in various reports published by the industry, investors and others; and

        (3) Analyze significant variances between its foreclosure and delinquency rates and those found in available reports and publications and take appropriate corrective action.

        (m) Holders shall provide available statistical data on delinquency and foreclosure rates and their analysis of such data to the Secretary upon request.

        § 36.4279   Extensions and reamortizations.

#### § § 36.4279

        (a) Provided the debtor(s) is (are) a reasonable credit risk(s), as determined by the holder based upon review of the debtor's (s') creditworthiness, including a review of a current credit report(s) on the debtor(s), the terms of repayment of any loan may, by written agreement between the holder and debtor(s), be extended in the event of default, to avoid imminent default, or in any other case where the prior approval of the Secretary is obtained. Except with the prior approval of the Secretary, no such extension shall set a rate of amortization less than that sufficient to fully amortize at least 80 percent of the loan balance so extended within the maximum maturity prescribed for loans of its class.

        (b) In the event of a partial prepayment pursuant to § 36.4211, the balance of the indebtedness may, by written agreement between the holder and the debtor(s), be reamortized, provided the reamortization schedule will result in full repayment of the loan within the original maturity, and provided the debtor(s) is (are) a reasonable credit risk(s), as determined by the holder based upon review of the debtor's (s') creditworthiness, including a review of a current credit report(s) on the debtor(s).

        (c) Unless the prior approval of the Secretary has been obtained, any extension or reamortization agreed to by a holder which relieves any obligor from liability will release the liability of the Secretary under the guaranty on the entire loan. However, if such release of liability of an obligor results through operation of law by reason of an extension or other act of forbearance, the liability of the Secretary as guarantor will not be affected thereby,  The required lien is maintained and the title holder is and will remain liable for the payment of the indebtedness:  That if such extension or act of forbearance will result in the release of the veteran, all delinquent installments, plus any foreclosure expenses which may have been incurred, shall have been fully paid.

        (d) The holder shall promptly forward to the Secretary an advice of the terms of any agreement effecting a reamortization or extension of a guaranteed loan, together with cop(y)(ies) of the credit report(s) obtained on the debtor(s).

        § 36.4280   Reporting of defaults.

#### § § 36.4280

        The holder of any guaranteed loan shall give notice to the Secretary within 15 days after any debtor:

        (a) Is in default by reason of nonpayment of two full installments; or

        (b) Is in default by failing to comply with any other covenant or obligation of such guaranteed loan which failure persists for a continuing period of 60 days after demand for compliance therewith has been made, except that if the default is due to nonpayment of real estate taxes, the notice shall not be required until the failure to pay when due has persisted for a continuing period of 120 days.

        (c) In the event any failure of the months or for more than 1 month on an extended loan, the holder may then or thereafter give the notice in the manner described in paragraph (e) of this section.

        (d) The notice prescribed in paragraph (e) of this section may be submitted prior to the time prescribed in paragraph (c) of this section in any case where any material prejudice to the rights of the holder or to the Secretary or hazard to the security warrants more prompt action.

        (e) Except upon the express waiver of the Secretary, a holder shall not begin proceedings in court or give notice of sale under power of sale, repossess the security, or accelerate the loan, or otherwise take steps to terminate the debtor's rights in the security until the expiration of 30 days after delivery by certified mail to the Secretary of a notice of intention to take such action; provided, that immediate action as required under 38 CFR 36.4278(i) may be taken if the property to be affected thereby has been abandoned by the debtor, or has been or may be otherwise subjected to extraordinary waste or hazard.

        (f) The notice required under subparagraph (e) of this paragraph shall also be provided to the original veteran-borrower and any other liable obligors by certified mail within 30 days after such notice is provided to the Secretary in all cases in which the current owner of the property is not the original veteran-borrower. A failure by the holder to make a good faith effort to comply with the provisions of this subparagraph may result in a partial or total loss of guaranty pursuant to VA Regulation 36.4286(b), but such failure shall not constitute a defense to any legal action to terminate the loan. A good faith effort will include:

        (1) A search of the holder's automated and physical loan record systems to identify the name and current or last address of the original veteran and any other liable obligors;

        (2) A search of the holder's automated and physical loan record systems to identify sufficient information (e.g., Social Security Number) to perform a routine trace inquiry through a major consumer credit bureau;

        (3) Conducting the trace inquiry using an in-house credit reporting terminal;

        (4) Obtaining the results of the inquiry;

        (5) Mailing the required notices and concurrently providing the Secretary with the names and addresses of all obligors identified and sent notice; and

        (6) Documentation of the holder's records.

#### § § 36.4281

        Upon receiving a notice of default the Secretary may at any time prior to the termination of the borrower's interest in the property require the holder upon penalty of otherwise losing the guaranty to transfer and assign the loan and the security therefor to the Secretary or to another designated by him or her upon receipt of payment of the balance of the indebtedness remaining unpaid to the date of such assignment. Such assignment may be made without recourse but the transferor shall not thereby be relieved from the provisions of § 36.4286.

#### § § 36.4282

        (a) When the holder institutes suit or otherwise becomes a party in any legal or equitable proceeding brought on or in connection with the guaranteed indebtedness, or involving title to, or other lien on, the security, such holder, within the time that would be required if the Secretary were a party to the proceeding, shall deliver to the Secretary, by mail or otherwise, by making such delivery to the loan guaranty officer at the office which granted the guaranty, or other office to which the holder has been notified the file is transferred, a copy of every procedural paper filed on behalf of holder, and shall also so deliver, as promptly as possible, a copy of each similar pleading served on holder or filed in the cause by any other party thereto. Notice of, or motion for, continuance and orders thereon are excepted from the foregoing.

        (b) A copy of a notice of sale under power by a holder or one acting at his or her behest (e.g., trustee or public official) shall be similarly delivered to the Secretary at or before the date of first publication, posting, or other notice, but in any event, except in emergency or when waived by the Secretary, not less than 10 days prior to date of sale. Copy of any other notice of sale served on the holder or of which he or she has knowledge shall be similarly delivered to the Secretary, including any such notice of sale under tax or other superior lien or any judicial sale.

        (c) The procedure prescribed in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section shall not be applicable in any proceeding to which the Secretary is a party, after the Secretary's appearance shall have been entered therein by a duly authorized attorney.

        (d) In any legal or equitable proceeding (including probate and bankruptcy proceedings) to which the Secretary is a party, original process and any other process prior to appearance, proper to be served on the Secretary, shall be delivered to the loan guaranty officer of the office of the Department of Veterans Affairs having jurisdiction of the area in which the court is situated. Within the time required by applicable law, or rule of court, the Secretary will cause appropriate special or general appearance to be entered in the cause by the Secretary's authorized attorney.

        (e) After appearance of the Secretary by attorney, all process and notice otherwise proper to serve on the Secretary before or after judgment, if served on the Secretary's attorney of record shall have the same effect as if the Secretary were personally served within the jurisdiction of the court.

        (f) If following a default the holder does not begin appropriate action within 30 days after requested in writing by the Secretary to do so, or does not prosecute such action with reasonable diligence, the Secretary shall have the option to intervene in, or begin and prosecute to completion any action or proceeding, in the Secretary's name or in the name of the holder, which the Secretary deems necessary or appropriate, and may fix a date beyond which no further charges may be included in the computation of the guaranty claim. The Secretary shall pay, in advance if necessary, any court costs or other expenses incurred by the Secretary, or properly taxed against the Secretary, in any such action to which the Secretary is a party, but may charge the same, and also a reasonable amount for legal services, against the guaranteed indebtedness, or the proceeds of the sale of the security to the same extent as the holder (see § 36.4276), or otherwise collect from the holder any such expenses incurred by the Secretary because of the neglect or failure of the holder to take or complete proper action. The rights and remedies herein reserved are without prejudice to any other rights, remedies, or defenses, in law or in equity, available to the Secretary.

        (g) The holder, no later than 10 days after it has repossessed a property, must advise the Secretary of such repossession. The holder shall proceed thereafter, within a reasonable time after repossession, to terminate the debtors' rights in the property. If it is a legal requirement or if the Secretary requires that the debtors' rights be terminated by public sale, the holder shall follow the procedures set forth in paragraph (b) of this section. Otherwise, the holder shall proceed in the manner set forth in § 36.4283(f).

        § 36.4283   Foreclosure or repossession.

#### § § 36.4283

        (a) Upon receipt by the Secretary of notice of a judicial or statutory sale, or other public sale under power of sale contained in the loan instruments, to liquidate any security for a guaranteed loan, the Secretary may specify in advance of such sale the minimum amount which shall be credited to the indebtedness of the borrower on account of the value of the security to be sold, subject to the provisions of paragraphs (a)(1), (2), (3), and (4) of this section:

        (1) If a minimum amount has been specified in relation to a sale of the property and the holder is the successful bidder at the sale for an amount not in excess of such specified amount the holder shall dispose of the property in the manner set forth in paragraph (f) and the amount realized from the resale of the property shall govern in the final accounting for determining the rights and liabilities of the holder and the Secretary.

        (2) If a minimum amount has been specified by the Secretary and:

        (i) A third party is the successful bidder at the sale for an amount equal to or in excess of that specified, the holder shall credit to the indebtedness the net proceeds of the sale.

        (ii) A third party is the successful bidder at the sale for an amount less than that specified, the holder shall credit to the indebtedness the amount specified less expenses allowable under § 36.4276.

        (iii) The holder is the successful bidder at the sale for an amount in excess of the specified amount the indebtedness shall be credited with the net proceeds of the sale or an amount established in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section, whichever is the greater, unless the bid in excess of the specified amount was made pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section.

        (3) If a minimum amount has not been specified by the Secretary under paragraph (a)(1) or (2) of this section, and the Secretary advised the holder that it did not intend to specify an amount, and the property is purchased at the sale by a third party, the holder shall credit against the indebtedness the net proceeds of the sale except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section. However, if the property is purchased at the sale by the holder, the indebtedness will be credited with the net proceeds of the sale or an amount established in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section, whichever is greater.

        (4) The holder shall notify the Secretary of the results of the sale within 10 days after the sale is completed.

        (b) In the event that any real property which is security for a guaranteed loan is to be acquired by a holder in a manner other than as provided in paragraph (a) or (c) of this section (e.g., by strict foreclosure or by the termination without a public sale of the purchaser's interest in a land sale contract), the holder shall notify the Secretary of the acquisition within 15 days thereafter and account to the Secretary for the proceeds of the liquidation of the security in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section.

        (c) When a debtor proposes to convey or transfer any property to a holder to avoid foreclosure or other judicial, contractual, or statutory disposition of the obligation or of the security, the consent of the Secretary to the terms of such proposal shall be obtained in advance of such conveyance or transfer. If the Secretary consents thereto, the holder may acquire the property and account to the Secretary for the proceeds of the liquidation of the security in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section.

        (d) If a minimum bid is required under applicable State law, or decree of foreclosure or order of sale, or other lawful order or decree, the holder may bid an amount not exceeding such amount legally required. If an amount has been specified by the Secretary and the holder is the successful bidder for an amount not exceeding the amount legally required, such specified amount shall govern for the purpose of this section.

        (e) If the Secretary has specified an amount as provided in this section, and the holder learns of any material damage to the property occurring prior to the foreclosure sale or to the acceptance of a deed in lieu of foreclosure or prior to any other event to which such specified amount is applicable, the holder shall promptly advise the Secretary of such damage. Also, if the holder acquires or repossesses the property and the holder learns of any material damage to it, the holder shall promptly advise the Secretary of such damage.

        (f) When the security for a guaranteed loan is acquired by the holder through foreclosure or otherwise, the holder shall resell the property within a reasonable time and may thereafter submit its claim under the guaranty. The Secretary, upon receipt of a notice of acquisition, shall determine the current reasonable value of the property and advise the holder of the minimum selling price that will be acceptable in any accounting with the Secretary upon liquidation of the security.

        (1) If the holder resells the property for an amount at least equal to the minimum selling price, it shall credit the indebtedness with the proceeds of the sale.

        (2) If the holder is unable to resell the property for an amount at least equal to the minimum selling price after exposure to the market for a reasonable period of time, the holder may submit to the Secretary a written advice setting forth the price, terms, conditions and expenses of any offer received. The Secretary shall thereupon:

        (i) Assent to the resale of the property upon the terms of such offer, in which event the holder will credit the indebtedness with the proceeds of the sale, or

        (ii) Review the minimum selling price previously established and, if appropriate, provide the holder with a reduced minimum selling price at which the property shall be further exposed to the market.

        (3) If the holder resells the property and finances the sale under the terms of a new security agreement and note, the Secretary may, pursuant to paragraph (f)(3)(iv) of this section, agree to indemnify the holder against loss on the new loan.

        (i) The Secretary's maximum liability under the indemnity agreement shall be the percentage of the loan originally guaranteed applied to the indebtedness as of the date of claim computation as set forth in § 36.4284(a), or the amount originally guaranteed, or the amount of the Secretary's liability under a preexisting indemnity agreement, whichever is less.

        (ii) In the event the proceeds of sale are less than the total indebtedness, the Secretary may pay a partial claim for the difference between the indebtedness and the proceeds of sale and thereafter agree to indemnify the holder for the amount of the maximum liability as of the date of claim computation, less the amount of claim paid.

        (iii) Subject to the limitation that the total amount payable under an indemnity agreement shall in no event exceed the Secretary's maximum liability, the remaining liability will be continued as a percentage of the new loan amount increasing or decreasing pro rata with any increase or decrease in the balance of the loan obligation.

        (iv) The Secretary shall execute an indemnity agreement evidencing the amount and terms of the indemnity liability, provided:

        (A) The Secretary has determined that resale of the security under an indemnity agreement is in the best interest of the Government, and the holder has obtained the prior approval of the Secretary;

        (B) The terms of repayment of the proposed loan bear a proper relationship to the borrower's present and anticipated income and expenses, and the borrower is a satisfactory credit risk;

        (C) The borrower executes an agreement establishing liability to the Secretary for the amount of any claim paid under the indemnity agreement;

        (D) The term of the proposed loan does not exceed the maximum term allowable under § 36.4204(c)(4);

        (E) The interest rate charged the borrower does not exceed the maximum rate allowable under § 36.4212 as of the date of closing pursuant to the indemnity agreement;

        (F) The holder agrees to comply with VA manufactured home regulations as if the original loan had not been terminated.

        (4) If the holder has not resold the property, it may elect to submit its claim under Loan Guaranty within 60 days of the date of the Secretary's written advice of the minimum selling price.

        (i) For purposes of computation of a claim submitted pursuant to this paragraph, and subject to the limitation that the maximum amount of claim payable shall in no event exceed the amount originally guaranteed, the amount payable on a claim for the guaranty shall be the percentage of the loan originally guaranteed applied to the indebtedness computed as of the date the holder acquired the security. Further:

        (A) The minimum selling price determined by the Secretary and provided to the holder shall be credited to the indebtedness as proceeds of sale; or

        (B) If no minimum selling price is provided then the current reasonable value of the property as determined by the Secretary and provided to the holder shall be credited to the indebtedness as proceeds of sale; and

        The amount payable on the claim shall in no event exceed the remaining balance of the indebtedness.

        (ii) Allowable post-acquisition expenditures or costs paid by the holder which may be included in the accounting with the Secretary are limited to those specified in § 36.4276(c).

        (g) If at the end of 6 months from the date of acquisition the holder has been unable to resell the property and no claim has been filed pursuant to paragraph (f)(4) of this section, a claim may be submitted under the guaranty and the Secretary will pay to the holder upon submission of such claim:

        (1) The difference between the appraised value of the property as determined by the Secretary and the indebtedness including those costs allowable under § 36.4276 and the costs of repossessing the manufactured home not to exceed $100, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to the applicable cutoff date as set forth in § 36.4284(a) at the maximum rate allowable. For loans guaranteed prior to May 8, 1984, the Secretary will also pay accrued interest at a rate of 6 percent from such cutoff date to the date of claim but not to exceed 60 days. For loans guaranteed on or after May 8, 1984, the Secretary will pay accrued interest at a rate 4.75 percent below the contract interest rate from such cutoff date to the date of claim but not to exceed 90 days.

        (2) The amount of the guaranty payable on the total outstanding indebtedness as of the applicable cutoff date set forth in § 36.4284(a), whichever is less.

        (h) If the property securing the guaranteed loan is acquired by a holder pursuant to paragraph (a), (b) or (c) of this section, or § 36.4282(g), the following provisions shall apply:

        (1) The holder's notice to the Secretary after acquisition shall state the amount of the successful bid at public sale, or in the event of a repossession or a voluntary conveyance, the date of acquisition.

        (2) The holder's notice after acquisition shall also provide complete occupancy data. Except with the prior approval of the Secretary the holder shall not rent the property to a new tenant nor extend the terms of an existing tenancy on other than a month-to-month basis.

        (3) Except with the prior approval of the Secretary, any taxes or special assessments which constitute prior liens due and payable after acquisition of the property by the holder shall be paid by the holder sufficiently in advance of the payment due dates to avoid penalties and to take advantage of any discounts. The holder also may include in its accounting with the Secretary any expenditures for repairs made that were reasonably necessary to properly maintain or refurbish the security property, not to exceed $400. Expenditures in excess of $400 shall not be made without the prior approval of the Secretary.

        (4) As between the holder and the Secretary, the holder shall be responsible for any loss due to damage to or destruction of the property, ordinary wear and tear excepted, from the date of repossession or acquisition by the holder to the date the property has been liquidated.

        (5) The holder shall include as credits in its accounting with the Secretary all rentals and other income collected from the property and insurance proceeds or refunds subsequent to the date of acquisition by the holder.

        (i) Definitions: (1) The terms  or  as used in this section are defined as the date of the event (e.g., date of repossession, _date of sale_ confirmation when required under local practice, date of acceptance of deed in case of voluntary conveyance, etc.) which fixes the rights of the parties in the property.

        (2) The term  or  as used in this section shall include:

        (i) A leasehold estate therein which at the time of closing the loan was of not less duration than that prescribed by § 36.4253, and

        (ii) The rights derived by the holder through a foreclosure sale of real estate whether or not such rights constitute an estate in real property under local law.

        (j) A claim for the guaranty must include a cop(y)(ies) of a current credit report(s) on the debtor(s).

        (k) The provisions of this section shall not be in derogation of any rights which the Secretary may have under § 36.4286. The Under Secretary for Benefits, or the Executive Director, Loan Guaranty Service, may authorize any deviation from the provisions of this section, within the limitations prescribed in 38 U.S.C. chapter 37, which may be necessary or desirable to accomplish the objectives of this section if such deviation is made necessary by reason of any laws or practice in any State, Territory, or the District of Columbia:  That no such deviation shall impair the rights of any holder not consenting thereto with respect to loans made or approved prior to the date the holder is notified of such action.

        § 36.4284   Computation of guaranty claims.

#### § § 36.4284

        (a) Subject to the limitation that the maximum amount payable shall in no event exceed the amount originally guaranteed, the amount payable on a claim for the guaranty shall be the percentage of the loan originally guaranteed applied to the indebtedness computed as of the date of claim but not later than (1) the date of judgment or of decree of foreclosure; or (2) in nonjudicial foreclosures, the date of publication of the first notice of sale; or (3) in cases in which the security is repossessed without a judgment, decree, or foreclosure, the date the holder repossesses the security; or (4) if no security is available, the date of claim but not more than 6 months after the first uncured default. Deposits or other credits or setoffs including any escrowed or earmarked funds legally applicable to the indebtedness on the date of the claim computation shall be applied in reduction of the indebtedness upon which the claim is based.

        (b) Credits accruing from the proceeds of a sale or other disposition of the security shall be reported to the Secretary incident to such submission, and the amount payable on the claim shall in no event exceed the remaining balance of the indebtedness.

        (c) Any allowable expenditures or costs, paid by the holder, and any accrued and unpaid interest to the applicable cutoff date as set forth in paragraph (a) of this section at the maximum rate allowable, may be deducted from the proceeds of the sale of the property, or may be included in the accounting to the Secretary on such loan. For loans guaranteed prior to May 8, 1984, the holder may also either deduct from sales proceeds, or include in the accounting, accrued interest at a rate of 6 percent from such cutoff date to the date of resale or other liquidation but not to exceed 60 days. For loans guaranteed on or after May 8, 1984, the holder may also either deduct from sales proceeds, or include in the accounting, accrued interest at a rate 4.75 percent below the contract interest rate from such cutoff date to the date of resale or other liquidation but not to exceed 90 days.

        (d) In computing the indebtedness for the purpose of filing a claim for payment of a guaranty, or in the event of a transfer of the loan under § 36.4281, or other accounting to the Secretary, the holder shall not be entitled to treat repayments theretofore made, as liquidated damages, or rentals, or otherwise than as payments on the indebtedness, notwithstanding any provision in the note, or mortgage, or otherwise, to the contrary.

        § 36.4285   Subrogation and indemnity.

#### § § 36.4285

        (a) The Secretary shall be subrogated to the contract and the lien or other rights of the holder to the extent of any sum paid on a guaranty, which right shall be junior to the holder's rights as against the debtor or the encumbered property until the holder shall have received the full amount payable under the contract with the debtor except that where the holder has entered into a recourse and/or repurchase or indemnity agreement with a dealer or servicer or other entity and the Department of Veterans Affairs pays a claim under guaranty to the holder the Department of Veterans Affairs will not be subrogated to any rights the holder may have under the recourse and/or repurchase or indemnity agreement. No partial or complete release by a creditor shall impair the rights of the Secretary with respect to the debtor's obligation.

        (b) The holder, upon request, shall execute, acknowledge, and deliver an appropriate instrument tendered the holder for that purpose, evidencing any payment received from the Secretary and the Secretary's resulting right of subrogation.

        (c) The Secretary may cause the instrument required by paragraph (b) of this section to be filed for record in the Office of the Recorder of Deeds, or other appropriate office of the proper county, town, or State, in accordance with the applicable State law.

        (d) Any amounts paid by the Secretary on account of the liabilities of any veteran guaranteed under the provisions of 38 U.S.C. 3712 shall constitute a debt owing to the United States by such veteran.

        (e) Whenever any veteran disposes of residential property securing a guaranteed loan obtained under 38 U.S.C. 3712, and for which the commitment to make the loan was made prior to March 1, 1988, the Secretary, upon application made by such veteran, shall issue to the veteran a release relieving him or her of all further liability to the Secretary on account of such loan (including liability for any loss resulting from any default of the transferee or any subsequent purchaser of such property) if the Secretary has determined, after such investigation as the Secretary may deem appropriate, that there has been compliance with the conditions prescribed in 38 U.S.C. 3713(a). The assumption of full liability for repayment of the loan by the transferee of the property must be evidenced by an agreement in writing in such form as the Secretary may require. Release of the veteran from liability to the Secretary will not impair or otherwise affect the Secretary's guaranty on the loan, or the liability of the veteran to the holder. Any release of liability granted to a veteran by the Secretary shall inure to the spouse of such veteran. The release of the veteran from liability to the Secretary will constitute the Secretary's prior approval to a release of the veteran from liability on the loan by the holder thereof. This release will not result in the veteran being entitled to further loan benefits unless the requirements of § 36.4203 are met.

        (f) If, on or after July 1, 1972, any veteran disposes of residential property securing a guaranteed loan obtained by him or her under 38 U.S.C. 3712, without securing a release from liability with respect to such loan under 38 U.S.C. 3713(a) and a default subsequently occurs which results in liability of the veteran to the Secretary on account of the loan, the Secretary may relieve the veteran of such liability if the Secretary determines that:

        (1) A transferee either immediate or remote is legally liable to the Secretary for the debt of the original veteran-borrower established after the termination of the loan, and

        (2) The original loan was current at the time such transferee acquired the property, and

        (3) The transferee who is liable to the Secretary is found to have been a satisfactory credit risk at the time he or she acquired the property.

        (g) If a veteran or any other person disposes of residential property securing a guaranteed or insured loan for which a commitment was made on or after March 1, 1988, and the veteran or other person notifies the loan holder in writing before disposing of the property, the veteran or other person shall be relieved of all further liability to the Secretary with respect to the loan (including liability for any loss resulting from any default of the purchaser or any subsequent owner of the property) and the application for assumption shall be approved if the holder determines that:

        (1) The proposed purchaser is creditworthy;

        (2) The proposed purchaser is contractually obligated to assume the loan and the liability to indemnify the Department of Veterans Affairs for the amount of any claim paid under the guaranty as a result of a default on the loan, or has already done so; and,

        (3) The payments on the loan are current.

        § 36.4286   Partial or total loss of guaranty.

#### § § 36.4286

        (a) There shall be no guaranty liability on the part of the Secretary in respect to any loan as to which a signature to the note, the mortgage or other security instrument is a forgery. Except as to a holder who acquired the loan instrument before maturity, for value, and without notice, and who has not directly or by agent participated in the fraud, or in the misrepresentation hereinafter specified, any willful and material misrepresentation or fraud by the lender, or by a holder, or the agent of either, in procuring the guaranty shall relieve the Secretary of liability, or shall constitute a defense against liability on account of the guaranty of the loan in respect to which the willful misrepresentation, or the fraud, is practiced:  That if a misrepresentation, although material, is not made willfully, or with fraudulent intent, it shall have only the consequences prescribed in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.

        (b) In taking security required by 38 U.S.C. 3712 and the § 36.4200 series, a holder shall obtain the required lien on real property the title to which is such as to be acceptable to prudent lending institutions, informed buyers, title companies, and attorneys, generally in the community in which the property is situated:  That a title will not be unacceptable by reason of any of the limitations on the quantum or quality of the property or title stated in § 36.4253. If such holder fails in this respect or fails to comply with any of the requirements of 38 U.S.C. 3712 and the § 36.4200 series with respect to:

        (1) Obtaining and retaining a lien of the dignity prescribed on all property upon which a lien is required by 38 U.S.C. 3712 or the § 36.4200 series,

        (2) Inclusion of power to substitute trustees,

        (3) The procurement and maintenance of insurance coverage,

        (4) Advice to Secretary as to default,

        (5) Notice of intention to begin action,

        (6) Notice to the Secretary in any suit or action, or notice of sale,

        (7) The release, conveyance, substitution, or exchange of security,

        (8) Lack of legal capacity of a party to the transaction incident to which the guaranty is granted,

        (9) Failure of the lender to see that any escrowed or earmarked account is expended in accordance with the agreement,

        (10) The taking into consideration of limitations upon the quantum or quality of the estate or property,

        (11) Any other requirement of 38 U.S.C. 3712 or the § 36.4200 series which does not by the terms of said section or regulations result in relieving the Secretary of all liability with respect to the loan,

        (c) If after the payment of a guaranty, or after a loan is transferred pursuant to § 36.4281, the fraud, misrepresentation, or failure to comply with the regulations concerning guaranty of loans to veterans as provided in this section is discovered and the Secretary determines that an increased loss to the Government resulted therefrom, the transferee or person to whom such payment was made shall be liable to the Secretary for the amount of the loss caused by such misrepresentation or failure.

        § 36.4287   Substitution of trustees.

#### § § 36.4287

        In jurisdictions in which valid, any deed of trust or mortgage securing a guaranteed loan, if it names trustees or confers a power of sale otherwise, shall contain a provision empowering any holder of the indebtedness to appoint substitute trustees or other person with such power to sell, who shall succeed to all the rights, powers, and duties of the trustees, or other person, originally designated.

      § 36.4201   Applicability of the § 36.4200 series.

#### § § 36.4201

      The § 36.4200 series shall be applicable to each loan entitled to guaranty under 38 U.S.C. 3712 on or after the date of publication thereof in the

      § 36.4202   Definitions.

#### § § 36.4202

      The lender or any subsequent assignee or transferee of the guaranteed obligation or the authorized servicing agent (also referred to as “the servicer”) of the lender or of the assignee or transferee.

      Home means place of residence.

      Any alteration that improves the property for the purpose for which it is occupied.

      Insurance means the obligation assumed by the United States to indemnify a lender to the extent specified in this subpart for any loss incurred upon any loan insured under 38 U.S.C. 3703(a)(2).

      Lien means any interest in, or power over, real or personal property, reserved by the vendor, or created by the parties or by operation of law, chiefly or solely for the purpose of assuring the payment of the purchase price, or a debt, and irrespective of the identity of the party in whom title to the property is vested, including but not limited to mortgages, deeds with a defeasance therein or collaterally, deeds of trust, security deeds, mechanics' liens, lease-purchase contracts, conditional sales contracts, consignments.

      Any judicial, contractual or statutory disposition of real property, under the terms of the loan instruments and applicable law, to liquidate a defaulted loan that is secured by such property. This includes a voluntary conveyance made to avoid such disposition of the obligation or of the security. This term also includes a short sale.

      A parcel of land acceptable to the Secretary as a manufactured home site.

      A moveable dwelling unit designed and constructed for year-round occupancy by a single family, on land, containing permanent eating, cooking, sleeping and sanitary facilities. A double-wide manufactured home is a moveable dwelling designed for occupancy by one family and consisting of:

      (1) Two or more units intended to be joined together horizontally when located on a site, but capable of independent movement or

      (2) A unit having a section or sections which unfold along the entire length of the unit. For the purposes of this section of VA regulations, manufactured home/lot loans guaranteed under the purview of §§ 36.4300 through 36.4393 must be for units permanently affixed to a lot and considered to be real property under the laws of the State where it is located. If the loan is for the purchase of a manufactured home and lot it must be considered as one loan.

      Net loss on insured loans means the indebtedness, plus any other charges authorized under § 36.4314, remaining unsatisfied after the liquidation of all available security and recourse to all intangible rights of the holder against those obligated on the debt.

      The fair market value of real property, minus an amount representing the costs that the Secretary estimates would be incurred by VA in acquiring and disposing of the property. The number to be subtracted from the fair market value will be calculated by multiplying the fair market value by the current cost factor. The cost factor used will be the most recent percentage of the fair market value that VA calculated and published in the Notices section of the  (it is intended that this percentage will be calculated annually). In computing this cost factor, VA will determine the average operating expenses and losses (or gains) on resale incurred for properties acquired under § 36.4323 which were sold during the preceding fiscal year and the average administrative cost to VA associated with the property management activity. The final net value derived from this calculation will be stated as a whole dollar amount (any fractional amount will be rounded up to the next whole dollar). The cost items included in the calculation will be:

      (1)  All disbursements made for payment of taxes, assessments, liens, property maintenance and related repairs, management broker's fees and commissions, and any other charges to the property account excluding property improvements and selling expenses.

      (2)  All disbursements for sales commissions plus any other costs incurred and paid in connection with the sale of the property.

      (3)  (i) An estimate of the total cost for VA of personnel (salary and benefits) and overhead (which may include things such as travel, transportation, communication, utilities, printing, supplies, equipment, insurance claims and other services) associated with the acquisition, management and disposition of property acquired under § 36.4323 of this part. The average administrative costs will be determined by:

      (A) Dividing the total cost for VA personnel and overhead salary and benefits costs by the average number of properties on hand and adjusting this figure based on the average holding time for properties sold during the preceding fiscal year; and

      (B) Dividing the figure calculated in paragraph (3)(i)(A) of this definition by the VBA ratio of personal services costs to total obligations.

      (ii) The three cost averages will be added to the average loss (or gain) on property sold during the preceding fiscal year (based on the average property purchase price) and the sum will be divided by the average fair market value at the time of acquisition for properties which were sold during the preceding fiscal year to derive the percentage to be used in estimating net value.

      The entire legal consideration paid or payable upon or on account of the sale of property, exclusive of acquisition costs, or for the cost of materials and labor to be applied to the property.

      Any obligation incurred for the purchase of real property or a leasehold estate as limited in §§ 36.4300 through 36.4393 or for the construction of fixtures or appurtenances thereon or for alterations, improvements, or repairs thereon required by §§ 36.4300 through 36.4393 to be secured by a lien on such property or is so secured. Loans for the purpose specified in 38 U.S.C. 3710(a)(5) (refinancing of mortgage loans or other liens on a dwelling or farm residence), loans for the purpose specified in 38 U.S.C. 3710(a)(8) (refinancing of a VA guaranteed, insured or direct loan to lower the interest rate), loans for the purposes specified in 38 U.S.C. 3710(a)(9) (purchase of manufactured homes/lots or the refinancing of such loans in order to reduce the interest rate or purchase a lot, in States in which manufactured homes, when permanently affixed to a lot, are considered real property, and loans to purchase one-family residential units in condominium housing developments or projects within the purview of 38 U.S.C. 3710(a)(6) and §§ 36.4360 through 36.4365 shall also be considered real estate loans.

      Reasonable value means that figure which represents the amount a reputable and qualified appraiser, unaffected by personal interest, bias, or prejudice, would recommend to a prospective purchaser as a proper price or cost in the light of prevailing conditions.

      The term registered mail wherever used in the regulations concerning guaranty or insurance of loans to veterans shall include certified mail.

      Any alteration of existing improved realty or equipment which is necessary or advisable for protective, safety or restorative purposes.

      This is a documented agreement by and between the borrower and the holder to reinstate a loan that is 61 or more calendar days delinquent, by requiring the borrower to pay each month over a fixed period (minimum of three months duration) the normal monthly payments plus an agreed upon portion of the delinquency each month.

      Repossession means recovery or acquisition of such physical control of property (pursuant to the provisions of the security instrument or as otherwise provided by law) as to make further legal or other action unnecessary in order to obtain actual possession of the property or to dispose of the same by sale or otherwise.

      (1) Any one-family residential unit in a condominium housing development within the purview of 38 U.S.C. 3710(a)(6) and §§ 36.4360 through 36.4365;

      (2) Any manufactured home permanently affixed to a lot owned or being purchased by a veteran and considered to be real property under the laws of the State where it is located;

      (3) Any improved real property (other than a condominium housing development or a manufactured home and/or lot) or leasehold estate therein as limited by this subpart, the primary use of which is for occupancy as a home, consisting of not more than four family units, plus an added unit for each eligible veteran if more than one participates in the ownership thereof; or

      (4) Any land to be purchased out of the proceeds of a loan for the construction of a dwelling, and on which such dwelling is to be erected.

      The Secretary of Veterans Affairs, or any employee of the Department of Veterans Affairs authorized to act in the Secretary's stead.

      The authorized servicer is either:

      (1) The servicing agent of a holder; or

      (2) The holder itself, if the holder is performing all servicing functions on a loan. The servicer is typically the entity reporting all loan activity to VA and filing claims under the guaranty on behalf of the holder. VA will generally issue guaranty claims and other payments to the servicer, who will be responsible for forwarding funds to the holder in accordance with its servicing agreement. Incentives under § 36.4319 will generally be paid directly to the servicer based on its performance under that section and in accordance with its tier ranking under § 36.4318.

      An agent designated by the loan holder as the entity to collect installments on the loan and/or perform other functions as necessary to protect the interests of the holder.

      A sale to a third party for an amount less than is sufficient to repay the unpaid balance on the loan where the holder has agreed in advance to release the lien in exchange for the proceeds of such sale.

      This is a documented agreement by and between the holder and the borrower where the holder agrees to suspend all payments or accept reduced payments for one or more months, on a loan 61 or more calendar days delinquent, and the borrower agrees to pay the total delinquency at the end of the specified period or enter into a repayment plan.

      For purposes of 38 U.S.C. 3732(c), the veteran's “total indebtedness” shall be the sum of: the unpaid principal on the loan as of the date of the liquidation sale, accrued unpaid interest permitted by § 36.4324(a) of this part, and allowable advances/other charges permitted to be included in the guaranty claim by § 36.4314 of this part.

      § 36.4302   Computation of guaranties or insurance credits.

#### § § 36.4302

      (a) With respect to a loan to a veteran guaranteed under 38 U.S.C. 3710 the guaranty shall not exceed the lesser of the dollar amount of entitlement available to the veteran or—

      (1) 50 percent of the original principal loan amount where the loan amount is not more than $45,000; or

      (2) $22,500 where the original principal loan exceeds $45,000, but is not more than $56,250; or

      (3) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, the lesser of $36,000 or 40 percent of the original principal loan amount where the loan amount exceeds $56,250; or

      (4) The lesser of $60,000 or 25 percent of the original principal loan amount where the loan amount exceeds $144,000 and the loan is for the purchase or construction of a home or the purchase of a condominium unit.

      (b) With respect to an interest rate reduction refinancing loan guaranteed under 38 U.S.C. 3710(a)(8), (a)(9)(B)(i), or (a)(11), the dollar amount of guaranty may not exceed the greater of the original guaranty amount of the loan being refinanced, or 25 percent of the refinancing loan amount.

      (c) With respect to a loan for an energy efficient mortgage guaranteed under 38 U.S.C. 3710(d), the amount of the guaranty shall be in the same proportion as would have been provided if the energy efficient improvements were not added to the loan amount, and there shall be no additional charge to the veteran's entitlement as a result of the increased guaranty amount.

      (d) An amount equal to 15 percent of the original principal amount of each insured loan shall be credited to the insurance account of the lender and shall be charged against the guaranty entitlement of the borrower: Provided, That no loan may be insured unless the borrower has sufficient entitlement remaining to permit such credit.

      (e) Subject to the provisions of § 36.4303(g), the following formulas shall govern the computation of the amount of the guaranty or insurance entitlement which remains available to an eligible veteran after prior use of entitlement:

      (1) If a veteran previously secured a nonrealty (business) loan, the amount of nonrealty entitlement used is doubled and subtracted from $36,000. The sum remaining is the amount of available entitlement for use, except that:

      (i) Entitlement may be increased by up to $24,000 if the loan amount exceeds $144,000 and the loan is for purchase or construction of a home or purchase of a condominium; and

      (ii) Entitlement for manufactured home loans that are to be guaranteed under 38 U.S.C. 3712 may not exceed $20,000.

      (2) If a veteran previously secured a realty (home) loan, the amount of realty (home) loan entitlement used is subtracted from $36,000. The sum remaining is the amount of available entitlement for use, except that:

      (i) Entitlement may be increased by up to $24,000 if the loan amount exceeds $144,000 and the loan is for purchase or construction of a home or purchase of a condominium; and

      (ii) Entitlement for manufactured home loans that are to be guaranteed under 38 U.S.C. 3712 may not exceed $20,000.

      (3) If a veteran previously secured a manufactured home loan under 38 U.S.C. 3712, the amount of entitlement used for that loan is subtracted from $36,000. The sum remaining is the amount of available entitlement for home loans and the sum remaining may be increased by up to $24,000 if the loan amount exceeds $144,000 and the loan is for purchase or construction of a home or purchase of a condominium. To determine the amount of entitlement available for manufactured home loans processed under 38 U.S.C. 3712, the amount of entitlement previously used for that purpose is subtracted from $20,000. The sum remaining is the amount of available entitlement for use for manufactured home loan purposes under 38 U.S.C. 3712.

      (f) For the purpose of computing the remaining guaranty or insurance benefit to which a veteran is entitled, loans guaranteed prior to February 1, 2008 shall be taken into consideration as if made subsequent thereto.

      (g) A loan eligible for insurance may be either guaranteed or insured at the option of the borrower and the lender, provided that if the Secretary is not advised of the exercise of such option at the time the loan is reported pursuant to § 36.4303, such loan will not be eligible for insurance.

      (h) A guaranty is reduced or increased pro rata with any deduction or increase in the amount of the guaranteed indebtedness, but in no event will the amount payable on a guaranty exceed the amount of the original guaranty, except where the guaranty has been increased under § 36.4315, or the percentage of the total indebtedness corresponding to that of the original guaranty whichever is less. However, on a graduated payment mortgage loan, the percentage of guaranty applicable to the original loan amount pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section shall apply to the loan indebtedness to the extent scheduled deferred interest is added to principal during the graduation period without regard to the original maximum dollar amount of guaranty.

      (i) The amount of any guaranty or the amount credited to a lender's insurance account in relation to any insured loan shall be charged against the original or remainder of the guaranty benefit of the borrower. Complete or partial liquidation, by payment or otherwise, of the veteran's guaranteed or insured indebtedness does not increase the remainder of the guaranty benefit, if any, otherwise available to the veteran. When the maximum amount of guaranty or insurance legally available to a veteran shall have been granted, no further guaranty or insurance is available to the veteran.

      (j) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (i) of this section, in computing the aggregate amount of guaranty or insurance housing loan entitlement available to a veteran under this chapter, the Secretary may exclude the amount of guaranty or insurance housing loan entitlement used for any guaranteed, insured, or direct loan under any one of the following circumstances:

      (1)(i) The property which secured the loan has been disposed of by the veteran or has been destroyed by fire or other natural hazard; and

      (ii) The loan has been repaid in full; or, the Secretary has been released from liability as to the loan; or, if the Secretary has suffered a loss on such loan, the loss has been paid in full.

      (2) A veteran-transferee has agreed to assume the outstanding balance on the loan and consented to the use of the veteran-transferee's entitlement, to the extent that the entitlement of the veteran-transferor had been used originally, in place of the veteran-transferor's for the guaranteed, insured, or direct loan, and the veteran-transferee otherwise meets the requirements of this chapter.

      (3)(i) The loan has been repaid in full; and

      (ii) The loan for which the veteran seeks to use entitlement under this chapter is secured by the same property which secured the loan referred to in the preceding paragraph (j)(3)(i) of this paragraph.

      (4) In a case not covered by (j)(1) or (j)(2) of this section, the Secretary may, one time per veteran, exclude entitlement used if:

      (i) The loan has been repaid in full and, if the Secretary has suffered a loss on the loan, the loss has been paid in full; or

      (ii) The Secretary has been released from liability as to the loan and, if the Secretary has suffered a loss on the loan, the loss has been paid in full.

      (k) The Secretary may, in any case involving circumstances that the Secretary deems appropriate, waive one or more of the requirements set forth in paragraph (j)(1) of this section.

      (l)(1) The amount of guaranty entitlement, available and unused, of an eligible unmarried surviving spouse (whose eligibility does not result from his or her own service) is determinable in the same manner as in the case of any veteran, and any entitlement which the decedent (who was his or her spouse) used shall be disregarded. A certificate as to the eligibility of such surviving spouse, issued by the Secretary, shall be a condition precedent to the guaranty or insurance of any loan made to a surviving spouse in such capacity.

      (2) An unmarried surviving spouse who was a co-obligor under an existing VA guaranteed, insured or direct loan shall be considered to be a veteran eligible for an interest rate reduction refinancing loan pursuant to 38 U.S.C. 3710(a)(8) or (9)(B)(i).

      § 36.4303   Reporting requirements.

#### § § 36.4303

      (a) With respect to loans automatically guaranteed under 38 U.S.C. 3703(a)(1), evidence of the guaranty will be issuable to a lender of a class described under 38 U.S.C. 3702(d) if the loan is reported to the Secretary not later than 60 days following full disbursement and upon the certification of the lender that:

      (1) No default exists thereunder that has continued for more than 30 days;

      (2) Except for acquisition and improvement loans as defined in § 36.4301, any construction, repairs, alterations, or improvements effected subsequent to the appraisal of reasonable value, and paid for out of the proceeds of the loan, which have not been inspected and approved upon completion by a compliance inspector designated by the Secretary, have been completed properly in full accordance with the plans and specifications upon which the original appraisal was based; and any deviations or changes of identity in said property have been approved as required in § 36.4304 concerning guaranty or insurance of loans to veterans;

      (3) The loan conforms otherwise with the applicable provisions of 38 U.S.C. chapter 37 and of the regulations concerning guaranty or insurance of loans to veterans.

      (b) Loans made pursuant to 38 U.S.C. 3703(a), although not entitled to automatic insurance thereunder, may, when made by a lender of a class described in 38 U.S.C. 3702(d)(1), be reported for issuance of an insurance credit.

      (c) Each loan proposed to be made to an eligible veteran by a lender not within a class described in 38 U.S.C. 3702(d) shall be submitted to the Secretary for approval prior to closing. Lenders described in 38 U.S.C. 3702(d) shall have the optional right to submit any loan for such prior approval. The Secretary, upon determining any loan so submitted to be eligible for a guaranty, or for insurance, will issue a certificate of commitment with respect thereto.

      (d) A certificate of commitment shall entitle the holder to the issuance of the evidence of guaranty or insurance upon the ultimate actual payment of the full proceeds of the loan for the purposes described in the original report and upon the submission within 60 days thereafter of a supplemental report showing that fact and:

      (1) The identity of any property purchased therewith,

      (2) That all property purchased or acquired with the proceeds of the loan has been encumbered as required by the regulations concerning guaranty or insurance of loans to veterans,

      (3) Except for acquisition and improvement loans as defined in § 36.4301(c), any construction, repairs, alterations, or improvements paid for out of the proceeds of the loan, which have not been inspected and approved subsequent to completion by a compliance inspector designated by the Secretary, have been completed properly in full accordance with the plans and specifications upon which the original appraisal was based; and that any deviations or changes of identity in said property have been approved as required by § 36.4304, and

      (4) That the loan conforms otherwise with the applicable provisions of 38 U.S.C. chapter 37 and the regulations concerning guaranty or insurance of loans to veterans.

      (e) Upon the failure of the lender to report in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (d) of this section, the certificate of commitment shall have no further effect, or the amount of guaranty or insurance shall be reduced pro rata, as may be appropriate under the facts of the case: , nevertheless, that if the loan otherwise meets the requirements of this section, said certificate of commitment may be given effect by the Secretary, notwithstanding the report is received after the date otherwise required.

      (f) For loans not reported within 60 days, evidence of guaranty will be issued only if the loan report is accompanied by a statement signed by a corporate officer of the lending institution which explains why the loan was reported late. The statement must identify the case or cases in issue and must set forth the specific reason or reasons why the loan was not submitted on time. Upon receipt of such a statement evidence of guaranty will be issued. A pattern of late reporting and the reasons therefore will be considered by VA in taking action under § 36.4353.

      (g) Evidence of a guaranty will be issued by the Secretary by appropriate endorsement on the note or other instrument evidencing the obligation, or by a separate certificate at the option of the lender. Notice of credit to an insurance account will be given to the lender. Unused certificates of eligibility issued prior to March 1, 1946, are void. No certificate of commitment shall be issued and no loan shall be guaranteed or insured unless the lender, the veteran, and the loan are shown to be eligible. Evidence of guaranty or insurance will not be issued on any loan for the purchase or construction of residential property unless the veteran, or the veteran's spouse in the case of a veteran who cannot occupy the property because of active duty status with the Armed Forces, certifies in such form as the Secretary shall prescribe that the veteran, or spouse of the active duty veteran, intends to occupy the property as his or her home. Guaranty or insurance evidence will not be issued on any loan for the alteration, improvement, or repair of any residential property or on a refinancing loan unless the veteran, or spouse of an active duty servicemember, certifies that he or she presently occupies the property as his or her home. An exception to this is if the home improvement or refinancing loan is for extensive changes to the property that will prevent the veteran or the spouse of the active duty veteran from occupying the property while the work is being completed. In such a case the veteran or spouse of the active duty veteran must certify that he or she intends to occupy or reoccupy the property as his or her home upon completion of the substantial improvements or repairs. All of the mentioned certifications must take place at the time of loan application and closing except in the case of loans automatically guaranteed, in which case veterans or, in the case of an active duty veteran, the veteran's spouse shall make the required certification only at the time the loan is closed.

      (h) Subject to compliance with the regulations concerning guaranty or insurance of loans to veterans, the certificate of guaranty or the evidence of insurance credit will be issuable within the available entitlement of the veteran on the basis of the loan stated in the final loan report or certification of loan disbursement, except for refinancing loans for interest rate reductions. The available entitlement of a veteran will be determined by the Secretary as of the date of receipt of an application for guaranty or insurance of a loan or of a loan report. Such date of receipt shall be the date the application or loan report is date-stamped into VA. Eligibility derived from the most recent period of service:

      (1) Shall cancel any unused entitlement derived from any earlier period of service, and

      (2) Shall be reduced by the amount by which entitlement from service during any earlier period has been used to obtain a direct, guaranteed, or insured loan:

      (i) On property which the veteran owns at the time of application, or

      (ii) As to which the Secretary has incurred actual liability or loss, unless in the event of loss or the incurrence and payment of such liability by the Secretary, the resulting indebtedness of the veteran to the United States has been paid in full. , that if the Secretary issues or has issued a certificate of commitment covering the loan described in the application for guaranty or insurance or in the loan report, the amount and percentage of guaranty or the amount of the insurance credit contemplated by the certificate of commitment shall not be subject to reduction if the loan has been or is closed on a date that is not later than the expiration date of the certificate of commitment, notwithstanding that the Secretary in the meantime and prior to the issuance of the evidence of guaranty or insurance shall have incurred actual liability or loss on a direct, guaranteed, or insured loan previously obtained by the borrower. For the purposes of this paragraph, the Secretary will be deemed to have incurred actual loss on a guaranteed or insured loan if the Secretary has paid a guaranty or insurance claim thereon and the veteran's resultant indebtedness to the Government has not been paid in full, and to have incurred actual liability on a guaranteed or insured loan if the Secretary is in receipt of a claim on the guaranty or insurance or is in receipt of a notice of default. In the case of a direct loan, the Secretary will be deemed to have incurred an actual loss if the loan is in default. A loan, the proceeds of which are to be disbursed progressively or at intervals, will be deemed to have been closed for the purposes of this paragraph if the loan has been completed in all respects excepting the actual “payout” of the entire loan proceeds.

      (i) Any amounts that are disbursed for an ineligible purpose shall be excluded in computing the amount of guaranty or insurance credit.

      (j) Notwithstanding the lender has erroneously, but without intent to misrepresent, made certification with respect to paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the guaranty or insurance will become effective upon the curing of such default and its continuing current for a period of not less than 60 days thereafter. For the purpose of this paragraph a loan will be deemed current so long as the installment is received within 30 days after its due date.

      (k) No guaranty or insurance commitment or evidence of guaranty or insurance will be issuable in respect to any loan to finance a contract that:

      (1) Is for the purchase, construction, repair, alteration, or improvement of a dwelling or farm residence;

      (2) Is dated on or after June 4, 1969;

      (3) Provides for a purchase price or cost to the veteran in excess of the reasonable value established by the Secretary; and

      (4) Was signed by the veteran prior to the veteran's receipt of notice of such reasonable value; unless such contract includes, or is amended to include, a provision that reads substantially as follows:

      (l) With respect to any loan for which a commitment was made on or after March 1, 1988, the Secretary must be notified whenever the holder receives knowledge of disposition of the residential property securing a VA-guaranteed loan.

      (1) If the seller applies for prior approval of the assumption of the loan, then:

      (i) A holder (or its authorized servicing agent) who is an automatic lender must examine the creditworthiness of the purchaser and determine compliance with the provisions of 38 U.S.C. 3714. The creditworthiness review must be performed by the party that has automatic authority. If both the holder and its servicing agent are automatic lenders, then they must decide between themselves which one will make the determination of creditworthiness, whether the loan is current and whether there is a contractual obligation to assume the loan, as required by 38 U.S.C. 3714. If the actual loan holder does not have automatic authority and its servicing agent is an automatic lender, then the servicing agent must make the determinations required by 38 U.S.C. 3714 on behalf of the holder. The actual holder will remain ultimately responsible for any failure of its servicing agent to comply with the applicable law and VA regulations.

      (A) If the assumption is approved and the transfer of the security is completed, then the notice required by this paragraph (l) shall consist of the credit package (unless previously provided in accordance with paragraph (l)(1)(i)(B) of this section) and a copy of the executed deed and/or assumption agreement as required by VA office of jurisdiction. The notice shall be submitted to the Department with the VA receipt for the funding fee provided for in § 36.4313(e)(2).

      (B) If the application for assumption is disapproved, the holder shall notify the seller and the purchaser that the decision may be appealed to the VA office of jurisdiction within 30 days. The holder shall make available to that VA office all items used by the holder in making the holder's decision in case the decision is appealed to VA. If the application remains disapproved after 60 days (to allow time for appeal to and review by VA), then the holder must refund $50 of any fee previously collected under the provisions of § 36.4313(d)(8). If the application is subsequently approved and the sale is completed, then the holder (or its authorized servicing agent) shall provide the notice described in paragraph (l)(1)(i)(A) of this section.

      (C) In performing the requirements of paragraphs (l)(1)(i)(A) or (l)(1)(i)(B) of this section, the holder must complete its examination of the creditworthiness of the prospective purchaser and advise the seller no later than 45 days after the date of receipt by the holder of a complete application package for the approval of the assumption. The 45-day period may be extended by an interval not to exceed the time caused by delays in processing of the application that are documented as beyond the control of the holder, such as employers or depositories not responding to requests for verifications, which were timely forwarded, or follow-ups on those requests.

      (ii) If neither the holder nor its authorized servicing agent is an automatic lender, the notice to VA shall include:

      (A) Advice regarding whether the loan is current or in default;

      (B) A copy of the purchase contract; and

      (C) A complete credit package developed by the holder which the Secretary may use for determining the creditworthiness of the purchaser.

      (D) The notice and documents required by this section must be submitted to the VA office of jurisdiction no later than 35 days after the date of receipt by the holder of a complete application package for the approval of the assumption, subject to the same extensions as provided in paragraph (l)(l)(i) of this section. If the assumption is not automatically approved by the holder or its authorized agent, pursuant to the automatic authority provisions, $50 of any fee collected in accordance with § 36.4313(d)(8) must be refunded. If the Department of Veterans Affairs does not approve the assumption, the holder will be notified and an additional $50 of any fee collected under § 36.4313(d)(8) must be refunded following the expiration of the 30-day appeal period set out in paragraph (l)(l)(i)(B) of this section. If such an appeal is made to the Department of Veterans Affairs, then the review will be conducted at the Department of Veterans Affairs office of jurisdiction by an individual who was not involved in the original disapproval decision. If the application for assumption is approved and the transfer of security is completed, then the holder (or its authorized servicing agent) shall provide the notice required in paragraph (l)(l)(i)(A) of this section.

      (2) If the seller fails to notify the holder before disposing of property securing the loan, the holder shall notify the Secretary within 60 days after learning of the transfer. Such notice shall advise whether or not the holder intends to exercise its option to immediately accelerate the loan and whether or not an opportunity will be extended to the transferor and transferee to apply for retroactive approval of the assumption under the terms of this paragraph (l).

      § 36.4304   Deviations; changes of identity.

#### § § 36.4304

      A deviation of more than 5 percent between the estimates upon which a certificate of commitment has been issued and the report of final payment of the proceeds of the loan, or a change in the identity of the property upon which the original appraisal was based, will invalidate the certificate of commitment unless such deviation or change be approved by the Secretary. Any deviation in excess of 5 percent or change in the identity of the property upon which the original appraisal was based must be supported by a new or supplemental appraisal of reasonable value: Provided, That substitution of materials of equal or better quality and value approved by the veteran and the designated appraiser shall not be deemed a “change in the identity of the property” within the purview of this section. A deviation not in excess of 5 percent will not require the prior approval of the Secretary.

      § 36.4305   Partial disbursement.

#### § § 36.4305

      In cases where intervening circumstances make it impracticable to complete the actual paying out of the loan originally proposed, or justify the lender in declining to make further disbursements on a construction loan, evidence of guaranty or of insurance of the loan or the proper pro rata part thereof will be issuable if the loan is otherwise eligible for automatic guaranty or a certificate of commitment was issued thereon: Provided,

      (a) A report of the loan is submitted to the Secretary within a reasonable time subsequent to the last disbursement, but in no event more than 90 days thereafter, unless report of the facts and circumstances is made and an extension of time obtained from the Secretary.

      (b) There has been no default on the loan, except that the existence of a default shall not preclude issuance of a guaranty certificate or insurance advice if a certificate of commitment was issued with respect to the loan.

      (c) The Secretary determines that a person of reasonable prudence similarly situated would not make further disbursements in the situation presented.

      (d) There has been full compliance with the provisions of 38 U.S.C. chapter 37 and of the applicable regulations up to the time of the last disbursement.

      (e) In the case of a construction loan when the construction is not fully completed, the amount and percentage of the guaranty and the amount of the loan for the purposes of insurance or accounting to the Secretary shall be based upon such portion of the amount disbursed out of the proceeds of the loan which, when added to any other payments made by or on behalf of the veteran to the builder or the contractor, does not exceed 80 percent of the value of that portion of the construction performed (basing value on the contract price) plus the sum, if any, disbursed by the lender out of the proceeds of the loan for the land on which the construction is situated: And provided further, That the lender shall certify as follows:

      (1) Any amount advanced for land is protected by title or lien as provided in the regulations concerning guaranty or insurance of loans to veterans; and

      (2) No enforceable liens, for any work done or material furnished for that part of the construction completed and for which payment has been made out of the proceeds of the loan, exist or can come into existence.

      § 36.4306   Refinancing of mortgage or other lien indebtedness.

#### § § 36.4306

      (a) A refinancing loan made pursuant to 38 U.S.C. 3710(a)(5) qualifies for guaranty in an amount as computed under 38 U.S.C. 3703, provided—

      (1) The amount of the new loan must not exceed an amount equal to 100 percent of the reasonable value, as determined by the Secretary, of the dwelling or farm residence which will secure the loan.

      (2) The funding fee as prescribed by 38 U.S.C. 3729 may be included in the new loan amount, except that any portion of the funding fee that would cause the new loan amount to exceed 100 percent of the reasonable value of the property must be paid in cash at the loan closing.

      (3) The new loan must provide a net tangible benefit to the borrower. For the purposes of this section, net tangible benefit means that the new loan is in the financial interest of the borrower. The lender of the new loan must provide the borrower with a net tangible benefit test. The net tangible benefit test must be satisfied. The net tangible benefit test is defined as follows:

      (i) The new loan must meet one or more of the following:

      (A) The new loan eliminates monthly mortgage insurance, whether public or private, or monthly guaranty insurance;

      (B) The term of the new loan is shorter than the term of the loan being refinanced;

      (C) The interest rate on the new loan is lower than the interest rate on the loan being refinanced;

      (D) The payment on the new loan is lower than the payment on the loan being refinanced;

      (E) The new loan results in an increase in the borrower's monthly residual income as explained by § 36.4340(e);

      (F) The new loan refinances an interim loan to construct, alter, or repair the primary home;

      (G) The new loan amount is equal to or less than 90 percent of the reasonable value of the home; or

      (H) The new loan refinances an adjustable rate mortgage to a fixed rate loan.

      (ii) The lender must provide a borrower with a comparison of the following:

      (A) The loan payoff amount of the new loan, with a comparison to the loan payoff amount of the loan being refinanced;

      (B) The new type of loan, with a comparison to the type of the loan being refinanced;

      (C) The interest rate of the new loan, with a comparison to the interest rate of the loan being refinanced;

      (D) The term of the new loan, with a comparison to the term remaining on the loan being refinanced;

      (E) The total the borrower will have paid after making all payments of principal, interest, and mortgage or guaranty insurance (if applicable), as scheduled, for both the loan being refinanced and the new loan; and

      (F) The loan to value ratio of the loan being refinanced compared to the loan to value ratio under the new loan.

      (iii) The lender must provide the borrower with an estimate of the dollar amount of home equity that, by refinancing into a new loan, is being removed from the reasonable value of the home, and explain that removal of this home equity may affect the borrower's ability to sell the home at a later date.

      (iv) The lender must provide the information required under paragraphs (a)(3)(i) through (iii) of this section in a standardized format and on two separate occasions: Not later than 3 business days from the date of the loan application and again at loan closing. The borrower must certify that the borrower received the information required under paragraphs (a)(3)(i) through (iii) on both occasions.

      (4) The dollar amount of discount, if any, to be paid by the borrower must be reasonable in amount as determined by the Secretary in accordance with § 36.4313(d)(7)(i).

      (5) The loan must otherwise be eligible for guaranty.

      (b) If the loan being refinanced is a VA-guaranteed or insured loan, and the new loan amount is equal to or less than the payoff amount of the loan being refinanced, the following requirements must also be met—

      (1)(i) The lender of the refinanced loan must provide the Secretary with a certification of the recoupment period for fees, closing costs, and any expenses (other than taxes, amounts held in escrow, and fees paid under 38 U.S.C. chapter 37) that would be incurred by the borrower in the refinancing of the loan;

      (ii) All of the fees and incurred costs must be scheduled to be recouped on or before the date that is 36 months after the date of loan issuance; and

      (iii) The recoupment must be calculated through lower regular monthly payments (other than taxes, amounts held in escrow, and fees paid under 38 U.S.C. chapter 37) as a result of the refinanced loan.

      (2) The new loan may not be guaranteed or insured until the date that is the later of 210 days from the date of the first monthly payment made by the borrower and the date on which the sixth monthly payment is made on the loan.

      (3) In a case in which the loan being refinanced has a fixed interest rate and the new loan will also have a fixed interest rate, the interest rate on the new loan must not be less than 50 basis points less than the loan being refinanced.

      (4) In a case in which the loan being refinanced has a fixed interest rate and the new loan will have an adjustable rate, the interest rate on the new loan must not be less than 200 basis points less than the previous loan. In addition—

      (i) The lower interest rate must not be produced solely from discount points, unless such points are paid at closing; and

      (ii) Such points are not added to the principal loan amount, unless—

      (A) For discount point amounts that are less than or equal to one discount point, the resulting loan balance after any fees and expenses allows the property with respect to which the loan was issued to maintain a loan to value ratio of 100 percent or less; and

      (B) For discount point amounts that are greater than one discount point, the resulting loan balance after any fees and expenses allows the property with respect to which the loan was issued to maintain a loan to value ratio of 90 percent or less.

      (c) If the new loan amount exceeds the payoff amount of the loan being refinanced—

      (1) The borrower is deemed to have recouped the costs of the refinancing if the requirements prescribed in paragraph (a) are met.

      (2) The new loan may not be guaranteed or insured until the date that is the later of 210 days from the date of the first monthly payment made by the borrower and the date on which the sixth monthly payment is made on the loan; however, this requirement applies only when the loan being refinanced is a VA-guaranteed or insured loan.

      (d) For the limited purpose of calculating entitlement, nothing shall preclude guaranty of a loan to an eligible veteran having home loan guaranty entitlement to refinance under the provisions of 38 U.S.C. 3710(a)(5) a VA-guaranteed or insured (or direct) mortgage loan made to him or her which is outstanding on the dwelling or farm residence owned and occupied or to be reoccupied after the completion of major alterations, repairs, or improvements to the property, by the veteran as a home, or in the case of an eligible veteran unable to occupy the property because of active duty status in the Armed Forces, occupied or to be reoccupied by the veteran's spouse as the spouse's home.

      (e) A refinancing loan may include contractual prepayment penalties, if any, due the holder of the mortgage or other lien indebtedness to be refinanced.

      (f) Nothing in this section shall preclude the determination that a loan is being made for a purpose authorized under 38 U.S.C. 3710, if the purpose of such loan is the refinancing of the balance due for the purchase of land on which new construction is to be financed through the proceeds of the loan, or the refinancing of the balance due on an existing land sale contract relating to a borrower's dwelling or farm residence.

      (g) A veteran may refinance (38 U.S.C. 3710(a)(9)(B)(ii)) an existing loan that was for the purchase of, and is secured by, a manufactured home in order to purchase the lot on which the manufactured home is or will be permanently affixed, provided the following requirements are met:

      (1) The refinancing of a manufactured home and the purchase of a lot must be considered as one loan;

      (2) The manufactured home upon being permanently affixed to the lot will be considered real property under the laws of the State where it is located;

      (3) The loan must be secured by the same manufactured home which is being refinanced and the real property on which the manufactured home is or will be located;

      (4) The amount of the loan may not exceed an amount equal to the sum of the balance of the loan being refinanced; the purchase price, not to exceed the reasonable value of the lot; the costs of the necessary site preparation of the lot as determined by the Secretary; a reasonable discount as authorized in § 36.4313(d)(6) with respect to that portion of the loan used to refinance the existing purchase money lien on the manufactured home, and closing costs as authorized in § 36.4313.

      (5) If the loan being refinanced was guaranteed by VA, the portion of the loan made for the purpose of refinancing an existing purchase money manufactured home loan may be, guaranteed without regard to the outstanding guaranty entitlement available for use by the veteran, and the veteran's guaranty entitlement shall not be charged as a result of any guaranty provided for the refinancing portion of the loan. For the purposes enumerated in 38 U.S.C. 3702(b), the refinancing portion of the loan shall be considered to have been obtained with the guaranty entitlement used to obtain VA-guaranteed loan being refinanced. The total guaranty for the new loan shall be the sum of the guaranty entitlement used to obtain VA-guaranteed loan being refinanced and any additional guaranty entitlement available to the veteran. However, the total guaranty may not exceed the guaranty amount as calculated under § 36.4302(a); and

      (6) All other requirements of this section are met.

      (h) Any refinancing loan that might be guaranteed under this section, when made or purchased by any financial institution subject to examination and supervision by any agency of the United States or of any State may, in lieu of such guaranty, be insured by the Secretary under an agreement whereby the Secretary will reimburse any such institution for losses incurred on such loan up to 15 percent of the aggregate of loans so made or purchased by it.

      § 36.4307   Interest rate reduction refinancing loan.

#### § § 36.4307

      (a) Pursuant to 38 U.S.C. 3710(a)(8), (a)(9)(B)(i), and (a)(11), a veteran may refinance an existing VA guaranteed, insured, or direct loan to reduce the interest rate payable on the existing loan provided that all of the following requirements are met:

      (1) The new loan must be secured by the same dwelling or farm residence as the loan being refinanced.

      (2) The veteran owns the dwelling or farm residence securing the loan and

      (i) Occupies the dwelling or residence as his or her home; or

      (ii) Previously occupied the dwelling or residence as his or her home and certifies, in such form as the Secretary shall require, that he or she has previously occupied the dwelling or residence as a home; or

      (iii) In a case in which the veteran is or was unable to occupy the residence or dwelling as a home because the veteran was on active duty status as a member of the Armed Forces, the spouse of the veteran occupies, or previously occupied, the dwelling or residence as the spouse's home and certifies to that occupancy in such form as the Secretary shall require.

      (3) The monthly principal and interest payment on the new loan is lower than the principal and interest payment on the loan being refinanced; or the term of the new loan is shorter than the term of the loan being refinanced; or the new loan is a fixed-rate loan that refinances a VA-guaranteed adjustable rate mortgage; or the increase in the monthly payments on the loan results from the inclusion of energy efficient improvements, as provided by § 36.4339(a)(4); or the Secretary approves the loan in advance after determining that the new loan is necessary to prevent imminent foreclosure and the veteran qualifies for the new loan under the credit standards contained in § 36.4340.

      (4) The amount of the refinancing loan does not exceed:

      (i) An amount equal to the balance of the loan being refinanced, which is not delinquent, except as provided in paragraph (a)(5) of this section, plus closing costs authorized by § 36.4313(d) and a discount not to exceed 2 percent of the loan amount; or

      (ii) In the case of a loan to refinance an existing VA-guaranteed or direct loan and to improve the dwelling securing such loan through energy efficient improvements, the amount referred to with respect to the loan under paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section, plus the amount authorized by § 36.4339(a)(4).

      (5) If the loan being refinanced is delinquent (delinquent means that a scheduled monthly payment of principal and interest is more than 30 days past due), the new loan will be guaranteed only if the Secretary approves it in advance after determining that the borrower, through the lender, has provided reasons for the loan deficiency, has provided information to establish that the cause of the delinquency has been corrected, and qualifies for the loan under the credit standards contained in § 36.4340. In such cases, the term “balance of the loan being refinanced” shall include any past due installments, plus allowable late charges.

      (6) The dollar amount of guaranty on the 38 U.S.C. 3710(a)(8) or (a)(9)(B)(i) loan does not exceed the greater of the original guaranty amount of the loan being refinanced or 25 percent of the new loan.

      (7) The term of the refinancing loan (38 U.S.C. 3710(a)(8)) may not exceed the original term of the loan being refinanced plus ten years, or the maximum loan term allowed under 38 U.S.C. 3703(d)(1), whichever is less. For manufactured home loans that were previously guaranteed under 38 U.S.C. 3712, the loan term, if being refinanced under 38 U.S.C. 3710(a)(9)(B)(i), may exceed the original term of the loan but may not exceed the maximum loan term allowed under 38 U.S.C. 3703(d)(1).

      (b) Notwithstanding any other regulatory provision, the interest rate reduction refinancing loan may be guaranteed without regard to the amount of guaranty entitlement available for use by the veteran, and the amount of the veteran's remaining guaranty entitlement, if any, shall not be charged for an interest rate reduction refinancing loan. The interest rate reduction refinancing loan will be guaranteed with the lesser of the entitlement used by the veteran to obtain the loan being refinanced or the amount of the guaranty as calculated under § 36.4302(a). The veteran's loan guaranty entitlement originally used for a purpose as enumerated in 38 U.S.C. 3710(a)(1) through (7) and (a)(9)(A)(i) and (ii) and subsequently transferred to an interest rate reduction refinancing loan (38 U.S.C. 3710(a)(8) or (a)(9)(B)(i)) shall be eligible for restoration when the interest rate reduction refinancing loan or subsequent interest rate reduction refinancing loans on the same property meets the requirements of § 36.4302(h).

      (c) Title to the estate which is refinanced for the purpose of an interest rate reduction must be in conformity with § 36.4354.

> [73 FR 6310, Feb. 1, 2008. Redesignated at 75 FR 33705, June 15, 2010, as amended at 75 FR 65238, Oct. 22, 2010]

      § 36.4308   Joint loans.

#### § § 36.4308

      (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the prior approval of the Secretary is required in respect to any loan to be made to two or more borrowers who become jointly and severally liable, or jointly liable therefor, and who will acquire an undivided interest in the property to be purchased or who will otherwise share in the proceeds of the loan, or in respect to any loan to be made to an eligible veteran whose interest in the property owned, or to be acquired with the loan proceeds, is an undivided interest only, unless such interest is at least a 50 percent interest in a partnership. The amount of the guaranty or insurance credit shall be computed in such cases only on that portion of the loan allocable to the eligible veteran which, taking into consideration all relevant factors, represents the proper contribution of the veteran to the transaction. Such loans shall be secured to the extent required by 38 U.S.C. chapter 37 and the regulations concerning guaranty or insurance of loans to veterans.

      (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section, the joinder of the spouse of a veteran-borrower in the ownership of residential property shall not require prior approval or preclude the issuance of a guaranty or insurance credit based upon the entire amount of the loan. If both spouses be eligible veterans, either or both may, within permissible maxima, utilize available guaranty or insurance entitlement.

      (c) For the purpose of determining the rights and the liabilities of the Secretary with respect to a loan subject to paragraph (a) of this section, credits legally applicable to the entire loan shall be applied as follows:

      (1) Prepayments made expressly for credit to that portion of the indebtedness allocable to the veteran (including the gratuity paid pursuant to former provisions of law), shall be applied to such portion of the indebtedness. All other payments shall be applied ratably to those portions of the loan allocable respectively to the veteran and to the other debtors.

      (2) Proceeds of the sale or other liquidation of the security shall be applied ratably to the respective portions of the loan, such portion of the proceeds as represents the interest of the veteran being applied to that portion of the loan allocable to such veteran.

      § 36.4309   Transfer of title by borrower or maturity by demand or acceleration.

#### § § 36.4309

      (a) Except as provided by paragraphs (b) or (c) of this section the conveyance of or other transfer of title to property by operation of law or otherwise, after the creation of a lien thereon to secure a loan which is guaranteed or insured in whole or in part by the Secretary, shall not constitute an event of default, or acceleration of maturity, elective or otherwise, and shall not of itself terminate or otherwise affect the guaranty or insurance.

      (b)(1) The Secretary may issue guaranty on loans in which a State, Territorial, or local governmental agency provides assistance to a veteran for the acquisition of a dwelling. Such loans will not be considered ineligible for guaranty if the State, Territorial, or local authority, by virtue of its laws or regulations or by virtue of Federal law, requires the acceleration of maturity of the loan upon the sale or conveyance of the security property to a person ineligible for assistance from such authority.

      (2) At the time of application for a loan assisted by a State, Territorial, or local governmental agency, the veteran-applicant must be fully informed and consent in writing to the housing authority restrictions. A copy of the veteran's consent statement must be forwarded with the loan application or the report of a loan processed on the automatic basis.

      (c) Any housing loan which is financed under 38 U.S.C. chapter 37, and to which section 3714 of that chapter applies, shall include a provision in the security instrument that the holder may declare the loan immediately due and payable upon transfer of the property securing such loan to any transferee unless the acceptability of the assumption of the loan is established pursuant to section 3714.

      (1) A holder may not exercise its option to accelerate a loan upon:

      (i) The creation of a lien or other encumbrance subordinate to the lender's security instrument which does not relate to the transfer of rights of occupancy in the property;

      (ii) The creation of a purchase money security interest for household appliances;

      (iii) A transfer by devise, descent, or operation of law on the death of a joint tenant or tenant by the entirety;

      (iv) The granting of a leasehold interest of three years or less not containing an option to purchase;

      (v) A transfer to a relative resulting from the death of a borrower;

      (vi) A transfer where the spouse or children of the borrower become joint owners of the property with the borrower;

      (vii) A transfer resulting from a decree of a dissolution of marriage, legal separation agreement, or from an incidental property settlement agreement by which the spouse of the borrower becomes the sole owner of the property. In such a case the borrower shall have the option of applying directly to the Department of Veterans Affairs regional office of jurisdiction for a release of liability in accordance with § 36.4326; or

      (viii) A transfer into an inter vivos trust in which the borrower is and remains a beneficiary and which does not relate to a transfer of rights of occupancy in the property.

      (2) With respect to each such loan at least one of the instruments used in the transaction shall contain the following statement: “This loan is not assumable without the approval of the Department of Veterans Affairs or its authorized agent.” This statement must be:

      (i) Printed in a font size which is the larger of:

      (A) Two times the largest font size contained in the body of the instrument; or

      (B) 18 points; and

      (ii) Contained in at least one of the following:

      (A) The note;

      (B) The mortgage or deed of trust; or

      (C) A rider to either the note, the mortgage, or the deed of trust.

      (d) The term of payment of any guaranteed or insured obligation shall bear a proper relation to the borrower's present and anticipated income and expenses, (except loans pursuant to 38 U.S.C. 3710(a)(8) or (a)(9)(B)(i)). In addition the terms of payment of any guaranteed or insured obligation shall provide for discharge of the obligation at a definite date or dates or intervals, in amount specified on or computable from the face of the instrument. A loan which is payable on demand, or at sight, or on presentation, or at a time not specified or computable from the language in the note, mortgage, or other loan instrument, or which contemplates periodic renewals at the option of the holder to satisfy the repayment requirements of this section, is not eligible for guaranty or insurance, except as provided in paragraph (f) of this section.

      (e) No guaranteed or insured obligation shall contain a provision to the effect that the holder shall have the right to declare the indebtedness due, or to pursue one or more legal or equitable remedies, if holder “shall feel insecure,” or upon the occurrence of one or more such conditions optional to the holder, without regard to an act or omission by the debtor, which condition by the terms of the note, mortgage, or other loan instrument would at the option of the holder afford a basis for declaring a default.

      (f) Notwithstanding the inclusion in the guaranteed or insured obligation of a provision contrary to the provisions of this section, the right of the holder to payment of the guaranty or insurance shall not be thereby impaired: Provided,

      (1) Default was declared or maturity was accelerated under some other provision of the note, mortgage, or other loan instrument, or

      (2) Activation or enforcement of such provision is warranted under § 36.4350(i)(2), or if there exist conditions justifying the appointment of a receiver for the property (without reference to any contractual provisions for such appointment), or

      (3) The prior approval of the Secretary was obtained.

      (g) The holder of any guaranteed or insured obligation shall have the right, notwithstanding the absence of express provision therefor in the instruments evidencing the indebtedness, to accelerate the maturity of such obligation at any time after the continuance of any default for the period of three months.

      (h) If sufficient funds are tendered to bring a delinquency current at any time prior to a judicial or statutory sale or other public sale under power of sale provisions contained in the loan instruments to liquidate any security for a guaranteed loan, the holder shall be obligated to accept the funds in payment of the delinquency unless the prior approval of the Secretary is obtained to do otherwise, or unless reinstatement of the loan would adversely affect the dignity of the lien or be otherwise precluded by law. A delinquency will include all installment payments (principal, interest, taxes, insurance, advances, etc.) due and unpaid and any accumulated late charges plus any reasonable expenses incurred and paid by the holder if termination proceedings have begun (e.g., advertising costs, foreclosure costs, attorney or trustee fees, recording fees, etc.).

      § 36.4310   Amortization.

#### § § 36.4310

      (a) All loans, the maturity date of which is beyond 5 years from date of loan or date of assumption by the veteran, shall be amortized. Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, the schedule of payments thereon shall be in accordance with any generally recognized plan of amortization requiring approximately equal periodic payments and shall require a principal reduction not less often than annually during the life of the loan. The final installment on any loan shall not be in excess of two times the average of the preceding installments, except that on a construction loan such installment may be for an amount not in excess of 5 percent of the original principal amount of the loan. The limitations imposed herein on the amount of the final installment shall not apply in the case of any loan extended pursuant to § 36.4315.

      (b) Any plan of repayment on loans required to be amortized which does not provide for approximately equal periodic payments shall not be eligible unless the plan conforms with the provisions of paragraph (e) of this section, or is otherwise approved by the Secretary.

      (c) Every guaranteed or insured loan shall be repayable within the estimated economic life of the property securing the loan.

      (d) Subject to paragraph (a) of this section, any amounts which under the terms of a loan do not become due and payable on or before the last maturity date permissible for loans of its class under the limitations contained in 38 U.S.C. chapter 37 shall automatically fall due on such date.  § 36.4337.

      (e) A graduated payment mortgage loan, providing for deferrals of interest during the first 5 years of the loan and addition of the deferred amounts to principal shall be eligible, Provided:

      (1) The loan is for the purpose of acquiring a single-family dwelling unit, including a condominium unit or simultaneously acquiring and improving a previously occupied, existing single-family dwelling unit.

      (2)(i) For proposed construction or existing homes not previously occupied (new homes), the maximum loan amount cannot exceed 97.5 percent of the lesser of the reasonable value of the property as of the time the loan is made or the purchase price.

      (ii) For previously occupied, existing homes the maximum loan amount must be computed to assure that the principal amount of the loan, including all interest scheduled to be deferred and added to the loan principal, will not exceed the purchase price or reasonable value of the property, whichever is less, as of the time the loan is made;

      (3) The increases in the monthly periodic payment amount occur annually on each of the first five annual anniversary dates of the first loan installment due date, at a rate of 7.5 percent over the preceding year's monthly payment amount;

      (4) Beginning with the payment due on the fifth annual anniversary date of the first loan installment due date, all remaining monthly periodic payments are approximately equal in amount and amortize the loan fully in accordance with the requirements of this section, and

      (5) The plan is otherwise acceptable to the Secretary.

      § 36.4311   Prepayment.

#### § § 36.4311

      The debtor shall have the right to prepay at any time, without premium or fee, the entire indebtedness or any part thereof not less than the amount of one installment, or $100, whichever is less. Any prepayment in full of the indebtedness shall be credited on the date received, and no interest may be charged thereafter. Any partial prepayment made on other than an installment due date need not be credited until the next following installment due date or 30 days after such prepayment, whichever is earlier. The holder and the debtor may agree at any time that any prepayment not previously applied in satisfaction of matured installments shall be reapplied for the purpose of curing or preventing any subsequent default.

      § 36.4312   Interest rates.

#### § § 36.4312

      (a) In guaranteeing or insuring loans under 38 U.S.C. chapter 37, the Secretary may elect to require that such loans either bear interest at a rate that is agreed upon by the veteran and the lender, or bear interest at a rate not in excess of a rate established by the Secretary. The Secretary may, from time to time, change that election by publishing a notice in the  However, the interest rate of a loan for the purpose of an interest rate reduction under 38 U.S.C. 3710(a)(8), (a)(9)(B)(i), or (a)(11) must be less than the interest rate of the VA loan being refinanced. This paragraph does not apply in the case of an adjustable rate mortgage being refinanced under 38 U.S.C. 3710(a)(8), (a)(9)(B)(i), or (a)(11) with a fixed rate loan.

      (b) For loans bearing an interest rate agreed upon by the veteran and the lender, the veteran may pay reasonable discount points in connection with the loan. The discount points may not be included in the loan amount, except for interest rate reduction refinancing loans under 38 U.S.C. 3710(a)(8), (a)(9)(B)(i), and (a)(11). For loans bearing an interest rate agreed upon by the veteran and the lender, the provisions of § 36.4313(d)(6) and (d)(7) do not apply.

      (c) Except as provided in § 36.4315, interest in excess of the rate reported by the lender when requesting evidence of guaranty or insurance shall not be payable on any advance, or in the event of any delinquency or default: Provided, that a late charge not in excess of an amount equal to 4 percent on any installment paid more than 15 days after due date shall not be considered a violation of this limitation.

      (d) Effective October 1, 2003, adjustable rate mortgage loans which comply with the requirements of this paragraph (d) are eligible for guaranty.

      (1)  Changes in the interest rate charged on an adjustable rate mortgage must correspond to changes in the weekly average yield on one year (52 weeks) Treasury bills adjusted to a constant maturity. Yields on one year Treasury bills at “constant maturity” are interpolated by the United States Treasury from the daily yield curve. This curve, which relates the yield on the security to its time to maturity, is based on the closing market bid yields on actively traded one year Treasury bills in the over-the-counter market. The weekly average one year constant maturity Treasury bill yields are published by the Federal Reserve Board of the Federal Reserve System. The Federal Reserve Statistical Release Report H. 15 (519) is released each Monday. These one year constant maturity Treasury bill yields are also published monthly in the Federal Reserve Bulletin, published by the Federal Reserve Board of the Federal Reserve System, as well as quarterly in the Treasury Bulletin, published by the Department of the Treasury.

      (2)  Interest rate adjustments must occur on an annual basis, except that the first adjustment may occur no sooner than 36 months from the date of the borrower's first mortgage payment. The adjusted rate will become effective the first day of the month following the adjustment date; the first monthly payment at the new rate will be due on the first day of the following month. To set the new interest rate, the lender will determine the change between the initial ( base) index figure and the current index figure. The initial index figure shall be the most recent figure available before the date of the note. For loans where the date of the note is before January 10, 2015, the current index figure shall be the most recent index figure available 30 days before the date of each interest rate adjustment. For loans where the date of the note is on or after January 10, 2015, the current index figure shall be the most recent index figure available 45 days before the date of each interest rate adjustment.

      (3)  Interest rate changes may only be implemented through adjustments to the borrower's monthly payments.

      (4)  The initial contract interest rate of an adjustable rate mortgage shall be agreed upon by the lender and the veteran. Annual adjustments in the interest rate shall correspond to annual changes in the interest rate index, subject to the following conditions and limitations:

      (i) No single adjustment to the interest rate may result in a change in either direction of more than one percentage point from the interest rate in effect for the period immediately preceding that adjustment. Index changes in excess of one percentage point may not be carried over for inclusion in an adjustment in a subsequent year. Adjustments in the effective rate of interest over the entire term of the mortgage may not result in a change in either direction of more than five percentage points from the initial contract interest rate.

      (ii) At each adjustment date, changes in the index interest rate, whether increases or decreases, must be translated into the adjusted mortgage interest rate, rounded to the nearest one-eighth of one percent, up or down. For example, if the margin is 2 percent and the new index figure is 6.06 percent, the adjusted mortgage interest rate will be 8 percent. If the margin is 2 percent and the new index figure is 6.07 percent, the adjusted mortgage interest rate will be 8  percent.

      (5)  The lender shall explain fully and in writing to the borrower, at the time of loan application, the nature of the obligation taken. The borrower shall certify in writing that he or she fully understands the obligation and a copy of the signed certification shall be placed in the loan folder and furnished to VA upon request.

      (i) The fact that the mortgage interest rate may change, and an explanation of how changes correspond to changes in the interest rate index;

      (ii) Identification of the interest rate index, its source of publication and availability;

      (iii) The frequency (, annually) with which interest rate levels and monthly payments will be adjusted, and the length of the interval that will precede the initial adjustment; and

      (iv) A hypothetical monthly payment schedule that displays the maximum potential increases in monthly payments to the borrower over the first five years of the mortgage, subject to the provisions of the mortgage instrument.

      (6)  The lender must provide the borrower with disclosures in accordance with the timing, content, and format required by the regulations implementing the Truth in Lending Act (15 U.S.C. 1601 ) at 12 CFR 1026.20(c) and (d). A copy of these disclosures will be made a part of the lender's permanent record on the loan.

      § 36.4313   Charges and fees.

#### § § 36.4313

      (a) No charge shall be made against, or paid by, the borrower incident to the making of a guaranteed or insured loan other than those expressly permitted under paragraph (d) or (e) of this section, and no loan shall be guaranteed or insured unless the lender certifies to the Secretary that it has not imposed and will not impose any charges or fees against the borrower in excess of those permissible under paragraph (d) or (e) of this section. Any charge which is proper to make against the borrower under the provisions of this paragraph may be paid out of the proceeds of the loan: Provided, That if the purpose of the loan is to finance the purchase or construction of residential property the costs of closing the loan including the pro rata portion of the ground rents, hazard insurance premiums, current year's taxes, and other prepaid items normally involved in financing such transaction may not be included in the loan.

      (b) Except as provided in this subpart, no brokerage or service charge or their equivalent may be charged against the debtor or the proceeds of the loan either initially, periodically, or otherwise.

      (c) Brokerage or other charges shall not be made against the veteran for obtaining any guaranty or insurance under 38 U.S.C. chapter 37, nor shall any premiums for insurance on the life of the borrower be paid out of the proceeds of a loan.

      (d) The following schedule of permissible fees and charges shall be applicable to all Department of Veterans Affairs guaranteed or insured loans.

      (1) The veteran may pay reasonable and customary amounts for any of the following items:

      (i) Fees of Department of Veterans Affairs appraiser and of compliance inspectors designated by the Department of Veterans Affairs except appraisal fees incurred for the predetermination of reasonable value requested by others than veteran or lender.

      (ii) Recording fees and recording taxes or other charges incident to recordation.

      (iii) Credit report.

      (iv) That portion of taxes, assessments, and other similar items for the current year chargeable to the borrower and an initial deposit (lump-sum payment) for the tax and insurance account.

      (v) Hazard insurance required by § 36.4329.

      (vi) Survey, if required by lender or veteran; except that any charge for a survey in connection with a loan under §§ 36.4360 through 36.4365 (Condominium Loans) must have the prior approval of the Secretary.

      (vii) Title examination and title insurance, if any.

      (viii) The actual amount charged for flood zone determinations, including a charge for a life-of-the-loan flood zone determination service purchased at the time of loan origination, if made by a third party who guarantees the accuracy of the determination. A fee may not be charged for a flood zone determination made by a Department of Veterans Affairs appraiser or for the lender's own determination.

      (ix) Such other items as may be authorized in advance by the Under Secretary for Benefits as appropriate for inclusion under this paragraph (d) as proper local variances.

      (2) A lender may charge and the veteran may pay a flat charge not exceeding 1 percent of the amount of the loan, provided that such flat charge shall be in lieu of all other charges relating to costs of origination not expressly specified and allowed in this schedule.

      (3) In cases where a lender makes advances to a veteran during the progress of construction, alteration, improvement, or repair, either under a commitment of the Department of Veterans Affairs to issue a guaranty certificate or insurance credit upon completion, or where the lender would be entitled to guaranty or insurance on such advances when reported under automatic procedure, the lender may make a charge against the veteran of not exceeding 2 percent of the amount of the loan for its services in supervising the making of advances and the progress of construction notwithstanding that the “holdback” or final advance is not actually paid out until after the construction, alteration, improvement, or repair is fully completed: Provided, That the major portion (51 percent or more) of the loan proceeds is paid out during the actual progress of the construction, alteration, improvement, or repair. Such charge may be in addition to the 1 percent charge allowed under paragraph (d)(2) of this section.

      (4) In consideration, alteration, improvement or repair loans, including supplemental loans made pursuant to § 36.4359, where no charge is permissible under the provisions of paragraph (d)(3) of this section the lender may charge and the veteran may pay a flat sum not exceeding 1 percent of the amount of the loan. Such charge may be in addition to the 1 percent allowed under paragraph (d)(2) of this section.

      (5) The fees and charges permitted under this paragraph are maximums and are not intended to preclude a lender from making alternative charges against the veteran which are not specifically authorized in the schedule provided the imposition of such alternative charges would not result in an aggregate charge or payment in excess of the prescribed maximum.

      (6) The veteran borrower subject to the limitations set forth in paragraphs (d)(6) and (7) of this section may pay a discount required by a lender when the proceeds of the loan will be used for any of the following purposes:

      (i) To refinance existing indebtedness pursuant to 38 U.S.C. 3710(a)(5), (a)(8), (a)(9)(B)(i) or (a)(9)(B)(ii);

      (ii) To repair, alter or improve a dwelling owned by the veteran pursuant to 38 U.S.C. 3710(a)(4) or (7) if such loan is to be secured by a first lien;

      (iii) To construct a dwelling or farm residence on land already owned or to be acquired by the veteran, provided that the veteran did not or will not acquire the land directly or indirectly from a builder or developer who will be constructing such dwelling or farm residence;

      (iv) To purchase a dwelling from a class of sellers which the Secretary determines are legally precluded under all circumstances from paying such a discount if the best interest of the veteran would be so served.

      (7) Discounts shall be computed as follows:

      (i) Unless otherwise approved by the Secretary, the discount, if any, to be paid by the borrower on a loan secured by a first lien may not exceed the difference between the bid price, rounded to the lower whole number, and par value for GNMA (Government National Mortgage Association) 90-day forward bid closing price for pass through securities   percent less than the face note rate of the loan. Unless the lender and borrower negotiate a firm written commitment for a maximum amount of discount to be paid, the bid price to be used in the computation must be the GNMA 90-day forward bid closing quote for any day 1 to 4 business days prior to loan closing. “Loan closing” is defined for this purpose as the date on which the borrower's 3-day right of rescission commences pursuant to the Truth in Lending Act. If the lender and borrower choose to negotiate a firm discount commitment for a maximum amount of discount to be paid, the bid price to be used in establishing the maximum discount must be the closing quote for the business day prior to the date of the commitment. Lenders negotiating firm commitments must close that loan at a discount no higher than the firm commitment regardless of changes in the maximum allowable Department of Veterans Affairs interest rate. If a lender's commitment expires prior to loan closing, the lender and borrower may negotiate a new firm commitment based on the procedure outlined in this paragraph (d)(7)(i) or may use the procedure for determining the discount based on the GNMA 90-day forward bid closing quote for any day 1 to 4 business days prior to loan closing.

      (ii) The borrower, subject to the limitations set forth in paragraphs (d)(6) and (7) of this section, may pay a discount required by the lender when the proceeds of the loan will be used to repair, alter, or improve a dwelling owned by the veteran pursuant to 38 U.S.C. 3710(a)(4) or (7) if such loan is unsecured or secured by less than a first lien. No such discount may be charged unless:

      (A) The loan is submitted to the Secretary for prior approval;

      (B) The dollar amount of the discount is disclosed to the Secretary and the veteran prior to the issuance by the Secretary of the certificate of commitment. Said certificate of commitment shall specify the discount to be paid by the veteran, and this discount may not be increased once the commitment is issued without the approval of the Secretary; and

      (C) The discount has been determined by the Secretary to be reasonable in amount.

      (iii) A veteran may pay the discount on an acquisition and improvement loan (as defined in § 36.4301) provided:

      (A) The veteran pays no discount on the acquisition portion of the loan except in accordance with paragraph (d)(6)(iv) of this section; and

      (B) The discount paid on the improvements portion of the loan does not exceed the percentage of discount paid on the acquisition portion of the loan.

      (iv) Unless the Under Secretary for Benefits otherwise directs, all powers of the Secretary under paragraphs (d)(6) and (7) of this section are hereby delegated to the officials designated by § 36.4345(b).

      (8) On any loan to which 38 U.S.C. 3714 applies, the holder may charge a reasonable fee, not to exceed the lesser of $300 and the actual cost of any credit report required, or any maximum prescribed by applicable State law, for processing an application for assumption and changing its records.

      (e) Subject to the limitations set out in paragraph (e)(4) of this section, a fee must be paid to the Secretary.

      (1) The fee on loans to veterans shall be as follows:

      (i) On all interest rate reduction refinancing loans guaranteed under 38 U.S.C. 3710(a)(8), (a)(9)(B)(i), and (a)(11), the fee shall be 0.50 percent of the total loan amount.

      (ii) On all refinancing loans other than those described in paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section, the funding fee shall be 2.75 percent of the loan amount for loans to veterans whose entitlement is based on service in the Selected Reserve under the provisions of 38 U.S.C. 3701(b)(5), and 2 percent of the loan amount for loans to all other veterans; provided, however, that if the veteran is using entitlement for a second or subsequent time, the fee shall be 3 percent of the loan amount.

      (iii) Except for loans to veterans whose entitlement is based on service in the Selected Reserve under the provisions of 38 U.S.C. 3701(b)(5), the funding fee shall be 2 percent of the total loan amount for all loans for the purchase or construction of a home on which the veteran does not make a down payment, unless the veteran is using entitlement for a second or subsequent time, in which case the fee shall be 3 percent. On purchase or construction loans on which the veteran makes a down payment of 5 percent or more, but less than 10 percent, the amount of the funding fee shall be 1.50 percent of the total loan amount. On purchase or construction loans on which the veteran makes a down payment of 10 percent or more, the amount of the funding fee shall be 1.25 percent of the total loan amount.

      (iv) On loans to veterans whose entitlement is based on service in the Selected Reserve under the provisions of 38 U.S.C. 3701(b)(5), the funding fee shall be 2.75 percent of the total loan amount on loans for the purchase or construction of a home on which the veteran does not make a down payment, unless the veteran is using entitlement for a second or subsequent time, in which case the fee shall be 3 percent. On purchase or construction loans on which veterans whose entitlement is based on service in the Selected Reserve make a down payment of 5 percent or more, but less than 10 percent, the amount of the funding fee shall be 2.25 percent of the total loan amount. On purchase or construction loans on which such veterans make a down payment of 10 percent or more, the amount of the funding fee shall be 2 percent of the total loan amount.

      (v) All or part of the fee may be paid in cash at loan closing or all or part of the fee may be included in the loan without regard to the reasonable value of the property or the computed maximum loan amount, as appropriate. In computing the fee, the lender will disregard any amount included in the loan to enable the borrower to pay such fee.

      (2) Subject to the limitations set out in this section, a fee of one-half of one percent of the loan balance must be paid to the Secretary in a manner prescribed by the Secretary by a person assuming a loan to which 38 U.S.C. 3714 applies. The instrument securing such a loan shall contain a provision describing the right of the holder to collect this fee as trustee for the Department of Veterans Affairs. The loan holder shall list the amount of this fee in every assumption statement provided and include a notice that the fee must be paid to the holder immediately following loan settlement. The fee must be transmitted to the Secretary within 15 days of the receipt by the holder of the notice of transfer.

      (3) The lender is required to pay to the Secretary the fee described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section within 15 days after loan closing. Any lender closing a loan, subject to the limitations set out in paragraph (e)(4) of this section who fails to submit timely payment of this fee will be subject to a late charge equal to 4 percent of the total fee due. If payment of the fee described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section is made more than 30 days after loan closing, interest will be assessed at a rate set in conformity with the Department of Treasury's Fiscal Requirements Manual. This interest charge is in addition to the 4 percent late charge, but the late charge is not included in the amount on which interest is computed. This interest charge is to be calculated on a daily basis beginning on the date of closing, although the interest will be assessed only on funding fee payments received more than 30 days after closing.

      (4) The lender is required to pay to the Secretary electronically through the Automated Clearing House (ACH) system the fees described in paragraphs (e)(1) and (e)(2) of this section and any late fees and interest due on them. This shall be paid to a collection agent by operator-assisted telephone, terminal entry, or CPU-to-CPU transmission. The collection agent will be identified by the Secretary. The lender shall provide the collection agent with the following: authorization for payment of the funding fee (including late fees and interest) along with the following information: VA lender ID number; four-digit personal identification number; dollar amount of debit; VA loan number; OJ (office of jurisdiction) code; closing date; loan amount; information about whether the payment includes a shortage, late charge, or interest; veteran name; loan type; sale amount; down payment; whether the veteran is a reservist; and whether this is a subsequent use of entitlement. For all transactions received prior to 8:15 p.m. on a workday, VA will be credited with the amount paid to the collection agent at the opening of business the next banking day.

      (5) The fees described in paragraph (e)(1) and (e)(2) of this section shall not be collected from a veteran who is receiving compensation (or who but for the receipt of retirement pay would be entitled to receive compensation) or from a surviving spouse described in section 3701(b) of title 38, United States Code.

      § 36.4314   Advances and other charges.

#### § § 36.4314

      (a) A holder may advance any amount reasonably necessary and proper for the maintenance or repair of the security, or for the payment of accrued taxes, special assessments, ground or water rents, or premiums on fire or other casualty insurance against loss of or damage to such property and any such advance so made may be added to the guaranteed or insured indebtedness. A holder may also advance the one-half of one percent funding fee due on a transfer under 38 U.S.C. 3714 when this is not paid at the time of transfer. All security instruments for loans to which 38 U.S.C. 3714 applies must include a clause authorizing the collection of an assumption funding fee and an advance for this fee if it is not paid at the time of transfer.

      (b) In addition to advances allowable under paragraph (a) of this section, the holder may charge against the proceeds of the sale of the security; may charge against gross amounts collected; may include in any accounting to the Secretary after payment of a claim under the guaranty; may include in the computation of a claim under the guaranty, if lawfully authorized by the loan agreement and subject to § 36.4324(a); or, may include in the computation of an insurance loss, any of the following items actually paid:

      (1) Any expense which is reasonably necessary for preservation of the security;

      (2) Court costs in a foreclosure or other proper judicial proceeding involving the security;

      (3) Other expenses reasonably necessary for collecting the debt, or repossession or liquidation of the security;

      (4) Reasonable trustee's fees or commissions not in excess of those allowed by statute and in no event in excess of 5 percent of the unpaid indebtedness;

      (5)(i) Fees for legal services actually performed, not to exceed the reasonable and customary fees for such services in the State where the property is located, as determined by the Secretary.

      (ii) In determining what constitutes the reasonable and customary fees for legal services, the Secretary shall review allowances for legal fees in connection with the foreclosure of single-family housing loans, including bankruptcy-related services, issued by HUD, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac. The Secretary will review such fees annually and, as the Secretary deems necessary, publish in the  a table setting forth the amounts the Secretary determines to be reasonable and customary. The table will reflect the primary method for foreclosing in each state, either judicial or non-judicial, with the exception of those States where either judicial or non-judicial is acceptable. The use of a method not authorized in the table will require prior approval from VA. This table will be available throughout the year on a VA controlled Web site, such as at

      (iii) If the foreclosure attorney has the discretion to conduct the sale or to name a substitute trustee to conduct the sale, the combined total paid for legal fees under paragraph (b)(5)(i) of this section and trustee's fees pursuant to paragraph (b)(4) of this section shall not exceed the applicable maximum allowance for legal fees established under paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section. If the trustee conducting the sale must be a Government official under local law, or if an individual other than the foreclosing attorney (or any employee of that attorney) is appointed as part of judicial proceedings, and local law also establishes the fees payable for the services of the public or judicially appointed trustee, then those fees will not be subject to the maximum established for legal fees under paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section and may be included in the total indebtedness.

      (6) The cost of a credit report(s) on the debtor(s), which is (are) to be forwarded to the Secretary in connection with the claim;

      (7) Reasonable and customary costs of property inspections;

      (8) Any other expense or fee that is approved in advance by the Secretary.

      (c) Any advances or charges enumerated in paragraph (a) or (b) of this section may be included as specified in the holder's accounting to the Secretary, but they are not chargeable to the debtor unless he or she otherwise be liable therefor.

      (d) Advances of the type enumerated in paragraph (a) of this section and any other advances determined by VA to be necessary and proper in order to preserve or protect the security may be authorized by employees designated in § 36.4345(b) in the case of any property constituting the security for a loan acquired by the Secretary or constituting the security for the unpaid balance of the purchase price owing to the Secretary on account of the sale of such property. Such advances shall be secured to the extent legal and practicable by a lien on the property.

      (e) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a) or (b) of this section, holders of condominium loans guaranteed or insured under 38 U.S.C. 3710(a)(6) shall not pay those assessments or charges allocable to the condominium unit which are provided for in the instruments establishing the condominium form of ownership in the absence of the prior approval of the Secretary.

      (f)(1) Fees and charges otherwise allowable by this section that accrue after the date specified in paragraph (f)(2) of this section may not be included in a claim under the guaranty.

      (2) The date referenced in paragraph (f)(1) of this section will be computed by adding 210 calendar days to the due date of the last paid installment, plus the reasonable period that the Secretary has determined, pursuant to § 36.4322(a), it should have taken to complete the foreclosure. There will also be added to the time period specified in the previous sentence such additional time as the Secretary determines was reasonably necessary to complete the foreclosure if the Secretary determines the holder was unable to complete the foreclosure within the time specified in that section due to Bankruptcy proceedings, appeal of the foreclosure by the debtor, the holder granting forbearance in excess of 30 days at the request of the Secretary, or other factors beyond the control of the holder.

      § 36.4315   Loan modifications.

#### § § 36.4315

      (a) The terms of any guaranteed loan may be modified by a documented agreement between the holder and the borrower, without prior approval of the Secretary, if all of the following conditions are met:

      (1) The loan is in default;

      (2) The event or circumstances that caused the default has been or will be resolved and it is not expected to re-occur;

      (3) The obligor is considered to be a reasonable credit risk, based on a review by the holder of the obligor's creditworthiness under the criteria specified in § 36.4340, including a current credit report. The fact of the recent default will not preclude the holder from determining the obligor is now a satisfactory credit risk provided the holder determines that the obligor is able to resume regular mortgage installments when the modification becomes effective based upon a review of the obligor's current and anticipated income, expenses, and other obligations as provided in § 36.4340;

      (4) At least 12 monthly payments have been paid since the closing date of the loan;

      (5) The current owner(s) is obligated to repay the loan, and is party to the loan modification agreement;

      (6) The loan will be reinstated to performing status by virtue of the loan modification;

      (7) A loan has not been modified more than once in a 3-year period or more than 3 times during the life of the loan;

      (8) The loan as modified will bear a fixed-rate of interest, which—

      (i) May not exceed the most recent Freddie Mac Weekly Primary Mortgage Market Survey Rate for 30-year fixed-rate conforming mortgages (U.S. Average), rounded to the nearest one-eighth of one percent (0.125%), as of the date the Modification Agreement is approved, plus 50 basis points;

      (ii) After being determined and selected in accordance with paragraph (i), is not more than one percent higher than the existing rate on the loan; or,

      (iii) In the case of a loan in which a State, Territorial, or local governmental agency provided assistance to the veteran for the acquisition of the dwelling, and the law providing that assistance precludes any revision in the interest rate on the loan, then the interest rate on the modified loan is the same or less than that on the original note evidencing the loan;

      (9) The unpaid balance of the modified loan will be re-amortized over the remaining life of the loan, or if the loan term is to be extended, the maturity date will not exceed the shorter of:

      (i) 360 months from the due date of the first installment required under the modification, or

      (ii) 120 months after the original maturity date of the loan (unless the original term was less than 360 months, in which case the term may be extended to 480 months from the due date of the first installment on the original loan);

      (10) Only the following items may be included in the modified indebtedness: Unpaid principal; accrued interest; deficits in the taxes and insurance impound accounts; amounts incurred to pay actual legal fees and foreclosure costs related to the canceled foreclosure; (subject to the maximum amounts prescribed in § 36.4314) the cost of a title insurance policy endorsement or other update for the modified loan; and advances required to preserve the lien position, such as homeowner association fees, special assessments, water and sewer liens, etc. Late fees and other charges may not be capitalized;

      (11) The holder will not charge a processing fee, and all unpaid late fees will be waived. Any other actual costs incurred and legally chargeable, but which cannot be capitalized in the modified indebtedness, may be collected directly from the borrower as part of the modification process or waived, at the discretion of the servicer;

      (12) Holders will ensure the first lien status of the modified loan;

      (13) The dollar amount of the guaranty will not exceed the greater of:

      (i) The original guaranty amount of the loan being modified (but if the modified loan amount is less than the original loan amount, then the amount of guaranty will be equal to the original guaranty percentage applied to the modified loan), or

      (ii) 25 percent of the loan being modified subject to the statutory maximum specified at 38 U.S.C. 3703(a)(1)(B); and

      (14) The obligor will not receive any cash back from the modification.

      (b) If a loan fails to meet one or more of the conditions identified in paragraph (a), the holder must submit the loan file to the Secretary for approval before entering into any loan modification agreement. The Secretary will grant such approval if the Secretary determines that the modification is in the best interests of the veteran and the Government after balancing the risks of non-approval versus approval despite the absence of one or more of the conditions identified in paragraph (a) of this section.

      (c) This section does not create a right of a borrower to have a loan modified, but simply authorizes the loan holder to modify a loan in certain situations without the prior approval of the Secretary.

      § 36.4316   Acceptability of partial payments.

#### § § 36.4316

      A partial payment is a remittance by or on behalf of the borrower on a loan in default (as defined in § 36.4301) of any amount less than the full amount due under the terms of the loan and security instruments at the time the remittance is tendered.

      (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, or upon the express waiver of the Secretary, the mortgage holder shall accept any partial payment and either apply it to the mortgagor's account or identify it with the mortgagor's account and hold it in a special account pending disposition. When partial payments held for disposition aggregate a full monthly installment, including escrow, they shall be applied to the mortgagor's account.

      (b) A partial payment may be returned to the mortgagor, within 10 calendar days from date of receipt of such payment, with a letter of explanation only if one or more of the following conditions exist:

      (1) The property is wholly or partially tenant-occupied and rental payments are not being remitted to the holder for application to the loan account;

      (2) The payment is less than one full monthly installment, including escrows and late charge, if applicable, unless the lesser payment amount has been agreed to under a repayment plan;

      (3) The payment is less than 50 percent of the total amount then due, unless the lesser payment amount has been agreed to under a repayment plan;

      (4) The payment is less than the amount agreed to in a repayment plan;

      (5) The amount tendered is in the form of a personal check and the holder has previously notified the mortgagor in writing that only cash or certified remittances are acceptable;

      (6) A delinquency of any amount has continued for at least 6 months since the account first became delinquent and no repayment plan has been arranged;

      (7) Foreclosure has been commenced by the taking of the first action required for foreclosure under local law; or

      (8) The holder's lien position would be jeopardized by acceptance of the partial payment.

      (c) A failure by the holder to comply with the provisions of this paragraph may result in a partial or total loss of guaranty or insurance pursuant to § 36.4328(b), but such failure shall not constitute a defense to any legal action to terminate the loan.

      § 36.4318   Servicer tier ranking—temporary procedures.

#### § § 36.4318

      (a) The Secretary shall assign to each servicer a “Tier Ranking” based upon the servicer's performance in servicing guaranteed loans. There shall be four tiers, known as tier one, tier two, tier three, and tier four, with tier one being the highest rated and tier four the lowest. Upon the effective date of this regulation, every servicer of loans guaranteed by the Secretary shall be presumed to be in servicer tier two, and shall remain in tier two until the date specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.

      (b) For purposes of this section, the term “calendar quarter” shall mean the 3-month periods ending on March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31.

      (c)(1) No later than 30 calendar days after the last business day of the first calendar quarter occurring after the rules for determining tier rankings take effect, and then not later than 30 calendar days after the last business day of each subsequent calendar quarter, the Secretary shall provide each servicer with an evaluation of their performance under such rules.

      (2) No later than 45 calendar days after the last business day of the fourth calendar quarter during which the Secretary evaluates the performance of servicers, and then annually thereafter, VA shall advise each servicer of its tier ranking.

      (3) Any entity which begins servicing guaranteed loans after the first calendar quarter occurring after rules for determining tier rankings take effect shall be presumed to be in tier two. The Secretary will evaluate the performance of such servicer as provided in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. The Secretary will advise such servicer of its tier ranking at the time other servicers are advised of their tier rankings pursuant to paragraph (c)(2) of this section, provided the servicer has received evaluations for at least four continuous calendar quarters.

      (d) The quarterly evaluation and tier ranking of a servicer shall be deemed to be confidential and privileged and shall not be disclosed by the Secretary to any other party.

      § 36.4319   Servicer loss-mitigation options and incentives.

#### § § 36.4319

      (a) The Secretary will pay a servicer in tiers one, two, or three an incentive payment for each of the following successful loss-mitigation options or alternatives to foreclosure completed: repayment plans, special forbearances, loan modifications, short sales, and deeds-in-lieu of foreclosure. Only one incentive payment will be made with respect to any default required to be reported to the Secretary pursuant to § 36.4317(c). No incentive payment will be made to a servicer in tier four. The options and alternatives are listed in paragraph (b) of this section from top to bottom in their preferred order of consideration (, a hierarchy for review), but VA recognizes that individual circumstances may lead to “out of the ordinary” considerations.

      (b) The amount of the incentive payment is as follows:

      (c) For purposes of this section, a loss-mitigation option or alternative to foreclosure will be deemed successfully completed as follows:

      (1) With respect to a repayment plan (as defined in § 36.4301), when the loan reinstates;

      (2) With respect to special forbearance (as defined in § 36.4301), when the loan reinstates. If a repayment plan is developed at the end of the forbearance period, then the special forbearance is not eligible for an incentive payment, although the subsequent repayment plan may be eligible upon loan reinstatement;

      (3) With respect to a loan modification, when the modification is executed and the loan reinstates;

      (4) With respect to a short sale, when the claim under guaranty is filed; or

      (5) With respect to a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure, when the claim under guaranty is filed.

      (d) Incentive payments with respect to repayment plans, special forbearances and loan modifications shall be made no less frequently than monthly. For all other successful loss-mitigation options, incentives shall be paid in the final claim payment.

      (e) The Secretary shall reserve the right to stop an incentive payment to a servicer if the servicer fails to perform adequate servicing.

#### § § 36.4320

      (a) Upon receiving a notice of default or a notice under § 36.4317, the Secretary may require the holder upon penalty of otherwise losing the guaranty or insurance to transfer and assign the loan and the security therefore to the Secretary or to another designated by the Secretary upon receipt of payment in full of the balance of the indebtedness remaining unpaid to the date of such assignment. Such assignment may be made without recourse but the transferor shall not thereby be relieved from the provisions of § 36.4328.

      (b) If the obligation is assigned or transferred to a third party pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section the Secretary may continue in effect the guaranty or insurance issued with respect to the previous loan in such manner as to cover the assignee or transferee.

      (c) Servicers must deliver to the Secretary all legal documents, including but not limited to proper loan assignments, required as evidence of proper loan transfer within 60 calendar days from the date that VA sends notice to the servicer that VA has decided to purchase a loan under this section. Servicers exhibiting a continued failure to provide timely loan transfer documentation may, at the discretion of the Secretary and following advance notice to the servicer, be subject to temporary suspension of all property acquisition and claim payments until all deficiencies identified in the notice provided to the servicer have been corrected.

      § 36.4321   Service of process.

#### § § 36.4321

      (a) In any legal or equitable proceeding to which the Secretary is a party (including probate and bankruptcy proceedings) arising from a loan guaranteed, insured, or made, or a property acquired by the Secretary pursuant to title 38, U.S.C. chapter 37, original process and any other process prior to appearance that may be served on the Secretary must be delivered to the VA Regional Counsel located in the jurisdiction in which the proceeding is docketed. Copies of such process will also be served on the Attorney General of the United States and the United States Attorney having jurisdiction over that area. Within the time required by applicable law, or rule of court, the Secretary will cause appropriate special or general appearance to be entered in the case by an authorized attorney.

      (b) After appearance of the Secretary by attorney all process and notice otherwise proper to serve on the Secretary before or after judgment, if served on the attorney of record, shall have the same effect as if the Secretary were personally served within the jurisdiction of the court.

      § 36.4322   Loan termination.

#### § § 36.4322

      (a) For purposes of this part, a holder, using reasonable diligence must complete a foreclosure within the timeframe and in the manner determined by the Secretary. In determining what constitutes allowable time and method for foreclosure, the Secretary shall review allowances for time and method in connection with the foreclosure of single-family housing loans issued by HUD, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac, as well as State statutory requirements. The Secretary will review such timeframes annually and, as the Secretary deems necessary, publish in the  a table setting forth the timeframes and methods the Secretary determines to be reasonable. The schedule will reflect the timeframe allowed for the standard, acceptable method for foreclosure proceedings in each State. The use of another method will require prior approval from VA. VA will maintain the loan termination time allowable timeframes on a Web site under VA's control, such as at

      (b)(1) At least 30 days prior to the scheduled or anticipated date of the liquidation sale, the holder must request that VA assign an appraiser to conduct a liquidation appraisal.

      (2) If the holder (or its authorized servicing agent) has been approved by the Secretary to process liquidation appraisals under 38 CFR 36.4348, the appraiser shall forward the liquidation appraisal report directly to the holder for a determination of the fair market value of the property pursuant to § 36.4348.

      (3) If the holder (or its authorized servicing agent) has not been approved by the Secretary to process liquidations appraisals under 38 CFR 36.4348, the Secretary shall review the appraisal and determine the fair market value of the property. The Secretary will provide the holder with a statement of the fair market value.

      (4)(i) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section, a liquidation appraisal or statement of fair market value issued pursuant to paragraph (b)(3) of this section will be valid for 180 calendar days.

      (ii) The Secretary may specify in writing a shorter validity period, not less than 90 calendar days, for a liquidation appraisal or statement of fair market value if rapidly-changing market conditions in the area where the property is located make such shorter validity period in the best fiscal interests of the United States.

      (c) Prior to the liquidation sale, the holder shall compute the net value of the property securing the guaranteed loan by subtracting the estimated costs to the Secretary for the acquisition and disposition of the property from the fair market value, as determined under paragraph (b) of this section. Those costs will be calculated using the percentage derived by the Secretary and published in the  pursuant to § 36.4301.

      (d) If the holder learns of any material damage to the property occurring after the appraisal and prior to the liquidation sale, the impact of such damage on the fair market value must be determined in consultation with the fee appraiser, and the net value adjusted accordingly.

      (e)(1) A holder may approve a short sale of the property securing the loan without the prior approval of the Secretary provided that:

      (i) The holder has determined the loan is insoluble;

      (ii) The credit to the indebtedness (consisting of the net proceeds from the short sale and any waiver of indebtedness by the holder) must equal or exceed the net value of the property securing the loan; and

      (iii) The current owner of the property securing the loan will not receive any proceeds from the sale of the property.

      (2) A holder may request advance approval from the Secretary for a short sale notwithstanding that all of the conditions specified in paragraph (e)(1) of this section cannot be met if the holder believes such short sale would be in the best interests of the veteran and the Secretary.

      (f)(1) A holder may accept a deed voluntarily tendered by the current owner of the property securing the loan in lieu of conducting a foreclosure without the prior approval of the Secretary provided that:

      (i) The holder has determined the loan is insoluble;

      (ii) The holder has computed the net value of the property securing the loan pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section;

      (iii) The holder has considered a short sale pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section and determined such short sale is not practical; and,

      (iv) The holder has determined the current owner of the property can convey clear and marketable title to the property that would meet the standard stated in paragraph (d)(5) of § 36.4323.

      (2) A holder may request advance approval from the Secretary for a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure notwithstanding that all of the conditions specified in paragraph (f)(1) of this section cannot be met if the holder believes such deed-in-lieu would be in the best interests of the veteran and the Secretary.

      § 36.4323   Election to convey security.

#### § § 36.4323

      (a) If the holder acquires the property that secured the guaranteed loan at the liquidation sale or through acceptance of a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure and if, under 38 U.S.C. 3732(c), the Secretary may accept conveyance of the property, the holder must notify the Secretary by electronic means no later than 15 calendar days after the date of liquidation sale (, the event which fixes the rights of the parties in the property, such as the date of foreclosure sale, date of recordation of a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure, or confirmation/ratification of sale date when required under local practice) that the holder elects to convey the property to the Secretary. The Secretary will not accept conveyance of the property if the holder fails to notify the Secretary of its election within such 15 calendar days. In computing the eligible indebtedness under 38 U.S.C. 3732(c), the holder may follow the alternative procedure described in paragraph (b) of this section.

      (b) If the calculation by the holder shows that the net value is equal to or less than the unguaranteed portion of the loan (, the total indebtedness minus VA's maximum claim payable under the guaranty), this would preclude conveyance under 38 U.S.C. 3732(c). However, the holder may desire to convey the property to VA and may decide to waive a portion of the indebtedness to the extent that the property may be conveyed under 38 U.S.C. 3732(c). In such a case, the holder must provide the notice described in paragraph (a) of this section, and must subsequently waive that portion of the total indebtedness remaining after application of the net value amount and VA's guaranty claim payment. The holder must send the borrower(s) a notice describing the amount of indebtedness that has been waived no later than 15 calendar days after receipt of the guaranty claim.

      (c) The holder, in accounting to the Secretary in connection with the conveyance of any property pursuant to this section, may include as a part of the indebtedness all actual expenses or costs of the proceedings, paid by the holder, within the limits defined in § 36.4314. In connection with the conveyance or transfer of property to the Secretary the holder may include in accounting to the Secretary the following expense items if actually paid by the holder, in addition to the consideration payable for the property under 38 U.S.C. 3732(c):

      (1) State and documentary stamp taxes as may be required.

      (2) Amount expended for taxes, special assessments, including such payments which are specified in paragraph (d)(4) of this section.

      (3) Recording fees.

      (4) Any other expenditures in connection with the property which are approved by the Secretary, including, but not limited to, the cost of a title policy insuring title in the name of the Secretary of Veterans Affairs.

      (d) The conveyance or transfer of any property to the Secretary pursuant to this section shall be subject to the following provisions:

      (1) The notice of the holder's election to convey the property to the Secretary shall state the amount of the holder's successful bid and shall state the insurance coverage then in force, specifying for each policy, the name of the insurance company, the hazard covered, the amount, and the expiration date. With respect to a voluntary conveyance to the holder in lieu of foreclosure, the amount of the holder's successful bid shall be deemed to be the lesser of the net value of the property or the total indebtedness.

      (2) Coincident with the notice of election to convey or transfer the property to the Secretary or with the acquisition of the property by the holder, following such notice, whichever is later, the holder shall request endorsements on all insurance policies naming the Secretary as an assured, as his/her interest may appear. Such insurance policies shall be forwarded to the Secretary at the time of the conveyance or transfer of the property to the Secretary or as soon after that time as feasible. If insurers cancel policies, holders must properly account for any unearned premiums refunded by the insurer.

      (3) Occupancy of the property by anyone properly in possession by virtue of and during a period of redemption, or by anyone else unless under a claim of title which makes the title sought to be conveyed by the holder of less dignity or quality than that required by this section, shall not preclude the holder from conveying or transferring the property to the Secretary. Except with the prior approval of the Secretary, the holder shall not rent the property to a new tenant, nor extend the term of an existing tenancy on other than a month-to-month basis.

      (4) The notice shall provide property tax information to include all taxing authority property identification numbers. Any taxes, special assessments or ground rents due and payable within 30 days after date of conveyance or transfer to the Secretary must be paid by the holder.

      (5)(i) Each conveyance or transfer of real property to the Secretary pursuant to this section shall be acceptable if:

      (A) The holder thereby covenants or warrants against the acts of the holder and those claiming under the holder (e.g., by special warranty deed); and

      (B) It vests in the Secretary or will entitle the Secretary to such title as is or would be acceptable to prudent lending institutions, informed buyers, title companies, and attorneys, generally, in the community in which the property is situated.

      (ii) Any title will not be unacceptable to the Secretary by reason of any of the limitations on the quantum or quality of the property or title stated in § 36.4354(b),  that:

      (A) At the time of conveyance or transfer to the Secretary there has been no breach of any conditions affording a right to the exercise of any reverter.

      (B) With respect to any such limitations which came into existence subsequent to the making of the loan, full compliance was had with the requirements of § 36.4327.

      (iii) The acceptability of a conveyance or transfer pursuant to the requirements of this paragraph will generally be established by delivery to the Secretary of the following evidence of title showing that title to the property of the quality specified in this paragraph (d)(5) is or will be vested in the Secretary:

      (A) A copy of the deed or document evidencing transfer of interest and title at the liquidation sale;

      (B) A special warranty deed conveying the property to the Secretary;

      (C) Origination Deed of Trust or Mortgage;

      (D) Original or Copy of Mortgagee's Title Insurance Policy from Loan Origination (except in Iowa, where a title abstract is required);

      (E) Owner's Title Insurance Policy issued after loan termination in the name of the Secretary (except in Iowa, where a title abstract is required);

      (F) Loan Assignments;

      (G) Appointment of Substitute Trustee (where required as part of the termination process);

      (H) Estoppel Affidavit for deed in lieu of foreclosure, if required by State law and appropriate language cannot be included in the deed in lieu of foreclosure; and/or

      (I) Any evidence that the Secretary may reasonably require.

      (iv) In lieu of such title evidence listed in paragraph (d)(5)(iii) of this section, the Secretary will accept a conveyance or transfer with general warranty with respect to the title from a holder described in 38 U.S.C. 3702(d) or from a holder of financial responsibility satisfactory to the Secretary.

      (6) Except with respect to matters covered by any covenants or warranties of the holder, the acceptance by the Secretary of a conveyance or transfer by the holder shall conclude the responsibility of the holder to the Secretary under the regulations of this subpart with respect to the title. In the event of the subsequent discovery of title defects, the Secretary shall have no recourse against the holder with respect to such title other than by reason of such covenants or warranties.

      (7) As between the holder and the Secretary, the responsibility for any loss due to damage to or destruction of the property or due to personal injury sustained in respect to such property shall be governed by the provisions of this paragraph and paragraph (d)(11) of this section. Ordinary wear and tear excepted, the holder shall bear such risk of loss from the date of acquisition by the holder to the date such risk of loss is assumed by the Secretary. Such risk of loss is assumed by the Secretary from the date of receipt of the holder's election to convey or transfer the property to the Secretary. The amount of any loss chargeable to the holder may be deducted from the amount payable by the Secretary at the time the property is transferred. In any case where pursuant to the VA regulations rejection of the title is legally proper, the Secretary may surrender custody of the property as of the date specified in the Secretary's notice to the holder. The Secretary's assumption of such risk shall terminate upon such surrender.

      (8) The conveyance should be made to “Secretary of Veterans Affairs, an Officer of the United States.” The name of the incumbent Secretary should not be included unless State law requires naming a real person.

      (9) The holder shall not be liable to the Secretary for any portion of the paid or unpaid taxes, special assessments, ground rents, insurance premiums, or other similar items. The holder shall be liable to the Secretary for all penalties and interest associated with taxes not timely paid by the holder prior to conveyance.

      (10) The Secretary shall be entitled to all rentals and other income collected from the property and to any insurance proceeds or refunds subsequent to the date of acquisition by the holder.

      (11) In respect to a property which was the security for a condominium loan guaranteed or insured under 38 U.S.C. 3710(a)(6) the responsibility for any loss due to damage to or destruction of the property or due to personal injury sustained in respect to such property shall in no event pass to the Secretary until the Secretary expressly assumes such responsibility or until conveyance of the property to the Secretary, whichever first occurs. The holder shall have the right to convey such property to the Secretary only if the property (including elements of the development or project owned in common with other unit owners) is undamaged by fire, earthquake, windstorm, flooding or boiler explosion. The absence of a right in the holder to convey such property which is so damaged shall not preclude a conveyance, if the Secretary agrees in a given case to such a conveyance upon completion of repairs within a specified period of time and such repairs are so completed and the conveyance is otherwise in order.

      (e) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(6) of this section, the provisions of this section shall not be in derogation of any rights which the Secretary may have under § 36.4328. The Under Secretary for Benefits, or the Executive Director, Loan Guaranty Service, may authorize any deviation from the provisions of this section, within the limitations prescribed in 38 U.S.C. chapter 37, which may be necessary or desirable to accomplish the objectives of this section if such deviation is made necessary by reason of any laws or practice in any State or Territory or the District of Columbia,  that no such deviation shall impair the rights of any holder not consenting to the deviation with respect to loans made or approved prior to the date the holder is notified of such action.

      § 36.4324   Guaranty claims; subsequent accounting.

#### § § 36.4324

      (a) Subject to the limitation that the total amounts payable shall in no event exceed the amount originally guaranteed, or in the case of a modified loan, such amount as may have been increased under the provisions of § 36.4315(h)(2), the amount payable on a claim for the guaranty shall be the percentage of the loan originally guaranteed, or the percentage as adjusted under § 36.4315(h)(2), whichever is applicable, applied to the sum of:

      (1) The unpaid principal as of the date of the liquidation sale;

      (2) Allowable expenses/advances as described in § 36.4314; and

      (3) The lesser of:

      (i) The unpaid interest as of the date of the liquidation sale; or

      (ii) The unpaid interest for the reasonable period that the Secretary has determined, pursuant to § 36.4322(a), it should have taken to complete the foreclosure, plus 210 days from the due date of the last paid installment. This amount will be increased if the Secretary determines the holder was unable to complete the foreclosure within the time specified in this paragraph due to Bankruptcy proceedings, appeal of the foreclosure by the debtor, the holder granting forbearance in excess of 30 days at the request of the Secretary, or other factors beyond the control of the holder.

      (b) Deposits or other credits or setoffs legally applicable to the indebtedness shall be applied in reduction of the indebtedness on which the claim is based. Any escrowed or earmarked funds not subject to superior claims of third persons must likewise be so applied.

      (c)(1) Credits accruing from the proceeds of a liquidation sale shall be reported to the Secretary incident to claim submission, and the amount payable on the claim shall in no event exceed the remaining balance of the indebtedness.

      (2) The amount payable under the guaranty shall be computed applying the formulae in 38 U.S.C. 3732(c). With respect to a voluntary conveyance to the holder in lieu of foreclosure, the holder shall be deemed to have acquired the property at the liquidation sale for the lesser of the net value of the property or the total indebtedness.

      (d)(1)(i) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section, holders shall file a claim for payment under the guaranty electronically no later than 1 year after the completion of the liquidation sale. For purposes of this section, the liquidation sale will be considered completed when:

      (A) The last act required under State law is taken to make the liquidation sale final, but excluding any redemption period permitted under State law;

      (B) If a holder accepts a voluntary conveyance of the property in lieu of foreclosure, the date of recordation of the deed to the holder or the holder's designee; or

      (C) In the case of a sale of the property to a third party for an amount less than is sufficient to repay the unpaid balance on the loan where the holder has agreed in advance to release the lien in exchange for the proceeds of such sale, the date of settlement of such sale.

      (ii) With respect to any liquidation sale completed prior to February 1, 2008, all claims must be submitted no later than February 2, 2009.

      (2) If additional information becomes known to a holder after the filing of a guaranty claim, the holder may file a supplemental claim provided that such supplemental claim is filed within the time period specified in paragraph (d)(1) of this section.

      (3) No claim under a guaranty shall be payable unless it is submitted within the time period specified in paragraph (d)(1) of this section.

      (4) A claim shall be submitted to VA electronically on the VA Loan Electronic Reporting Interface system.

      (5) Supporting documents will not be submitted with the claim, but must be retained by the servicer and are subject to inspection as provided in § 36.4333 of this title.

      (e) In the event that VA does not approve payment of any item submitted under a guaranty claim, VA shall notify the holder electronically what items are being denied and the reasons for such denial. The holder may, within 30 days after the date of such denial notification, submit an electronic request to VA that one or more items that were denied be reconsidered. The holder must present any additional information justifying payment of items denied.

      § 36.4325   Computation of indebtedness.

#### § § 36.4325

      In computing the indebtedness for the purpose of filing a claim for payment of a guaranty or for payment of an insured loss, or in the event of a transfer of the loan under § 36.4320(a), or other accounting to the Secretary, the holder shall not be entitled to treat repayments theretofore made as liquidated damages, or rentals, or otherwise than as payments on the indebtedness, notwithstanding any provision in the note, or mortgage, or otherwise, to the contrary.

> [73 FR 6310, Feb. 1, 2008. Redesignated at 75 FR 33705, June 15, 2010, as amended at 80 FR 34319, June 16, 2015]

      § 36.4326   Subrogation and indemnity.

#### § § 36.4326

      (a) The Secretary shall be subrogated to the contract and the lien or other rights of the holder to the extent of any sum paid on a guaranty or on account of an insured loss, which right shall be junior to the holder's rights as against the debtor or the encumbered property until the holder shall have received the full amount payable under the contract with the debtor. No partial or complete release by a creditor shall impair the rights of the Secretary with respect to the debtor's obligation.

      (b) The holder, upon request, shall execute, acknowledge and deliver an appropriate instrument tendered for that purpose, evidencing any payment received from the Secretary and the Secretary's resulting right of subrogation.

      (c) The Secretary shall cause the instrument required by paragraph (b) of this section to be filed for record in the office of the recorder of deeds, or other appropriate office of the proper county, town or State, in accordance with the applicable State law. The filing or failure to file such instrument for record shall have the legal results prescribed by the applicable law of the State where the real or personal property is situated, with respect to filing or failure to so file mortgages and other lien instruments and assignments thereof. The references herein to “filing for record” include “registration” or any similar transaction, by whatever name designated when title to the encumbered property has been “registered” pursuant to a Torrens or other similar title registration system provided by law.

      (d) As a condition to paying a claim for an insured loss the Secretary may require that the loan, including any security or judgment held therefor, be assigned to the extent of such payment, and if any claim has been filed in bankruptcy, insolvency, probate, or similar proceedings such claim may likewise be required to be so assigned.

      (e) Any amounts paid by the Secretary on account of the liabilities of any veteran guaranteed or insured under the provisions of 38 U.S.C. chapter 37 shall constitute a debt owing to the United States by such veteran. Before a liquidation sale, an official authorized to act for the Secretary under provisions of § 36.4345 may approve a complete or partial release of the Secretary's right to collect a debt owing to the United States under this paragraph and/or under paragraph (a) of this section as follows:

      (1)  VA will approve a complete release if an official authorized to act for the Secretary under § 36.4345 determines that all of the following are true:

      (i) The loan default was caused by circumstances beyond the control of the obligor; and

      (ii) There are no indications of fraud, misrepresentation or bad faith on the part of the obligor in obtaining the loan or in connection with the loan default; and

      (iii) The obligor cooperated with VA in exploring all realistic alternatives to termination of the loan through foreclosure, and, either:

      (A) Review of the obligor's current financial situation and prospective earning potential and obligations indicates there are no realistic prospects that the obligor could repay all or part of the anticipated debt within six years after the liquidation sale and still provide the necessities of life for himself or herself and his or her family; or,

      (B) In consideration for a release of the Secretary's collection rights the obligor completes, or VA is enabled to authorize, an action which reduces the Government's claim liability sufficiently to offset the amount of the anticipated indebtedness which would otherwise be established pursuant to this paragraph and likely be collectible by VA after foreclosure in view of the obligor's financial situation. Such actions would include termination of the loan by means of a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure, private sale of the property for less than the indebtedness with a reduced claim paid by VA for the balance due the loan holder, or enabling VA to authorize the holder to elect a more expeditious foreclosure procedure when such an election would result in the legal release of the obligor's liability; or

      (C) The obligor being released is not the current titleholder to the property and there are no indications of fraud, misrepresentation, or bad faith on the obligor's part in disposing of the property.

      (2)  In the event of a partial release, the amount of indebtedness established will be such that the obligor's financial situation permits repayment of the debt to the Government in regular monthly installments of principal plus interest over a five year period commencing within one year after the date the promissory note is executed, except in those cases in which a lump sum settlement appears to be in the best interest of the Government or in which it appears the obligor may reasonably expect significant changes in his or her financial situation which would permit higher payments to be made during later periods of the life of the note. VA may authorize a partial release if an official authorized to act for the Secretary under § 36.4345 determines that all of the following are true:

      (i) The loan default was caused by circumstances beyond the control of the obligor; and,

      (ii) There are no indications of fraud, misrepresentation or bad faith on the part of the obligor in obtaining the loan or in connection with the loan default; and,

      (iii) The obligor cooperated with VA in exploring all realistic alternatives to termination of the loan through foreclosure; and,

      (iv) Review of the obligor's current financial situation and prospective earning potential and obligations indicates there are no realistic prospects that the obligor could repay all of the anticipated debt within six years of the liquidation sale while providing the necessities of life for himself or herself and his or her family; and,

      (v) The obligor executes a written agreement acknowledging his or her liability to VA under this paragraph and executes a promissory note which provides for regular amortized monthly payments of an amount determined by VA in accordance with paragraph (e)(3) of this section including interest on the total amount payable at the rate in effect for Loan Guaranty liability accounts at the time of execution, or, the obligor agrees to other terms of repayment acceptable to VA including payment of a lump sum in settlement of his or her obligation under this paragraph.

      (3)  For purposes of authorizing a complete or partial release under this paragraph, a VA official reviewing an obligor's financial situation will consider all of the following:

      (i) The obligor's current and anticipated family income based on employment skills and experience;

      (ii) The obligor's current short-term and long-term financial obligations, including the obligation to repay the Government which must be afforded consideration at least equal to his or her consumer debt obligations;

      (iii) A current credit report on the obligor;

      (iv) The obligor's assets and net worth; and

      (v) The required balance available for family support used in underwriting VA guaranteed loans in the area.

      (4) Determinations made under paragraphs (e)(1) and (2) of this section are intended for the benefit of the Government in reducing the amount of claim payable by VA and/or avoiding the establishment of uncollectible debts owing to the United States. Such determinations are discretionary on the part of VA and shall not constitute a defense to any legal action to terminate the loan nor vest any appellate right in an obligor which would require further review of the case.

      (f) Whenever any veteran disposes of residential property securing a guaranteed or insured loan obtained by him or her under 38 U.S.C. chapter 37, and for which the commitment to make the loan was made prior to March 1, 1988, the Secretary, upon application made by such veteran, shall issue to the veteran a release relieving him or her of all further liability to the Secretary on account of such loan (including liability for any loss resulting from any default of the transferee or any subsequent purchaser of such property) if the Secretary has determined, after such investigation as may be deemed appropriate, that there has been compliance with the conditions prescribed in 38 U.S.C. 3713. The assumption of full liability for repayment of the loan by the transferee of the property must be evidenced by an agreement in writing in such form as the Secretary may require. Release of the veteran from liability to the Secretary will not impair or otherwise affect the Secretary's guaranty or insurance liability on the loan, or the liability of the veteran to the holder. Any release of liability granted to a veteran by the Secretary shall inure to the spouse of such veteran. The release of the veteran from liability to the Secretary will constitute the Secretary's prior approval to a release of the veteran from liability on the loan by the holder thereof.

      (g) If any veteran disposes of residential property securing a guaranteed or insured loan obtained under 38 U.S.C. chapter 37, without receiving a release from liability with respect to such loan under 38 U.S.C. 3713 and a default subsequently occurs which results in liability of the veteran to the Secretary on account of the loan, the Secretary may relieve the veteran of such liability if he determines that:

      (1) A transferee either immediate or remote is legally liable to the Secretary for the debt of the original veteran-borrower established after the termination of the loan, and

      (2) The original loan was current at the time such transferee acquired the property, and

      (3) The transferee who is liable to the Secretary is found to have been a satisfactory credit risk at the time he or she acquired the property.

      (h)(1) If a veteran or any other person disposes of residential property securing a guaranteed or insured loan for which a commitment was made on or after March 1, 1988, and the veteran or other person notifies the loan holder in writing before disposing of the property, the veteran or other person shall be relieved of all further liability to the Secretary with respect to the loan (including liability for any loss resulting from any default of the purchaser or any subsequent owner of the property) and the application for assumption shall be approved if the holder determines that:

      (i) The proposed purchaser is creditworthy;

      (ii) The proposed purchaser is contractually obligated to assume the loan and the liability to indemnify the Department of Veterans Affairs for the amount of any claim paid under the guaranty as a result of a default on the loan, or has already done so; and

      (iii) The payments on the loan are current.

      (2) Should these requirements be satisfied, the holder may also release the veteran or other person from liability on the loan. This does not apply if the approval for the assumption is granted upon special appeal to avoid immediate foreclosure.

      (i) If a veteran requests a release of liability under paragraph (f) of this section, or if a borrower requests a release of liability pursuant to § 36.4309(c)(1)(vii), a holder described in the first sentence of § 36.4303(l)(1)(i) is authorized to and must make all decisions regarding the credit-worthiness of the transferee, subject to the right of a transferee to appeal any denial to the Secretary within 30 days of being notified in writing of the denial by the holder or servicer. The procedures and fees specified in §§ 36.4303(l)(1)(i) and 36.4313(d)(8) applicable to decisions under 38 U.S.C. 3714 shall also apply to decisions specified in this paragraph.

      § 36.4327   Release of security.

#### § § 36.4327

      (a)(1) Except upon full payment of the indebtedness, or except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section or in paragraphs (e) and (f) of § 36.4322, the holder shall not release a lien or other right in or to real property held as security for a guaranteed or insured loan, or grant a fee or other interest in such property, without prior approval of the Secretary.

      (2) The holder may, without the prior approval of the Secretary, release the lien on a portion of the property securing the loan provided:

      (i) The holder has obtained an appraisal from the Secretary showing the value of the security prior to the partial release of the lien and the value of the security on which the lien will remain;

      (ii) The portion of the property still subject to the lien is fit for dwelling purposes; and

      (iii) The loan-to-value ratio after the partial release of the lien:

      (A) Will be not more than 80 percent; or

      (B) If the loan-to-value ratio after the partial release of the lien is 80 percent or higher, any proceeds received as consideration from the partial release of the lien shall be applied to the unpaid loan balance.

      (b) A holder may release from the lien personal property including crops without the prior approval of the Secretary.

      (c) Failure of the holder to comply with the provisions of this section shall not in itself affect the validity of the title of a purchaser to the property released.

      (d) The release of the personal liability of any obligor on a guaranteed or insured obligation resultant from the act or omission of any holder without the prior approval of the Secretary shall release the obligation of the Secretary as guarantor or insurer, except when such act or omission consists of:

      (1) Failure to establish the debt as a valid claim against the assets of the estate of any deceased obligor, provided no lien for the guaranteed or insured debt is thereby impaired or destroyed; or

      (2) An election and appropriate prosecution of legally available effective remedies with respect to the repossession or the liquidation of the security in any case, irrespective of the identity or the survival of the original or of any subsequent debtor, if holder shall have given such notice as required by § 36.4317 and if, after receiving such notice, the Secretary shall have failed to notify the holder within 15 days to proceed in such manner as to effectively preserve the personal liability of the parties liable, or such of them as the Secretary indicates in such notice to the holder; or

      (3) The release of an obligor, or obligors, from liability on an obligation secured by a lien on property, which release is an incident of and contemporaneous with the sale of such property to an eligible veteran who assumed such obligation, which assumed obligation is guaranteed on the assuming veteran's account pursuant to 38 U.S.C. chapter 37; or

      (4) The release of an obligor or obligors as provided in § 36.4315; or, the release of an obligor, or obligors, incident to the sale of property securing the loan which the holder is authorized to approve under the provisions of 38 U.S.C. 3714.

      § 36.4328   Partial or total loss of guaranty or insurance.

#### § § 36.4328

      (a) Subject to the incontestable provisions of 38 U.S.C. 3721 as to loans guaranteed or insured on or subsequent to July 1, 1948, there shall be no liability on account of a guaranty or insurance, or any certificate or other evidence thereof, with respect to a transaction in which a signature to the note, the mortgage, or any other loan papers, or the application for guaranty or insurance is a forgery; or in which the certificate of discharge or the certificate of eligibility is counterfeited, or falsified, or is not issued by the Government.

      (1) Except as to a holder who acquired the loan instrument before maturity, for value, and without notice, and who has not directly or by agent participated in the fraud, or in the misrepresentation hereinafter specified, any willful and material misrepresentation or fraud by the lender, or by a holder, or the agent of either, in procuring the guaranty or the insurance credit, shall relieve the Secretary of liability, or, as to loans guaranteed or insured on, or subsequent to July 1, 1948, shall constitute a defense against liability on account of the guaranty or insurance of the loan in respect to which the willful misrepresentation, or the fraud, is practiced: , that if a misrepresentation, although material, is not made willfully, or with fraudulent intent, it shall have only the consequences prescribed in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.

      (2) [Reserved]

      (b) In taking security required by 38 U.S.C. chapter 37 and the regulations concerning guaranty or insurance of loans to veterans, a holder shall obtain the required lien on property the title to which is such as to be acceptable to prudent lending institutions, informed buyers, title companies, and attorneys, generally, in the community in which the property is situated: , that a title will not be unacceptable by reason of any of the limitations on the quantum or quality of the property or title stated in § 36.4354(b) and if such holder fails in this respect or fails to comply with 38 U.S.C. chapter 37 and the regulations concerning guaranty or insurance of loans to veterans, then no claim on the guaranty or insurance shall be paid on account of the loan with respect to which such failure occurred, or in respect to which an unwillful misrepresentation occurred, until the amount by which the ultimate liability of the Secretary would thereby be increased has been ascertained. The burden of proof shall be upon the holder to establish that no increase of ultimate liability is attributable to such failure or misrepresentation. The amount of increased liability of the Secretary shall be offset by deduction from the amount of the guaranty or insurance otherwise payable, or if consequent upon loss of security shall be offset by crediting to the indebtedness the amount of the impairment as proceeds of the sale of security in the final accounting to the Secretary. To the extent the loss resultant from the failure or misrepresentation prejudices the Secretary's right of subrogation acceptance by the holder of the guaranty or insurance payment shall subordinate the holder's right to those of the Secretary. Adjustments under this section may be made for failure to comply with:

      (1) Obtaining and retaining a lien of the dignity prescribed on all property upon which a lien is required by 38 U.S.C. chapter 37 or the regulations concerning guaranty or insurance of loans to veterans,

      (2) Inclusion of power to substitute trustees (§ 36.4330),

      (3) The procurement and maintenance of insurance coverage (§ 36.4329),

      (4) Any notice required by § 36.4317,

      (5) The release, conveyance, substitution, or exchange of security (§ 36.4327),

      (6) Lack of legal capacity of a party to the transaction incident to which the guaranty or the insurance is granted (§ 36.4331),

      (7) Failure of the lender to see that any escrowed or earmarked account is expended in accordance with the agreement,

      (8) The taking into consideration of limitations upon the quantum or quality of the estate or property (§ 36.4354(b)),

      (9) Any other requirement of 38 U.S.C. chapter 37 or the regulations concerning guaranty or insurance of loans to veterans which does not by the terms of said chapter or the regulations concerning guaranty or insurance of loans to veterans result in relieving the Secretary of all liability with respect to the loan,

      (c) If after the payment of a guaranty or an insurance loss, or after a loan is transferred pursuant to § 36.4320(a), the fraud, misrepresentation or failure to comply with the regulations in this subpart as provided in this section is discovered and the Secretary determines that an increased loss to the government resulted therefrom the transferor or person to whom such payment was made shall be liable to the Secretary for the amount of the loss caused by such misrepresentation or failure.

      § 36.4329   Hazard insurance.

#### § § 36.4329

      The holder shall require insurance policies to be procured and maintained in an amount sufficient to protect the security against the risks or hazards to which it may be subjected to the extent customary in the locality. All moneys received under such policies covering payment of insured losses shall be applied to restoration of the security or to the loan balance. Flood insurance will be required on any building or personal property securing a loan at any time during the term of the loan that such security is located in an area identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency as having special flood hazards and in which flood insurance has been made available under the National Flood Insurance Act, as amended. The amount of flood insurance must be at least equal to the lesser of the outstanding principal balance of the loan or the maximum limit of coverage available for the particular type of property under the National Flood Insurance Act, as amended. The Secretary cannot guarantee a loan for the acquisition or construction of property located in an area identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency as having special flood hazards unless the community in which such area is situated is then participating in the National Flood Insurance Program.

      § 36.4330   Substitution of trustees.

#### § § 36.4330

      In jurisdictions in which valid, any deed of trust or mortgage securing a guaranteed or insured loan, if it names trustees, or confers a power of sale otherwise, shall contain a provision empowering any holder of the indebtedness to appoint substitute trustees, or other person with such power to sell, who shall succeed to all the rights, powers and duties of the trustees, or other person, originally designated.

      § 36.4331   Capacity of parties to contract.

#### § § 36.4331

      Nothing in §§ 36.4300 through 36.4380 shall be construed to relieve any lender of responsibility otherwise existing, for any loss caused by the lack of legal capacity of any person to contract, convey, or encumber, or caused by the existence of other legal disability or defects invalidating, or rendering unenforceable in whole or in part, either the loan obligation or the security therefor.

      § 36.4332   Geographical limits.

#### § § 36.4332

      Any real property purchased, constructed, altered, improved, or repaired with the proceeds of a guaranteed or insured loan shall be situated within the United States which for purposes of 38 U.S.C. chapter 37 is here defined as the several States, Territories and possessions, and the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.

      § 36.4333   Maintenance of records.

#### § § 36.4333

      (a)(1) The holder shall maintain a record of the amounts of payments received on the obligation and disbursements chargeable thereto and the dates thereof, including copies of bills and receipts for such disbursements. These records shall be maintained until the Secretary ceases to be liable as guarantor or insurer of the loan, or, if the Secretary has paid a claim on the guaranty, until 3 years after such claim was paid. For the purpose of any accounting with the Secretary or computation of a claim, any holder who fails to maintain such record and, upon request, make it available to the Secretary for review shall be presumed to have received on the dates due all sums which by the terms of the contract are payable prior to date of claim for default, or to have not made the disbursement for which reimbursement is claimed, and the burden of going forward with evidence and of ultimate proof of the contrary shall be on such holder.

      (2) The holder shall maintain records supporting their decision to approve any loss mitigation option. The holder shall maintain records supporting their decision to pursue a partial claim payment under the COVID-19 Veterans Assistance Partial Claim Payment program established under subpart F of this part. Such records shall be retained a minimum of 3 years from the date of any incentive paid in accordance with § 36.4319(a) or, in the case of a partial claim payment under the COVID-19 Veterans Assistance Partial Claim Payment program, the date the veteran's guaranteed loan is made current under such program, whichever is later, and shall include, but not be limited to, credit reports, verifications of income, employment, assets, liabilities, and other factors affecting the obligor's credit worthiness, work sheets, and other documents supporting the holder's decision.

      (3) For any loan where the claim on the guaranty was paid on or after February 1, 2008, or action described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section was taken after February 1, 2008, holders shall submit any documents described in paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section to the Secretary in electronic form; , an image of the original document in .jpg, .gif, .pdf, or a similar widely accepted format.

      (b) The lender shall retain copies of all loan origination records on a VA-guaranteed loan for at least two years from the date of loan closing. Loan origination records include the loan application, including any preliminary application, verifications of employment and deposit, all credit reports, including preliminary credit reports, copies of each sales contract and addendums, letters of explanation for adverse credit items, discrepancies and the like, direct references from creditors, correspondence with employers, appraisal and compliance inspection reports, reports on termite and other inspections of the property, builder change orders, and all closing papers and documents.

      (c) The Secretary has the right to inspect, examine, or audit, at a reasonable time and place, the records or accounts of a lender or holder pertaining to loans guaranteed or insured by the Secretary.

      Regulations issued under 38 U.S.C. chapter 37 and in effect on the date of any loan which is submitted and accepted or approved for a guaranty or for insurance thereunder, shall govern the rights, duties, and liabilities of the parties to such loan and any provisions of the loan instruments inconsistent with such regulations are hereby amended and supplemented to conform thereto.

      § 36.4338   Supplementary administrative action.

#### § § 36.4338

      (a) Notwithstanding any requirement, condition, or limitation stated in or imposed by the regulations concerning the guaranty or insurance of loans to veterans, the Under Secretary for Benefits, or the Executive Director, Loan Guaranty Service, within the limitations and conditions prescribed by the Secretary, is hereby authorized, if he or she finds the interests of the Government are not adversely affected, to relieve undue prejudice to a debtor, holder, or other person, which might otherwise result, provided no such action may be taken which would impair the vested rights of any person affected thereby. If such requirement, condition, or limitation is of an administrative or procedural (not substantive) nature, any employee designated in § 36.4345 is hereby authorized to grant similar relief if he or she finds the failure or error of the lender was due to misunderstanding or mistake and that the interests of the Government are not adversely affected. Provisions of the regulations considered to be of an administrative or procedural (nonsubstantive) nature are limited to the following:

      (1) The requirement in § 36.4308(a) that a lender obtain in prior approval of the Secretary before closing a joint loan if the lender or class of lenders is eligible or has been approved by the Secretary to close loans on the automatic basis pursuant to 38 U.S.C. 3702(d);

      (2) The requirements in § 36.4303(l) concerning the giving of notice in assumption cases under 38 U.S.C. 3714;

      (3) The requirement in § 36.4324(d)(3) that no claim is payable unless it is submitted within 1 year after the liquidation sale;

      (4) The requirement in § 36.4323(a) to submit notice of election to convey a property to VA within 15 days of the date of liquidation sale;

      (5) The determination by the holder in § 36.4323(b) of the amount of indebtedness that must be waived in order to make a property eligible for conveyance;

      (6) The determination in § 36.4314(f)(2) of the date beyond which no additional fees or charges will be allowed;

      (7) The determination in § 36.4324(a)(3) of the interest payable on a claim under guaranty; and

      (8) The reconsideration in § 36.4324(e) of the holder's electronic request for review of any denied items within the claim;

      (b) Authority is hereby granted to the Loan Guaranty Officer to redelegate authority to make any determinations under this section.

      § 36.4339   Eligibility of loans; reasonable value requirements.

#### § § 36.4339

      (a) Evidence of guaranty or insurance shall be issued in respect to a loan for any of the purposes specified in 38 U.S.C. 3710(a) only if all of the following conditions are met:

      (1) The proceeds of such loan have been used to pay for the property purchased, constructed, repaired, refinanced, altered, or improved.

      (2) Except as to refinancing loans pursuant to 38 U.S.C. 3710(a)(8), (a)(9)(B)(i), (a)(11), or (b)(7) and energy efficient mortgages pursuant to 38 U.S.C. 3710(d), the loan (including any scheduled deferred interest added to principal) does not exceed the reasonable value of the property or projected reasonable value of a new home which is security for a graduated payment mortgage loan, as appropriate, as determined by the Secretary. For the purpose of determining the reasonable value of a graduated payment mortgage loan to purchase a new home, the reasonable value of the property as of the time the loan is made shall be calculated to increase at a rate not in excess of 2.5 percent per year, but in no event may the projected value of the property exceed 115 percent of the initially established reasonable value.

      (3) The veteran has certified, in such form as the Secretary may prescribe, that the veteran has paid in cash from his or her own resources on account of such purchase, construction, alteration, repair, or improvement a sum equal to the difference, if any, between the purchase price or cost of the property and its reasonable value.

      (b) A loan guaranteed under 38 U.S.C. 3710(d) which includes the cost of energy efficient improvements may exceed the reasonable value of the property. The cost of the energy efficient improvements that may be financed may not exceed $3,000; provided, however, that up to $6,000 in energy efficient improvements may be financed if the increase in the monthly payment for principal and interest does not exceed the likely reduction in monthly utility costs resulting from the energy efficient improvements.

      (c) Notwithstanding that the aggregate of the loan amount in the case of loans for the purposes specified in paragraph (a) of this section, and the amount remaining unpaid on taxes, special assessments, prior mortgage indebtedness, or other obligations of any character secured by enforceable superior liens or a right to such lien existing as of the date the loan is closed exceeds the reasonable value of such property as of said date and that evidence of guaranty or insurance credit is issued in respect thereof, as between the holder and Secretary (for the purpose of computing the claim on the guaranty or insurance and for the purposes of § 36.4323, and all accounting), the indebtedness which is the subject of the guaranty or insurance shall be deemed to have been reduced as of the date of the loan by a sum equal to such excess, less any amounts secured by liens released or paid on the obligations secured by such superior liens or rights by a holder or others without expense to or obligation on the debtor resulting from such payment, or release of lien or right; and all payments made on the loan shall be applied to the indebtedness as so reduced. Nothing in this paragraph affects any right or liability resulting from fraud or willful misrepresentation.

> [73 FR 6310, Feb. 1, 2008. Redesignated at 75 FR 33705, June 15, 2010, as amended at 80 FR 34319, June 16, 2015]

      § 36.4340   Underwriting standards, processing procedures, lender responsibility, and lender certification.

#### § § 36.4340

      (a)  The standards contained in paragraphs (c) through (j) of this section will be used to determine whether the veteran's present and anticipated income and expenses, and credit history, are satisfactory. These standards do not apply to loans guaranteed pursuant to 38 U.S.C. 3710(a)(8) except for cases where the Secretary is required to approve the loan in advance under § 36.4307.

      (b)(1)  Use of the standards in paragraphs (c) through (j) of this section for underwriting home loans will be waived only in extraordinary circumstances when the Secretary determines, considering the totality of circumstances, that the veteran is a satisfactory credit risk.

      (2)  Notwithstanding paragraphs (a) and (b)(1) of this section, a streamlined refinance loan to be guaranteed pursuant to 38 U.S.C. 3710(a)(8) and (e) is exempt from income verification requirements of the Truth-in-Lending Act (15 U.S.C. 1639C) and its implementing regulations only if all of the following conditions are met:

      (i) The veteran is not 30 days or more past due on the prior existing residential mortgage loan;

      (ii) The proposed streamlined refinance loan would not increase the principal balance outstanding on the prior existing residential mortgage loan, except to the extent of fees and charges allowed by VA;

      (iii) Total points and fees payable in connection with the proposed streamlined refinance loan are in accordance with 12 CFR 1026.32, will not exceed 3 percent of the total new loan amount, and are in compliance with VA's allowable fees and charges found at 38 CFR 36.4313;

      (iv) The interest rate on the proposed streamlined refinance loan will be lower than the interest rate on the original loan, unless the borrower is refinancing from an adjustable rate to a fixed-rate loan, under guidelines that VA has established;

      (v) The proposed streamlined refinance loan will be subject to a payment schedule that will fully amortize the IRRRL in accordance with VA regulations;

      (vi) The terms of the proposed streamlined refinance loan will not result in a balloon payment, as defined in TILA; and

      (vii) Both the residential mortgage loan being refinanced and the proposed streamlined refinance loan satisfy all other VA requirements.

      (c)  The two primary underwriting standards that will be used in determining the adequacy of the veteran's present and anticipated income are debt-to-income ratio and residual income analysis. They are described in paragraphs (d) through (f) of this section. Ordinarily, to qualify for a loan, the veteran must meet both standards. Failure to meet one standard, however, will not automatically disqualify a veteran. The following exceptions shall apply to cases where a veteran does not meet both standards:

      (1) If the debt-to-income ratio is 41 percent or less, and the veteran does not meet the residual income standard, the loan may be approved with justification, by the underwriter's supervisor, as set out in paragraph (c)(4) of this section.

      (2) If the debt-to-income ratio is greater than 41 percent (unless it is larger due solely to the existence of tax-free income which should be noted in the loan file), the loan may be approved with justification, by the underwriter's supervisor, as set out in paragraph (c)(4) of this section.

      (3) If the ratio is greater than 41 percent and the residual income exceeds the guidelines by at least 20 percent, the second level review and statement of justification are not required.

      (4) In any case described by paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section, the lender must fully justify the decision to approve the loan or submit the loan to the Secretary for prior approval in writing. The lender's statement must not be perfunctory, but should address the specific compensating factors, as set forth in paragraph (c)(5) of this section, justifying the approval of the loan. The statement must be signed by the underwriter's supervisor. It must be stressed that the statute requires not only consideration of a veteran's present and anticipated income and expenses, but also that the veteran be a satisfactory credit risk. Therefore, meeting both the debt-to-income ratio and residual income standards does not mean that the loan is automatically approved. It is the lender's responsibility to base the loan approval or disapproval on all the factors present for any individual veteran. The veteran's credit must be evaluated based on the criteria set forth in paragraph (g) of this section as well as a variety of compensating factors that should be evaluated.

      (5) The following are examples of acceptable compensating factors to be considered in the course of underwriting a loan:

      (i) Excellent long-term credit;

      (ii) Conservative use of consumer credit;

      (iii) Minimal consumer debt;

      (iv) Long-term employment;

      (v) Significant liquid assets;

      (vi) Down payment or the existence of equity in refinancing loans;

      (vii) Little or no increase in shelter expense;

      (viii) Military benefits;

      (ix) Satisfactory homeownership experience;

      (x) High residual income;

      (xi) Low debt-to-income ratio;

      (xii) Tax credits of a continuing nature, such as tax credits for child care; and

      (xiii) Tax benefits of home ownership.

      (6) The list in paragraph (c)(5) of this section is not exhaustive and the items are not in any priority order. Valid compensating factors should represent unusual strengths rather than mere satisfaction of basic program requirements. Compensating factors must be relevant to the marginality or weakness.

      (d)  A debt-to-income ratio that compares the veteran's anticipated monthly housing expense and total monthly obligations to his or her stable monthly income will be computed to assist in the assessment of the potential risk of the loan. The ratio will be determined by taking the sum of the monthly Principal, Interest, Taxes and Insurance (PITI) of the loan being applied for, homeowners and other assessments such as special assessments, condominium fees, homeowners association fees, etc., and any long-term obligations divided by the total of gross salary or earnings and other compensation or income. The ratio should be rounded to the nearest two digits; e.g., 35.6 percent would be rounded to 36 percent. The standard is 41 percent or less. If the ratio is greater than 41 percent, the steps cited in paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(6) of this section apply.

      (e)  The guidelines provided in this paragraph for residual income will be used to determine whether the veteran's monthly residual income will be adequate to meet living expenses after estimated monthly shelter expenses have been paid and other monthly obligations have been met. All members of the household must be included in determining if the residual income is sufficient. They must be counted even if the veteran's spouse is not joining in title or on the note, or if there are any other individuals depending on the veteran for support, such as children from a spouse's prior marriage who are not the veteran's legal dependents. It is appropriate, however, to reduce the number of members of a household to be counted for residual income purposes if there is sufficient verified income not otherwise included in the loan analysis, such as child support being regularly received as discussed in paragraph (e)(4) of this section. In the case of a spouse not to be obligated on the note, verification that he/she has stable and reliable employment as discussed in paragraph (f)(3) of this section would allow not counting the spouse in determining the sufficiency of the residual income. The guidelines for residual income are based on data supplied in the Consumer Expenditure Survey (CES) published by the Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics. Regional minimum incomes have been developed for loan amounts up to $79,999 and for loan amounts of $80,000 and above. It is recognized that the purchase price of the property may affect family expenditure levels in individual cases. This factor may be given consideration in the final determination in individual loan analyses. For example, a family purchasing in a higher-priced neighborhood may feel a need to incur higher-than-average expenses to support a lifestyle comparable to that in their environment, whereas a substantially lower-priced home purchase may not compel such expenditures. It should also be clearly understood from this information that no single factor is a final determinant in any applicant's qualification for a VA-guaranteed loan. Once the residual income has been established, other important factors must be examined. One such consideration is the amount being paid currently for rental or housing expenses. If the proposed shelter expense is materially in excess of what is currently being paid, the case may require closer scrutiny. In such cases, consideration should be given to the ability of the borrower and spouse to accumulate liquid assets, such as cash and bonds, and to the amount of debts incurred while paying a lesser amount for shelter. For example, if an application indicates little or no capital reserves and excessive obligations, it may not be reasonable to conclude that a substantial increase in shelter expenses can be absorbed. Another factor of prime importance is the applicant's manner of meeting obligations. A poor credit history alone is a basis for disapproving a loan, as is an obviously inadequate income. When one or the other is marginal, however, the remaining aspect must be closely examined to assure that the loan applied for will not exceed the applicant's ability or capacity to repay. Therefore, it is important to remember that the figures provided below for residual income are to be used as a guide and should be used in conjunction with the steps outlined in paragraphs (c) through (j) of this section. The residual income guidelines are as follows:

      (1)

      (2)

      (3)  Northeast—Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Vermont; Midwest—Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, South Dakota and Wisconsin; South—Alabama, Arkansas, Delaware, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Puerto Rico, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, West Virginia; West—Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, Washington and Wyoming.

      (4)  For loan applications involving an active-duty servicemember or military retiree, the residual income figures will be reduced by a minimum of 5 percent if there is a clear indication that the borrower or spouse will continue to receive the benefits resulting from the use of facilities on a nearby military base. (This reduction applies to tables in paragraph (e) of this section.)

      (f)  Only stable and reliable income of the veteran and spouse can be considered in determining ability to meet mortgage payments. Income can be considered stable and reliable if it can be concluded that it will continue during the foreseeable future.

      (1)  Income of the borrower and spouse which is derived from employment and which is considered in determining the family's ability to meet the mortgage payments, payments on debts and other obligations, and other expenses must be verified. If the spouse is employed and will be contractually obligated on the loan, the combined income of both the veteran and spouse is considered when the income of the veteran alone is not sufficient to qualify for the amount of the loan sought. In other than community property states, if the spouse will not be contractually obligated on the loan, Regulation B (12 CFR part 202), promulgated by the Federal Reserve Board pursuant to the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, prohibits any request for, or consideration of, information concerning the spouse (including income, employment, assets, or liabilities), except that if the applicant is relying on alimony, child support, or maintenance payments from a spouse or former spouse as a basis for repayment of the loan, information concerning such spouse or former spouse may be requested and considered (see paragraph (f)(4) of this section). In community property states, information concerning a spouse may be requested and considered in the same manner as that for the applicant. The standards applied to income of the veteran are also applicable to that of the spouse. There can be no discounting of income on account of sex, marital status, or any other basis prohibited by the Equal Credit Opportunity Act. Income claimed by an applicant that is not or cannot be verified cannot be considered when analyzing the loan. If the veteran or spouse has been employed by a present employer for less than 2 years, a 2-year history covering prior employment, schooling, or other training must be secured. Any periods of unemployment must be explained. Employment verifications and pay stubs must be no more than 120 days (180 days for new construction) old to be considered valid. For loans closed automatically, this requirement will be considered satisfied if the date of the employment verification is within 120 days (180 days for new construction) of the date the note is signed. For prior approval loans, this requirement will be considered satisfied if the verification of employment is dated within 120 days of the date the application is received by VA.

      (2)  (i) In the case of an active-duty applicant, a military Leave & Earnings Statement is required and will be used instead of an employment verification. The statement must be no more than 120 days old (180 days for new construction) and must be the original or a lender-certified copy of the original. For loans closed automatically, this requirement is satisfied if the date of the Leave & Earnings Statement is within 120 days (180 days for new construction) of the date the note is signed. For prior approval loans, this requirement will be considered satisfied if the verification of employment is dated within 120 days of the date the application is received by VA.

      (ii) For servicemembers within 12 months of release from active duty, or members of the Reserves or National Guard within 12 months of release, one of the following is also required:

      (A) Documentation that the servicemember has in fact already reenlisted or extended his/her period of active duty or Reserve or National Guard service to a date beyond the 12-month period following the projected closing of the loan.

      (B) Verification of a valid offer of local civilian employment following release from active duty. All data pertinent to sound underwriting procedures (date employment will begin, earnings, etc.) must be included.

      (C) A statement from the servicemember that he/she intends to reenlist or extend his/her period of active duty or Reserve or National Guard service to a date beyond the 12 month period following the projected loan closing date, and a statement from the servicemember's commanding officer confirming that the servicemember is eligible to reenlist or extend his/her active duty or Reserve or National Guard service as indicated and that the commanding officer has no reason to believe that such reenlistment or extension will not be granted.

      (D) Other unusually strong positive underwriting factors, such as a down payment of at least 10 percent, significant cash reserves, or clear evidence of strong ties to the community coupled with a nonmilitary spouse's income so high that only minimal income from the active duty servicemember or member of the Reserves or National Guard is needed to qualify.

      (iii) Each active-duty member who applies for a loan must be counseled through the use of VA Form 26-0592, Counseling Checklist for Military Homebuyers. Lenders must submit a signed and dated VA Form 26-0592 with each prior approval loan application or automatic loan report involving a borrower on active duty.

      (3)  Income received by the borrower and spouse is to be used only if it can be concluded that the income will continue during the foreseeable future and, thus, should be properly considered in determining ability to meet the mortgage payments. If an employer puts N/A or otherwise declines to complete a verification of employment statement regarding the probability of continued employment, no further action is required of the lender. Reliability will be determined based on the duration of the borrower's current employment together with his or her overall documented employment history. There can be no discounting of income solely because it is derived from an annuity, pension or other retirement benefit, or from part-time employment. However, unless income from overtime work and part-time or second jobs can be accorded a reasonable likelihood that it is continuous and will continue in the foreseeable future, such income should not be used. Generally, the reliability of such income cannot be demonstrated unless the income has continued for 2 years. The hours of duty and other work conditions of the applicant's primary job, and the period of time in which the applicant was employed under such arrangement, must be such as to permit a clear conclusion as to a good probability that overtime or part-time or secondary employment can and will continue. Income from overtime work and part-time jobs not eligible for inclusion as primary income may, if properly verified for at least 12 months, be used to offset the payments due on debts and obligations of an intermediate term, , 6 to 24 months. Such income must be described in the loan file. The amount of any pension or compensation and other income, such as dividends from stocks, interest from bonds, savings accounts, or other deposits, rents, royalties, etc., will be used as primary income if it is reasonable to conclude that such income will continue in the foreseeable future. Otherwise, it may be used only to offset intermediate-term debts, as described in this paragraph. Also, the likely duration of certain military allowances cannot be determined and, therefore, will be used only to offset intermediate-term debts, as described in this paragraph. Such allowances are: Pro-pay, flight or hazard pay, and overseas or combat pay, all of which are subject to periodic review and/or testing of the recipient to ascertain whether eligibility for such pay will continue. Only if it can be shown that such pay has continued for a prolonged period and can be expected to continue because of the nature of the recipient's assigned duties, will such income be considered as primary income. For instance, flight pay verified for a pilot can be regarded as probably continuous and, thus, should be added to the base pay. Income derived from service in the Reserves or National Guard may be used if the applicant has served in such capacity for a period of time sufficient to evidence good probability that such income will continue beyond 12 months. The total period of active and reserve service may be helpful in this regard. Otherwise, such income may be used to offset intermediate-term debts. There are a number of additional income sources whose contingent nature precludes their being considered as available for repayment of a long-term mortgage obligation. Temporary income items such as VA educational allowances and unemployment compensation do not represent stable and reliable income and will not be taken into consideration in determining the ability of the veteran to meet the income requirement of the governing law. As required by the Equal Opportunity Act Amendments of 1976, Public Law 94-239, income from public assistance programs is used to qualify for a loan if it can be determined that the income will probably continue for 3 years or more.

      (4)  Special consideration can be given to verified nontaxable income once it has been established that such income is likely to continue (and remain untaxed) into the foreseeable future. Such income includes certain military allowances, child support payments, workers' compensation benefits, disability retirement payments and certain types of public assistance payments. In such cases, current income tax tables may be used to determine an amount which can be prudently employed to adjust the borrower's actual income. This adjusted or “grossed up” income may be used to calculate the monthly debt-to-income ratio, provided the analysis is documented. Only the borrower's actual income may be used to calculate the residual income. Care should be exercised to ensure that the income is in fact tax-exempt.

      (5)  (i) If an applicant chooses to reveal income from alimony, child support or maintenance payments (after first having been informed that any such disclosure is voluntary pursuant to the Federal Reserve Board's Regulation B (12 CFR part 202)), such payments are considered as income to the extent that the payments are likely to be consistently made. Factors to be considered in determining the likelihood of consistent payments include, but are not limited to: Whether the payments are received pursuant to a written agreement or court decree; the length of time the payments have been received; the regularity of receipt; the availability of procedures to compel payment; and the creditworthiness of the payor, including the credit history of the payor when available under the Fair Credit Reporting Act or other applicable laws. However, the Fair Credit Reporting Act (15 U.S.C. 1681(b)) limits the permissible purposes for which credit reports may be ordered, in the absence of written instructions of the consumer to whom the report relates, to business transactions involving the subject of the credit report or extensions of credit to the subject of the credit report.

      (ii) If the applicant chooses to reveal income related to workers' compensation, it will be considered as income to the extent it can be determined such income will continue.

      (iii) Income received specifically for the care of any foster child(ren) may be counted as income if documented. Generally, however, such foster care income is to be used only to balance the expenses of caring for the foster child(ren) against any increased residual income requirements.

      (6)  With respect to off-base housing (quarters) allowances for service personnel on active duty, it is the policy of the Department of Defense to utilize available on-base housing when possible. In order for a quarters allowance to be considered as continuing income, it is necessary that the applicant furnish written authorization from his or her commanding officer for off-base housing. This authorization should verify that quarters will not be made available and that the individual should make permanent arrangements for nonmilitary housing. A Department of Defense form, DD Form 1747, Status of Housing Availability, is used by the Family Housing Office to advise personnel regarding family housing. The applicant's quarters allowance cannot be considered unless item b (Permanent) or d is completed on DD Form 1747, dated October 1990. Of course, if the applicant's income less quarters allowance is sufficient, there is no need for assurance that the applicant has permission to occupy nonmilitary housing provided that a determination can be made that the occupancy requirements of the law will be met. Also, authorization to obtain off-base housing will not be required when certain duty assignments would clearly qualify service personnel with families for quarters allowance. For instance, off-base housing authorizations need not be obtained for service personnel stationed overseas who are not accompanied by their families, recruiters on detached duty, or military personnel stationed in areas where no on-base housing exists. In any case in which no off-base housing authorization is obtained, an explanation of the circumstances justifying its omission must be included with the loan application except when it has been established by the VA facility of jurisdiction that the waiting lists for on-base housing are so long that it is improbable that individuals desiring to purchase off-base housing would be precluded from doing so in the foreseeable future. If stations make such a determination, a release shall be issued to inform lenders.

      (7)  Generally, automobile allowances are paid to cover specific expenses related to an applicant's employment, and it is appropriate to use such income to offset a corresponding car payment. However, in some instances, such an allowance may exceed the car payment. With proper documentation, income from a car allowance which exceeds the car payment can be counted as effective income. Likewise, any other similar type of allowance which exceeds the specific expense involved may be added to gross income to the extent it is documented to exceed the actual expense.

      (8)  When all or a major portion of the veteran's income is derived from commissions, it will be necessary to establish the stability of such income if it is to be considered in the loan analysis for the repayment of the mortgage debt and/or short-term obligations. In order to assess the value of such income, lenders should obtain written verification of the actual amount of commissions paid to date, the basis for the payment of such commissions and when commissions are paid; , monthly, quarterly, semiannually, or annually. Lenders should also obtain signed and dated individual income tax returns, plus applicable schedules, for the previous 2 years, or for whatever additional period is deemed necessary to properly demonstrate a satisfactory earnings record. The length of the veteran's employment in the type of occupation for which commissions are paid is also an important factor in the assessment of the stability of the income. If the veteran has been employed for a relatively short time, the income should not normally be considered stable unless the product or service was the same or closely related to the product or service sold in an immediate prior position. Generally, income from commissions is considered stable when the applicant has been receiving such income for at least 2 years. Less than 2 years of income from commissions cannot usually be considered stable. When an applicant has received income from commissions for less than 1 year, it will rarely be possible to demonstrate that the income is stable for qualifying purposes; such cases would require in-depth development.

      (9)  Generally, income from self-employment is considered stable when the applicant has been in business for at least 2 years. Less than 2 years of income from self-employment cannot usually be considered stable unless the applicant has had previous related employment and/or extensive specialized training. When an applicant has been self-employed less than 1 year, it will rarely be possible to demonstrate that the income is stable for qualifying purposes; such cases would require in-depth development. The following documentation is required for all self-employed borrowers:

      (i) A profit-and-loss statement for the prior fiscal year (12-month accounting cycle), plus the period year to date since the end of the last fiscal year (or for whatever shorter period records may be available), and balance sheet based on the financial records. The financial statement must be sufficient for a loan underwriter to determine the necessary information for loan approval and an independent audit (on the veteran and/or the business) by a Certified Public Accountant will be required if necessary for such determination; and

      (ii) Copies of signed individual income tax returns, plus all applicable schedules for the previous 2 years, or for whatever additional period is deemed necessary to properly demonstrate a satisfactory earnings record, must be obtained. If the business is a corporation or partnership, copies of signed Federal business income tax returns for the previous two years plus all applicable schedules for the corporation or partnership must be obtained; and

      (iii) If the business is a corporation or partnership, a list of all stockholders or partners showing the interest each holds in the business will be required. Some cases may justify a written credit report on the business as well as the applicant. When the business is of an unusual type and it is difficult to determine the probability of its continued operation, explanation as to the function and purpose of the business may be needed from the applicant and/or any other qualified party with the acknowledged expertise to express a valid opinion.

      (10)  Loan applications received from recently discharged veterans who have little or no employment experience other than their military occupation and from veterans seeking VA-guaranteed loans who have retired after 20 years of active military duty require special attention. The retirement income of the latter veterans in many cases may not be sufficient to meet the statutory income requirements for the loan amount sought. Many have obtained full-time employment and have been employed in their new jobs for a very short time.

      (i) It is essential in determining whether veterans in these categories qualify from the income standpoint for the amount of the loan sought, that the facts in respect to their present employment and retirement income be fully developed, and that each case be considered on its individual merits.

      (ii) In most cases the veteran's current income or current income plus his or her retirement income is sufficient. The problem lies in determining whether it can be properly concluded that such income level will continue for the foreseeable future. If the veteran's employment status is that of a trainee or an apprentice, this will, of course, be a factor. In cases of the self-employed, the question to be resolved is whether there are reasonable prospects that the business enterprise will be successful and produce the required income. Unless a favorable conclusion can be made, the income from such source should not be considered in the loan analysis.

      (iii) If a recently discharged veteran has no prior employment history and the veteran's verification of employment shows he or she has not been on the job a sufficient time in which to become established, consideration should be given to the duties the veteran performed in the military service. When it can be determined that the duties a veteran performed in the service are similar or are in direct relation to the duties of the applicant's present position, such duties may be construed as adding weight to his or her present employment experience and the income from the veteran's present employment thus may be considered available for qualifying the loan, notwithstanding the fact that the applicant has been on the present job only a short time. This same principle may be applied to veterans recently retired from the service. In addition, when the veteran's income from retirement, in relation to the total of the estimated shelter expense, long-term debts and amount available for family support, is such that only minimal income from employment is necessary to qualify from the income standpoint, it would be proper to resolve the doubt in favor of the veteran. It would be erroneous, however, to give consideration to a veteran's income from employment for a short duration in a job requiring skills for which the applicant has had no training or experience.

      (iv) To illustrate the provisions of paragraph (f)(10), it would be proper to use short-term employment income in qualifying a veteran who had experience as an airplane mechanic in the military service and the individual's employment after discharge or retirement from the service is in the same or allied fields; e.g., auto mechanic or machinist. This presumes, however, that the verification of employment included a statement that the veteran was performing the duties of the job satisfactorily, the possibility of continued employment was favorable and that the loan application is eligible in all other respects. An example of nonqualifying experience is that of a veteran who was an Air Force pilot and has been employed in insurance sales on commission for a short time. Most cases, of course, fall somewhere between those extremes. It is for this reason that the facts of each case must be fully developed prior to closing the loan automatically or submitting the case to VA for prior approval.

      (11)  The provisions of paragraph (f)(7) of this section are similarly applicable to applicants whose employment is of short duration. Such cases will entail careful consideration of the employer's confirmation of employment, probability of permanency, past employment record, the applicant's qualifications for the position, and previous training, including that received in the military service. In the event that such considerations do not enable a determination that the income from the veteran's current position has a reasonable likelihood of continuance, such income should not be considered in the analysis. Applications received from persons employed in the building trades, or in other occupations affected by climatic conditions, should be supported by documentation evidencing the applicant's total earnings to date and covering a period of not less than 1 year as well as signed and dated copies of complete income tax returns, including all schedules for the past 2 years or for whatever additional period is deemed necessary to properly demonstrate a satisfactory earnings record. If the applicant works out of a union, evidence of the previous year's earnings should be obtained together with a verification of employment from the current employer.

      (12) —(i)  When the loan pertains to a structure with more than a one-family dwelling unit, the prospective rental income will not be considered unless the veteran can demonstrate a reasonable likelihood of success as a landlord, and sufficient cash reserves are verified to enable the veteran to carry the mortgage loan payments (principal, interest, taxes, and insurance) without assistance from the rental income for a period of at least 6 months. The determination of the veteran's likelihood of success as a landlord will be based on documentation of any prior experience in managing rental units or other collection activities. The amount of rental income to be used in the loan analysis will be based on 75 percent of the amount indicated on the lease or rental agreement, unless a greater percentage can be documented.

      (ii)  Proposed rental of a veteran's existing property may be used to offset the mortgage payment on that property, provided there is no indication that the property will be difficult to rent. If available, a copy of the rental agreement should be obtained. It is the responsibility of the loan underwriter to be aware of the condition of the local rental market. For instance, in areas where the rental market is very strong the absence of a lease should not automatically prohibit the offset of the mortgage by the proposed rental income.

      (iii)  If income from rental property will be used to qualify for the new loan, the documentation required of a self-employed applicant should be obtained together with evidence of cash reserves equaling 3 months PITI on the rental property. As for any self-employed earnings (see paragraph (f)(7) of this section), depreciation claimed may be added back in as income. In the case of a veteran who has no experience as a landlord, it is unlikely that the income from a rental property may be used to qualify for the new loan.

      (13)  Deductions to be applied for Federal income taxes and Social Security may be obtained from the Employer's Tax Guide (Circular E) issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). (For veterans receiving a mortgage credit certificate (MCC), see paragraph (f)(14) of this section.) Any State or local taxes should be estimated or obtained from charts similar to those provided by IRS which may be available in those states with withholding taxes. A determination of the amount paid or withheld for retirement purposes should be made and used when calculating deductions from gross income. In determining whether a veteran-applicant meets the income criteria for a loan, some consideration may be given to the potential tax benefits the veteran will realize if the loan is approved. This can be done by using the instructions and worksheet portion of IRS Form W-4, Employee's Withholding Allowance Certificate, to compute the total number of permissible withholding allowances. That number can then be used when referring to IRS Circular E and any appropriate similar State withholding charts to arrive at the amount of Federal and State income tax to be deducted from gross income.

      (14)  (i) The Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C.) as amended by the Tax Reform Act of 1984, allows states and other political subdivisions to trade in all or part of their authority to issue mortgage revenue bonds for authority to issue MCCs. Veterans who are recipients of MCCs may realize a significant reduction in their income tax liability by receiving a Federal tax credit for a percentage of their mortgage interest payment on debt incurred on or after January 1, 1985.

      (ii) Lenders must provide a copy of the MCC to VA with the home loan application. The MCC will specify the rate of credit allowed and the amount of certified indebtedness; , the indebtedness incurred by the veteran to acquire a principal residence or as a qualified home improvement or rehabilitation loan.

      (iii) For credit underwriting purposes, the amount of tax credit allowed to a veteran under an MCC will be treated as a reduction in the monthly Federal income tax. For example, a veteran having a $600 monthly interest payment and an MCC providing a 30-percent tax credit would receive a $180 (30 percent × $600) tax credit each month. However, because the annual tax credit, which amounts to $2,160 (12 × $180), exceeds $2,000 and is based on a 30-percent credit rate, the maximum tax credit the veteran can receive is limited to $2,000 per year (Pub. L. 98-369) or $167 per month ($2,000/12). As a consequence of the tax credit, the interest on which a deduction can be taken will be reduced by the amount of the tax credit to $433 ($600−$167). This reduction should also be reflected when calculating Federal income tax.

      (iv) For underwriting purposes, the amount of the tax credit is limited to the amount of the veteran's maximum tax liability. If, in the example in paragraph (f)(14)(iii) of this section, the veteran's tax liability for the year were only $1,500, the monthly tax credit would be limited to $125 ($1,500/12).

      (g)  The conclusion reached as to whether or not the veteran and spouse are satisfactory credit risks must also be based on a careful analysis of the available credit data. Regulation B (12 CFR part 202), promulgated by the Federal Reserve Board pursuant to the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, requires that lenders, in evaluating creditworthiness, shall consider, on the applicant's request, the credit history, when available, of any account reported in the name of the applicant's spouse or former spouse which the applicant can demonstrate accurately reflects the applicant's creditworthiness. In other than community property states, if the spouse will not be contractually obligated on the loan, Regulation B prohibits any request for or consideration of information about the spouse concerning income, employment, assets or liabilities. In community property states, information concerning a spouse may be requested and considered in the same manner as that for the applicant.

      (1)  If the analysis develops any derogatory credit information and, despite such facts, it is determined that the veteran and spouse are satisfactory credit risks, the basis for the decision must be explained. If a veteran and spouse have debts outstanding which have not been paid timely, or which they have refused to pay, the fact that the outstanding debts are paid after the acceptability of the credit is questioned or in anticipation of applying for new credit does not, of course, alter the fact that the record for paying debts has been unsatisfactory. With respect to unpaid debts, lenders may take into consideration a veteran's claim of bona fide or legal defenses. Such defenses are not applicable when the debt has been reduced to judgment. Where a collection account has been established, if it is determined that the borrower is a satisfactory credit risk, it is not mandatory that such an account be paid off in order for a loan to be approved. Court-ordered judgments, however, must be paid off before a new loan is approved.

      (2)  When the credit information shows that the borrower or spouse has been discharged in bankruptcy under the “straight” liquidation and discharge provisions of the bankruptcy law, this would not in itself disqualify the loan. However, in such cases it is necessary to develop complete information as to the facts and circumstances concerning the bankruptcy. Generally speaking, when the borrower or spouse, as the case may be, has been regularly employed (not self-employed) and has been discharged in bankruptcy within the last one to two years, it probably would not be possible to determine that the borrower or spouse is a satisfactory credit risk unless both of the following requirements are satisfied:

      (i) The borrower or spouse has obtained credit subsequent to the bankruptcy and has met the credit payments in a satisfactory manner over a continued period; and

      (ii) The bankruptcy was caused by circumstances beyond the control of the borrower or spouse, e.g., unemployment, prolonged strikes, medical bills not covered by insurance. Divorce is not generally viewed as beyond the control of the borrower and/or spouse. The circumstances alleged must be verified. If a borrower or spouse is self-employed, has been adjudicated bankrupt, and subsequently obtains a permanent position, a finding as to satisfactory credit risk may be made provided there is no derogatory credit information prior to self-employment, there is no derogatory credit information subsequent to the bankruptcy, and the failure of the business was not due to misconduct. If a borrower or spouse has been discharged in bankruptcy within the past 12 months, it will not generally be possible to determine that the borrower or spouse is a satisfactory credit risk.

      (3)  A petition under chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code (11 U.S.C.) filed by the borrower or spouse is indicative of an effort to pay their creditors. Some plans may provide for full payment of debts while others arrange for payment of scaled-down debts. Regular payments are made to a court-appointed trustee over a 2- to 3-year period (or up to 5 years in some cases). When the borrowers have made all payments in a satisfactory manner, they may be considered as having reestablished satisfactory credit. When they apply for a home loan before completion of the payout period, favorable consideration may nevertheless be given if at least 12 months' worth of payments have been made satisfactorily and the Trustee or Bankruptcy Judge approves of the new credit.

      (4)  (i) When the credit information shows that the veteran or spouse has had a foreclosure on a prior mortgage; e.g., a VA-guaranteed or HUD-insured mortgage, this will not in itself disqualify the borrower from obtaining the loan. Lenders and field station personnel should refer to the preceding guidelines on bankruptcies for cases involving foreclosures. As with a borrower who has been adjudicated bankrupt, it is necessary to develop complete information as to the facts and circumstances of the foreclosure.

      (ii) When VA pays a claim on a VA-guaranteed loan as a result of a foreclosure, the original veteran may be required to repay any loss to the Government. In some instances VA may waive the veteran's debt, in part or totally, based on the facts and circumstances of the case. However, guaranty entitlement cannot be restored unless the Government's loss has been repaid in full, regardless of whether or not the debt has been waived, compromised, or discharged in bankruptcy. Therefore, a veteran who is seeking a new VA loan after having experienced a foreclosure on a prior VA loan will in most cases have only remaining entitlement to apply to the new loan. The lender should assure that the veteran has sufficient entitlement for its secondary marketing purposes.

      (5)  An applicant for a Federally-assisted loan will not be considered a satisfactory credit risk for such loan if the applicant is presently delinquent or in default on any debt to the Federal Government, e.g., a Small Business Administration loan, a U.S. Guaranteed Student loan, a debt to the Public Health Service, or where there is a judgment lien against the applicant's property for a debt owed to the Government. The applicant may not be approved for the loan until the delinquent account has been brought current or satisfactory arrangements have been made between the borrower and the Federal agency owed, or the judgment is paid or otherwise satisfied. Of course, the applicant must also be able to otherwise qualify for the loan from an income and remaining credit standpoint. Refinancing under VA's interest rate reduction refinancing provisions, however, is allowed even if the borrower is delinquent on the VA guaranteed mortgage being refinanced. Prior approval processing is required in such cases.

      (6)  The fact that recently discharged veterans may have had no opportunity to develop a credit history will not preclude a determination of satisfactory credit. Similarly, other loan applicants may not have established credit histories as a result of a preference for purchasing consumer items with cash rather than credit. There are also cases in which individuals may be genuinely wary of acquiring new obligations following bankruptcy, consumer credit counseling (debt proration), or other disruptive credit occurrence. The absence of the credit history in these cases will not generally be viewed as an adverse factor in credit underwriting. However, before a favorable decision is made for cases involving bankruptcies or other derogatory credit factors, efforts should be made to develop evidence of timely payment of non-installment debts such as rent and utilities. It is anticipated that this special consideration in the absence of a credit history following bankruptcy would be the rare case and generally confined to bankruptcies that occurred over 3 years ago.

      (7)  If a veteran, or veteran and spouse, have prior adverse credit and are participating in a Consumer Credit Counseling plan, they may be determined to be a satisfactory credit risk if they demonstrate 12 months' satisfactory payments and the counseling agency approves the new credit. If a veteran, or veteran and spouse, have good prior credit and are participating in a Consumer Credit Counseling plan, such participation is to be considered a neutral factor, or even a positive factor, in determining creditworthiness.

      (8)  In circumstances not involving bankruptcy, satisfactory credit is generally considered to be reestablished after the veteran, or veteran and spouse, have made satisfactory payments for 12 months after the date of the last derogatory credit item.

      (9)  v.  All known debts and obligations including any alimony and/or child support payments of the borrower and spouse must be documented. Significant liabilities, to be deducted from the total income in determining ability to meet the mortgage payments are accounts that, generally, are of a relatively long term, , 10 months or over. Other accounts for terms of less than 10 months must, of course, be considered in determining ability to meet family expenses. Certainly, any severe impact on the family's resources for any period of time must be considered in the loan analysis. For example, monthly payments of $300 on an auto loan with a remaining balance of $1,500 would be included in those obligations to be deducted from the total income regardless of the fact that the account can be expected to pay out in 5 months. It is clear that the applicant will, in this case, continue to carry the burden of those $300 payments for the first, most critical months of the home loan.

      (10)  If the credit investigation reveals debts or obligations of a material nature which were not divulged by the applicant, lenders must be certain to obtain clarification as to the status of such debts from the borrower. A proper analysis is obviously not possible unless there is total correlation between the obligations claimed by the borrower and those revealed by a credit report or deposit verification. Conversely, significant debts and obligations reported by the borrower must be dated. If the credit report fails to provide necessary information on such accounts, lenders will be expected to obtain their own verifications of those debts directly from the creditors. Credit reports and verifications must be no more than 120 days old (180 days for new construction) to be considered valid. For loans closed automatically, this requirement will be considered satisfied if the date of the credit report or verification is within 120 days (180 days for new construction) of the date the note is signed. For prior approval loans, this requirement will be considered satisfied if the date of the credit report or verification is within 120 days of the date the application is received by VA. Of major significance are the applicant's rental history and outstanding or recently retired mortgages, if any, particularly prior VA loans. Lenders should be sure ratings on such accounts are obtained; a written explanation is required when ratings are not available. A determination is necessary as to whether alimony and/or child support payments are required. Verification of the amount of such obligations should be obtained, although documentation concerning an applicant's divorce should not be obtained automatically unless it is necessary to verify the amount of any alimony or child support liability indicated by the applicant. If in the routine course of processing the loan application, however, direct evidence is received (e.g., from the credit report) that an obligation to pay alimony or child support exists (as opposed to mere evidence that the veteran was previously divorced), the discrepancy between the loan application and credit report can and should be fully resolved in the same manner as any other such discrepancy would be handled. When a pay stub or leave-and-earnings statement indicates an allotment, the lender must investigate the nature of the allotment(s) to determine whether the allotment is related to a debt. Debts assigned to an ex-spouse by a divorce decree will not generally be charged against a veteran-borrower.

      (11)  Known job-related expenses should be documented. This will include costs for any dependent care, significant commuting costs, etc. When a family's circumstances are such that dependent care arrangements would probably be necessary, it is important to determine the cost of such services in order to arrive at an accurate total of deductions.

      (12)  Credit reports obtained by lenders on VA-guaranteed loan applications must be either a three-file Merged Credit Report (MCR) or a Residential Mortgage Credit Report (RMCR). If used, the RMCR must meet the standards formulated jointly by the Department of Veterans Affairs, Federal National Mortgage Association, Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, Federal Housing Administration, Farmers Home Administration, credit repositories, repository affiliated consumer reporting agencies and independent consumer reporting agencies. All credit reports obtained by the lender must be submitted to VA.

      (h)  The number and ages of dependents have an important bearing on whether income after deduction of fixed charges is sufficient to support the family. Type and duration of employment of both the borrower and spouse are important as an indication of stability of their employment. The amount of liquid assets owned by the borrower or spouse, or both, is an important factor in determining that they have sufficient funds to close the loan, as well as being significant in analyzing the overall qualifications for the loan. (It is imperative that adequate cash assets from the veteran's own resources are verified to allow the payment (see § 36.4339(a)(3)) of any difference between the sales price of the property and the loan amount, in addition to that necessary to cover closing costs, if the sales price exceeds the reasonable value established by VA.) Verifications must be no more than 120 days old (180 days for new construction) to be considered valid. For loans closed on the automatic basis, this requirement will be considered satisfied if the date of the deposit verification is within 120 days (180 days for new construction) of the date of the veteran's application to the lender. For prior approval loans, this requirement will be considered satisfied if the verification of employment is dated within 120 days of the date the application is received by VA. Current monthly rental or other housing expense is an important consideration when compared to that to be undertaken in connection with the contemplated housing purchase.

      (i)  It is important that monthly expenses such as taxes, insurance, assessments and maintenance and utilities be estimated accurately based on property location and type of house; e.g., old or new, large or small, rather than using or applying a “rule of thumb” to all properties alike. Maintenance and utility amounts for various types of property should be realistically estimated. Local utility companies should be consulted for current rates. The age and type of construction of a house may well affect these expenses. In the case of condominiums or houses in a planned unit development (PUD), the monthly amount of the maintenance assessment payable to a homeowners association should be added. If the amount currently assessed is less than the maximum provided in the covenants or master deed, and it appears likely that the amount will be insufficient for operation of the condominium or PUD, the amount used will be the maximum the veteran could be charged. If it is expected that real estate taxes will be raised, or if any special assessments are expected, the increased or additional amounts should be used. In special flood hazard areas, include the premium for any required flood insurance.

      (j)  (1) Lenders are fully responsible for developing all credit information; , for obtaining verifications of employment and deposit, credit reports, and for the accuracy of the information contained in the loan application.

      (2) Verifications of employment and deposits, and requests for credit reports and/or credit information must be initiated and received by the lender.

      (3) In cases where the real estate broker/agent or any other party requests any of this information, the report(s) must be returned directly to the lender. This fact must be disclosed by appropriately completing the required certification on the loan application or report and the parties must be identified as agents of the lender.

      (4) Where the lender relies on other parties to secure any of the credit or employment information or otherwise accepts such information obtained by any other party, such parties shall be construed for purposes of the submission of the loan documents to VA to be authorized agents of the lender, regardless of the actual relationship between such parties and the lender, even if disclosure is not provided to VA under paragraph (j)(3) of this section. Any negligent or willful misrepresentation by such parties shall be imputed to the lender as if the lender had processed those documents and the lender shall remain responsible for the quality and accuracy of the information provided to VA.

      (5) All credit reports secured by the lender or other parties as identified in paragraphs (j)(3) and (4) of this section shall be provided to VA. If updated credit reports reflect materially different information than that in other reports, such discrepancies must be explained by the lender and the ultimate decision as to the effects of the discrepancy upon the loan application fully addressed by the underwriter.

      (k)  Lenders originating loans are responsible for determining and certifying to VA on the appropriate application or closing form that the loan meets all statutory and regulatory requirements. Lenders will affirmatively certify that loans were made in full compliance with the law and loan guaranty regulations as prescribed in this section.

      (1)  The definitions contained in part 42 of this chapter and the following definitions are applicable in this section.

      (i)  In determining the appropriate amount of a lender's civil penalty in cases where the Secretary has not sustained a loss or where two times the amount of the Secretary's loss on the loan involved does not exceed $28,619, the Secretary shall consider:

      (A) The materiality and importance of the false certification to the determination to issue the guaranty or to approve the assumption;

      (B) The frequency and past pattern of such false certifications by the lender; and

      (C) Any exculpatory or mitigating circumstances.

      (ii)  Complaint includes the assessment of liability served pursuant to this section.

      (iii)  Defendant means a lender named in the complaint.

      (iv)  Lender includes the holder approving loan assumptions pursuant to 38 U.S.C. 3714.

      (2)  (i) As a condition to VA issuance of a loan guaranty on all loans closed on or after October 27, 1994, and as a prerequisite to an effective loan assumption on all loans assumed pursuant to 38 U.S.C. 3714 on or after November 17, 1997, the following certification shall accompany each loan closing or assumption package:

      (ii) The certification shall be executed by an officer of the lender authorized to execute documents and act on behalf of the lender.

      (3)  Any lender who knowingly and willfully makes a false certification required pursuant to § 36.4340(k)(2) shall be liable to the United States Government for a civil penalty equal to two times the amount of the Secretary's loss on the loan involved or to another appropriate amount, not to exceed $28,619, whichever is greater.

      (l)  (1) Upon an assessment confirmed by the Under Secretary for Benefits, in consultation with the Investigating Official, that a certification, as required in this section, is false, a report of findings of the Under Secretary for Benefits shall be submitted to the Reviewing Official setting forth:

      (i) The evidence that supports the allegations of a false certification and of liability;

      (ii) A description of the claims or statements upon which the allegations of liability are based;

      (iii) The amount of the VA demand to be made; and

      (iv) Any exculpatory or mitigating circumstances that may relate to the certification.

      (2) The Reviewing Official shall review all of the information provided and will either inform the Under Secretary for Benefits and the Investigating Official that there is not adequate evidence, that the lender is liable, or serve a complaint on the lender stating:

      (i) The allegations of a false certification and of liability;

      (ii) The amount being assessed by the Secretary and the basis for the amount assessed;

      (iii) Instructions on how to satisfy the assessment and how to file an answer to request a hearing, including a specific statement of the lender's right to request a hearing by filing an answer and to be represented by counsel; and

      (iv) That failure to file an answer within 30 days of the complaint will result in the imposition of the assessment without right to appeal the assessment to the Secretary.

      (m)  A lender hearing on an assessment established pursuant to this section shall be governed by the procedures recited at 38 CFR 42.8 through 42.47.

      (n)  Any assessment under this section may be in addition to other remedies available to VA, such as debarment and suspension pursuant to 38 U.S.C. 3704 and 2 CFR parts 180 and 801 or loss of automatic processing authority pursuant to 38 U.S.C. 3702, or other actions by the Government under any other law including but not limited to title 18 U.S.C. and 31 U.S.C. 3732.

      § 36.4341   Death or insolvency of holder.

#### § § 36.4341

      (a) Immediately upon the death of the holder and without the necessity of request or other action by the debtor or the Secretary, all sums then standing as a credit balance in a trust, or deposit, or other account to cover taxes, insurance accruals, or other items in connection with the loan secured by the encumbered property, whether stated to be such or otherwise designated, and which have not been credited on the note shall, nevertheless, be treated as a setoff and shall be deemed to have been credited thereon as of the date of the last debit to such account, so that the unpaid balance of the note as of that date will be reduced by the amount of such credit balance: Provided, that any unpaid taxes, insurance premiums, ground rents, or advances may be paid by the holder of the indebtedness, at the holder's option, and the amount which otherwise would have been deemed to have been credited on the note reduced accordingly. This paragraph shall be applicable whether the estate of the deceased holder is solvent or insolvent.

      (b) The provisions of paragraph (a) of this section shall also be applicable in the event of:

      (1) Insolvency of holder;

      (2) Initiation of any bankruptcy or reorganization, or liquidation proceedings as to the holder, whether voluntary or involuntary;

      (3) Appointment of a general or ancillary receiver for the holder's property; or in any case; or

      (4) Upon the written request of the debtor if all secured and due insurance premiums, taxes, and ground rents have been paid, and appropriate provisions made for future accruals.

      (c) Upon the occurrence of any of the events enumerated in paragraph (a) or (b) of this section, interest on the note and on the credit balance of the deposits mentioned in paragraph (a) shall be set off against each other at the rate payable on the principal of the note, as of the date of last debit to the deposit account. Any excess credit of interest shall be treated as a set-off against the unpaid advances, if any, and the unpaid balance of the note.

      (d) The provisions of paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of this section shall apply also to corporations. The dissolution thereof by expiration of charter, by forfeiture, or otherwise shall be treated as is the death of an individual as provided in paragraph (a) of this section.

      § 36.4342   Qualification for designated fee appraisers.

#### § § 36.4342

      To qualify for approval as a designated fee appraiser, an applicant must show to the satisfaction of the Secretary that his or her character, experience, and the type of work in which he or she has had experience for at least 5 years qualifies the applicant to competently appraise and value within a prescribed area the type of property to which the approval relates.

      § 36.4343   Restriction on designated fee appraisers.

#### § § 36.4343

      (a) A designated fee appraiser shall not make an appraisal, excepting of alterations, improvements, or repairs to real property entailing a cost of not more than $3,500, if such appraiser is an officer, director, trustee, employer, or employee of the lender, contractor, or vendor.

      (b) An appraisal made by a designated fee appraiser shall be subject to review and adjustment by the Secretary. The amount determined to be proper upon any such review or adjustment shall constitute the “reasonable value” for the purpose of determining the eligibility of the related loan.

      § 36.4346   Cooperative loans.

#### § § 36.4346

      (a) To be eligible for guaranty or insurance, any loan of the following types shall require prior approval of the Under Secretary for Benefits, or the Executive Director, Loan Guaranty Service, who may issue such approval upon such conditions and limitations deemed appropriate, not inconsistent with the provisions of 38 U.S.C. chapter 37 and this subpart:

      (1) Any loan which is related to an enterprise in which more than 10 individuals will participate; or

      (2) Any loan to be made for the purchase or construction of residential units in any housing development, cooperative or otherwise, the title to which development or to the individual units therein is not to be held directly by the veteran-participants, or which contemplates the ownership or maintenance of more than three units or of their major appurtenances in common.

      (b) The issuance of such approval with respect to a residential development under paragraph (a)(2) of this section also shall be subject to such conditions and stipulation as in the judgment of the approving officer are possible and proper to:

      (1) Afford reasonable and feasible protection to the rights of the Government as guarantor or insurer, and as subrogee, and to each veteran-participant against loss of his or her respective equity consequent upon the failure of other participants to discharge their obligations;

      (2) Provide for a reasonable and workable plan for the operation and management of the project;

      (3) Limit the personal liability of each veteran-participant to those sums allocable on a proper ratable basis to the purchase, cost, and maintenance of his or her individual unit or participating interest; and

      (4) Limit commercial features to those reasonably calculated to promote the economic soundness of the project and the living convenience of the participants, retaining the essential character of a residential project.

      (c) No such project, development, or enterprise may be approved which involves an initial grouping of more than 500 veterans, or a cost of more than five million dollars, unless it is conclusively shown to the satisfaction of the approving officer that a greater number of veterans or dollar amount will assure substantial advantages to the veteran-participants which could not be achieved in a smaller project.

      (d) When approved as in this section provided, and upon performance of the conditions indicated in the prior approval, proper guaranty certificate or certificates may be issued in connection with the loan or loans to be guaranteed on behalf of eligible veterans participating in the project, development or enterprise not to exceed in total amount the sum of the guaranties applied for by the individual participants and for which guaranty each participant is then eligible.

      (e) In lieu of guaranty as authorized in paragraph (d) of this section, insurance shall be available on application by the lender and all veterans concerned. In such case the insurance credit shall be limited to 15 percent of the obligation of the veteran applicant (subject to available eligibility) and the total insurance credit in respect to the veterans' loans involved in the project shall not exceed 15 percent of the aggregate of the principal sums of the individual indebtedness incurred by the veterans participating in the project for the purpose of acquiring their respective interests therein.

      § 36.4347   Lender Appraisal Processing Program.

#### § § 36.4347

      (a)  (1) To be eligible for delegation of authority to review VA appraisals and determine the reasonable value of properties to be purchased with VA guaranteed loans, a lender must—

      (i) Have automatic processing authority under 38 U.S.C. 3702(d), and

      (ii) Employ one or more staff appraisal reviewers acceptable to the Secretary.

      (2) To qualify as a lender's staff appraisal reviewer an applicant must be a full-time member of the lender's permanent staff and may not be employed by, or perform services for, any other mortgagee. The individual must not engage in any private pursuits in which there will be, or appear to be, any conflict of interest between those pursuits and his/her duties, responsibilities, and performance as a Lender Appraisal Processing Program (LAPP) staff appraisal reviewer. Three years of experience is necessary to qualify as a lender's staff appraisal reviewer. That experience must demonstrate a knowledge of, and the ability to apply industry-accepted principles, methods, practices and techniques of appraising, and the ability to competently determine the value of property within a prescribed geographical area. The individual must demonstrate the ability to review the work of others and to recognize deviations from accepted appraisal principles, practices, and techniques; errors in computations, and unjustifiable and unsupportable conclusions.

      (3) Lenders that meet the requirements of 38 U.S.C. 3702(d), and have a staff appraisal reviewer determined acceptable by VA, will be authorized to review appraisals and make reasonable value determinations on properties that will be security for VA guaranteed loans. The lender's authorization will be subject to a one-year probationary period. Additionally, lenders must satisfy initial and subsequent VA office case review requirements prior to being allowed to determine reasonable value without VA involvement. The initial office case review requirement must be satisfied in the VA regional office in whose jurisdiction the lender's staff appraisal reviewer is located before the LAPP authority may be utilized by that lender in any other VA office's jurisdiction. To satisfy the initial office case review requirement, the first five cases of each lender staff appraisal reviewer involving properties in the regional office location where the staff appraisal reviewer is located will be processed by him or her up to the point where he or she has made a reasonable value determination and fully drafted, but not issued, the lender's notification of reasonable value letter to the veteran. At that point, and prior to loan closing, each of the five cases will be submitted to the local VA office. After a staff review of each case, VA will issue a Certificate of Reasonable Value, which the lender may use in closing the loan automatically if it meets all other requirements of the VA. If these five cases are found to be acceptable by VA, the lender's staff appraisal reviewer will be allowed to fully process subsequent appraisals for properties located in that VA office's jurisdiction without prior submission to VA and issuance by VA of a Certificate of Reasonable Value. Lenders must also satisfy a subsequent VA office case review requirement in each additional VA office location in which they desire to extend and utilize this authority. Under this requirement, the lender must have first satisfied the initial office case review requirement and then must submit to the additional VA office(s) the first case each staff appraisal reviewer processes in the jurisdiction of that office. As provided under the initial office case review requirement, VA office personnel will issue a Certificate of Reasonable Value for this case and subsequently determine the acceptability of the lender's staff appraisal reviewer's processing. If VA finds this first case to be acceptable, the lender's staff appraisal reviewer will be allowed to fully process subsequent cases in that additional VA office's jurisdiction without prior submission to VA. The initial and subsequent office case review requirements may be expanded by VA if acceptable performance has not been demonstrated. After satisfaction of the initial and subsequent office case review requirements, routine reviews of LAPP cases will be made by VA staff based upon quality control procedures established by the Under Secretary for Benefits. Such review will be made on a random sampling or performance related basis. During the probationary period a high percentage of reviews will be made by VA staff.

      (4) The following certification by the lender's nominated staff appraisal reviewer must be provided with the lender's application for delegation of LAPP authority:

      (5) Other certifications required from the lender will be specified with particularity in the separate instructions issued by the Secretary, as noted in § 36.4347(b).

      (b)  The Secretary will publish separate instructions for processing appraisals under the Lenders Appraisal Processing Program. Compliance with these regulations and the separate instructions issued by the Secretary is deemed by VA to be the minimum exercise of due diligence in processing LAPP cases. Due diligence is considered by VA to represent that care, as is to be properly expected from, and ordinarily exercised by, reasonable and prudent lenders who would be dependent on the property as security to protect its investment.

      (c)  Lenders are responsible for determining that the property meets _VA minimum property requirements._ The separate instructions issued by the Secretary will set forth the lender's ability to adjust, remove, or alter the fee appraiser's or fee compliance inspector's recommendations concerning VA minimum property requirements. Condominiums, planned-unit developments and leasehold estates must have been determined acceptable by VA. A condominium or planned-unit development which is acceptable to the Department of Housing and Urban Development or the Department of Agriculture may also be acceptable to VA.

      (d)  The amount of authority to upwardly adjust the fee appraiser's estimated market value during the lender staff appraisal reviewer's initial review of the appraisal report or to subsequently process an appeal of the lender's established reasonable value will be specified in the separate instructions issued by VA as noted in § 36.4347(b). The amount specified must not in any way be considered an administrative adjustment figure which may be applied indiscriminately and without valid basis or justification with the sole purpose of reaching an amount necessary to complete the sale or mortgage transaction.

      (1)  Any adjustment during the staff appraisal reviewer's initial review of the appraisal report must be fully and clearly justified in writing on the appraisal report form or, if necessary, on an addendum. The basis for the adjustment must be adequate and reasonable by professional appraisal standards. If real estate market or other valid data was utilized in arriving at the decision to make the adjustment, such data must be attached to the appraisal report. All adjustments, comments, corrections, justifications, etc., to the appraisal report must be made in a contrasting color, be clearly legible, and signed and dated by the staff appraisal reviewer.

      (2)  The authority provided under 38 U.S.C. 3731(d) which permits a lender to obtain a VA fee panel appraiser's report which VA is obligated to consider in an appeal of the established reasonable value shall not apply to cases processed under the authority provided by this section. All appeals of VA fee appraisers' estimated market values or lenders' reasonable value determinations above the amount specified in the separate instructions issued by VA must be submitted, along with the lender's recommendations, if any, to VA for processing and final determination. Unless otherwise authorized in the separate instructions lenders must also submit appeals, regardless of the amount, to VA in all cases where the staff appraisal reviewer has made an adjustment during their initial review of the appraisal report to the fee appraiser's market value estimate. The fee appraiser's estimated market value or lender's reasonable value determination may be increased only when such increase is clearly warranted and fully supported by real estate market or other valid data considered adequate and reasonable by professional appraisal standards and the lender's staff appraisal reviewer clearly and fully justifies the reasoning and basis for the increase in writing on the appraisal report form or an addendum. The staff appraisal reviewer must date and sign the written justification and must cite within it the data used in arriving at the decision to make the increase. All such data shall be attached to the appraisal report form and any addendum.

      (e)  It will be the responsibility of the lender to notify the veteran borrower in writing of the determination of reasonable value and related conditions specific to the property and to provide the veteran with a copy of the appraisal report. Any delay in processing the notification of value must be documented. Any delay of more than five work days between the date of the lender's receipt of the fee appraiser's report and date of the notification of value to the veteran, without reasonable and documented extenuating circumstances, will not be acceptable. A copy of the lender notification letter to the veteran and the appraisal report must be forwarded to the VA office of jurisdiction at the same time the veteran is notified. In addition, the original appraisal report, related appraisal documentation, and a copy of the reasonable value determination notification to the veteran must be submitted to the VA with the request for loan guaranty.

      (f)  When the Secretary has incurred a loss as a result of a payment of claim under guaranty and in which the Secretary determines an increase made by the lender under § 36.4347(d) was unwarranted, or arbitrary and capricious, the lender shall indemnify the Secretary to the extent the Secretary determines such loss was caused, or increased, by the increase in value.

      (g)  A lender affiliated with a real estate firm builder, land developer or escrow agent as a subsidiary division, investment or any other entity in which it has a financial interest or which it owns may not use this authority for any cases involving the affiliate unless the lender demonstrates to the Secretary's satisfaction that the lender and its affiliate(s) are essentially separate entities that operate independently of each other, free of all cross-influences (e.g., a formal corporate agreement exists which specifically sets forth this fact).

      (h)  The lender must have an effective self-policing or quality control system to ensure the adequacy and quality of their LAPP staff appraisal reviewer's processing and, that its activities do not deviate from high standards of integrity. The quality control system must include frequent, periodic audits that specifically address the appraisal review activity. These audits may be performed by an independent party, or by the lender's independent internal audit division which reports directly to the firm's chief executive officer. The lender must agree to furnish findings and information under this system to VA on demand. While the quality control personnel need not be appraisers, they should have basic familiarity with appraisal theory and techniques and the ability to prescribe appropriate corrective action(s) in the appraisal review process when discrepancies or problems are identified. The basic elements of the system will be described in separate instructions issued by the Secretary. Copies of the lender's quality control plan or self-policing system evidencing appraisal related matters must be provided to the VA office of jurisdiction with the lender's application for LAPP authority.

      (i)  The Secretary may require mortgagees to pay an application fee and/or annual fees, including additional fees for each branch office authorized to process cases under the authority delegated under this section, in such amounts and at such times as the Secretary may require.

      (j)  The authority for a lender to determine reasonable value may be withdrawn by the Loan Guaranty Officer when proper cause exists. A lender's authority to make reasonable value determinations shall be withdrawn when the lender no longer meets the basic requirements for delegating the authority, or when it can be shown that the lender's reasonable value determinations have not been made in accordance with VA regulations, requirements, guidelines, instructions or applicable laws, or when there is adequate evidence to support reasonable belief by VA that a particular unacceptable act, practice, or performance by the lender or the lender's staff has occurred. Such acts, practices or performance include, but are not limited to: Demonstrated technical incompetence (, conduct which demonstrates an insufficient knowledge of industry accepted appraisal principles, techniques and practices; or the lack of technical competence to review appraisal reports and make value determinations in accordance with those requirements); substantive or repetitive errors (, any error(s) of a nature that would materially or significantly affect the determination of reasonable value or condition of the property; or a number or series of errors that, considered individually, may not significantly impact the determination of reasonable value or property condition, but which when considered in the aggregate would establish that appraisal reviews or LAPP case processing are being performed in a careless or negligent manner), or continued instances of disregard for VA requirements after they have been called to the lender's attention.

      (1) Withdrawal of authority by the Loan Guaranty Officer may be either for an indefinite or a specified period of time. For any withdrawal longer than 90 days, a reapplication for lender authority to process appraisals under these regulations will be required. Written notice will be provided at least 30 days in advance of withdrawal unless the Government's interests are exposed to immediate risk from the lender's activities in which case the withdrawal will be effected immediately. The notice will clearly and specifically set forth the basis and grounds for the action. There is no right to a formal hearing to contest the withdrawal of LAPP processing privileges. However, if within 15 days after receiving notice the lender requests an opportunity to contest the withdrawal, the lender may submit, in person, in writing, or through a representative, information and argument to the Loan Guaranty Officer in opposition to the withdrawal. The Loan Guaranty Officer will make a recommendation to the Regional Office Director who shall make the determination as to whether the action should be sustained, modified or rescinded. The lender will be informed in writing of the decision.

      (2) The lender has the right to appeal the Regional Office Director's decision to the Under Secretary for Benefits. In the event of such an appeal, the Under Secretary for Benefits will review all relevant material concerning the matter and make a determination that shall constitute final agency action. If the lender's submission of opposition raises a genuine dispute over facts material to the withdrawal of LAPP authority, the lender will be afforded an opportunity to appear with a representative, submit documentary evidence, present witnesses and confront any witness the Veterans Benefits Administration presents. The Under Secretary for Benefits will appoint a hearing officer or panel to conduct the hearing. When such additional proceedings are necessary, the Under Secretary for Benefits shall base the determination on the facts as found, together with any information and argument submitted by the lender.

      (3) In actions based upon a conviction or civil judgment, or in which there is no genuine dispute over material facts, the Under Secretary for Benefits shall make a decision on the basis of all the information in the administrative record, including any submission made by the lender.

      (4) Withdrawal of the LAPP authority will require that VA make subsequent determinations of reasonable value for the lender. Consequently, VA staff will review each appraisal report and issue a Certificate of Reasonable Value which can then be used by the lender to close loans on either the prior VA approval or automatic basis.

      (5) Withdrawal by VA of the lender's LAPP authority does not prevent VA from also withdrawing automatic processing authority or taking debarment or suspension action based upon the same conduct by the lender.

      § 36.4348   Servicer Appraisal Processing Program.

#### § § 36.4348

      (a)  Based on the reasonable value, the servicer will be able to determine net value.

      (1) To be eligible for delegation of authority to review VA liquidation appraisals and determine the reasonable value for liquidation purposes on properties secured by VA guaranteed or insured loans, a lender must:

      (i) Have automatic processing authority under 38 U.S.C. 3702(d), and

      (ii) Employ one or more Staff Appraisal Reviewers (SAR) acceptable to the Secretary.

      (2) To qualify as a servicer's staff appraisal reviewer an applicant must be a full-time member of the servicer's permanent staff and may not be employed by, or perform services for, any other mortgagee. The individual must not engage in any private pursuits in which there will be, or appear to be, any conflict of interest between those pursuits and his/her duties, responsibilities, and performance as a Servicer Appraisal Processing Program (SAPP) staff appraisal reviewer. Three years of appraisal related experience is necessary to qualify as a servicer's staff appraisal reviewer. That experience must demonstrate knowledge of, and the ability to apply industry-accepted principles, methods, practices and techniques of appraising, and the ability to competently determine the value of property. The individual must demonstrate the ability to review the work of others and to recognize deviations from accepted appraisal principle, practices, and techniques, error in computations, and unjustifiable and unsupportable conclusions.

      (3) Servicers that have a staff appraisal reviewer determined acceptable to VA, will be authorized to review liquidation appraisals and make reasonable value determinations for liquidation purposes on properties that are the security for VA guaranteed or insured loans. Additionally, servicers must satisfy initial VA office case review requirements prior to being allowed to determine reasonable value without VA involvement. The initial office case review requirement must be satisfied in the VA regional loan center in whose jurisdiction the servicer's staff appraisal reviewer is located before the SAPP authority may be utilized by that servicer in any other VA office's jurisdiction. To satisfy the initial office case review requirement, the first five cases of each servicer staff appraisal reviewer involving properties in the regional office location where the staff appraisal reviewer is located will be processed by him or her up to the point where he or she has made a reasonable value determination and fully drafted, but not issued, the servicer's notice of value. At that point, and prior to loan termination, each of the five cases will be submitted to the VA regional loan center having jurisdiction over the property. After a staff review of each case, VA will issue a notice of value which the servicer may use to compute the net value of the property for liquidation purposes. If these five cases are found to be acceptable by VA, the servicer's staff appraisal reviewer will be allowed to fully process subsequent appraisals for properties regardless of jurisdictional location without prior submission to VA and issuance by VA of a notice of value. Where the servicer's reviewer cannot readily meet the jurisdictional review requirement, the SAR applicant may request that VA expand the geographic area of consideration. VA will accommodate such requests if practicable. The initial office case review requirement may be expanded by VA if acceptable performance has not been demonstrated. After satisfaction of the initial office case review requirement, routine reviews of SAPP cases will be made by VA staff based upon quality control procedures established by the Undersecretary for Benefits. Such review will be made on a random sampling or performance related basis.

      (4) Certifications required from the servicer will be specified with particularity in the separate instructions issued by the Secretary, as noted in § 36.4348(b).

      (b)  The Secretary will publish separate instructions for processing appraisals under the Servicer Appraisal Processing Program. Compliance with these regulations and the separate instructions issued by the Secretary is deemed by VA to be the minimum exercise of due diligence in processing SAPP cases. Due diligence is considered by VA to represent that care, as is to be properly expected from, and ordinarily exercised by, a reasonable and prudent servicer who would be dependent on the property as security to protect its investment.

      (c)  The amount of authority to upwardly adjust the fee appraiser's estimated market value during the servicer staff appraisal reviewer's initial review of the appraisal report or to subsequently process an appeal of the servicer's established reasonable value will be specified in the separate instructions issued by VA as noted in § 36.4348(b). The amount specified must not in any way be considered an administrative adjustment figure which may be applied indiscriminately and without valid basis or justification.

      (1)  Any adjustment during the staff appraisal reviewer's initial review of the appraisal report must be fully and clearly justified in writing on the appraisal report form or, if necessary, on an addendum. The basis for the adjustment must be adequate and reasonable by professional appraisal standards. If real estate market or other valid data was utilized in arriving at the decision to make the adjustment, such data must be attached to the appraisal report. All adjustments, comments, corrections, justifications, etc., to the appraisal report must be made in a contrasting color, be clearly legible, and signed and dated by the staff appraisal reviewer.

      (2)  The authority provided under 38 U.S.C. 3731(d) which permits a lender to obtain a VA fee panel appraiser's report which VA is obligated to consider in an appeal of the established reasonable value shall not apply to cases processed under the authority provided by this section. All appeals of VA fee appraiser's estimated market values or servicer's reasonable value determinations above the amount specified in the separate instructions issued by VA must be submitted, along with the servicer's recommendations, if any, to VA for processing and final determination. Unless otherwise authorized in the separate instructions servicers must also submit appeals, regardless of the amount, to VA in all cases where the staff appraisal reviewer has made an adjustment during their initial review of the appraisal report to the fee appraiser's market value estimate. The fee appraiser's estimated market value or servicer's reasonable value determination may be increased only when such increase is clearly warranted and fully supported by real estate market or other valid data considered adequate and reasonable by professional appraisal standards and the servicer's staff appraisal reviewer clearly and fully justifies the reasoning and basis for the increase in writing on the appraisal report form or an addendum. The staff appraisal reviewer must date and sign the written justification and must cite within it the data used in arriving at the decision to make the increase. All such data shall be attached to the appraisal report form and any addendum.

      (d)  When the Secretary has incurred a loss as a result of a payment of claim under guaranty and in which the Secretary determines an increase made by the servicer under § 36.4348(c) was unwarranted, or arbitrary and capricious, the lender shall indemnify the Secretary to the extent the Secretary determines such loss was caused or increased, by the increase in value.

      (e)  A servicer affiliated with a real estate firm, builder, land developer or escrow agent as a subsidiary division, or in any other entity in which it has a financial interest or which it owns may not use the authority for any cases involving the affiliate unless the servicer demonstrates to the Secretary's satisfaction that the servicer and its affiliate(s) are essentially separate entities that operate independently of each other, free of all cross-influences (e.g., a formal corporate agreement exists which specifically sets forth this fact).

      (f)  The servicer must have an effective self-policing or quality control system to ensure the adequacy and quality of their SAPP staff appraisal reviewer's processing and, that its activities do not deviate from high standards of integrity. The quality control system must include frequent, periodic audits that specifically address the appraisal review activity. These audits may be performed by an independent party, or by the servicer's independent internal audit division which reports directly to the firm's chief executive officer. The servicer must agree to furnish findings and information under this system to VA on demand. While the quality control personnel need not be appraisers, they should have basic familiarity with appraisal theory and techniques and the ability to prescribe appropriate corrective action(s) in the appraisal review process when discrepancies or problems are identified. The basic elements of the system will be described in separate instructions issued by the Secretary. Copies of the lender's quality control plan or self-policing system evidencing appraisal related matters must be provided to the VA office of jurisdiction with the servicer's application of SAPP authority.

      (g)  The Secretary will require servicers to pay a $100.00 application fee for each SAR the servicer nominates for approval. The application fee will also apply if the SAR begins work for another servicer.

      (h)  The authority for a servicer to determine reasonable value may be withdrawn by the Loan Guaranty Officer when proper cause exists. A servicer's authority to make reasonable value determinations shall be withdrawn when the servicer no longer meets the basic requirements for delegating the authority, or when it can be shown that the servicer's reasonable value determinations have not been made in accordance with VA regulations, requirements, guidelines, instructions or applicable laws, or when there is adequate evidence to support reasonable belief by VA that a particular unacceptable act, practice, or performance by the servicer or the servicer's staff has occurred. Such acts, practices, or performance include, but are not limited to: Demonstrated technical incompetence (, conduct which demonstrates an insufficient knowledge of industry accepted appraisal principles, techniques and practices; or the lack of technical competence to review appraisal reports and make value determinations in accordance with those requirements); substantive or repetitive errors (, any error(s) of a nature that would materially or significantly affect the determination of reasonable value or condition of the property; or a number or series of errors that, considered individually, may not significantly impact the determination of reasonable value or property condition, but which when considered in the aggregate would establish that appraisal reviews or SAPP case processing are being performed in a careless or negligent manner), or continued instances of disregard for VA requirements after they have been called to the servicer's attention.

      (1) Withdrawal of authority by the Loan Guaranty Officer may be either for an indefinite or a specified period of time. For any withdrawal longer than 90 days a reapplication for servicer authority to process appraisals under these regulations will be required. Written notice will be provided at least 30 days in advance of withdrawal unless the Government's interests are exposed to immediate risk from the servicer's activities in which case the withdrawal will be effected immediately. The notice will clearly and specifically set forth the basis and grounds for the action. There is no right to a formal hearing to contest the withdrawal of SAPP processing privileges. However, if within 15 days after receiving notice the servicer requests an opportunity to contest the withdrawal, the servicer may submit, in person, in writing, or through a representative, information and argument to the Loan Guaranty Officer in opposition to the withdrawal. The Loan Guaranty Officer will make a recommendation to the Regional Loan Center Director who shall make the determination as to whether the action should be sustained, modified or rescinded. The servicer will be informed in writing of the decision.

      (2) The servicer has the right to appeal the Regional Loan Center Director's decision to the Undersecretary for Benefits. In the event of such an appeal, the Undersecretary for Benefits will review all relevant material concerning the matter and make a determination that shall constitute final agency action. If the servicer's submission of opposition raises a genuine dispute over facts material to the withdrawal of SAPP authority, the servicer will be afforded an opportunity to appear with a representative, submit documentary evidence, present witnesses and confront any witness the Veterans Benefits Administration presents. The Undersecretary for Benefits will appoint a hearing officer or panel to conduct the hearing. When such additional proceedings are necessary, the Undersecretary for Benefits shall base the determination on the facts as found, together with any information and argument submitted by the servicer.

      (3) In actions based upon a conviction or civil judgment, or in which there is no genuine dispute over material facts, the Undersecretary for Benefits shall make a decision on the basis of all the information in the administrative record, including any submission made by the servicer.

      (4) Withdrawal of the SAPP authority will require that VA make subsequent determinations of reasonable value for the servicer. Consequently, VA staff will review each appraisal report and issue a Notice of Value which can then be used by the servicer to compute the net value of properties for liquidation purposes.

      (5) Withdrawal by VA of the servicer's SAPP authority does not prevent VA from also withdrawing automatic processing authority or taking debarment or suspension action based upon the same conduct of the servicer.

      § 36.4349   Waivers, consents, and approvals; when effective.

#### § § 36.4349

      No waiver, consent, or approval required or authorized by the regulations concerning guaranty or insurance of loans to veterans shall be valid unless in writing signed by the Secretary or the subordinate officer to whom authority has been delegated by the Secretary.

      § 36.4350   Servicing procedures for holders.

#### § § 36.4350

      (a)  The holder of a loan guaranteed or insured by the Secretary shall develop and maintain a loan servicing program which follows accepted industry standards for servicing of similar type conventional loans. The loan servicing program established pursuant to this section may employ different servicing approaches to fit individual borrower circumstances and avoid establishing a fixed routine. However, it must incorporate each of the provisions specified in paragraphs (b) through (l) of this section.

      (b)  (1) Loan holders shall establish procedures to provide loan information to borrowers, arrange for individual loan consultations upon request and maintain controls to assure prompt responses to inquiries. One or more of the following means of making information readily available to borrowers is required.

      (i) An office staffed with trained servicing personnel with access to loan account information located within 200 miles of the property.

      (ii) Toll-free telephone service or acceptance of collect telephone calls at an office capable of providing needed information.

      (2) All borrowers must be informed of the system available for obtaining answers to loan inquiries, the office from which the needed information may be obtained, and reminded of the system at least annually.

      (c)  Before February 1st of each calendar year, the holder shall furnish to the borrower a statement of the interest paid and, if applicable, a statement of the taxes disbursed from the escrow account during the preceding year. At the borrower's request, the holder shall furnish a statement of the escrow account sufficient to enable the borrower to reconcile the account.

      (d)  Whenever servicing of a loan guaranteed or insured by the Secretary is transferred from one holder to another, notice of such transfer by both the transferor and transferee, the form and content of such notice, the timing of such notice, the treatment of payments during the period of such transfer, and damages and costs for failure to comply with these requirements shall be governed by the pertinent provisions of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act as administered by the Department of Housing and Urban Development.

      (e)  A holder of a loan guaranteed or insured by the Secretary may collect periodic deposits from the borrower for taxes and/or insurance on the security and maintain a tax and insurance escrow account provided such a requirement is authorized under the terms of the security instruments. In maintaining such accounts, the holder shall comply with the pertinent provisions of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act.

      (f)  In addition to the requirements of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, concerning the duties of the loan servicer to respond to borrower inquiries, to protect the borrower's credit rating during a payment dispute period, and to pay damages and costs for noncompliance, holders shall establish a system for servicing delinquent loans which ensures that prompt action is taken to collect amounts due from borrowers and minimize the number of loans in a default status. The holder's servicing system must include the following:

      (1) An accounting system which promptly alerts servicing personnel when a loan becomes delinquent;

      (2) A collection staff which is trained in techniques of loan servicing and counseling delinquent borrowers to advise borrowers how to cure delinquencies, protect their equity and credit rating and, if the default is insoluble, pursue alternatives to foreclosure;

      (3) Procedural guidelines for individual analysis of each delinquency;

      (4) Instructions and appropriate controls for sending delinquent notices, assessing late charges, handling partial payments, maintaining servicing histories and evaluating repayment proposals;

      (5) Management review procedures for evaluating efforts made to collect the delinquency and the response from the borrower before a decision is made to initiate action to liquidate a loan;

      (6) Procedures for reporting delinquencies of 90 days or more and loan terminations to major consumer credit bureaus as specified by the Secretary and for informing borrowers that such action will be taken; and

      (7) Controls to ensure that all notices required to be given to the Secretary on delinquent loans are provided timely and in such form as the Secretary shall require.

      (g)  (1) Holders shall employ collection techniques which provide flexibility to adapt to the individual needs and circumstances of each borrower. A variety of collection techniques may be used based on the holder's determination of the most effective means of contact with borrowers during various stages of delinquency. However, at a minimum the holder's collection procedures must include the following actions:

      (i) An effort, concurrent with the initial late payment notice to establish contact with the borrower(s) by telephone. When talking with the borrower(s), the holder should attempt to determine why payment was not made and emphasize the importance of remitting loan installments as they come due.

      (ii) A letter to the borrower(s) if payment has not been received within 30 days after it is due and telephone contact could not be made. This letter should emphasize the seriousness of the delinquency and the importance of taking prompt action to resolve the default. It should also notify the borrower(s) that the loan is in default, state the total amount due and advise the borrower(s) how to contact the holder to make arrangements for curing the default.

      (iii) In the event the holder has not established contact with the borrower(s) and has not determined the financial circumstances of the borrower(s) or established a reason for the default or obtained agreement to a repayment plan from the borrower(s), then a face-to-face interview with the borrower(s) or a reasonable effort to arrange such a meeting is required.

      (iv)(A) A letter to the borrower if payment has not been received:

      () In the case of a default occurring within the first 6 months following loan closing or the execution of a modification agreement pursuant to § 36.43_1_5, within 45 calendar days after such payment was due; or

      () In the case of any other default, within 75 calendar days after such payment was due.

      (B) The letter required by paragraph (g)(1)(iv)(A) must be mailed no later than 7 calendar days after the payment is delinquent for the time period stated in paragraph (g)(1)(iv)(A) and shall:

      () Provide the borrower with a toll-free telephone number and, if available, an e-mail address for contacting the servicer;

      () Explain loss mitigation options available to the borrower;

      () Emphasize that the intent of servicing is to retain home ownership whenever possible; and

      () Contain the following language:

      (2) The holder must provide a valid explanation of any failure to perform these collection actions when reporting loan defaults to the Secretary. A pattern of such failure may be a basis for sanctions under 2 CFR parts 180 and 801.

      (h)  When personal contact with the borrower(s) is established, the holder shall solicit sufficient information to properly evaluate the prospects for curing the default and whether the granting of forbearance or other relief assistance would be appropriate. At a minimum, the holder must make a reasonable effort to establish the following:

      (1) The reason for the default and whether the reason is a temporary or permanent condition;

      (2) The present income and employment of the borrower(s);

      (3) The current monthly expenses of the borrower(s) including household and debt obligations;

      (4) The current mailing address and telephone number of the borrower(s); and

      (5) A realistic and mutually satisfactory arrangement for curing the default.

      (i)  (1) The holder shall make an inspection of the property securing the loan whenever it becomes aware that the physical condition of the security may be in jeopardy. Unless a repayment agreement is in effect, a property inspection shall also be made at the following times:

      (i) Before the 60th day of delinquency or before initiating action to liquidate a loan, whichever is earlier; and

      (ii) At least once each month after liquidation proceedings have been started unless servicing information shows the property remains owner-occupied.

      (2) Whenever a holder obtains information which indicates that the property securing the loan is abandoned, it shall make appropriate arrangements to protect the property from vandalism and the elements. Thereafter, the holder shall schedule inspections at least monthly to prevent unnecessary deterioration due to vandalism, or neglect. With respect to any loan more than 60 calendar days delinquent, if the property is abandoned, this fact must be reported to the Secretary as required in § 36.4317(c)(10) and immediate action should be initiated by the servicer to terminate the loan once the abandonment has been confirmed.

      (j)  The holder shall maintain individual file records of collection action on delinquent loans and make such records available to the Secretary for inspection on request. Such collection records shall show:

      (1) The dates and content of letters and notices which were mailed to the borrower(s);

      (2) Dated summaries of each personal servicing contact and the result of same;

      (3) The indicated reason(s) for default; and

      (4) The date and result of each property inspection.

      (k)  No later than 180 days after the effective date of this regulation, each loan holder shall establish internal controls to periodically assess the quality of the servicing performed on loans guaranteed by the Secretary and assure that all requirements of this section are being met. Those procedures must provide for a review of the holder's servicing activities at least annually and include an evaluation of delinquency and foreclosure rates on loans in its portfolio which are guaranteed by the Secretary. As part of its evaluation of delinquency and foreclosure rates, the holder shall:

      (1) Collect and maintain appropriate data on delinquency and foreclosure rates to enable the holder to evaluate effectiveness of its collection efforts;

      (2) Determine how its VA delinquency and foreclosure rates compare with rates in reports published by the industry, investors and others; and,

      (3) Analyze significant variances between its foreclosure and delinquency rates and those found in available reports and publications and take appropriate corrective action.

      (l)  Holders shall provide available statistical data on delinquency and foreclosure rates and their analysis of such data to the Secretary upon request.

      § 36.4351   Minimum property and construction requirements.

#### § § 36.4351

      No loan for the purchase or construction of residential property shall be eligible for guaranty or insurance unless such property complies or conforms with those standards of planning, construction, and general acceptability that may be applicable thereto and prescribed by the Secretary pursuant to 38 U.S.C. 3704(a) or 38 U.S.C. 3710(b)(4), or both such sections, as applicable.

> [79 FR 2101, Jan. 13, 2014]

      § 36.4352   Authority to close loans on the automatic basis.

#### § § 36.4352

      (a)  Supervised lenders of the classes described in 38 U.S.C. 3702(d)(1) and (2) are authorized by statute to process VA guaranteed home loans on the automatic basis. This category of lenders includes any Federal land bank, national bank, State bank, private bank, building and loan association, insurance company, credit union or mortgage and loan company that is subject to examination and supervision by an agency of the United States or of any State or by any State.

      (b)  Non-supervised lenders of the class described in 38 U.S.C. 3702(d)(3) must apply to the Secretary for authority to process loans on the automatic basis. Each of the minimum requirements listed below must be met by applicant lenders.

      (1)  The applicant lender must meet one of the following experience requirements:

      (i) The applicant lender must have been actively engaged in originating VA loans for at least two years, have a VA Lender ID number and have originated and closed a minimum of ten VA loans within the past two years, excluding interest rate reduction refinance loans (IRRRLs), that have been properly documented and submitted in compliance with VA requirements and procedures; or

      (ii) The applicant lender must have a VA ID number and, if active for less than two years, have originated and closed at least 25 VA loans, excluding IRRRLs, that have been properly documented and submitted in compliance with VA requirements and procedures; or

      (iii) Each principal officer of the applicant lender, who is actively involved in managing origination functions, must have a minimum of two recent years' management experience in the origination of VA loans. This experience may be with the current or prior employer. For the purposes of this requirement, principal officer is defined as president or vice president; or

      (iv) If the applicant lender has been operating as an agent for a non-supervised automatic lender (sponsoring lender), the firm must submit documentation confirming that it has a VA Lender ID number and has originated a minimum of ten VA loans, excluding IRRRLs, over the past two years. If active for less than two years, the agent must have originated at least 25 VA loans. The required documentation is a copy of the VA letter approving the applicant lender as an agent for the sponsoring lender; a copy of the corporate resolution, describing the functions the agent was to perform, submitted to VA by the sponsoring lender; and a letter from a senior officer of the sponsoring lender indicating the number of VA loans submitted by the agent each year and that the loans have been properly documented and submitted in compliance with VA requirements and procedures.

      (2)  A senior officer of the applicant lender must nominate a full-time qualified employee(s) to act in the applicant lender's behalf as underwriter(s) to personally review and make underwriting decisions on VA loans to be closed on the automatic basis.

      (i) Nominees for underwriter must have a minimum of three years experience in processing, pre-underwriting or underwriting mortgage loans. At least one recent year of this experience must have included making underwriting decisions on VA loans. (Recent is defined as within the past three years.) A VA nomination and current resume, outlining the underwriter's specific experience with VA loans, must be submitted for each underwriter nominee.

      (ii) Alternatively, if an underwriter does not have the experience outlined above, the underwriter must submit documentation verifying that he or she is a current Accredited Residential Underwriter (ARU) as designated by the Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA).

      (iii) If an underwriter is not located in the lender's corporate office, then a senior officer must certify that the underwriter reports to and is supervised by an individual who is not a branch manager or other person with production responsibilities.

      (iv) All VA-approved underwriters must attend a 1-day (eight-hour) training course on underwriter responsibilities, VA underwriting requirements, and VA administrative requirements, including the usage of VA forms, within 90 days of approval (if VA is unable to make such training available within 90 days, the underwriter must attend the first available training). Immediately upon approval of a VA underwriter, the office of jurisdiction will contact the underwriter to schedule this training at a VA regional office (VARO) of the underwriter's choice. This training is required for all newly approved VA underwriters, including those who qualified for approval based on an ARU designation, as well as VA-approved underwriters who have not underwritten VA-guaranteed loans in the past 24 months. Furthermore, and at the discretion of any VARO in whose jurisdiction the lender is originating VA loans, VA-approved underwriters who consistently approve loans that do not meet VA credit standards may be required to retake this training.

      (3)  The lender must certify that all underwriting decisions as to whether to accept or reject a VA loan will be made by a VA-approved underwriter. In addition each VA-approved underwriter will be required to certify on each VA loan that he or she approves that the loan has been personally reviewed and approved by the underwriter.

      (4)  Each application must include the most recent annual financial statement audited and certified by a certified public accountant (CPA). If the date of the annual financial statement precedes that of the application by more than six months, the lender must also attach a copy of its latest internal financial statement. Lenders are required to meet either the working capital or the minimum net worth financial requirement as defined below.

      (i)  A minimum of $50,000 in working capital must be demonstrated.

      (A) Working capital is a measure of an applicant lender's liquidity, or the ability to pay its short-term debts. Working capital is defined as the excess of current assets over current liabilities. Current assets are defined as cash or other liquid assets convertible into cash within a 1-year period. Current liabilities are defined as debts that must be paid within the same 1-year time frame.

      (B) The VA determination of whether a lender has the required minimum working capital is based on the balance sheet of the lender's annual audited financial statement. Therefore, either the balance sheet must be classified to distinguish between current and fixed assets and between current and long-term liabilities or the information must be provided in a footnote to the statement.

      (ii)  Lenders must show evidence of a minimum of $ 250,000 in adjusted net worth. Net worth is a measure of an applicant lender's solvency, or its ability to exist in the long run, quantified by the payment of long-term debts. Net worth as defined by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) is total assets minus total liabilities. Adjusted net worth for VA purposes is the same as the adjusted net worth required by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), net worth less certain unacceptable assets including:

      (A) Any assets of the lender pledged to secure obligations of another person or entity.

      (B) Any asset due from either officers or stockholders of the lender or related entities, in which the lender's officers or stockholders have a personal interest, unrelated to their position as an officer or stockholder.

      (C) Any investment in related entities in which the lender's officers or stockholders have a personal interest unrelated to their position as an officer or stockholder.

      (D) That portion of an investment in joint ventures, subsidiaries, affiliates and/or other related entities which is carried at a value greater than equity, as adjusted. “Equity as adjusted” means the book value of the related entity reduced by the amount of unacceptable assets carried by the related entity.

      (E) All intangibles, such as goodwill, covenants not to compete, franchisee fees, organization costs, etc., except unamortized servicing costs carried at a value established by an arm's-length transaction and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

      (F) That portion of an asset not readily marketable and for which appraised values are very subjective, carried at a value in excess of a substantially discounted appraised value. Assets such as antiques, art work and gemstones are subject to this provision and should be carried at the lower of cost or market.

      (G) Any asset that is principally used for the personal enjoyment of an officer or stockholder and not for normal business purposes. Adjusted net worth must be calculated by a CPA using an audited and certified balance sheet from the lender's latest financial statements. “Personal interest” as used in this section indicates a relationship between the lender and a person or entity in which that specified person (e.g., spouse, parent, grandparent, child, brother, sister, aunt, uncle or in-law) has a financial interest in or is employed in a management position by the lender.

      (5)  The lender applicant must have one or more lines of credit aggregating at least $ 1 million. The identity of the source(s) of warehouse lines of credit must be submitted to VA and the applicant must agree that VA may contact the named source(s) for the purpose of verifying the information. A line of credit must be unrestricted, that is, funds are available upon demand to close loans and are not dependent on prior investor approval. A letter from the company(ies) verifying the unrestricted line(s) of credit must be submitted with the application for automatic authority.

      (6)  If the lender customarily sells loans it originates, it must have a minimum of two permanent investors. The names, addresses and telephone numbers of the permanent investors must be submitted with the application.

      (7)  The lender applicant must designate an employee and an alternate to be the primary liaison with VA. The liaison officers should be thoroughly familiar with the lender's entire operation and be able to respond to any query from VA concerning a particular VA loan or the firm's automatic authority.

      (8)  All applications will also be reviewed in light of the following considerations:

      (i) There must be no factors that indicate that the firm would not exercise the care and diligence required of a lender originating and closing VA loans on the automatic basis; and

      (ii) In the event the applicant lender, any member of the board of directors, or any principal officer has ever been debarred or suspended by any Federal agency or department, or any of its directors or officers has been a director or officer of any other lender or corporation that was so debarred or suspended, or if the lender applicant ever had a servicing contract with an investor terminated for cause, a statement of the facts must be submitted with the application for automatic authority.

      (9)  In order to be approved as a non-supervised lender for automatic-processing authority, the lender must implement a written quality control system which ensures compliance with VA requirements. The lender must agree to furnish findings under its systems to VA on demand. The elements of the quality control system must include the following:

      (i)  Each office of the lender shall maintain copies of VA credit standards and all available VA underwriting guidelines.

      (ii)  The system should ensure that effective corrective measures are taken promptly when deficiencies in loan originations are identified by either the lender or VA. Any cases involving major discrepancies which are discovered under the system must be reported to VA.

      (iii)  The quality control system should be independent of the mortgage loan production function.

      (iv)  The review of underwriting decisions and certifications must include compliance with VA underwriting requirements, sufficiency of documentation and soundness of underwriting judgments.

      (v)  For lenders approved for the Lender Appraisal Processing Program (LAPP), the quality control system must specifically contain provisions concerning the adequacy and quality of real property appraisals. While the lender's quality control personnel need not be appraisers, they should have basic familiarity with appraisal theory and techniques so that they can select appropriate cases for review if discretionary sampling is used, and prescribe appropriate corrective action(s) in the appraisal review process when discrepancies or problems are identified. Copies of the lender's quality control plan or self-policing system evidencing appraisal related matters must be provided to the VA office of jurisdiction.

      (10)  The lender applicant must certify to VA that it will not close loans on an automatic basis as a courtesy or accommodation for other mortgage lenders, whether or not such lenders are themselves approved to close on an automatic basis without the express approval of VA. However, a lender with automatic authority may close loans for which information and supporting credit data have been developed on its behalf by a duly authorized agent.

      (11)  Lenders meeting these requirements will be approved to close VA loans on an automatic basis for a 1-year period. At the end of this period, the lender's quality of underwriting, the completeness of loan submissions, compliance with VA requirements and procedures, and the delinquency and foreclosure rates will be reviewed.

      (12)  When a lender wants its automatic authority extended to another State, the request must be submitted, with the fee designated in paragraph (e)(5) of this section, to the VA regional office having jurisdiction in the State where the lender's corporate office is located.

      (i) When a lender wants its automatic authority to include loans involving a real estate brokerage and/or a residential builder or developer in which it has a financial interest, owns, is owned by, or with which it is affiliated, the following documentation must be submitted:

      (A) A corporate resolution from the lender and each affiliate indicating that they are separate entities operating independently of each other. The lender's corporate resolution must indicate that it will not give more favorable underwriting consideration to its affiliate's loans, and the affiliate's corporate resolution must indicate that it will not seek to influence the lender to give their loans more favorable underwriting consideration.

      (B) Letters from permanent investors indicating the percentage of all VA loans based on the affiliate's production originated by the lender over a 1-year period that are past due 90 days or more. This delinquency ratio must be no higher than the national average for the same period for all mortgage loans.

      (ii) When a lender wants its automatic authority extended to additional States, the lender must indicate how it plans to originate VA loans in those States. Unless a lender proposes a telemarketing plan, VA requires that a lender have a presence in the State, that is, a branch office, an agent relationship, or that it is a reasonable distance from one of its offices in an adjacent State, , 50 miles. If the request is based on an agency relationship, the documentation outlined in paragraph (b)(13) must be submitted with the request for extension.

      (13)  A lender using an agent to perform a portion of the work involved in originating and closing a VA-guaranteed loan on an automatic basis must take full responsibility by certification for all acts, errors and omissions of the agent or other entity and its employees for the work performed. Any such acts, errors or omissions will be treated as those of the lender and appropriate sanctions may be imposed against the lender and its agent. Lenders requesting an agent must submit the following documentation to the VA regional office having jurisdiction for the lender's corporate office:

      (i) A corporate resolution certifying that the lender takes full responsibility for all acts, errors and omissions of the agent that it is requesting. The corporate resolution must also identify the agent's name and address, and the geographic area in which the agent will be originating and/or closing VA loans; whether the agent is authorized to issue interest rate lock-in agreements on behalf of the lender; and outline the functions the agent is to perform. Alternatively, the lender may submit a blanket corporate resolution which sets forth the functions of any and all agents and identifies individual agents by name, address, and geographic area in separate letters which refer to the blanket resolution.

      (ii) When the VA regional office having jurisdiction for the lender's corporate office acknowledges receipt of the lender's request in writing, the agent is thereby authorized to originate VA loans on the lender's behalf.

      (c)  A lender approved to close loans on the automatic basis who subsequently fails to meet the requirements of this section must report to VA the circumstances surrounding the deficiency and the remedial action to be taken to cure it. Failure to advise VA in a timely manner could result in a lender's loss of its approval to close VA loans on the automatic basis.

      (d)  Non-supervised lenders of the class described in 38 U.S.C. 3702(d)(3) must be recertified annually for authority to process loans on the automatic basis. The following minimum annual recertification requirements must be met by each lender approved for automatic authority:

      (1)  A lender must submit, within 120 days following the end of its fiscal year, an audited and certified financial statement with a classified balance sheet or a separate footnote for adjusted net worth to VA Central Office (264) for review. The same minimum financial requirements described in § 36.4352(b)(5) must be maintained and verified annually in order to be recertified for automatic authority.

      (2)  The VA regional office having jurisdiction for the lender's corporate office will mail an annual notice to the lender requesting current information on the lender's personnel and operation. The lender is required to complete the form and return it with the appropriate annual renewal fees to the VA regional office.

      (e)  To participate as a VA automatic lender, non-supervised lenders of the class described in 38 U.S.C. 3702(d)(3) shall pay fees as follows:

      (1) $500 for new applications;

      (2) $200 for reinstatement of lapsed or terminated automatic authority;

      (3) $100 for each underwriter approval;

      (4) $100 for each agent approval;

      (5) A minimum fee of $100 for any other VA administrative action pertaining to a lender's status as an automatic lender;

      (6) $200 annually for certification of home offices; and

      (7) $100 annually for each agent renewal.

      (f)  Supervised lenders of the classes described in paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) of 38 U.S. Code 3702 participating in VA's Loan Guaranty Program shall pay fees as follows:

      (1) $100 fee for each agent approval; and

      (2) $100 annually for each agent renewal.

      (g)  Lenders participating in VA's Lender Appraisal Processing Program shall pay a fee of $100 for approval of each staff appraisal reviewer.

      § 36.4353   Withdrawal of authority to close loans on the automatic basis.

#### § § 36.4353

      (a)(1) As provided in 38 U.S.C. 3702(e), the authority of any lender to close loans on the automatic basis may be withdrawn by the Secretary at any time upon 30 days notice. The automatic processing authority of both supervised and non-supervised lenders may be withdrawn for engaging in practices which are imprudent from a lending standpoint or which are prejudicial to the interests of veterans or the Government but are of a lesser degree than would warrant complete suspension or debarment of the lender from participation in the program.

      (2) Automatic-processing authority may be withdrawn at any time for failure to meet basic qualifying and/or annual recertification criteria.

      (i)  (A) Automatic authority may be withdrawn for lack of a VA-approved underwriter, failure to maintain $50,000 in working capital or $250,000 in adjusted net worth, or failure to file required financial information.

      (B) During the 1-year probationary period for newly approved lenders, automatic authority may be temporarily or permanently withdrawn for any of the reasons set forth in this section regardless of whether deficiencies previously have been brought to the attention of the probationary lender.

      (ii)  Automatic authority will be withdrawn for loss of status as an entity subject to examination and supervision by a Federal or State supervisory agency as required by 38 U.S.C. 3702(d).

      (3) Automatic processing authority may also be withdrawn for any of the causes for debarment set forth in 2 CFR parts 180 and 801.

      (b) Authority to close loans on the automatic basis may also be temporarily withdrawn for a period of time under the following schedule.

      (1) Withdrawal for 60 days may occur when:

      (i) Automatic loan submissions show deficiencies in credit underwriting, such as use of unstable sources of income to qualify the borrower, ignoring significant adverse credit items affecting the applicant's creditworthiness, etc., after such deficiencies have been repeatedly called to the lender's attention;

      (ii) Employment or deposit verifications are handcarried by applicants or otherwise improperly permitted to pass through the hands of a third party;

      (iii) Automatic loan submissions are consistently incomplete after such deficiencies have been repeatedly called to the lender's attention by VA; or

      (iv) There are continued instances of disregard of VA requirements after they have been called to the lender's attention.

      (2) Withdrawal for 180 days may occur when:

      (i) Loans are closed automatically which conflict with VA credit standards and which would not have been made by a lender acting prudently;

      (ii) The lender fails to disclose to VA significant obligations or other information so material to the veteran's ability to repay the loan that undue risk to the Government results;

      (iii) Employment or deposit verifications are allowed to be handcarried by applicant or otherwise mishandled, resulting in the submission of significant misinformation to VA;

      (iv) Substantiated complaints are received that the lender misrepresented VA requirements to veterans to the detriment of their interests (e.g., veteran was dissuaded from seeking a lower interest rate based on lender's incorrect advice that such options were precluded by VA requirements);

      (v) Closing documentation shows instances of improper charges to the veteran after the impropriety of such charges has been called to the lender's attention by VA, or refusal to refund such charges after notification by VA; or

      (vi) There are other instances of lender actions which are prejudicial to the interests of veterans such as deliberate delays in scheduling loan closings.

      (3) Withdrawal for a period of from one year to three years may occur when:

      (i) The lender fails to properly disburse loans (e.g., loan disbursement checks returned due to insufficient funds);

      (ii) There is involvement by the lender in the improper use of a veteran's entitlement (e.g., knowingly permitting the veteran to violate occupancy requirements, lender involvement in sale of veteran's entitlement, etc.).

      (4) A continuation of actions that have led to previous withdrawal of automatic authority justifies withdrawal of automatic authority for the next longer period of time.

      (5) Withdrawal of automatic processing authority does not prevent a lender from processing VA guaranteed loans on the prior approval basis.

      (6) Action by VA to remove a lender's automatic authority does not prevent VA from also taking debarment or suspension action based on the same conduct by the lender.

      (7) VA field facilities are authorized to withdraw automatic privileges for 60 days, based on any of the violations set forth in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(3) of this section, for non-supervised lenders without operations in other stations' jurisdictions. All determinations regarding withdrawal of automatic authority for longer periods of time or multi-jurisdictional lenders must be made in Central Office.

      (c) VA will provide 30 days notice of a withdrawal of automatic authority in order to enable the lender to either close or obtain prior approval for a loan on which processing has begun. There is no right to a formal hearing to contest the withdrawal of automatic processing privileges. However, if within 15 days after receiving notice the lender requests an opportunity to contest the withdrawal, the lender may submit in person, in writing, or through a representative, information and argument in opposition to the withdrawal.

      (d) If the lender's submission in opposition raises a dispute over facts material to the withdrawal of automatic authority, the lender will be afforded an opportunity to appear with a representative, submit documentary evidence, present witnesses, and confront any witnesses VA presents. The Under Secretary for Benefits will appoint a hearing officer or panel to conduct the hearing.

      (e) A transcribed record of the proceedings shall be made available at cost to the lender, upon request, unless the requirement for a transcript is waived by mutual agreement.

      (f) In actions based upon a conviction or civil judgment, or in which there is no genuine dispute over material facts, the Under Secretary for Benefits shall make a decision on the basis of all the information in the administrative record, including any submission made by the lender.

      (g) In actions in which additional proceedings are necessary to determine disputed material facts, written findings of fact will be prepared by the hearing officer or panel. The Under Secretary for Benefits shall base the decision on the facts as found, together with any information and argument submitted by the lender and any other information in the administrative record.

      § 36.4354   Estate of veteran in real property.

#### § § 36.4354

      (a) The title of the estate in the realty acquired by the veteran, wholly or partly with the proceeds of a guaranteed or insured loan, or owned by him and on which construction, or repairs, or alterations or improvements are to be made, shall be such as is acceptable to informed buyers, title companies, and attorneys, generally, in the community in which the property is situated, except as modified by paragraph (b) of this section. Such estate shall be not less than:

      (1) A fee simple estate therein, legal or equitable; or

      (2) A leasehold estate running or renewable at the option of the lessee for a period of not less than 14 years from the maturity of the loan, or to any earlier date at which the fee simple title will vest in the lessee, which is assignable or transferable, if the same be subjected to the lien; however, a leasehold estate which is not freely assignable and transferable will be considered an acceptable estate if it is determined by the Under Secretary for Benefits, or the Executive Director, Loan Guaranty Service:

      (i) That such type of leasehold is customary in the area where the property is located,

      (ii) That a veteran or veterans will be prejudiced if the requirement for free assignability is adhered to; and

      (iii) That the assignability and other provisions applicable to the leasehold estate are sufficient to protect the interests of the veteran and the Government and are otherwise acceptable; or

      (3) A life estate, provided that the remainder and reversionary interests are subjected to the lien; or

      (4) A beneficial interest in a revocable Family Living Trust that ensures that the veteran, or veteran and spouse, have an equitable life estate, provided the lien attaches to any remainder interest and the trust arrangement is valid under State law.

      (b) Any such property or estate will not fail to comply with the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section by reason of the following:

      (1) Encroachments;

      (2) Easements;

      (3) Servitudes;

      (4) Reservations for water, timber, or subsurface rights; or

      (5) Sale and lease restrictions:

      (i) Except as to condominiums, the right in any grantor or cotenant in the chain of title, or a successor of either, to purchase for cash, which right was established by an instrument recorded prior to December 1, 1976, and by the terms thereof is exercisable only if:

      (A) An owner elects to sell;

      (B) The option price is not less than the price at which the then owner is willing to sell to another; and

      (C) Exercised within 30 days after notice is mailed by registered mail to the address of optionee last known to the then owner of the then owner's election to sell, stating the price and the identity of the proposed vendee;

      (ii) A condominium estate established by the filing for record of the Master Deed, or other enabling document before December 1, 1976 will not fail to comply with the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section by reason of:

      (A) Prohibition against leasing a unit for a period of less than 6 months.

      (B) The existence of a right of first option to purchase or right to provide a substitute buyer reserved to the condominium association provided such option or right is exercisable only if:

      () An owner elects to sell;

      () The option price is not less than the price at which the then owner is willing to sell to another;

      () The terms and conditions under which the option price is to be paid are identical to or are not less favorable to the owner than the terms and conditions under which the owner was willing to sell to the owner's prospective buyer; and

      () Notice of the association's decision to exercise the option must be mailed to the owner by registered or certified mail within 30 days after notice is mailed by registered or certified mail to the address of the association last known to the owner of the owner's election to sell, stating the price, terms of sale, and the identity of the proposed vendee.

      (iii) Any property subject to a restriction on the owner's right to convey to any party of the owner's choice, which restriction is established by a document recorded on or after December 1, 1976, will not qualify as security for a guaranteed or insured loan. A prohibition or restriction on leasing an individual unit in a condominium will not cause the condominium estate to fail to qualify as security for such loan, provided the restriction is in accordance with § 36.4362(c).

      (iv) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (b)(5)(i), (ii), and (iii) of this section, a property shall not be considered ineligible pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section if:

      (A) The veteran obtained the property under a State or local political subdivision program designed to assist low-or moderate-income purchasers, and as a condition the purchaser must agree to one or more of the following restrictions:

      () If the property is resold within a time period as established by local law or ordinance, after the purchaser acquires title, the purchaser must first offer the property to the government housing agency, or a low-or moderate-income purchaser designated by such agency, provided the option to purchase is exercised within 90 days after notice by the purchaser to the agency of intention to sell.

      () If the property is resold within a time period as established by local law or ordinance after the purchaser acquires title, a governmental agency may specify a maximum price which the veteran may receive for the property upon resale; or

      () Such other restriction approved by the Secretary designed to insure either that a property acquired under such program again be made available to low-or moderate-income purchasers, or to prevent a private purchaser from obtaining a windfall profit on the resale of such property, while assuring that the purchaser has a reasonable opportunity to dispose of the property without undue difficulty at a reasonable price.

      () The sale price of a property under any of the restrictions of paragraph (b)(5)(iv)(A) of this section shall not be less than the lowest of the following: The price designated by the owner as the asking price; the appraised value of the property; or the original purchase price of the property, increased by a factor reflecting all or a reasonable portion of the increased costs of housing or the percentage increase in median income in the area between the date of original purchase and resale, plus the reasonable value or actual costs of any capital improvements made by the owner plus a reasonable real estate commission less the cost of necessary repairs required to place the property in saleable condition; or other reasonable formula approved by the Secretary. The veteran must be fully informed and consent in writing to the housing restrictions. A copy of the veteran's consent statement must be forwarded with the application for home loan guaranty or the report of a home loan processed on the automatic basis.

      (B) A recorded restriction on title designed to provide housing for older persons, provided that the restriction is acceptable under the provisions of the Fair Housing Act, title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, as amended by the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988, 42 U.S.C. 3601  The veteran must be fully informed and consent in writing to the restrictions. A copy of the veteran's consent statement must be forwarded with the application for home loan guaranty or the report of a home loan processed on the automatic basis.

      (6) Building and use restrictions whether or not enforceable by a reverter clause if there has been no breach of the conditions affording a right to an exercise of the reverter;

      (7) Any other covenant, condition, restriction, or limitation approved by the Secretary in the particular case. Such approval shall be a condition precedent to the guaranty or insurance of the loan; , That the limitations on the quantum or quality of the estate or property that are indicated in this paragraph, insofar as they may materially affect the value of the property for the purpose for which it is used, are taken into account in the appraisal of reasonable value required by 38 U.S.C. chapter 37.

      (c) The following limitations on the quantum or quality of the estate or property shall be deemed for the purposes of paragraph (b) of this section to have been taken into account in the appraisal of residential property and determined by the Secretary as not materially affecting the reasonable value of such property:

      (1)

      (i) No violation exists,

      (ii) The proposed use by a veteran does not presage a violation of a condition affording a right of reverter, and

      (iii) Any right of future modification contained in the building or use restrictions is not exercisable, by its own terms, until at least 10 years following the date of the loan.

      (2)  Violations of a restriction based on race, color, creed, or national origin, whether or not such restriction provides for reversion or forfeiture of title or a lien for liquidated damages in the event of a breach.

      (3)  Violations of building or use restrictions of record which have existed for more than 1 year, are not the subject of pending or threatened litigation, and which do not provide for a reversion or termination of title, or condemnation by municipal authorities, or, a lien for liquidated damages which may be superior to the lien of the guaranteed or insured mortgage.

      (4)  (i) Easements for public utilities along one or more of the property lines and easements for drainage or irrigation ditches, provided the exercise of the rights thereof do not interfere with the use of any of the buildings or improvements located on the subject property.

      (ii) Mutual easements for joint driveways located partly on the subject property and partly on adjoining property, provided the agreement is recorded in the public records.

      (iii) Easements for underground conduits which are in place and which do not extend under any buildings in the subject property.

      (5)  (i) On the subject property by improvements on the adjoining property where such encroachments do not exceed 1 foot within the subject boundaries, provided such encroachments do not touch any buildings or interfere with the use or enjoyment of any building or improvement on the subject property.

      (ii) By hedges or removable fences belonging to subject or adjoining property.

      (iii) Not exceeding 1 foot on adjoining property by driveways belonging to subject property, provided there exists a clearance of at least 8 feet between the buildings on the subject property and the property line affected by the encroachment.

      (6)  Variations between the length of the subject property lines as shown on the plot plan or other exhibits submitted to Department of Veterans Affairs and as shown by the record or possession lines, provided such variations do not interfere with the current use of any of the improvements on the subject property and do not involve a deficiency of more than 2 percent with respect to the length of the front line or more than 5 percent with respect to the length of any other line.

      § 36.4355   Loans, first, second, or unsecured.

#### § § 36.4355

      Loans for the purchase of real property or a leasehold estate as limited in the regulations concerning guaranty or insurance of loans to veterans, or for the alteration, improvement, or repair thereof, and for more than $1,500 and more than 40 percent of the reasonable value of such property or estate prior thereto shall be secured by a first lien on the property or estate. Loans for such alteration, improvement, or repairs for more than $1,500 but 40 percent or less of the prior reasonable value of the property shall be secured by a lien reasonable and customary in the community for the type of alteration, improvement, or repair financed. Those for $1,500 or less need not be secured, and in lieu of the title examination the lender may accept a statement from the borrower that he or she has an interest in the property not less than that prescribed in § 36.4354(a).

> [73 FR 6310, Feb. 1, 2008. Redesignated at 75 FR 33705, June 15, 2010, as amended at 80 FR 34319, June 16, 2015]

      § 36.4356   Tax, special assessment and other liens.

#### § § 36.4356

      Tax liens, special assessment liens, and ground rents shall be disregarded with respect to any requirement that loans shall be secured by a lien of specified dignity. With the prior approval of the Secretary, Under Secretary for Benefits, or Executive Director, Loan Guaranty Service, liens retained by nongovernmental entities to secure assessments or charges for municipal type services and facilities clearly within the public purpose doctrine may be disregarded. In determining whether a loan for the purchase or construction of a home is secured by a first lien the Secretary may also disregard a superior lien created by a duly recorded covenant running with the realty in favor of a private entity to secure an obligation to such entity for the homeowner's share of the costs of the management, operation, or maintenance of property, services or programs within and for the benefit of the development or community in which the veteran's realty is located, if the Secretary determines that the interests of the veteran-borrower and of the Government will not be prejudiced by the operation of such covenant. In respect to any such superior lien to be created after June 6, 1969, the Secretary's determination must have been made prior to the recordation of the covenant.

      § 36.4357   Combination residential and business property.

#### § § 36.4357

      If otherwise eligible, a loan for the purchase or construction of a combination of residential property and business property which the veteran proposes to occupy in part as a home will be eligible under 38 U.S.C. 3710, if the property is primarily for residential purposes and no more than one business unit is included in the property.

      § 36.4358   [Reserved]

#### § § 36.4358

      § 36.4359   Supplemental loans.

#### § § 36.4359

      (a) Any loan for the alteration, repair, improvement, extension, replacement, or expansion of a home, with respect to which a guaranteed or insured obligation of the borrower is currently outstanding, may be reported for guaranty or insurance coverage, if such loan is made by the holder of the currently outstanding obligation, notwithstanding the fact no guaranty entitlement remains available to the borrower; , that if no entitlement remains available the maximum amount payable on the revised guaranty shall not exceed the amount payable on the original guaranty on the date of closing the supplemental loan, and the percentage of guaranty shall be based upon the proportion the said maximum amount bears to the aggregate indebtedness, or, in the case of an insured loan, no additional credit to the holder's insurance account may be made:  further, that the prior approval of the Secretary shall be required if:

      (1) The loan will be made by a lender who is not the holder of the currently guaranteed or insured obligation; or

      (2) The loan will be made by a lender not of a class specified in 38 U.S.C. 3702(d); or

      (3) An obligor liable on the currently outstanding obligation will be released from personal liability.

      (b) In any case in which the unpaid balance of the prior loan currently outstanding is combined or consolidated with the amount of the supplemental loan, the entire aggregate indebtedness shall be repayable in full within the maximum maturity currently prescribed by statute for the original loan. No supplemental loan for the repair, alteration, or improvement of residential property will be eligible for guaranty or insurance unless such repair, alteration, or improvement substantially protects or improves the basic livability or utility of the property involved.

      (c) Such loans shall be secured as required in § 36.4355: , that a lien of lesser dignity than therein specified will suffice if the lien obtained is immediately junior to the lien of the original guaranteed or insured obligation: , that the liens of successive supplemental loans may be of lesser dignity so long as they are immediately junior to the lien of the last previous guaranteed or insured obligation having a lien of required dignity.

      (d) Upon providing or extending guaranty or insurance coverage in respect to any such supplemental loan, the rights of the Secretary to the proceeds of the sale of security shall be subordinate to the right of the holder to satisfy therefrom the indebtedness outstanding on the original and supplemental loans.

The loan must also conform to the otherwise applicable provisions of the regulations concerning the guaranty or insurance of loans to veterans. Sections 36.4357, 36.4359, and 36.4369 shall not be applicable.

Whenever used in 38 U.S.C. chapter 37 or this subpart, unless the context otherwise requires, the terms defined in this paragraph shall have the meaning stated.

      (1)  Affiliate of declarant means any person or entity which controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with, a declarant.

      (i) A person or entity shall be considered to control a declarant if that person or entity is a general partner, officer, director, or employee of the declarant who:

      (2)  Unless otherwise provided by State law, a condominium is a form of ownership in which the buyer receives title to a three dimensional air space containing the individual living unit together with an undivided interest or share in the ownership of common elements (restatement of § 36.4301, Condominium).

      (3)  Condominium projects not originally built and sold as condominiums but subsequently converted to the condominium form of ownership.

      (4)  Any person who has executed a declaration or an amendment to a declaration to add additional real estate to the project or any successors or assigns of the declarant who offers to sell or sells units in the condominium project and who assumes declarant rights in the project including the right to: Add, convert or withdraw real estate from the condominium project; maintain sales offices, management offices and rental units; exercise easements through the common elements for the purpose of making improvements within the condominium; or exercise control of the owner's association. Declarant is further defined as any sponsor of a project or affiliate of the declarant who is acting on behalf of or exercising the rights of the declarant.

      (5)  A condominium in which all onsite or offsite improvements were completed or the conversion was completed prior to appraisal by the Department of Veterans Affairs, but the declarant is in control of the owners' association and/or is currently marketing units for initial transfer to individual unit owners.

      (6)  A condominium in which all onsite or offsite improvements were completed, or the conversion was completed prior to appraisal by the Department of Veterans Affairs, and the declarant is no longer in control of the owners' association and/or marketing units for initial transfer to individual unit owners.

      (7)  A project which may be increased in size by the declarant. An expandable condominium is constructed in phases (or stages). After each phase is completed and constituted, the common estates are merged. Each unit owner, thereby, gains an individual interest in all of the facilities of the common estate.

      (8)  Foreclosure shall mean the termination of a lien by either judicial or nonjudicial procedures in accordance with local law or the voluntary transfer of property by a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure or similar procedures.

      (10)  A condominium project in which generally no part of a living unit extends over or under another living unit.

      (11)  A condominium project in which all or a part of a living unit extends over or under another living unit, e.g., garden apartment or walk-up project.

      (12)  A condominium project that is to be constructed or is under construction. In the case of a condominium conversion, the declarant proposes to convert a building or buildings to the condominium form of ownership, or the declarant is in the process of converting the building or buildings to the condominium form of ownership.

      (13)  A number of adjoining but separately constituted condominiums. An association of owners is established for each project, and each association is responsible for maintenance and upkeep of the common elements in its own project. Cross-easements between the separate condominiums may be created to permit members of the separate condominiums to use the common areas of the other condominiums.

      (c)  Prior to Department of Veterans Affairs guaranty of an individual unit loan in a condominium, the legal documentation establishing the condominium project or development must be approved by the Secretary.

      § 36.4361   Acceptable ownership arrangements and documentation.

#### § § 36.4361

      (a)  The following types of basic ownership arrangements are generally acceptable provided they are established in compliance with the applicable condominium law of the jurisdiction(s) in which the condominium is located:

      (1) Ownership of units by individual owners coupled with an undivided interest in all common elements.

      (2) Ownership of units by individual owners coupled with an undivided interest in general common elements and specified limited common elements.

      (3) Individual ownership of units coupled with an undivided interest in the general common elements and/or limited common elements, with title to additional property for common use vested in an association of unit owners, with mandatory membership by unit owners or owners' associations. Any such arrangement must not be precluded by applicable State law.

      (b)  The legal estate of each unit owner must comply with the provisions of § 36.4354. The declaration or equivalent document shall allocate an undivided interest in the common elements to each unit. Such interest may be allocated equally to each unit, may be proportionate to that unit's relative size or value, or may be allocated according to any other specified criteria provided that the method chosen is equitable and reasonable for that condominium.

      (c) —(1)  The declaration, bylaws and other enabling documentation shall conform to the laws governing the establishment and maintenance of condominium regimes within the jurisdiction in which the condominium is located, and to all other laws which apply to the condominium.

      (2)  The declaration and all amendments or modifications thereof shall be placed of record in the manner prescribed by the appropriate jurisdiction. If recording of plats, plans, or bylaws or equivalent documents and all amendments or modifications thereof is the prevailing practice or is required by law within the jurisdiction where the project is located, then such documents shall be placed of record. If the bylaws are not recorded, then covenants, restrictions and other matters requiring record notice should be contained in the declaration or equivalent document.

      (3)  The owner's association shall be required to make available to unit owners, lenders and the holders, insurers and guarantors of the first mortgage on any unit, current copies of the declaration, bylaws and other rules governing the condominium, and other books, records and financial statements of the owners' association. The owners' association also shall be required to make available to prospective purchasers current copies of the declaration, bylaws, other rules governing the condominium, and the most recent annual audited financial statement, if such is prepared. “Available” as used in this paragraph (c)(3) shall at least mean available for inspection, upon request, during normal business hours or under other reasonable circumstances.

      (4)  While the declarant is in control of the owners' association, amendments to the declaration, bylaws or other enabling documentation must be approved by the Secretary. The declarant should have proposed amendments reviewed prior to recordation. This provision does not apply to amendments which annex additional phases to the condominium regime in accordance with a general plan of development (§§ 36.4364(a)(3) and 36.4365(b)(6)).

      (d) —(1)  The description of the units, common elements, any recreational facilities and other related amenities, and any limited common elements shall be clear and in conformity with the law of the jurisdiction where the project is located. Responsibility for maintenance and repair of all portions of the condominium shall be set forth clearly.

      (2)  The declaration or other legally enforceable and binding document must state in a reasonable manner the overall development plan of the condominium, including building types, architectural style and the size of the units for those phases of the condominium which are required to be built. Under the applicable provisions of the declaration or such other legally enforceable and binding document, the development of the required portion of the condominium must be consistent with the overall plan, except that the declarant may reserve the right to change the overall plan or decide not to construct planned units or improvements to the common elements if the declaration sets forth the conditions required to be satisfied prior to the exercise of that right the time within which the right may be exercised, and any other limitations and criteria that would be necessary or appropriate under the particular circumstances. Such conditions, time restraints and other limitations must be reasonable in light of the overall plan for the condominium. In an expandable project, additional phases which are not required to be built may be described in the development plan in very general terms, or the declaration may provide that the declarant makes no assurances concerning the construction, building types, architectural style and size of the units, etc. of these phases. However, the minimum number of units to be built should be that which would be adequate to reasonably support the common elements. (See § 36.4364(a)(6).)

      § 36.4362   Rights and restrictions.

#### § § 36.4362

      (a) —(1)  Any right reserved by the declarant must be reasonable and set forth in the declaration.

      (2)  Binding the owners' association either directly or indirectly to any of the following agreements is not acceptable unless the owners' association shall have a right of termination thereof which is exercisable without penalty at any time after transfer of control, upon not more than 90 days' notice to the other party thereto:

      (i) Any management contract, employment contract or lease of recreational or parking areas or facilities.

      (ii) Any contract or lease, including franchises and licenses, to which a declarant is a party.

      (iii) The requirements of paragraphs (a)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section do not apply to acceptable ground leases.

      (3)  The following rights in the common elements may usually be reserved by the declarant for a reasonable period of time, subject to a concomitant obligation to restore:

      (i) Easement over and upon the common elements and upon lands appurtenant to the condominium for the purpose of completing improvements for which provision is made in the declaration, but only if access thereto is otherwise not reasonably available.

      (ii) Easement over and upon the common elements for the purpose of making repairs required pursuant to the declaration or contracts of sale made with unit purchasers.

      (iii) Right to maintain facilities in the common areas which are identified in the declaration and which are reasonably necessary to market the units. These may include sales and management offices, model units, parking areas, and advertising signs.

      (b) —(1)  The owners' association shall be granted a right of entry upon unit premises and any limited common elements to effect emergency repairs, and a reasonable right of entry thereupon to effect other repairs, improvements, replacement or maintenance as necessary.

      (2)  The owners' association should be granted other rights, such as the right to grant utility easements under, through or over the common elements, which are reasonably necessary to the ongoing development and operation of the project.

      (3)  A provision may be made in the declaration or bylaws for allocation of responsibility for damages resulting from the exercise of any of the above rights.

      (4) —(i)  The declaration or its equivalent shall describe the authority of the owners' association to levy and enforce the collection of general and special assessments for common expenses and shall describe adequate remedies for failure to pay such common expenses. The common expenses assessed against any unit, with interest, late charges, costs and a reasonable attorney's fee shall be a lien upon such unit in accordance with applicable law. Each such assessment, together with interest, late charges, costs, and attorney's fee, shall also be the personal obligation of the person who was the owner of such unit at the time the assessment fell due. The personal obligation for delinquent assessments shall not pass to successors in title or interest unless assumed by them, or required by applicable law. Common expenses as used in this subdivision shall mean expenditures made or liabilities incurred by or on behalf of the owners' association, together with any assessments for the creation and maintenance of reserves.

      (ii)  There shall be in new or proposed condominium projects (including conversions) a provision for an adequate reserve fund for the periodic maintenance, repair and replacement of the common elements, which fund shall be maintained out of regular assessments for common expenses. Additionally, a working capital fund must be established for the initial months of the project operations equal to at least a 2 months' estimated common area charge for each unit.

      (iii)  Any assessment lien must be subordinate to any Department of Veterans Affairs guaranteed mortgage except as provided in § 36.4356. A lien for common expense charges and assessments shall not be affected by any sale or transfer of a unit except that a sale or transfer pursuant to a foreclosure of a first mortgage shall extinguish a subordinate lien for common expense charges and assessments which became payable prior to such sale or transfer. Any such sale or transfer pursuant to a foreclosure shall not relieve the purchaser or transferee of a unit from liability for, nor the unit so sold or transferred from the lien of, any common expense charges thereafter becoming due.

      (c) —(1)  The declaration or equivalent document shall establish a duty on each unit owner, including the declarant, to pay a proportionate share of common expenses upon being assessed therefor by the owners' association. Such share may be allocated equally to each unit, may be proportionate to that unit's common element interest, relative size or value, or may be allocated according to any other specified criteria provided that the method chosen is equitable and reasonable for that condominium.

      (2)  The declaration or equivalent document shall allocate a portion of the votes in the association to each unit. Such portion may be allocated equally to each unit, may be proportionate to that unit's common expense liability, common element interest, relative size or value, or may be allocated according to any other specified criteria provided that the method is equitable and reasonable for that condominium. The declaration may provide different criteria for allocations of votes to the units on particular specified matters and may also provide different percentages of required unit owner approvals for such particular specified matters.

      (3)  There may not be any restriction upon any unit owner's right of ingress and egress to his or her unit.

      (4) —(i)  In the event any portion of the common elements encroaches upon any unit or any unit encroaches upon the common elements or another unit as a result of the construction, reconstruction, repair, shifting, settlement, or movement of any portion of the improvements, a valid easement for the encroachment and for the maintenance of the same shall exist so long as the encroachment exists. The declaration may provide, however, reasonable limits on the extent of any easement created by the overlap of units, common elements, and limited common elements resulting from such encroachments; or

      (ii)  If permitted by the governing law within the jurisdiction where the project is located, the existing physical boundaries of a unit or a common element or the physical boundaries of a unit or a common element reconstructed in substantial accordance with the original plats and plans thereof become its boundaries rather than the metes and bounds expressed in the deed, plat or plan, regardless of settling or lateral movement of the building, or minor variance between boundaries shown on the plats, plans or in the deed and those of the building. The declaration should provide reasonable limits on the extent of any such revised boundary(ies) created by the overlap of units, common elements, and limited common elements resulting from such encroachments.

      (5)  The right of a unit owner to sell, transfer, or otherwise convey his or her unit in a condominium shall not be subject to any right of first refusal or similar restriction if the declaration or similar document is recorded on or after December 1, 1976. If the declaration was recorded prior to December 1, 1976, the right of first refusal must comply with § 36.4354(b)(5)(ii); Provided, however, restrictions on the basis of age or restrictions established by a State, Territorial, or local government agency as part of a program for providing assistance to low- and moderate-income purchasers shall be governed by § 36.4354(b)(5)(iv).

      (6)  Except as provided in this paragraph, there shall be no prohibition or restriction on a condominium unit owner's right to lease his or her unit. The following restrictions are acceptable:

      (i) A requirement that leases have a minimum initial term of up to 1 year; or

      (ii) Age restrictions or restrictions imposed by State or local housing authorities which are allowable under § 36.4309(e) or § 36.4354(b)(5)(iv).

      (d)  The owners' association and any aggrieved unit owner should be granted a right of action against unit owners for failure to comply with the provisions of the declaration, bylaws, or equivalent documents, or with decisions of the owners' association which are made pursuant to authority granted the owners' association in such documents. Unit owners should have similar rights of action against the owners' association.

      § 36.4363   Miscellaneous legal requirements.

#### § § 36.4363

      (a) —(1)  The declarant shall relinquish all special rights, expressed or implied, through which the declarant may directly or indirectly control, direct, modify, or veto any action of the owners' association, its executive board, or a majority of unit owners, and control of the owners' association shall pass to the owners of units within the project, not later than the earlier of the following:

      (i) 120 days after the date by which 75 percent of the units have been conveyed to unit purchasers,

      (ii) The last date of a specified period of time following the first conveyance to a unit purchaser; such period of time is to be reasonable for the particular project. The maximum acceptable period usually will be from 3 to 5 years for single-phased condominium regimes and 5 to 7 years for expandable condominiums, or

      (iii) On a case basis, modifications or variations of the requirements of paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section will be acceptable, particularly in circumstances involving very large condominium developments.

      (2)  The requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall not affect the declarant's rights, as a unit owner, to exercise the votes allocated to units which the declarant owns.

      (3)  Declarant should provide for and foster early participation of unit owners in the management of the project.

      (b)  Unless otherwise provided by State law, real estate taxes must be assessed and be lienable only against the individual units, together with their undivided interests in the common elements, and not against the multifamily structure. The owners' association usually owns no real estate, so it has no obligation concerning ad valorem taxes. Unless taxes are assessed only against the individual units, a tax lien could amount to more than the value of any particular unit in the structure.

      (c) [Reserved]

      (d)  The bylaws of the condominium should be sufficiently detailed for the successful governance of the condominium by unit owners. Among other things, such documents should contain adequate provisions for the election and removal of directors and officers.

      (e) —(1)  The holder shall require hazard and flood insurance policies to be procured and maintained in accordance with § 36.4329. Because of the nature of condominiums, additional types of insurance coverages—such as tort liability insurance for injuries sustained on the premises, personal liability insurance for directors and officers managing association affairs, boiler insurance, etc.—should be considered in appropriate circumstances.

      (2)  The securing of appropriate fidelity bond coverage is recommended but not required, for any person or entity handling funds of the owners' association, including, but not limited to, employees of the professional managers. Such fidelity bonds should name the association as an obligee, and be written in an amount equal to at least the estimated maximum of funds, including reserve funds, in the custody of the owners' association or the management agent at any given time during the term of the fidelity bond. However, the bond should not be less than a sum equal to 3 months' aggregate assessments on all units plus reserve funds.

      § 36.4364   Documentation and related requirements—flexible condominiums and condominiums with offsite facilities.

#### § § 36.4364

      (a)  The following policies apply to condominium regimes which may be increased in size by the declarant:

      (1) The declarant's right to expand the regime must be fully described in the declaration. The declaration must contain provisions adequate to ensure that future improvements to the condominium will be consistent with initial improvements in terms of quality of construction. The declarant must build each phase in accordance with an approved general plan for the total development (§ 36.4361(d)(2)) supported by detailed plats and plans of each phase prior to the construction of the particular phase.

      (2) The reservation of a right to expand the condominium regime, the method of expansion and the result of an expansion must not affect the statutory validity of the condominium regime or the validity of title to the units.

      (3) The declaration or equivalent document must contain a covenant that the condominium regime may not be amended or merged with a successor condominium regime without prior written approval of the Secretary. The declarant may have the proposed legal documentation to accomplish the merger reviewed prior to recordation. However, the Secretary's final approval of the merger will not be granted until the successor condominium has been legally established and construction completed. The declarant may add phases to an expandable condominium regime without the prior approval of the Secretary if the phasing implements a previously approved general plan for the total development. A copy of the amendment to the declaration or other annexation document which adds each phase must be submitted to the Secretary in accordance with § 36.4365(b)(6).

      (4) Liens arising in connection with the declarant's ownership of, and construction of improvements upon, the property to be added must not adversely affect the rights of existing unit owners, or the priority of first mortgages on units in the existing condominium property. All taxes, assessments, mechanic's liens, and other charges affecting such property, covering any period prior to the addition of the property, must be paid or otherwise satisfactorily provided for by the declarant.

      (5) The declarant must purchase (at declarant's own expense) a general liability insurance policy in an amount not less than $1 million for each occurrence, to cover any liability which owners of previously sold units are exposed to as a result of further condominium project development.

      (6) Each expandable project shall have a specified maximum number of units which will give each unit owner a minimum percentage of interest in the common elements. Each project shall also have a specified minimum number of units which will give each unit owner a maximum percentage of interest in the common elements. The minimum number of units to be built should be that which would be adequate to reasonably support the common elements. The maximum number of units to be built should be that which would not overload the capacity of the common facilities. The maximum possible percentage(s) and the minimum possible percentage(s) of undivided interest in the common elements for each type of unit must be stated in the declaration or equivalent document.

      (7) The declaration or equivalent document shall set forth clearly the basis for reallocation of unit owner's ownership interests, common expense liabilities and voting rights in the event the number of units in the condominium is increased. Such reallocation shall be according to the applicable criteria set forth in §§ 36.4361(b) and 36.4362(c)(1) and (2).

      (8) The declarant's right to expand the condominium must be for a reasonable period of time with a specific ending date. The maximum acceptable period will usually be from 5 to 7 years after the date of recording the declaration. On a case basic, longer periods of expansion rights will be acceptable, particularly in circumstances involving sizable condominium developments.

      (b)  (1) Each phase in the series approach is to be considered as a separate project. A separate set of legal documents must be filed for each phase or project that relates to the condominium within its own boundary. The declaration for each phase must describe the particular project as a part of the whole development area, but subject only the one phase to the condominium regime. A separate unit ratio must be established that would relate each unit to all units of the particular condominium for purposes of ownership in the common areas, voting rights and assessment liability. A separate association may be created to govern the affairs of each condominium. Each phase is subject to a separate presale requirement.

      (2) In the case of proposed projects, or projects under construction, the declaration should state the number of total units that the developer intends to build on other sections of the development area.

      (c)  Condominiums containing withdrawable real estate (contractable condominiums) and condominiums containing convertible real estate (portions of the condominium within which additional units or limited common elements, or both, may be created) will be considered acceptable provided the flexible condominium complies with the § 36.4300 series.

> [73 FR 6310, Feb. 1, 2008. Redesignated at 75 FR 33705, June 15, 2010, as amended at 80 FR 34319, June 16, 2015]

      § 36.4365   Appraisal requirements.

#### § § 36.4365

      (a)  Upon acceptance by the local office of the organizational documents, the project and unit(s) proposed as security for guaranteed financing shall be appraised to ensure that they meet MPRs (Minimum Property Requirements) and are safe, sanitary, and structurally sound. The Department of Veterans Affairs MPRs for existing construction apply to all existing resale condominiums including conversions, except that water, heating, ventilating, air conditioning and sewer service may be supplied from a central source.

      (b) —(1)  Low rise and high rise condominiums shall comply with local building codes. Only the alterations, improvements, or repairs to low rise and high rise buildings proposed to be converted to the condominium form of ownership must comply with current local building codes, unless local authorities require total code compliance on the entire structure when a building is being converted to the condominium form of ownership. In those areas where local standards are nonexistent, inferior to, or in conflict with Department of Veterans Affairs objectives, a certification will be required from a registered professional architect and/or registered engineer certifying that the plans and specifications conform to one of the national building codes which is typical of similar construction methods and standards for condominiums used in the area. Those portions of the condominium conversion which are not being altered, improved or repaired must be appraised in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section.

      (2)  Department of Veterans Affairs policies and procedures applicable to single-family residential construction shall also apply to horizontal condominiums. Proposed or existing (declarant in control or marketing units) horizontal condominium conversions shall comply with current local building codes for alterations and improvements or repairs made to convert the building to the condominium form of ownership unless local authorities require total code compliance on the entire structure when a building is being converted to the condominium form of ownership. In those areas where local standards are nonexistent, inferior to, or in conflict with Department of Veterans Affairs objectives, a certification will be required from a professional architect and/or registered engineer certifying that the plans and specifications conform to one of the national building codes which is typical of similar construction methods and standards for condominiums used in the area. Those portions of the condominium conversion which are not being altered, improved or repaired must be appraised in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section.

      (3)  All units in the individual project or phase must be substantially completed except for customer preference items, such as interior finishes, appliances or equipment.

      (4)  All amenities of the condominium (to include offsite community facilities), that are to be considered in the unit value, must be bound legally to the condominium regime. All such amenities as well as the common elements of the project, must be substantially completed and available for use by the unit owners. In large multi-phase projects, the declarant should construct common elements in a manner consistent with the addition of units to support the entire development. The Secretary, in appropriate cases, may approve the placement of adequate funds by the declarant in an escrow or otherwise earmarked account or accept a letter of credit or surety bond to assure completion of amenities and allow closing of VA-guaranteed (or insured) loans. Such funds must be adequate to assure completion of the amenities free and clear of all liens.

      (5)  When units are being sold by the declarant (not applicable to resales), an information brochure/public offering statement must be given to veteran buyers prior to the time a down payment is received and an agreement is signed, unless State law authorized receipt of the down payment and delivery of the information brochure followed by a period in which purchasers may cancel the purchase agreement without penalty for a specified number of days. Information brochures must be written in simple terms to inform buyers that the association does not provide owner's contents and personal liability policies which are the owner's responsibility. In the event the development is expandable, series, etc., there must be full disclosure of the impact of the total development plan. In expandable, series or other projects with more than one phase, the information brochure must disclose fully later development rights, and the general plans of the declarant for additional phases. If the declarant makes no assurance concerning phases which are not required to be built, the declarant should state that no assurances are given concerning construction, unit sizes, building types, architectural styles, etc. In condominium conversions, the information brochure must list the major structural and mechanical components and the estimated remaining useful life of the components. A brief explanation must be furnished in the brochure explaining that certain major structural or mechanical components may require replacement within a specified time period. If the declarant has elected to place funds into a condominium reserve fund for replacement of a major component under the provisions of § 36.4365(b)(7), the amount of the contribution into the reserve fund must be specified in the information brochure.

      (6)  In an expandable or flexible condominium, evidence of the addition of each phase in accordance with a previously approved general plan of development must be submitted to the Secretary prior to the guaranty of the first loan in the added area.

      (7)  (i) The declarant of any condominium project must furnish structural and mechanical common element component statements on the present condition of all accessible structural and mechanical components material to the use and enjoyment of the condominium. These statements must be completed by a registered professional engineer and/or architect prior to the guaranty of the first unit loan in the project. Each statement must also give an estimate of the expected useful life of the roof, elevators, heating and cooling, plumbing and electrical systems assuming normal maintenance. A minimum of 10 years estimated remaining useful life is required on all structural and mechanical components. In the alternative, the declarant may contribute an amount of funds to the condominium reserve fund equal to a minimum of   (one-tenth) of the estimated costs of replacement of a major structural or mechanical component (as determined by an independent registered professional architect or engineer) for each year of estimated remaining useful life less than 10 years, e.g. 7 years remaining useful life equals a   required declarant contribution to the reserve fund of the component's estimated replacement cost. The noted statements and remaining useful life requirement are not applicable to existing resale conversion projects when the declarant is no longer marketing units and/or in control of the association. Expandable or series condominium conversions require engineering and architectural statements on each stage or phase.

      (ii) In declarant controlled projects, a statement(s) by the local authority(ies) of the adequacy of offsite utilities servicing the site (e.g., sanitary or water) is required. If a local authority(ies) declines to issue such a statement(s), a statement(s) may be obtained from a registered professional engineer. If local authority(ies) declines to issue such a statement(s), a statement(s) may be obtained from a registered professional engineer.

      (c)

      (1)  Bona fide agreements of sale must have been executed by purchasers other than the declarant (who are obligated contractually to complete the purchase) of 70 percent of the total number of units in the project. Lenders shall certify as to satisfaction of the presale requirement prior to VA guaranty of the first unit loan. When a declarant can demonstrate that a lower percentage would be justified, the Secretary, on an individual case basis, may approve a presale requirement of less than 70 percent. Reduction of the 70 percent presale requirement will be considered when:

      (i) Strong initial sales demonstrate a ready market, or

      (ii) The declarant will provide cash assets or acceptable bonds for payment of full common area assessments to the owners' association until such assessments are assumed by unit purchasers, or

      (iii) Subsequent phases of an overall development are being undertaken in a proven market area, or

      (iv) Previous experience in similar projects in the same market area indicates strong market acceptance, or

      (v) The development is in a market area that has repeatedly indicated acceptance of such projects.

      (2)  The requirements of paragraph (c)(1) of this section shall apply to each individual phase of a multiphase development, taking into consideration that each individual phase must be capable of self-support in the event that the developer does not complete all planned phases.

      (d)  Except in condominium conversion projects, each CRV (Certificate of Reasonable Value) issued by the Secretary relating to a proposed or existing not previously occupied dwelling unit in a condominium project shall be subject to the express condition that the builder, seller, or the real party in interest in the transaction shall deliver to the veteran purchasing the dwelling unit with the aid of a guaranteed or insured loan a warranty against defects for the unit and common elements. The unit shall be warranted for 1 year from the date of settlement or the date of occupancy (whichever first occurs). The common elements shall be warranted for 2 years from the date each of the common elements is completed and available for use by the unit owners, or 2 years from the date the first unit is conveyed to a unit owner other than the declarant, whichever is later, in the particular phase of the condominium containing the common element. For these purposes, defects shall be those items reasonably requiring the repair, renovation, restoration, or replacement of any of the components constituting the unit or common elements. Items of maintenance relating to the unit or common elements are not covered by the warranty. No certificate of guaranty or insurance credit shall be issued unless a copy of such warranty, duly receipted by the purchaser, is submitted with the loan papers.

      (e) —(1)  Evidence must be presented that the offsite facility owned by an owners' association with mandatory membership by condominium unit owners or condominium unit owners' associations has been completed and conveyed free of encumbrances by the declarant for the benefit of the unit owners with title insured by an owner's title policy or other acceptable title evidence. Offsite facilities conveyed to a nonprofit corporation are the preferred method of offsite facilities ownership; however, the Secretary will consider other forms of ownership on an individual case basis.

      (2)  The declaration of the condominium (each condominium in a series development) and the legal documentation of the corporation or association which owns the offsite facility must provide the following:

      (i) The owner of a condominium unit is automatically a member of the offsite facility corporation or association and that upon the sale of the unit, membership is transferred automatically to the new owner/purchaser. It is also acceptable if each condominium owners' association (in lieu of each individual unit owner) is automatically a member of the offsite facility corporation or association coupled with use rights for each of the unit owners or residents. If membership in an offsite owners' association is voluntary, no credit in the CRV valuation may be given for such offsite amenities.

      (ii) Each member of the offsite facility corporation or association must be entitled to a representative vote at meetings of the offsite facility corporation or association. If the individual condominium owners' association is a member of the offsite facility corporation or association, each condominium owners' association must be entitled to a representative vote at meetings of the offsite facility corporation or association.

      (iii) Each member must agree by acceptance of the unit deed to pay a share of the expenses of the offsite facility corporation or association as assessed by the corporation or association for upkeep, insurance, reserve fund for replacements, maintenance and operation of the offsite facility. The share of said expenses shall be determined equitably. Failure to pay such assessment must result in a lien against the individual unit in the same manner as unpaid assessments by the association of owners of the condominium. If each condominium owners' association is a member of the offsite facility in lieu of individual unit owners, failure of the condominium owners' association to pay its equitable assessment to the offsite facility must result in an enforceable lien.

      (3)  Until the declarant has completed all of the intended condominium phases in a total condominium development or established each condominium regime by filing a separate declaration in a series development, the balance of the total sum of the expenses of the offsite facility not covered by the assessment against the unit owners should be assessed against and be payable by the declarant commencing on the first day of the first month after the first unit is conveyed to a homeowner in the first phase. If this balance is not paid, it must become a lien against those parcels of land in the development area which are owned by the declarant. The collection of such debt and enforcement of such lien may be by foreclosure or such other remedies afforded the corporation or association under local law.

      (f)  Many condominiums are small enough and their common areas so minimal that professional management is not necessary. VA does not have a requirement for professional management of condominiums. The powers given to the owners' association by the declaration and bylaws are fundamentally for “use control” and maintenance of the undivided interest all of the owners have in the common areas. These powers normally include management which may, if desired, be delegated to a professional manager. However, if the board of directors wants professional management, the management agreement must be terminable for cause upon 30 days' notice, and run for a reasonable period of from 1 to 3 years and be renewable for consent of the association and the management. (Management contracts negotiated by the declarant should not exceed 2 years.)

      (g)  With respect to existing and proposed condominiums, commercial areas within condominium developments are acceptable, but such interests will be considered in value.

      Each certificate of reasonable value issued by the Secretary relating to a proposed or newly constructed dwelling unit, except those covering one-family residential units in condominium housing developments or projects within the purview of §§ 36.4360 through 36.4365, shall be subject to the express condition that the builder, seller, or the real party in interest in the transaction shall deliver to the veteran constructing or purchasing such dwelling with the aid of a guaranteed or insured loan a warranty, in the form prescribed by the Secretary, that the property has been completed in substantial conformity with the plans and specifications upon which the Secretary based the valuation of the property, including any modifications thereof, or changes or variations therein, approved in writing by the Secretary, and no certificate of guaranty or insurance credit shall be issued unless a copy of such warranty duly receipted by the purchaser is submitted with the loan papers.

#### § § 36.4368

      (a) Any request for a master certificate of reasonable value on proposed or existing construction, and any request for appraisal of individual existing housing not previously occupied, which is received on or after November 21, 1962, will not be assigned for appraisal prior to receipt of a certification from the builder, sponsor or other seller, in the form prescribed by the Secretary, that neither it nor anyone authorized to act for it will decline to sell any property included in such request to a prospective purchaser because of his or her race, color, religion, sex or national origin.

      (b) On requests for appraisal of individual proposed construction received on or after November 21, 1962, the prescribed nondiscrimination certification will be required if the builder is to sell the veteran the lot on which the dwelling is to be constructed, but will not be required if:

      (1) The veteran owns the lot; or

      (2) The lot is being acquired by the veteran from a seller other than the builder and there is no identity of interest between the builder and the seller of the lot.

      (c) Each builder, sponsor or other seller requesting approval of site and subdivision planning shall be required to furnish a certification, in the form prescribed by the Secretary, that neither it nor anyone authorized to act for it will decline to sell any property included in such request to a prospective purchaser because of his or her race, color, religion, sex or national origin. Site and subdivision analysis will not be commenced by the Department of Veterans Affairs prior to receipt of such certification.

      (d) No commitment shall be issued and no loan shall be guaranteed or insured under 38 U.S.C. chapter 37 unless the veteran certifies, in such form as the Secretary shall prescribe, that

      (1) Neither he/she, nor anyone authorized to act for him/her, will refuse to sell or rent, after the making of a bona fide offer, or refuse to negotiate for the sale or rental of, or otherwise make unavailable or deny the dwelling or property covered by this loan to any person because of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin;

      (2) He/she recognizes that any restrictive covenant on the property relating to race, color, religion, sex or national origin is illegal and void and any such covenant is specifically disclaimed; and

      (3) He/she understands that civil action for preventive relief may be brought by the Attorney General of the United States in any appropriate U.S. District Court against any person responsible for a violation of the applicable law.

      § 36.4369   Correction of structural defects.

#### § § 36.4369

      (a) The purpose of this section is to specify the types of assistance that the Secretary may render pursuant to 38 U.S.C. 3727 to an eligible borrower who has been unable to secure satisfactory correction of structural defects in a dwelling encumbered by a mortgage securing a guaranteed, insured or direct loan, and the terms and conditions under which such assistance will be rendered.

      (b) A written application for assistance in the correction of structural defects shall be filed by a borrower under a guaranteed, insured or direct loan with the Director of the Department of Veterans Affairs office having loan jurisdiction over the area in which the dwelling is located. The application must be filed not later than 4 years after the date on which the first direct, guaranteed or insured mortgage loan on the dwelling was made, guaranteed or insured by the Secretary. A borrower under a direct, guaranteed or insured mortgage loan on the same dwelling which was made, guaranteed or insured subsequent to the first such loan shall be entitled to file an application if it is filed not later than 4 years after the date on which such first loan was made, guaranteed or insured by the Secretary.

      (c) An applicant for assistance under this section must establish that:

      (1) The applicant is the owner of a one- to four-family dwelling which was inspected during construction by the Department of Veterans Affairs or the Federal Housing Administration.

      (2) The applicant is an original veteran-borrower on an outstanding guaranteed, insured or direct loan secured by a mortgage on such dwelling which was made, guaranteed or insured on or after May 8, 1968. The Secretary may, however, recognize an applicant who is not the original veteran-borrower but who contracted to assume such borrower's personal obligation thereunder, if the Secretary determines that such recognition would be in the best interests of the Government in the particular case.

      (3) There exists in such dwelling a structural defect, not the result of fire, earthquake, flood, windstorm, or waste, which seriously affects the livability of the dwelling.

      (4) The applicant has made reasonable efforts to obtain correction of such structural defect by the builder, seller, or other person or firm responsible for the construction of the dwelling.

      (d) In those instances in which the Secretary determines that assistance under this section is appropriate and necessary the Secretary may take any of the following actions:

      (1) Pay such amount as is reasonably necessary to correct the defect, or

      (2) Pay the claim of the borrower for reimbursement of the borrower's expenses for correcting or obtaining correction of the defect, or

      (3) Acquire title to the property upon terms acceptable to the borrower and the holder of the guaranteed or insured loan.

      (e) To the extent of any expenditure made by the Secretary pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section the Secretary shall be subrogated to any legal rights the borrower or applicant described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section may have against the builder, seller, or other persons arising out of the structural defect or defects.

      (f) The borrower shall not be entitled, as a matter of right, to receive the assistance in the correction of structural defects provided in this section. Any determination made by the Secretary in connection with a borrower's application for assistance shall be final and conclusive and shall not be subject to judicial or other review. Authority to act for the Secretary under this section is delegated to the Under Secretary for Benefits.

      (g) For the purpose of this section, the term “structural defects seriously affecting livability” shall in no event be deemed to include—

      (1) Defects of any nature in a dwelling in respect to which the applicant for assistance under this section was the builder or general contractor, or

      (2) Structural features, improvements, amenities, or equipment which were not taken into account in the Secretary's determination of reasonable value.

      § 36.4370   Advertising and solicitation requirements.

#### § § 36.4370

      Any advertisement or solicitation in any form (e.g., written, electronic, oral) from a private lender concerning housing loans to be guaranteed or insured by the Secretary:

      (b) Must not include information falsely stating or implying that the lender has an exclusive right to make loans guaranteed or insured by VA.

      § 36.4375   Insured loan and insurance account.

#### § § 36.4375

      (a) Loans otherwise eligible may be insured when purchased by a lender eligible under 38 U.S.C. 3703(a) if the purchaser (lender) submits with the loan report evidence of an agreement, general or special, made prior to the closing of the loan, to purchase such loan subject to its being insured.

      (b) A current account shall be maintained in the name of each insured lender or purchaser. The account shall be credited with the appropriate amounts available for the payment of losses on insured loans made or purchased. The account shall be debited with appropriate amounts on account of transfers, purchases under § 36.4320, or payment of losses. The Secretary may on 6 months' notice close any lender's insurance account. Such account after expiration of the 6-month period shall be available only as to loans embraced therein.

      (c) Amounts received or recovered by the Secretary or the holder with respect to a loan after payment of an insured claim thereon will not restore any amount to the holder's insurance account.

      (b) Transfers between insurance accounts in a manner or under conditions not provided in paragraph (a) of this section must have the prior approval of the Secretary.

      (c) Where loans are transferred with recourse or under a guaranty or repurchase agreement no insurance credit will be transferred or insurance account affected and no reports will be required.

      (d) In all cases of transfer of loans from one insured financial institution to another insured institution, except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, a report on a prescribed form executed by the parties and showing their agreement with regard to the transfer of insurance credits shall be made to the Secretary.

#### § § 36.4378

      In the event that an insured loan is transferred under the provisions of § 36.4320, there shall be charged to the insurance account of the transferor a sum equal to the amount paid transferor on account of the indebtedness less the current market value of the property transferred as security therefor as determined by an appraiser designated by the Secretary, or the amount chargeable to such insurance account in the event of a transfer under § 36.4377, whichever sum is the greater. The credit to the insurance account of the transferee will be computed in accordance with § 36.4377(a).

Subject to the provisions of the paragraph (b) of this section and to § 36.4375(b) a supplemental claim for any balance of an insurance loss may be filed at any time within 5 years after the date of the original claim.

      (b) The basis of the claim for an insured loss shall consist in the unrealized principal or the amount paid for the obligation, if less, plus unrealized interest to the date of claim or the date of sale whichever is earlier, and those expenses, if any, allowable under § 36.4314, but subject to proper credits because of payments, set-off, proceeds of security or otherwise, provided that if there is no liquidation of security the claim shall not include an accrual of interest for a period in excess of 6 months from the date of the first uncured default.

      (4) Where an eligible individual has already acquired a suitably adapted housing unit, the Secretary will pay, up to the aggregate amount of assistance available for 2101(a) grants, the lesser of:

      (i) 50 percent of the eligible individual's cost of acquiring such housing unit, or

      (ii) The full amount of the unpaid balance, if any, of the cost to the individual of the housing unit.

      (b)  (1) The 2101(b) grant provides monetary assistance for the purpose of acquiring specially adapted housing pursuant to one of the following plans:

      (i) Where an eligible individual elects to construct a dwelling on land to be acquired by the eligible individual or a member of the eligible individual's family;

      (ii) Where an eligible individual elects to construct a dwelling on land already owned by the eligible individual or a member of the eligible individual's family;

      (iii) Where an eligible individual elects to adapt a housing unit already owned by the eligible individual or a member of the eligible individual's family; or

      (iv) Where an eligible individual elects to purchase a housing unit that is already adapted to the requirements of the eligible individual's disability.

      (d)  (1) If an individual is determined eligible for a 2101(a) grant, he or she may not subsequently receive a 2101(b) grant.

      (2) If an individual is determined eligible for a 2101(b) grant, and becomes eligible for a 2101(a) grant, he or she may receive 2101(a) grants and TRA grants up to the aggregate amount of assistance available for 2101(a) grants. However, any 2101(b) or TRA grants received by the individual before he or she was determined eligible for the 2101(a) grant will count towards the six grant limit in § 36.4403.

      (3) If the Secretary has provided assistance to an eligible individual under 38 U.S.C. 1717, the Secretary will not provide assistance under this subpart that would result in duplicate payments for the same adaptations. However, nothing in this subpart prohibits an eligible individual from utilizing the assistance authorized under 38 U.S.C. 1717 and 38 U.S.C. chapter 21 simultaneously, provided that no duplicate payments result.

      § 36.4405   Grant approval.

#### § § 36.4405

      (a)  (1) The Secretary may provide written notification to an eligible individual of conditional approval of a specially adapted housing grant if the Secretary has determined that:

      (i) Disability requirements have been satisfied pursuant to § 36.4404(a);

      (ii) Feasibility and suitability requirements have been satisfied pursuant to § 36.4404(b); and

      (iii) The eligible individual has not exceeded the usage or dollar limitations prescribed by §§ 36.4402(d) and 36.4403.

      (2) Once conditional approval has been granted, the Secretary may authorize, in writing, an eligible individual to incur certain preconstruction costs pursuant to § 36.4406.

      (b)  In order for an individual to obtain final approval for a specially adapted housing grant, the Secretary must determine that the following property requirements are met:

      (1)  The plans and specifications of the proposed adaptations demonstrate compliance with minimum property and design requirements of the specially adapted housing program.

      (2)  (i) In the case of 2101(a) grants, the eligible individual must have, or provide satisfactory evidence that he or she will acquire, an ownership interest in the housing unit.

      (ii) In the case of 2101(b) grants, the eligible individual or a member of the eligible individual's family must have, or provide satisfactory evidence that he or she will acquire, an ownership interest in the housing unit.

      (iv) If the ownership interest in the housing unit is or will be vested in the eligible individual and another person, the Secretary will not for that reason reduce by percentage of ownership the amount of a specially adapted housing grant. However, to meet the ownership requirement for final approval of a specially adapted housing grant, the eligible individual's ownership interest must be of sufficient quantum and quality, as determined by the Secretary, to ensure the eligible individual's quiet enjoyment of the property.

      (3)  The eligible individual must certify, in such form as the Secretary will prescribe, that:

      (i) Neither the eligible individual, nor anyone authorized to act for the eligible individual, will refuse to sell or rent, after receiving a bona fide offer, or refuse to negotiate for the sale or rental of, or otherwise make unavailable or deny the housing unit acquired by this benefit, to any person because of race, color, religion, sex, familial status, disability, or national origin;

      (ii) The eligible individual, and anyone authorized to act for the eligible individual, recognizes that any restrictive covenant on the housing unit relating to race, color, religion, sex, familial status, disability, or national origin is illegal and void, and any such covenant is specifically disclaimed; and

      (iii) The eligible individual, and anyone authorized to act for the eligible individual, understands that civil action for preventative relief may be brought by the Attorney General of the United States in any appropriate U.S. District Court against any person responsible for a violation of the applicable law.

      (4)  The eligible individual's housing unit, if it is or becomes located in an area identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency as having special flood hazards and in which flood insurance has been made available under the National Flood Insurance Act, as amended, must be covered by flood insurance. The amount of flood insurance must be at least equal to the lesser of the full insurable value of the housing unit or the maximum limit of coverage available for the particular type of housing unit under the National Flood Insurance Act, as amended. The Secretary will not approve any financial assistance for the acquisition or construction of a housing unit located in an area identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency as having special flood hazards unless the community in which such area is situated is then participating in the National Flood Insurance Program

      (i) Within the United States, which, for purposes of 38 U.S.C. chapter 21, includes the several States, Territories, and possessions, including the District of Columbia, and the Commonwealths of Puerto Rico and the Northern Mariana Islands; or,

      § 36.4406   Reimbursement of costs and disbursement of grant funds.

#### § § 36.4406

      (a) After providing conditional approval of a specially adapted housing grant for an eligible individual pursuant to § 36.4405, the Secretary may authorize the incurrence, prior to obtaining final specially adapted housing grant approval, of preconstruction costs of the types and subject to the limits specified in this paragraph.

      (1) Preconstruction costs to be incurred may not exceed 20 percent of the eligible individual's aggregate amount of assistance available, unless the individual is authorized by the Secretary in writing to incur specific preconstruction costs in excess of this 20 percent limitation. Preconstruction costs may include the following items:

      (i) Architectural services employed for preparation of building plans and specifications.

      (ii) Land surveys.

      (iii) Attorneys' and other legal fees.

      (iv) Other costs or fees necessary to plan for specially adapted housing grant use, as determined by the Secretary.

      (2) If the Secretary authorizes final approval, the Secretary will pay out of the specially adapted housing grant the preconstruction costs that the Secretary authorized in advance. If the specially adapted housing grant process is terminated prior to final approval, preconstruction costs incurred that the Secretary authorized in advance will be reimbursed to the eligible individual, or the eligible individual's estate pursuant to paragraph(c) of this section, but will be deducted from the aggregate amount of assistance available and the reimbursement will constitute one of the six permitted grant usages (see § 36.4403).

      (b) The Secretary will determine a method of disbursement that is appropriate and advisable in the interest of the eligible individual and the Government, and will pay the specially adapted housing grant accordingly. Disbursement of specially adapted housing grant proceeds generally will be made to third parties who have contracted with the veteran, to an escrow agent, or to the eligible individual's lender, as the Secretary deems appropriate. If the Secretary determines that it is appropriate and advisable, the Secretary may disburse specially adapted housing grant funds directly to an eligible individual where the eligible individual has incurred authorized preconstruction or construction-related costs and paid for such authorized costs using personal funds.

      (c) Should an eligible individual die before the Secretary disburses the full specially adapted housing grant, the eligible individual's estate must submit to the Secretary all requests for reimbursement within one year of the date the Loan Guaranty Service learns of the eligible individual's death. Except where the Secretary determines that equity and good conscience require otherwise, the Secretary will not reimburse an eligible individual's estate for a request that has not been received by the Department of Veterans Affairs within this timeframe.

      (1) The Department of Veterans Affairs shall include in the mortgage or deed of trust and the promissory note or bond on any loan for which a commitment was made on or after March 1, 1988, the following warning in a conspicuous position in capital letters on the first page of the document in type at least 2  times larger than the regular type on such page: “THIS LOAN IS NOT ASSUMABLE WITHOUT THE APPROVAL OF THE DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS OR ITS AUTHORIZED AGENT”. Due to the difficulty in obtaining some commercial type sizes which are exactly 2  times larger in height than other sizes, minor deviations in size will be permitted based on commercially available type sizes nearest to 2  times the size of the print on the document.

      (2) The instrument securing a direct loan for which a commitment is made on or after March 1, 1988, shall include:

      (i) A provision that the Department of Veterans Affairs or other holder may declare the loan immediately due and payable upon transfer of the property securing such loan to any transferee unless the acceptability of the assumption of the loan is established pursuant to section 3714. This option may not be exercised if the transfer is the result of:

      (A) The creation of a lien or other encumbrance subordinate to the lender's security instrument which does not relate to a transfer of rights of occupancy in the property;

      (B) The creation of a purchase money security interest for household appliances;

      (C) A transfer by devise, descent, or operation of law on the death of a joint tenant or tenant by the entirety;

      (F) A transfer where the spouse or children of the borrower become a joint owner of the property with the borrower;

      (G) A transfer resulting from a decree of a dissolution of marriage, legal separation agreement, or from an incidental property settlement agreement by which the spouse of the borrower becomes the sole owner of the property. In such a case the borrower shall have the option of applying directly to the Department of Veterans Affairs regional office of jurisdiction for a release of liability under 1813(a); or

      (H) A transfer into an inter vivos trust in which the borrower is and remains a beneficiary and which does not relate to a transfer of rights of occupancy in the property.

      (ii) A provision that a funding fee equal to one-half of one percent of the loan balance as of the date of transfer shall be payable to the Department of Veterans Affairs or its authorized agent. Furthermore, this provision shall provide that if this fee is not paid it shall constitute an additional debt to that already secured by the instrument; and,

      (iii) A provision authorizing an assumption processing charge, not to exceed the lesser of $300 and the actual cost of a credit report or any maximum prescribed by applicable State law.

      (b) Whenever any veteran disposes of residential property securing a direct loan obtained under 38 U.S.C. chapter 37, the Department of Veterans Affairs, upon application made by such borrower, shall issue to the borrower a release relieving the borrower of all further liability to the Department of Veterans Affairs on account of such loan (including liability for any loss resulting from any default of the transferee or any subsequent purchaser of such property) if the Department of Veterans Affairs has determined, after such investigation as it deems appropriate, that there has been compliance with the conditions prescribed in 38 U.S.C. 3713(a) or 1814, as appropriate. The assumption of full liability for repayment of the loan by the transferee of the property must be evidenced by an agreement in writing in such form as the Department of Veterans Affairs may require. Any release of liability granted to a veteran by the Department of Veterans Affairs shall inure to the spouse of such veteran.

      (c) If, on or after July 1, 1972, any veteran disposes of the property securing a direct loan obtained under 38 U.S.C. chapter 37, without receiving a release from liability with respect to such loan under 38 U.S.C. 3713(a) and a default subsequently occurs which results in liability of the veteran to the Secretary on account of the loan, the Secretary may relieve the veteran of such liability if the Secretary determines that:

      (1) A transferee either immediate or remote is legally liable to the Secretary for the debt of the original veteran-borrower established after the termination of the loan, and

      (2) The original loan was current at the time such transferee acquired the property, and

      (3) The transferee who is liable to the Secretary is found to have been a satisfactory credit risk at the time the transferee acquired the property.

      § 36.4515   Estate of veteran in real property.

#### § § 36.4515

      (a) The estate in the realty acquired by the veteran, wholly or partly with the proceeds of a loan hereunder, or owned by the veteran and on which improvements on a farmhouse are to be financed by such loan, shall be not less than:

      (1) A fee simple estate therein, legal or equitable; or

      (2) A leasehold estate running or renewable at the option of the lessee for a period of not less than 14 years from the maturity of the loan, or to any earlier date at which the fee simple title will vest in the lessee, which is assignable or transferable, if the same be subjected to the lien; however, a leasehold estate which is not freely assignable and transferable will be considered an acceptable estate if it is determined by the Under Secretary for Benefits, or the Executive Director, Loan Guaranty Service, (i) that such type of leasehold is customary in the area where the property is located; (ii) that a veteran or veterans will be prejudiced if the requirement for free assignability is adhered to and (iii) that the assignability and other provisions applicable to the leasehold estate are sufficient to protect the interests of the veteran and the Government and are otherwise acceptable; or

      (3) A life estate, provided that the remainder and reversionary interests are subjected to the lien. The title to such estate shall be such as is acceptable to informed buyers, title companies, and attorneys, generally, in the community in which the property is situated, except as modified by paragraph (b) of this section; or

      (4) A beneficial interest in a revocable Family Living Trust that ensures that the veteran, or veteran and spouse, have an equitable life estate, provided the lien attaches to any remainder interest and the trust arrangement is valid under State law.

      (b) Any such property or estate will not fail to comply with the requirements in paragraph (a) of this section by reason of the following:

      (1) Encroachments;

      (2) Easements;

      (3) Servitudes;

      (4) Reservations for water, timber, or subsurface rights;

      (5) Right in any grantor or cotenant in the chain of title, or a successor of either, to purchase for cash, which right by the terms thereof is exercisable only if:

      (i) An owner elects to sell,

      (ii) The option price is not less than the price at which the then owner is willing to sell to another, and

      (iii) Exercised within 30 days after notice is mailed by registered mail to the address of optionee last known to the then owner, of the then owner's election to sell, stating the price and the identity of the proposed vendee;

      (6) Building and use restrictions whether or not enforceable by a reverter clause if there has been no breach of the conditions affording a right to an exercise of the reverter;

      (7) Any other covenant, condition, restriction, or limitation approved by the Department of Veterans Affairs in the particular case.

      § 36.4516   Lien requirements.

#### § § 36.4516

      (a) Loans for the purchase of a dwelling or for the purchase of a farm on which there is a farm residence shall be secured by a first lien on the property or estate. Loans for the construction of a farm residence or other dwelling shall also be secured by a first lien.

      (b) Loans solely for the purpose of energy conservation improvements or other alterations, improvements, or repairs shall be secured in the following manner:

      (1) Loans for $1,500 or less need not be secured, and in lieu of the title examination a statement may be accepted from the borrower that he or she has an interest in the property not less than that prescribed in § 36.4515(a).

      (2) Loans for more than $1,500 but 40 percent or less of the prior to the improved reasonable value of the property shall be secured by a lien reasonable and customary in the community for the type of alteration, improvement, or repair financed.

      (3) Loans for more than $1,500 and for more than 40 percent of the prior to the improved reasonable value of such property shall be secured by a first lien on the property or estate. However, such a home improvement loan may be secured by a lien immediately subordinate to the lien securing the previous loan extended by the Secretary, if the Department of Veterans Affairs is the holder of all liens of superior priority on the property.

      (c) Tax liens, special assessment liens, and ground rent shall be disregarded with respect to any requirement that loans shall be secured by a lien of specified dignity. With the prior approval of the Secretary, Under Secretary for Benefits, or Executive Director, Loan Guaranty Service, liens retained by nongovernmental entities to secure assessments or charges for municipal type services and facilities clearly within the public purpose doctrine may be disregarded. In determining whether a loan for the purchase or construction of a home is secured by a first lien the Secretary may also disregard a superior lien created by a duly recorded covenant running with the realty in favor of a private entity to secure an obligation to such entity for the homeowner's share of the costs of the management, operation, or maintenance of property, services or programs within and for the benefit of the development or community in which the veteran's realty is located, if the Secretary determines that the interests of the veteran-borrower and of the Government will not be prejudiced by the operation of such covenant. In respect to any such superior lien to be created after June 6, 1969, the Secretary's determination must have been made prior to the recordation of the covenant.

      (b) In the case of a loan for the construction of a farm residence or other dwelling on land owned by the veteran, a portion of the loan proceeds may be expended to liquidate an indebtedness secured by a lien against such land, but only if the reasonable value of the land is equal to or in excess of the amount of the indebtedness secured by such lien and if the liquidation of such indebtedness will permit the loan to be secured by a first lien. Except as provided in § 36.4507, no portion of the proceeds of a loan for repairs, alterations or improvements to a farm residence or other dwelling may be expended to liquidate a prior lien against the property.

      (c) No direct loan may be made for the purpose of an interest rate reduction refinancing loan pursuant to 38 U.S.C. 3710(a)(8).

#### § § 36.4527

      (1) The Secretary has entered into a memorandum of understanding with respect to such loans with the tribal organization that has jurisdiction over the veteran; or

      (2) The tribal organization that has jurisdiction over the veteran has entered into a memorandum of understanding with any department or agency of the United States with respect to such loans and the memorandum complies with the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section.

      (3) The memorandum is in effect when the loan is made and will remain in effect until the maturity of the subject loan.

      (b)(1) Subject to paragraph (b)(2) of this section, each memorandum of understanding entered into by the Secretary with a tribal organization shall provide for the following:

      (i) That each Native American veteran who is under the jurisdiction of the tribal organization and to whom the Secretary makes a direct loan under this section

      (A) Holds, possesses, or acquires using the proceeds of the loan a meaningful interest in a lot and/or dwelling that is located on trust land; and

      (B) Will purchase, construct, or improve a dwelling on the lot using the proceeds of the loan.

      (ii) That each Native American veteran obtaining a direct loan under this section will convey to the Secretary by an appropriate instrument the interest referred to in paragraph (A) as security for the direct loan or, if the laws of the tribal organization do not allow the veteran to convey the meaningful interest to the Secretary, the memorandum of understanding may authorize the tribe to serve as Trustee for the Secretary for purposes of protecting the interest of the Secretary as lender.

      (iii) That the tribal organization and each Native American veteran obtaining a direct loan under this section will permit the Secretary or his or her designee to enter upon the trust land of that organization or veteran for the purposes of carrying out such actions as the Secretary or his or her designee determines may be necessary:

      (A) To evaluate the advisability of the loan; and

      (B) To monitor any purchase, construction, or improvements carried out using the proceeds of the loan.

      (C) To protect the improvements from vandalism and the elements,

      (D) To make property inspections in conjunction with loan servicing, financial counseling, foreclosure, acquisition, management, repair, and resale of the secured interest.

      (iv) That the tribal organization has established standards and procedures that authorize the grantee to legally establish the interest conveyed by a Native American veteran pursuant to subsection (B) and terminate all interest of the veteran in the land and improvements, including:

      (A) Procedures for foreclosing the loan in the event of a default;

      (B) Procedures for acquiring possession of the veteran's interest in the property; and

      (C) Procedures for the resale of the property interest and/or the dwelling purchased, constructed, or improved using the proceeds of the loan.

      (v) That the tribal organization agrees to such other terms and conditions with respect to the making of direct loans to Native American veterans under the jurisdiction of the tribal organization as the Secretary and the tribal organization may negotiate in order to ensure that direct loans made under this section are made in a responsible and prudent manner.

      (c)(1) Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, and notwithstanding the provisions of section 36.4503 of this title, the principal amount of any loan made under this section may not exceed $80,000. The original principal amount of any loan made under this section shall not exceed an amount which bears the same ratio to $80,000 as the amount of the guaranty to which the veteran would be entitled under 38 U.S.C. 3710 at the time the loan is made bears to $36,000.

      (2) The Secretary may make loans which exceed the amount specified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section in geographic areas in which the Secretary has determined that housing costs are significantly higher than average housing costs nationwide. The Secretary shall determine the maximum loan amounts in such areas. The original principal amount of any such loan shall not exceed an amount which bears the same ratio to the maximum loan amount established by the Secretary as the amount of the guaranty to which the veteran would be entitled under 38 U.S.C. 3710 at the time the loan is made bears to $36,000.

      (3) Loans made under this section shall bear interest at a rate determined by the Secretary after considering yields on comparable mortgages in the secondary market, including bid and ask prices on mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by the Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA).

      (d) Notwithstanding the provisions of § 36.4504(b), for loans made under this section, the Native American veteran-borrower shall pay the following loan closing costs to the parties indicated:

      (1) A loan fee of 1.25 percent of the total loan amount (2 percent for Reservists who qualify under the provisions of 38 U.S.C. 3701(b)(5)) to the Department of Veterans Affairs. All or part of such fee may be paid in cash at loan closing or all or part of the fee may be included in the loan without regard to the reasonable value of the property or the maximum loan amount. In computing the fee, the Department of Veterans Affairs will disregard any amount included in the loan to enable the borrower to pay such fee.

      (2) The fee described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section shall not be collected from a veteran who is receiving compensation (or who but for the receipt of retirement pay would be entitled to receive compensation) or from a surviving spouse described in § 3701(b)(2) of title 38 U.S.C.

No service or brokerage fee shall be charged against the Native American veteran-borrower by any third party for procuring a direct loan.

      (e)(1) The credit underwriting standards of 38 CFR 36.4337 shall apply to loans made under this section except to the extent the Secretary determines that they should be modified on account of the purpose of the program to make available housing to Native American veterans living on trust lands.

      (2) The Secretary shall determine the reasonable value of the leasehold or other property interest that will serve as security for a loan made under this section in accordance with § 37.4519, of this chapter, unless the Secretary determines that such requirements are impractical to implement in a geographic area, on particular trust lands, or under circumstances specified by the Secretary.

      (f) In connection with the origination of any loan under this section, the Secretary may make advances in cash to provide for repairs, alterations, and improvements and to meet incidental expenses of the loan transaction.

      (g) Loans made under this section shall be amortized under a generally recognized plan which provides for equal monthly installments consisting of principal and interest, except for the final installment, which may not be in excess of two times the regular monthly installment. The limitation on the amount of the final installment shall not apply in the case of any loan extended, ballooned and/or reamortized.

If such a requirement, condition, or limitation is of an administrative or procedural nature, such action may be taken by any employee authorized to act under paragraph (j) of this section.

      (a) In addition to the loan fee required pursuant to 38 U.S.C. 3729, if any, the Secretary may, in connection with the origination of a vendee loan, charge a borrower a loan origination fee not to exceed one-and-a-half percent of the loan amount.

      (b) All or part of such fee may be paid in cash at loan closing or all or part may be included in the loan. The Secretary will not increase the loan origination fee because the borrower chooses to include such fee in the loan amount financed.

      (c) In no event may the total fee agreed upon between the Secretary and the borrower result in an amount that will cause the loan to be designated as a high-cost mortgage as defined in 15 U.S.C. 1602(bb) and 12 CFR part 1026.

    Subpart E—Sale of Loans, Guarantee of Payment, and Flood Insurance

      § 36.4600   Sale of loans, guarantee of payment.

#### § § 36.4600

      (a) Whenever loans are sold by the Department of Veterans Affairs, they will be clearly identified as loans sold with or without recourse.

      (b) The payment of all loans sold with recourse shall be guaranteed in accordance with the provisions of this section.

      (c) Wherever the term “holder” appears in this section it shall mean the purchaser of a loan sold by the Secretary and any subsequent transferee or assignee of such loan. The holder of each loan sold subject to guaranty shall be deemed to have agreed with the Secretary as follows:

      (1) To furnish the Secretary with notice of default within 60 days after a loan has become two full installments in default.

      (2) To maintain on the real estate a lien of the dignity assigned or transferred to the purchaser by the Secretary.

      (3) To maintain insurance in an amount sufficient to protect the security against risks or hazards to which it may be subjected to the extent customary in the locality, and to apply the proceeds of loss payments to the loan balance or the restoration of the security, as the holder may in the holder's discretion deem proper. Flood insurance will be required on any building or personal property securing a loan at any time during the term of the loan that such security is located in an area identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency as having special flood hazards and in which flood insurance has been made available under the National Flood Insurance Act, as amended. The amount of flood insurance must be at least equal to the lesser of the outstanding principal balance of the loan or the maximum limit of coverage available for the particular type of property under the National Flood Insurance Act, as amended. The notice requirements of 38 CFR 36.4709 shall apply to loans sold pursuant to this section.

      (4) To obtain a consideration equal to the fair market value of any real estate released from the first lien securing the loan, except where the loan will be paid in full, and to apply the entire consideration in reduction of the principal balance of the loan.

      (5) To maintain the tax and insurance account as provided for in the loan instruments and to pay accrued taxes, special assessments, ground or water rents and premiums on fire or other insurance properly chargeable to the tax and insurance account.

      (6) To submit to the Secretary notice of any suit or action or other legal or equitable proceeding to which the holder is a party (including a copy of every procedural paper filed on behalf of the holder or served on the holder), brought on or in connection with a loan sold under this section or involving title to, or other lien on, the property securing the loan, within the time that would be required if the Secretary were a party to the proceeding.

      (7) To submit to the Secretary for prior approval any proposal to recast or extend the repayment terms of the loan.

      (8) To take no action to accelerate the indebtedness or terminate the debtor's interest in the property without the prior approval of the Secretary.

      (9) To make advances only for the maintenance and repairs reasonably necessary for the preservation of the security, or for the payment of accrued taxes, special assessments, ground or water rents, premiums on fire or other insurance against loss or damage to the property, or for other purposes approved in advance by the Secretary.

      (10) To furnish the Secretary prompt notice of the cancellation of any repurchase endorsement or notice on the note or bond upon the payment in full of any loan sold pursuant to this section or of the release of the Secretary from liability to repurchase the loan.

      (11) To maintain adequate accounting records and to provide the Secretary with such data relating to the loan as the Secretary may request incident to the Secretary's determination of the amount payable in connection with a request for the repurchase of the loan.

      (12) To service the loans properly in accordance with established practices.

      (13) To permit the Secretary to inspect, examine or audit at reasonable times and places the records of loans which are subject to repurchase under this section.

      (14) To sell any loan to the Secretary for the amount specified in paragraph (e)(1) of this section upon request of the Secretary if the loan is six (6) full installments or more in default.

      (15) To dispose of partial payments in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph. A partial payment is a remittance on a loan in default of any amount less than the full amount due under the terms of the loan and security instruments at the time the remittance is tendered; a default is a failure of a borrower to comply with the terms of a loan agreement.

      (i) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(15)(ii) of this section, or upon the express waiver of the Secretary, the mortgage holder shall accept any partial payment and either apply it to the mortgagor's account or identify it with the mortgagor's account and hold it in a special account pending disposition. When partial payments held for disposition aggregate a full monthly installment, including escrow, they shall be applied to the mortgagor's account.

      (ii) A partial payment may be returned to the mortgagor, within 10 calendar days from date of receipt of such payment, with a letter of explanation only if one or more of the following conditions exist:

      () The property is wholly or p_a_rtially tenant-occupied and rental payments are not being remitted to the holder for application to the loan account;

      () The payment is less than one full monthly installment, including escrows and late charge, if applica_b_le, unless the lesser payment amount has been agreed to under a written repayment plan;

      () The payment is less than 50 per_c_ent of the total amount then due, unless the lesser payment amount has been agreed to under a written repayment plan;

      () The payment is less than the amount agree_d_ to in a written repayment plan;

      () Th_e_ amount tendered is in the form of personal check and the holder has previously notified the mortgagor in writing that only cash or certified remittances are acceptable;

      () A delinquency o_f_ any amount has continued for at least 6 months since the account first became delinquent and no written repayment plan has been arranged.

      () The loan has been submitted to the Department of Veterans Affairs for repurchase;

      () T_h_e lien position of the security instrument would be jeopardized by acceptance of the partial payment.

      (iii) A failure by the holder to comply with the provisions of this paragraph may result in a deduction from the repurchase price pursuant to paragraph (e)(1) of this section.

      (16) To obtain and forward a current credit report(s) on the debtor(s) to the Secretary when requesting that the Secretary repurchase the loan.

      (d) The Secretary's guaranty liability under this section shall consist of and be limited solely to liability to repurchase the loan from the holder thereof whenever,

      (1) The debtor is in default by reason of nonpayment of not less than two full installments and default has continued for three months or more on the date the holder submits its written request for repurchase by the Secretary; or

      (2) The property securing the loan has been abandoned by the debtor; or

      (3) The debtor has failed to comply with any other covenant or obligation of the loan contract and on the date of the holder's request for repurchase such failure has continued for more than 90 days after the holder's demand for compliance with the covenant or obligation, except that if the failure is due to nonpayment of real estate taxes the failure to pay when due has persisted for a continuing period of 180 days; or

      (4) The Secretary determines, upon request of the holder to repurchase any loan, that such repurchase is in the best interests of the Government notwithstanding that the account is ineligible for repurchase under paragraphs (d) (1) through (3) of this section.

      (e)(1) A cash payment shall be made to the holder upon the repurchase of a loan by the Secretary and shall be an amount equal to the price paid by the purchaser when the loan was sold by the Secretary, less repayments received by the holder which are properly applicable to the principal balance of the loan, plus any advances made for the purposes described in paragraph (c)(9) of this section, but no payments shall be made for accrued unpaid interest, except that with respect to loans sold by the Secretary after July 15, 1970, payment will be made for unpaid accrued interest from the date of the first uncured default to the date of the claim for repurchase, but not in excess of interest for 120 days. If, however, there has been a failure of any holder to comply with the provisions of paragraph (c) of this section the Secretary shall be entitled to deduct from the repurchase price otherwise payable such amount as the Secretary determines to be necessary to restore the Secretary to the position the Secretary would have occupied upon repurchase of the loan in the absence of any such failure. Incident to the repurchase by the Secretary, the holder will pay to the Secretary an amount equal to the balance, if any, remaining in the tax and insurance account.

      (2) The holder shall be deemed to have received as trustee for the benefit of the Secretary any amounts received on account of the loan indebtedness subsequent to submitting its request to repurchase and shall pay such amounts to the Department of Veterans Affairs upon the assignment and delivery of the note, bond and security instruments to the Department of Veterans Affairs.

      (3) The holder may be reimbursed for the cost of a current credit report(s) on the debtor(s) which is (are) forwarded to the Secretary along with the request for repurchase and for any other costs or expenses incurred which are approved in advance by the Secretary as being necessary to protect the Government's interest.

      (f) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the Secretary shall be released from liability and shall not be obligated to repurchase any loan in respect to which:

      (1) An obligor has been released from personal liability by any act or omission of the holder without the prior approval of the Secretary, except that a holder shall not be under any duty to establish the debt as a valid claim against the assets of the estate of any deceased or bankrupt obligor when such failure will not impair the validity or effectiveness of the lien securing the loan; or

      (2) The holder has instituted foreclosure action against the property securing the loan without the prior approval of the Secretary, and such action has proceeded to the point where the judicial sale or sale under the power in the deed of trust has been held or the owner's interest in the property has been terminated by the holder by strict foreclosure, acceptance of a voluntary deed, or by other liquidation action; or

      (3) Any material alteration has been made to the note, bond, security instrument, or installment sale contract after sale and delivery of the instruments by the Secretary to the purchaser.

      (g)(1) Each employee of the Department of Veterans Affairs heretofore or hereafter appointed to or lawfully filling, any position designated in paragraph (g)(2) of this section is hereby delegated authority within the limitations and conditions prescribed by law to exercise the powers and functions of the Secretary with respect to the sale, assignment, transfer, and repurchase of loans, including, but not limited to the offering of such loans for sale, the acceptance of purchase offers, the assignment or transfer of notes or bonds and security instruments evidencing the loans sold, granting the prior approval of the Secretary under this section, determining the eligibility of the loans for repurchase and to calculate and pay the sum due the holder upon repurchase of the loan by the Department of Veterans Affairs.

      (2) Designated positions:

      (h) No waiver, consent, or approval required or authorized by this section shall be valid unless in writing signed by an employee of the Department of Veterans Affairs authorized in this section to act for the Secretary.

      (i) Whenever prior approval or consent of the Secretary is desired in respect to an action to be taken by a holder of a loan, the holder may address such request to the Loan Guaranty Officer in the Regional Office or Center having jurisdiction over the area in which the real estate security is located.

      (j) Notwithstanding any requirement, condition, or limitation stated in or imposed by this section concerning the sale and repurchase of loans, the Under Secretary for Benefits, or the Executive Director, Loan Guaranty Service, within the limitations and conditions prescribed by the Secretary may take such action as may be necessary or appropriate to relieve undue prejudice to a holder, debtor or other person, which might otherwise result, as long as such action shall not impair the vested rights of any person affected thereby. If such requirement, condition, or limitation is of an administrative or procedural nature, such action may be taken by an employee authorized to act under paragraph (g) of this section.

      (k) This section will apply to all loans sold by the Department of Veterans Affairs after the effective date of this section which were originated or acquired by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs under chapter 37, title 38, U.S.C., or title III of the Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944, as amended, except that it shall not apply to direct loans sold pursuant to section 3711(g) of chapter 37, title 38, U.S.C.

      § 36.4802   General purpose of the COVID-19 Veterans Assistance Partial Claim Payment program.

#### § § 36.4802

      The COVID-19 Veterans Assistance Partial Claim Payment program is a temporary program to help veterans who have suffered a COVID-19 financial hardship. Notwithstanding the requirements elsewhere in this part regarding payment of a guaranty claim or refunding a loan, VA may assist a veteran exiting a COVID-19 forbearance by purchasing from the servicer the veteran's COVID-19 indebtedness. Such a purchase is called a partial claim payment. In exchange for VA's partial claim payment on behalf of the veteran, the veteran must agree to repay the Secretary, in the amount of such partial claim payment, upon loan terms established by the Secretary.

      § 36.4803   General requirements of the COVID-19 Veterans Assistance Partial Claim Payment program.

#### § § 36.4803

      The following general requirements must be met before the Secretary will allow for participation in the COVID-19 Veterans Assistance Partial Claim Payment program:

      (a) The loan for which a partial claim payment is requested must be a guaranteed loan that was either—

      (1) Current or less than 30 days past due on March 1, 2020; or

      (2) Made on or after March 1, 2020;

      (b) The veteran on whose behalf VA will pay a partial claim payment both received a COVID-19 forbearance and missed at least one scheduled monthly payment;

      (c) There remains unpaid at least one scheduled monthly payment that the veteran did not make while under a COVID-19 forbearance;

      (d) The veteran indicates that the veteran can resume making scheduled monthly payments, on time and in full, and that the veteran occupies, as the veteran's residence, the property securing the guaranteed loan for which the partial claim payment is requested; and

      (e) The veteran executes, in a timely manner, all loan documents necessary to establish an obligation to repay the Secretary for the partial claim payment.

      § 36.4804   Partial claim payment as a home retention option.

#### § § 36.4804

      (a) The Veterans Assistance Partial Claim Payment program is designed to address the financial hardships due, directly or indirectly, to the COVID-19 national emergency. A servicer may therefore use the partial claim payment option, even in cases where other home retention options are feasible, provided the partial claim payment option is in the veteran's financial interest.

      (b) If the veteran notifies the servicer that the veteran does not want to retain ownership of the property securing the guaranteed loan, the servicer may immediately proceed to offering an alternative to foreclosure.

      § 36.4805   Terms of the partial claim payment.

#### § § 36.4805

      (a) In order for a partial claim payment to be payable, the servicer must submit to the Secretary, not later than 120 days after the date the veteran exits the COVID-19 forbearance, a request for such payment, as prescribed in § 36.4807.

      (b) The amount of the partial claim payment that VA will pay to the servicer, as calculated under paragraph (e) of this section, shall not exceed 30 percent of the unpaid principal balance of the guaranteed loan. For the purposes of this paragraph (b), the unpaid principal balance of the guaranteed loan means such balance as of the date the veteran entered into a COVID-19 forbearance.

      (c) VA will pay only one partial claim payment per guaranteed loan.

      (d) VA will pay only one partial claim payment per veteran.

      (e)(1) Because VA will pay only one partial claim payment per guaranteed loan, and only one partial claim payment per veteran, a servicer must, when calculating the amount of partial claim payment to be paid by VA to the servicer, include the full amount of indebtedness that is necessary to bring the guaranteed loan current.

      (2) To bring the guaranteed loan current, servicers must include the full COVID-19 indebtedness, comprising—

      (i) All scheduled but missed monthly payments of principal and interest; and

      (ii) As applicable, all scheduled but missed monthly escrow payments for real estate taxes and insurance premiums, or where the guaranteed loan documents do not provide for monthly escrowing, all payments the servicer made to real estate tax authorities and insurance providers, on the veteran's behalf, during the COVID-19 forbearance.

      (3) Also in bringing the guaranteed loan current, servicers must include—

      (i) All scheduled monthly payments (comprising principal, interest, and escrow payments for real estate taxes and insurance premiums) due within 31 days of the date the servicer provides to the veteran the note and security instrument described in § 36.4806;

      (ii) If applicable, all scheduled monthly payments (comprising principal, interest, and escrow payments for real estate taxes and insurance premiums) that were missed on or after March 1, 2020, but before the veteran was granted the COVID-19 forbearance; and

      (iii) The actual amount of recording fees, recording taxes, or other charges levied by the recording authority, that must be paid in order to record the security instrument described in § 36.4806.

      (4) Except for amounts identified in paragraphs (e)(2) and (3) of this section, servicers shall not include any amounts ( fees, penalties, or interest) beyond the amounts scheduled or calculated as if the veteran made all contractual payments on time and in full under the terms of the guaranteed loan.

      (5) Nothing in this section shall preclude a veteran from making an optional payment or a servicer from waiving a veteran's indebtedness, such that the amount of partial claim payment would not exceed the 30 percent cap described in paragraph (b) of this section.

      (6) If the servicer miscalculates the partial claim amount, resulting in an overpayment to the servicer, the amount of such overpayment shall constitute a liability of the servicer to the United States. The servicer must remit the overpaid amount immediately to VA.

      (7) If the servicer miscalculates the partial claim amount, resulting in underpayment ( an amount insufficient to bring the guaranteed loan current), the servicer must waive the difference.

      (8) Servicers shall not include any amounts for a monthly payment that is scheduled to be paid on a date that is more than 31 days after the servicer provides to the veteran the note and security instrument described in § 36.4806.

      (f) The servicer must prepare a note and security instrument in favor of the “Secretary of Veterans Affairs, an Officer of the United States”. The name of the incumbent Secretary should not be included unless State law requires naming a real person.

      (1) The note must be consistent with the terms described in § 36.4806 and include all borrowers who are obligated on the guaranteed loan; and

      (2) The security instrument must include all persons (borrowers, as well as non-borrowers) who hold a title interest in the property securing the guaranteed loan.

      (g) Subject to paragraph (a) of this section, all loan documents must be fully executed not later than 90 days after the veteran exits the COVID-19 forbearance.

      (h) The servicer must record the security instrument timely, as prescribed in § 36.4807.

      (i) The servicer must not charge, or allow to be charged, to the veteran any fee in connection with the COVID-19 Veterans Assistance Partial Claim Payment program.

      § 36.4806   Terms of the assistance to the veteran.

#### § § 36.4806

      (a) If a veteran chooses to accept VA's assistance ( a partial claim payment to the servicer, on the veteran's behalf), the veteran, and all co-borrowers on the guaranteed loan, must execute a note and security instrument in favor of the “Secretary of Veterans Affairs, an Officer of the United States”. The name of the incumbent Secretary should not be included unless State law requires naming a real person.

      (b) Specific terms of the note and security instrument shall include the following:

      (1) The amount to be repaid to the Secretary, by the veteran, is the amount calculated under § 36.4805(e);

      (2) Repayment in full is required immediately upon—

      (i) The veteran's transfer of title to the property; or

      (ii) The refinancing or payment in full otherwise of the guaranteed loan with which the partial claim payment is associated.

      (3) A veteran may make payments for the subordinate loan, in whole or in part, without charge or penalty. If the veteran makes a partial prepayment, there will be no changes in the due date unless VA agrees in writing to those changes.

#### § § 36.4807

      (a) The servicer must provide VA with the original note required by § 36.4805. Not later than 180 days following the date the security instrument, required by § 36.4805, is fully executed, the servicer must provide VA with the original security instrument and evidence that the servicer recorded such instrument. If the recording authority causes a delay, the servicer may request an extension of time, in writing, from VA.

      (b) Servicers must report a partial claim event to VA through VA's existing electronic loan servicing system within seven days of the date the veteran returns to the servicer the executed note required by § 36.4805, but not later than 120 days after the date the veteran exits the COVID-19 forbearance.

#### § § 36.4808

      (a) Servicers must continue to service the guaranteed loan in accordance with subpart B of this part.

      (b) The liability of the United States for any guaranteed loan shall decrease or increase pro rata with any decrease or increase of the amount of the unpaid portion of the guaranteed loan. A partial claim payment does not affect the guaranty percentage established at the time the guaranteed loan was made.

      (c) Receipt of a partial claim payment shall not eliminate a servicer's option under 38 U.S.C. 3732 to convey to the Secretary the security for the guaranteed loan.

      § 36.4809   Expiration of the COVID-19 Veterans Assistance Partial Claim Payment program.

#### § § 36.4809

      (b) If a veteran's COVID-19 forbearance does not end until after the date described in paragraph (a) of this section, the Secretary shall accept a request for a partial claim payment, provided that such request is submitted to the Secretary not later than 120 days after the date the veteran exits the COVID-19 forbearance.

      § 36.4810   Oversight of the COVID-19 Veterans Assistance Partial Claim Payment program.

#### § § 36.4810

      (a) Subject to notice and opportunity for a hearing, whenever the Secretary finds with respect to a partial claim payment that any servicer has failed to maintain adequate loan accounting records, or to demonstrate proper ability to service loans adequately or to exercise proper credit judgment or has willfully or negligently engaged in practices otherwise detrimental to the interest of veterans or of the Government, the Secretary may refuse either temporarily or permanently to guarantee or insure any loans made by such servicer and may bar such servicer from servicing or acquiring guaranteed loans.

      (b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, but subject to § 36.4328, the Secretary will not refuse to pay a guaranty or insurance claim on a guaranteed loan theretofore entered into in good faith between a veteran and such servicer.

    (5) A person found, under procedures specified in § 38.618, to have committed a Federal or State crime that would cause the person to be a tier III sex offender for purposes of the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (34 U.S.C. 20901 ) but avoided conviction of such crime by reason of unavailability for trial due to death or flight to avoid prosecution.

    (b)  The prohibition referred to in paragraphs (a)(3) and (5) of this section is not contingent on receipt by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs or any other VA official of notice from any Federal or State official.

    (c)  The Under Secretary for Memorial Affairs is delegated authority to receive from the United States Attorney General and appropriate State officials on behalf of the Secretary of Veterans Affairs the notification referred to in paragraphs (a)(1), (2), and (4) of this section.

    (e)  (1) Upon receipt of a request for interment or memorialization, where the Secretary of Veterans Affairs has not received the notification referred to in paragraph (a)(1), (2), or (4) of this section with regard to the deceased, but the Under Secretary for Memorial Affairs, or his or her designee, has reason to believe that the deceased may have been convicted of a Federal or State capital crime or sex offense as referred to in paragraph (a)(1), (2), or (4) of this section, the Under Secretary for Memorial Affairs, or his or her designee, will initiate an inquiry to either:

    (i) The United States Attorney General, requesting notification of whether the deceased has been convicted of a Federal capital crime or sex offense as referred to in paragraph (a)(1) or (4) of this section; or

    (2) The Under Secretary for Memorial Affairs, or his or her designee, will defer decision on whether to approve interment or memorialization until after a response is received from the Attorney General or appropriate State official.

    (f)  Where an inquiry has been initiated under paragraph (e) of this section, the Under Secretary for Memorial Affairs, or his or her designee, will make a decision on the request for interment or memorialization pursuant to 38 U.S.C. 2411 upon receipt of the notification requested, unless the Under Secretary for Memorial Affairs, or his or her designee, initiates an inquiry pursuant to § 38.618(a).

    (g)  Written notice of a decision under paragraph (d) or (f) of this section will be provided by the Under Secretary for Memorial Affairs, or his or her designee, to the personal representative of the deceased, along with written notice of appellate rights in accordance with § 19.25 of this title.

Action following receipt of a notice of disagreement with a denial of eligibility for interment or memorialization under this section will be in accordance with §§ 19.26 through 19.38 of this title.

> [70 FR 4769, Jan. 31, 2005, as amended at 73 FR 35352, June 23, 2008; 84 FR 5954, Feb. 25, 2019; 89 FR 31638, Apr. 25, 2024]

    § 38.618   Findings concerning commission of a capital crime or certain sex offenses where a person has not been convicted due to death or flight to avoid prosecution.

#### § § 38.618

    (a)  With respect to a request for interment or memorialization, if a cemetery director has reason to believe that a deceased individual who is otherwise eligible for interment or memorialization may have committed a Federal or State capital crime or a Federal or State crime that would cause the person to be a tier III sex offender for purposes of the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (34 U.S.C. 20901 ), but avoided conviction of such crime by reason of unavailability for trial due to death or flight to avoid prosecution, the cemetery director, with the assistance of the VA district counsel, as necessary, will initiate an inquiry seeking information from Federal, State, or local law enforcement officials, or other sources of potentially relevant information. After completion of this inquiry and any further measures required under paragraphs (c) through (f) of this section, the cemetery director will make a decision on the request for interment or memorialization in accordance with paragraph (b), (e), or (g) of this section.

    (b)  (1) If, after conducting the inquiry described in paragraph (a) of this section, the cemetery director determines that there is no clear and convincing evidence that the deceased committed a Federal or State capital crime or a Federal or State crime that would cause the person to be a tier III sex offender for purposes of the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (34 U.S.C. 20901 ) of which he or she was not convicted due to death or flight to avoid prosecution, and the deceased remains otherwise eligible, the cemetery director will make a decision approving the interment or memorialization.

    (2) If the personal representative elects for burial at a location other than a VA national cemetery, or makes alternate arrangements for burial at a location other than a VA national cemetery, the request for interment or memorialization will be considered withdrawn and action on the request will be terminated.

    (c)  (1) If, after conducting the inquiry described in paragraph (a) of this section, the cemetery director determines that there appears to be clear and convincing evidence that the deceased has committed a Federal or State capital crime or a Federal or State crime that would cause the person to be a tier III sex offender for purposes of the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (34 U.S.C. 20901 ) of which he or she was not convicted by reason of unavailability for trial due to death or flight to avoid prosecution, the cemetery director will provide the personal representative of the deceased with a written summary of the evidence of record and a written notice of procedural options.

    (2) The notice of procedural options will inform the personal representative that he or she may, within 15 days of receipt of the notice:

    (i) Request a hearing on the matter;

    (ii) Submit a written statement, with or without supporting documentation, for inclusion in the record;

    (iii) Waive a hearing and submission of a written statement and have the matter forwarded immediately to the Under Secretary for Memorial Affairs for a finding; or

    (iv) Notify the cemetery director that the personal representative is withdrawing the request for interment or memorialization, thereby, closing the claim.

    (3) The notice of procedural options will also inform the personal representative that, if he or she does not exercise one or more of the stated options within the prescribed period, the matter will be forwarded to the Under Secretary for Memorial Affairs for a finding based on the existing record.

    (d)  If a hearing is requested, the Director, Memorial Services Network will conduct the hearing. The purpose of the hearing is to permit the personal representative of the deceased to present evidence concerning whether the deceased committed a crime which would render the deceased ineligible for interment or memorialization in a national cemetery. Testimony at the hearing will be presented under oath, and the personal representative will have the right to representation by counsel and the right to call witnesses. The VA official conducting the hearing will have the authority to administer oaths. The hearing will be conducted in an informal manner and court rules of evidence will not apply. The hearing will be recorded on audiotape and, unless the personal representative waives transcription, a transcript of the hearing will be produced and included in the record.

    (e)  Following a hearing or the timely submission of a written statement, or in the event a hearing is waived or no hearing is requested and no written statement is submitted within the time specified:

    (1) If the cemetery director determines that it has not been established by clear and convincing evidence that the deceased committed a Federal or State capital crime or a Federal or State crime that would cause the person to be a tier III sex offender for purposes of the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (34 U.S.C. 20901 ) of which he or she was not convicted due to death or flight to avoid prosecution, and the deceased remains otherwise eligible, the cemetery director will make a decision approving interment or memorialization; or

    (2) If the cemetery director believes that there is clear and convincing evidence that the deceased committed a Federal or State capital crime or a Federal or State crime that would cause the person to be a tier III sex offender for purposes of the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (34 U.S.C. 20901 ) of which he or she was not convicted due to death or flight to avoid prosecution, the cemetery director will forward a request for a finding on that issue, together with the cemetery director's recommendation and a copy of the record to the Under Secretary for Memorial Affairs.

    (f)  Upon receipt of a request from the cemetery director under paragraph (e) of this section, the Under Secretary for Memorial Affairs will make a finding concerning whether the deceased committed a Federal or State capital crime or a Federal or State crime that would cause the person to be a tier III sex offender for purposes of the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (34 U.S.C. 20901 ) of which he or she was not convicted by reason of unavailability for trial due to death or flight to avoid prosecution. The finding will be based on consideration of the cemetery director's recommendation and the record supplied by the cemetery director.

    (g)  Upon receipt of notification of the finding of the Under Secretary for Memorial Affairs, the cemetery director will make a decision on the request for interment or memorialization pursuant to 38 U.S.C. 2411. In making that decision, the cemetery director will be bound by the finding of the Under Secretary for Memorial Affairs.

    (h)  The cemetery director will provide written notice of the finding of the Under Secretary for Memorial Affairs and of a decision under paragraph (b), (e)(1), or (g) of this section. With notice of any decision denying a request for interment or memorialization, the cemetery director will provide written notice of appellate rights to the personal representative of the deceased, in accordance with § 19.25 of this title. This will include notice of the opportunity to file a notice of disagreement with the decision of the cemetery director and the finding of the Under Secretary for Memorial Affairs. Action following receipt of a notice of disagreement with a denial of eligibility for interment or memorialization under this section will be in accordance with §§ 19.26 through 19.38 of this title.

    § 38.619   Requests for interment, committal services or memorial services, and funeral honors.

#### § § 38.619

    (a)  A personal representative, as defined in § 38.600, may request interment of an eligible decedent in a national cemetery by contacting the National Cemetery Scheduling Office (NCSO) at 1-800-535-1117.

    (1)  VA will request the following information from the decedent's personal representative at the time of the request for interment to allow VA to schedule the interment for the decedent:

    (i) Documentation of the decedent's eligibility for national cemetery interment. If needed, VA will make reasonable efforts to assist the personal representative in obtaining such documentation;

    (ii) Preferred date and time for the interment;

    (iii) Whether a committal service is requested (a committal service is not required);

    (iv) Whether the remains are in a casket or urn. For cremated remains, the personal representative will be advised to present a certificate of cremation or other documentation sufficient to identify the decedent at the time of interment.

    (v) The size of the casket or urn.

    (vi) The contact information for the personal representative.

    (vii) Whether a private vault will be provided to the national cemetery or a government-furnished grave liner is required.

    (viii) Whether the personal representative intends to have funeral honors during the committal service, if the decedent is a veteran.

    (ix) Other relevant information necessary to establish or confirm eligibility of the decedent and/or for cemetery logistics and planning.

    (2)  (i) Consistent with paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section, interment requests pursuant to § 38.620(j) must include the following:

    (A) For decedents who were naturalized under section 2(1) of the Hmong Veterans Naturalization Act of 2000 (the Act), a copy of the official U.S. Certificate of Naturalization. (VA will verify with the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services that the naturalization was pursuant to section 2(1) of the Act.)

    (B) For decedents who were otherwise naturalized, a copy of the U.S. Certificate of Naturalization and documentation of the decedent's honorable service with a special guerilla unit or irregular forces operating from a base in Laos in support of the Armed Forces at any time between February 28, 1961, and May 7, 1975.

    (C) For decedents who were not naturalized but were lawfully admitted for permanent residence in the U.S., a copy of the official documentation of status as a lawful permanent resident, and documentation of the decedent's honorable service with a special guerilla unit or irregular forces operating from a base in Laos in support of the Armed Forces at any time between February 28, 1961, and May 7, 1975.

    (D) Evidence that the decedent resided in the U.S. at the time of death.

    (ii) VA will accept the following types of documentation as evidence of service described in paragraphs (a)(2)(i)(B) and (C) of this section:

    (A) Original documentation issued by a government agency officially documenting the service type, location, and dates served;

    (B) An affidavit of the decedent's superior officer attesting to the type of service, location, and dates served;

    (C) Two affidavits from other individuals who were also serving with such a special guerilla unit or irregular forces and who personally knew of the decedent's service; or

    (D) Other appropriate evidence that factually documents the service, location, and dates served.

    (iii) The DD Form 214, Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty, is not an appropriate documentation of service for purposes of paragraphs (a)(2)(i)(B) and (C) of this section.

    (b)  The personal representative may request a memorial service for a decedent who is eligible for interment in a VA national cemetery. Memorial services may be conducted if the decedent's cremated remains will be scattered and will not be interred, or if the remains of the eligible individual are otherwise not available for interment, or were previously interred without a committal service. The personal representative may request the memorial service by contacting the National Cemetery Scheduling Office (NCSO) at 1-800-535-1117 and providing the following required information:

    (1) Documentation of the decedent's eligibility for national cemetery interment. If needed, VA will make reasonable efforts to assist the personal representative in obtaining such documentation;

    (2) Preferred date and time for the memorial service;

    (3) The contact information for the personal representative;

    (4) Whether the personal representative intends to have funeral honors services during the memorial service, if the decedent is a veteran;

    (5) Other relevant information necessary to establish or confirm eligibility of the decedent and/or for cemetery logistics and planning.

    (c)  VA will respect and defer to the expressed wishes of the personal representative for the content and conduct of a committal or memorial service, including the display of religious or other symbols chosen by the family, the use of all appropriate public areas, and the selection of funeral honors providers, provided that the safety and security of the national cemetery and its visitors are not adversely affected.

    (d)  Committal or memorial services at VA national cemeteries will be held in committal shelters located away from the gravesite to ensure accessibility and visitor safety, unless the cemetery director determines that a committal shelter is not available for logistical reasons, or the cemetery director approves a request from the personal representative for a gravesite service. A request for a gravesite service may be approved by the cemetery director if:

    (1) The service is requested by the decedent's personal representative for religious reasons; and

    (2) The request is made sufficiently prior to the scheduled committal service to ensure the gravesite is accessible; and

    (3) The cemetery director has sufficient staffing resources for the gravesite service, and

    (4) The site can be safely accessed on the day of the service.

    (e)  When scheduling the interment, the decedent's personal representative may request to witness the interment of the decedent's remains without additional services at the committal shelter. Approval of a request for witness-only interment is at the discretion of the cemetery director, and may be made only if:

    (1) The timing of the request provides sufficient time to ensure the gravesite is accessible, and;

    (2) The site can be safely accessed on the day of the interment. This determination may require limiting the number of individuals who may witness the interment and other logistics, such as distance from the gravesite, as the cemetery director finds necessary.

    (f) —(1)  Each cemetery director will maintain a list of organizations that will, upon request, provide funeral honors at the cemetery at no cost to the family. Each list must include DoD funeral honors contacts. Non-DoD funeral honors providers who want to be included on the list must make a request to the cemetery director and meet the requirements of paragraph (f)(5) of this section.

    (2)  Funeral honors will be provided at a committal or memorial service for an eligible individual only if requested by the decedent's personal representative. When scheduling a committal or memorial service for a veteran or other eligible individual who served in the U.S. armed forces, the NCSO will make available to the personal representative the list of available funeral honors providers, as described in paragraph (f)(1) of this section, for the cemetery where interment or services are to be scheduled. The decedent's personal representative may choose any funeral honors provider(s) on the list provided by VA, and/or any other organization that provides funeral honors services.

    (3)  Any agreement to provide funeral honors is exclusively between the organization(s) providing funeral honors and the decedent's personal representative. The composition of a funeral honors detail, as well as the specific content of the ceremony provided during a committal or memorial service is dependent on available resources of the providing organization(s). The Department of Defense (DoD) is responsible for determining eligibility for funeral honors provided by a DoD funeral honors detail. If funeral honors are provided by a combined detail that includes one or more funeral honors providers, all providers must provide services as requested by the personal representative.

    (4)  All organizations performing funeral honors at VA national cemeteries, including DoD organizations and any provider selected by the personal representative that is not on the list of providers provided by VA under paragraph (f)(1) of this section, must:

    (i) Provide to the cemetery director the name and contact information of a representative for the organization who is accountable for funeral honors activities; and

    (ii) Comply with VA security, safety, and law enforcement regulations under 38 CFR 1.218; and

    (iii) Maintain and operate any equipment in a safe manner consistent with VA and DoD policies and regulations; and

    (iv) Not solicit for or accept donations on VA property except as authorized under 38 CFR 1.218(a)(8).

    (5)  Non-DoD funeral honors providers, including any provider selected by the personal representative that is not on the list of providers provided by VA under paragraph (f)(1) of this section, must certify that:

    (i) They will comply with the requirements in subparagraphs (f)(4) of this section;

    (ii) They are conducting activities on federal property as an independent entity, not as an agent or employee of VA, unless registered as a VA volunteer;

    (iii) Members of the organization who will conduct the funeral honors have completed training on funeral honors tasks and the safe use of funeral honors equipment; and

    (iv) The funeral honors will be provided in accordance with the agreement in paragraph (f)(3) of this section between the personal representative and the funeral honors provider.

    (g)  The cemetery director and cemetery staff will allow access to and use of appropriate public areas of the national cemetery by national cemetery visitors, as well as to families and funeral honors providers for service preparations, contemplation, prayer, mourning, or reflection, so long as the safety and security of the national cemetery and cemetery operations are not adversely affected. Appropriate public areas include, but are not limited to, committal shelters, rest areas, chapels, and benches. The cemetery director will ensure that signs adequately identify restricted or non-public areas in the national cemetery.

    (h)  Nothing in this section prohibits or constrains any member of a funeral honors provider, a Veterans Service Organization, or the public from offering a gift or token to a family member of the decedent or any person at a committal or memorial service, provided that no compensation is requested, received, or expected in exchange for such gift or token. Committal or memorial service attendees may accept or decline any such gift or token, and may request that the offeror refrain from making any such offers to the service attendees.

    § 38.621   Disinterments.

#### § § 38.621

    (a) Interments of eligible decedents in national cemeteries are considered permanent and final. Disinterment will be permitted only for cogent reasons and with the prior written authorization of the National Cemetery District Executive Director or Cemetery Director responsible for the cemetery involved. Disinterment from a national cemetery will be approved only when:

    (1) A court order or State instrumentality of competent jurisdiction directs the disinterment; or

    (2) All living immediate family members of the decedent, and the individual who initiated the interment (whether or not the individual is a member of the immediate family), give their written consent.

    (i) If the individual who initiated the interment does not consent, or is not alive to provide consent, or all living immediate family members are not in agreement, anyone seeking disinterment of an eligible decedent must provide VA with an order from a court or State instrumentality of competent jurisdiction to direct the disinterment as provided in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.

    (ii) For purposes of this section, “immediate family members” are defined as surviving spouse, whether or not he or she is or was remarried; all adult children of the decedent; the appointed guardian(s) of minor children; and the appointed guardian(s) of the surviving spouse or of the adult child(ren) of the decedent. If the surviving spouse and all of the children of the decedent are deceased, the decedent's parents will be considered “immediate family members.”

    (b)(1) All requests to disinter remains as described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section must be submitted on VA Form 40-4970, Request for Disinterment, and must include the following information:

    (i) A full statement of reasons for the proposed disinterment.

    (ii) Notarized statement(s) by all living immediate family members of the decedent, and by the person who initiated the interment (whether or not the individual is a member of the immediate family), that all parties consent to the proposed disinterment.

    (iii) A notarized statement by the person requesting the disinterment that those who supplied affidavits comprise all the living immediate family members of the deceased and the individual who initiated the interment.

    (2) If the person provides a false certification on VA Form 40-4970, he or she may be subject to penalties, to include fine or imprisonment or both.

    (c) Any VA-approved disinterment in this section must be accomplished without expense to the Government.

    § 38.622   Reconsideration of prior interment and memorialization decisions.

#### § § 38.622

    (a)  (1) The Under Secretary for Memorial Affairs (USMA) is the appropriate Federal official who may reconsider a prior decision to inter the remains or honor the memory of a person in a national cemetery.

    (2) This section sets out the evaluative criteria and procedures for VA to reconsider prior interment and memorialization decisions for decedents who are subsequently found to have committed or to have been convicted of certain criminal acts that would prohibit them from receiving benefits to which they are otherwise entitled.

    (b)  (1) Upon written notification from the United States Attorney General or an appropriate State official that a person interred or memorialized in a national cemetery after December 20, 2013, was convicted of a Federal or State capital crime and whose conviction meets the requirements of 38 U.S.C. 2411(b)(1) or (2), respectively, or was convicted of a Federal or State crime causing the person to be a tier III sex offender and meets the requirements of 38 U.S.C. 2411(b)(4), the USMA may, upon reconsideration, decide to disinter the remains or remove the memorial headstone or marker of such person from the cemetery.

    (2) If VA has not initially received notification referred to in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, but a cemetery director has reason to believe that a person interred or memorialized in a national cemetery after December 20, 2013, may have been convicted of a Federal or State capital crime meeting the requirements of 38 U.S.C. 2411(b)(1) or (2), respectively, or may have been convicted of a Federal or State crime causing the person to be a tier III sex offender and meets the requirements of 38 U.S.C. 2411(b)(4), the cemetery director will initiate an inquiry to the United States Attorney General or appropriate State official for confirmation and provide the results of such inquiry to the USMA in cases where a conviction is confirmed, which will initiate a reconsideration. The USMA will render a decision on disinterment or memorial headstone or marker removal after reviewing the results of the inquiry submitted by the cemetery director.

    (c)  (1) If a cemetery director has reason to believe that a person interred or memorialized in a national cemetery after December 20, 2013, may have committed a Federal or State capital crime or may have committed a Federal or State crime that would cause the person to be a tier III sex offender under 38 U.S.C. 2411(b)(5), but avoided conviction of such crime by reason of unavailability for trial due to death or flight to avoid prosecution, the cemetery director will initiate an official inquiry seeking information from Federal, State, or local law enforcement officials, or other sources of potentially relevant information.

    (2) If, after conducting the inquiry, the cemetery director determines that there appears to be clear and convincing evidence that the decedent committed a Federal or State capital crime or committed a Federal or State crime that would cause the person to be a tier III sex offender under 38 U.S.C. 2411(b)(5), for which the decedent was not convicted because the decedent was unavailable for trial due to death or flight to avoid prosecution, the cemetery director will provide this information to the USMA who will decide whether to reconsider the prior decision to inter or memorialize the decedent. If the USMA decides to reconsider the prior interment or memorialization decision, the USMA will provide notice of procedural options and follow the procedures in paragraph (d)(2).

    (d)  (1) For cases involving a conviction of a Federal or State capital crime or conviction of a Federal or State crime that would cause the person to be a tier III sex offender under 38 U.S.C. 2411(b)(5), where the USMA decides to disinter or remove a memorial headstone or marker, NCA will provide written notice of that decision to the decedent's next of kin or personal representative. The written notice of decision will be in accordance with 38 U.S.C. 5104 and will include a notice of appellate rights in accordance with 38 CFR 20.200.

    (2) In cases in which a cemetery director has reason to believe that a person interred or memorialized in a national cemetery after December 20, 2013, may have committed a Federal or State capital crime, as described in 38 U.S.C. 2411(f)(1) and (2), or may have committed a Federal or State crime that would cause the person to be a tier III sex offender under U.S.C. 2411(b)(5), but avoided conviction of such crime by reason of unavailability for trial due to death or flight to avoid prosecution, should the USMA decide to reconsider the prior interment or memorialization, prior to rendering written notice of final decision, VA will follow the following process:

    (i) NCA will provide a notice of procedural options, which will inform the decedent's next of kin or personal representative that VA is reconsidering the prior interment or memorialization of the decedent and that they may, within 15 days of receipt of notice: request a hearing on the matter; submit a written statement, with or without supporting documentation, for inclusion in the record; or waive a hearing and submission of a written statement.

    (ii) If a hearing is requested, the District Executive Director will conduct the hearing. The purpose of the hearing is to permit the personal representative of the deceased to present evidence concerning whether the deceased committed a crime that would render the deceased ineligible for interment or memorialization in a national cemetery. Testimony at the hearing will be presented under oath, and the personal representative will have the right to representation by counsel and the right to call witnesses. The VA official conducting the hearing will have the authority to administer oaths. The hearing will be conducted in an informal manner and court rules of evidence will not apply. The hearing will be recorded on audiotape and, unless the personal representative waives transcription, a transcript of the hearing will be produced and included in the record.

    (iii) Following a hearing or the timely submission of a written statement, or in the event a hearing is waived or no hearing is requested and no written statement is submitted within the time specified, the USMA will decide whether there is clear and convincing evidence that the decedent committed a Federal or State capital crime or a Federal or State crime that would cause the person to be a tier III sex offender under 38 U.S.C. 2411(b)(5), for which the decedent was not convicted due to the decedent's unavailability for trial due to death or flight to avoid prosecution. If the USMA decides that clear and convincing evidence does not exist, the USMA will notify the next of kin or personal representative that the decedent may remain interred or that the decedent's memorial headstone or marker may remain in the national cemetery. If the USMA decides that clear and convincing evidence exists, the USMA will provide written notice of the decision to disinter the decedent or remove the decedent's memorial headstone or marker. The written notice of decision will be in accordance with 38 U.S.C. 5104 and will include a notice of appellate rights in accordance with 38 CFR 20.200.

    (3) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, a notice of disagreement with the decision of the USMA must be filed within 60 days from the date of the notice of decision, and the only method of appeal from a notice of decision issued under this section is through review by the Board of Veterans' Appeals. Action following receipt of a notice of disagreement with reversal of an interment or memorialization decision under this section will be in accordance with 38 CFR part 20.

    (e)  A decision to disinter the remains or remove a memorial headstone or marker becomes final either by failure of the next of kin or personal representative to appeal the decision or by final disposition of the appeal. In such cases, the cemetery director shall take the following actions:

    (1) In the case of disinterment, the cemetery director will contact the next of kin or personal representative to coordinate the transfer of remains from the national cemetery to another location. The next of kin or personal representative will have 30 days to respond to the cemetery director.

    (i) If the next of kin or personal representative responds to the notice within the 30-day period, the cemetery director will coordinate a date and time for the disinterment and release of the decedent's remains to the next of kin or personal representative for transport from the national cemetery to a place determined by the next of kin or personal representative. The cemetery director will perform the disinterment. The next of kin or personal representative will bear responsibility and cost for transportation of the remains from the cemetery, including compliance with applicable state laws concerning the disinterment and transport of remains from the national cemetery, and any costs associated with the subsequent disposition of remains.

    (ii) If the next of kin or personal representative does not respond to the notice within the 30-day period, indicates refusal to accept the decedent's remains, or fails to appear, the cemetery director will determine a suitable cemetery for the disposition of the decedent's remains and, at government expense, will make all necessary arrangements to disinter, transport, reinter, and mark the grave of the decedent with a non-government headstone or marker within a reasonable time frame. The non-government headstone or marker will include the decedent's name, date of birth, and date of death. The cemetery director will then notify the next of kin or personal representative of the date and time on which the disinterment was performed and the new location of the decedent's remains.

    (2) In the case of a memorial headstone or marker, the cemetery director will remove the headstone or marker from the cemetery and notify the next of kin or personal representative of the date on which this action was taken.

    § 38.628   Allowance for caskets and urns for unclaimed remains of veterans.

#### § § 38.628

    (a) VA will issue a flat-rate allowance, as established in paragraph (d) of this section, to any individual or entity for a casket or urn, purchased by the individual or entity for the burial in a national cemetery or in a veterans' cemetery of a State or Tribal Organization that has received a grant under 38 U.S.C. 2408, of an eligible deceased veteran for whom VA:

    (1) Is unable to identify the veteran's next-of-kin; and

    (2) Determines that sufficient resources are otherwise unavailable to furnish the casket or urn.

    (b) For purposes of satisfying the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section, VA will rely entirely on the requesting individual's or entity's certification as required under paragraphs (c)(2) and (3) of this section.

    (c) An individual or entity may request an allowance from VA under paragraph (a) of this section by completing and submitting VA Form 40-10088 and supporting documentation, in accordance with the instructions on the form. Prior to approving issuance of an allowance, VA must find all of the following:

    (1) The veteran is eligible for burial in a VA national cemetery or in a veterans' cemetery of a State or Tribal Organization that has received a grant under 38 U.S.C. 2408;

    (2) The individual or entity has certified that they cannot identify the veteran's next-of-kin, or that an identified next-of-kin is unwilling or unable to assume responsibility for the deceased veteran's burial arrangements, and that the individual or entity has followed applicable state or local law relating to the disposition of unclaimed remains;

    (3) The individual or entity has certified that, to the best of their knowledge, sufficient resources are otherwise unavailable to furnish the casket or urn;

    (4) The invoice presented by the individual or entity clearly indicates the purchase price of the casket or urn purchased by the individual or entity; and

    (5) The invoice presented by the individual or entity contains information sufficient for VA to determine, in conjunction with a visual inspection, that the casket or urn meets the following standards:

    (i) Caskets must be of metal construction of at least 20-gauge thickness, designed for containing human remains, sufficient to contain the remains of the deceased veteran, and include external fixed rails or swing arm handles.

    (ii) Urns must be of a durable construction, such as durable plastic, wood, metal, or ceramic, designed to contain cremated human remains, and include a secure closure to contain the cremated remains.

    (d) The allowance for a claim received in any calendar year under paragraph (a) of this section is $1,199.00 for a metal casket and $138.00 for an urn of durable material.

    (e) VA will make cost-of-living adjustments for the flat-rate casket and urn allowances using the Consumer Price Index (CPI). Each fiscal year, VA will provide a percentage increase (rounded to the nearest dollar) in the casket and urn flat-rate allowances equal to the percentage by which the CPI (all items, United States city average) for the 12-month period (June to June) preceding the beginning of the fiscal year for which the percentage increase is made exceeds the CPI for the 12-month period preceding the 12-month period described in this paragraph (e). VA will only make cost-of-living increases to the flat rate allowances when the CPI has increased.

    § 38.629   Outer burial receptacles.

#### § § 38.629

    (a) — For purposes of this section, an outer burial receptacle means a graveliner, burial vault, or other similar type of container for a casket.

    (b)  (1) This section provides for payment of a monetary allowance for an outer burial receptacle for any interment with casketed remains in a VA national cemetery where a privately purchased outer burial receptacle has been used in lieu of a Government-furnished graveliner and, for any interment on or after January 5, 2023, in a cemetery that is the subject of a grant to a State or Tribal organization under 38 U.S.C. 2408 where a privately purchased outer burial receptacle has been used.

    (2) This section also provides for payment of a monetary allowance for outer burial receptacles placed at the time of interment, for burials on or after January 5, 2023, in a cemetery that is the subject of a grant awarded to a State or Tribal organization under 38 U.S.C. 2408.

    (3) This section also provides for reimbursement of the cost of pre-placed outer burial receptacles that are installed as part of construction or expansion of a cemetery that is the subject of a grant awarded on or after January 5, 2023, to a State or Tribal organization under 38 U.S.C. 2408.

    (c)  In burials where a casket already exists in a grave with or without an outer burial receptacle, subsequent placement of a second casket in an outer burial receptacle will not be permitted in the same grave unless the cemetery director determines that the already interred casket will not be damaged.

    (d)  (1) VA will pay a monetary allowance for each casket burial in a VA national cemetery where a privately purchased outer burial receptacle was used in lieu of a Government-furnished graveliner. Payment will be made to the person identified in records contained in the National Cemetery Administration (NCA) electronic ordering system as the person who paid for the outer burial receptacle. No application is required to receive payment of this monetary allowance as the payment is processed automatically based on entry in the system.

    (2) VA will pay a monetary allowance for each casket burial in a cemetery that is the subject of a grant to a State or Tribal organization under 38 U.S.C. 2408, where a privately purchased outer burial receptacle was used on or after January 5, 2023. The person who paid for the outer burial receptacle must submit a request for payment of the allowance on the appropriate VA form. The request must be verified by the cemetery director where the burial occurred.

    (e)  (1) VA will pay a monetary allowance for outer burial receptacles placed at the time of interment for burials on or after January 5, 2023, in a cemetery that is the subject of a grant to a State or Tribal organization under 38 U.S.C. 2408. Such payments may be issued on a quarterly basis and will be paid to the State agency or Tribal organization.

    (2) VA will pay the allowance only if a State or Tribal organization submits a request for payment on the appropriate VA form. Requests may be submitted on a quarterly basis for the total number of burials that required an outer burial receptacle in that quarter and for which a fee for the outer burial receptacle was not charged to the decedent's family or other responsible party. Requests for payment under this section for burials that occur from January 5, 2023, through December 31, 2024, must be submitted by December 31, 2025. Requests for payment under this section for burials that occur on or after January 1, 2025, must be submitted within 1 year of interment.

    (3) No payment may be made for burials where a fee for the outer burial receptacle was charged to the decedent's family or other responsible party.

    (f)  (1) The monetary allowance will be the average cost, as determined by VA, of Government-furnished graveliners, less the administrative costs incurred by VA in processing and paying the allowance.

    (i) The average cost of Government-furnished graveliners will be based upon the actual average cost to the Government of such graveliners during the most recent fiscal year ending prior to the start of the calendar year for which the amount of the allowance will be used. This average cost will be determined by taking VA's total cost during that fiscal year for single-depth graveliners which were procured for placement at the time of interment and dividing it by the total number of such graveliners procured by VA during that fiscal year. The calculation shall exclude both graveliners procured and pre-placed in gravesites as part of cemetery gravesite development projects and all double-depth graveliners.

    (ii) The administrative costs incurred by VA will consist of those costs that relate to processing and paying an allowance, as determined by VA, for the calendar year ending prior to the start of the calendar year for which the amount of the allowance will be used.

    (2) The amount of the allowance for each calendar year will be published in the “Notices” section of the  The  notice will also provide, as information, the determined average cost of Government-furnished graveliners and the determined amount of the administrative costs to be deducted.

    (g)  (1) VA will reimburse the cost of outer burial receptacles that are pre-placed as part of new construction, expansion, or improvement of a cemetery that is the subject of a grant to a State or Tribal organization under 38 U.S.C. 2408 if the grant was awarded on or after January 5, 2023. The reimbursement will be paid to the State or Tribal organization or, if designated by the State or Tribal organization representative, the State or Tribal veterans cemetery for which such project is being carried out, or to any other State or Tribal organization, agency, or instrumentality.

    (2) States and Tribal organizations must submit a request for reimbursement of the cost of pre-placed outer burial receptacles using Standard Form 271, Outlay Report and Request for Reimbursement for Construction Programs, with supporting documentation. The Director of the Veterans Cemetery Grants Program must review and certify the request for payment. Funds paid under this section for pre-placed outer burial receptacles, as part of an approved establishment, expansion, and improvement project shall be used solely for payment of such outer burial receptacles. As a condition for payment, the representative of the State or Tribal organization must submit to VA an invoice reporting the cost for purchase and delivery of outer burial receptacles.

    (h)  A State or Tribal organization that seeks reimbursement for the cost of outer burial receptacles under this section will be subject to inspections, audits, and reports in accordance with § 39.122 of this chapter.

    (B) Has deteriorated to the extent it no longer serves to identify the buried decedent (e.g., identifying elements of an inscription are not legible, such as a decedent's name or a grave number for an unknown decedent), or, in the case of a medallion, no longer serves to identify the buried decedent as a veteran or as a Medal of Honor recipient if applicable; or

    (C) Has been stolen or vandalized; or

    (D) Is the incorrect style or type for the veteran's era of service; or

    (E) Requires changing or adding inscription information for the following reasons:

    () To correct errors in factual information (such as name or date of birth or death) provided to VA as part of the initial application process; or

    () To indicate information related to the deceased's military service that is provided to VA after the initial application process (such as the deceased's posthumous receipt of military awards); or

    () To identify on a single headstone or marker multiple decedents who are each eligible for a headstone or marker and who are buried in the same gravesite in a cemetery, to include identification of a spouse or dependent in accordance with _3_8 U.S.C. 2306(g)(1); or

    () To indicate the deceased's status as a Medal of Honor recipient if applicable, for a headstone or marker provided for a marked grave under paragraph (a)(2) of this section, in accordance with 38 U.S.C. 2306(d)(5)(B).

    () For any reason not listed in paragraphs (b)(3)(i)(E)() through () of this section, if the request to change or add inscription information is received from the decedent's next of kin as indicated in NCA's records systems, within six months of the initial headstone or marker being provided.

    (ii) To the extent practicable, replacement burial headstones, markers, and medallions will be of the same style and type (to include inscription information) as those headstones, markers, or medallions being replaced, except that style, type, or inscription information may differ for replacements if one of the criteria in paragraph (b)(3)(i)(D) or (E) is the reason for replacement.

    (iii) Requests to replace Government-furnished burial headstones, markers, or medallions are made as follows:

    (A) Through NCA's electronic ordering systems, when the headstone, marker, or medallion to be replaced is located in a cemetery that uses NCA electronic ordering systems; or

    (B) By completing and submitting VA Form 40-1330 or VA Form 40-1330M, when the headstone, marker, or medallion to be replaced is located in a cemetery that does not use NCA's electronic ordering systems.

    (ii) VA will not pay costs associated with affixing a medallion provided under paragraph (a)(2) of this section to a privately purchased headstone or marker in a non-national cemetery, but VA will deliver such medallion directly to the applicant.

Knowingly converting Government property to private use (such as using whole or partial headstones or markers in structures or landscaping or offering such items for sale) is a violation of Federal law under 18 U.S.C. 641.

    (ii) Under 38 CFR 1.218(b)(5), the destruction, mutilation, defacement, injury, or removal of any monument, gravestone, or other structure within the limits of any national cemetery is prohibited, with an associated fine of $500. Under 18 U.S.C. 1361, willful depredation of any property of the United States ( a headstone or marker in a non-national cemetery) shall be punishable by a fine or imprisonment under title 18 of the United States Code.

    (iii) When a Government-furnished burial headstone, marker, or medallion is removed from any cemetery, it should be properly disposed. Unless a headstone or marker that has been removed from a cemetery would be maintained by NCA for historic purposes, or in cases of disinterment would be relocated to a different gravesite, such headstones or markers made of stone must be physically broken into small enough pieces to ensure no portion of the inscription is legible and to ensure no part is available for any private, personal, or commercial use, and those made of bronze must be returned to VA for recycling.

    (vi) Any individual, if the dates of service of the veteran to be memorialized, or on whose service the eligibility of another individual for memorialization is based, ended prior to April 6, 1917.

    (2)  Ascertainable means inscribed on the headstone or marker or discoverable from some inscription on the headstone or marker that corresponds to information that is reasonably accessible by the public (e.g., a corresponding burial ledger at the cemetery, or publicly available burial information accessible on the internet).

    (i) A Government-furnished headstone or marker has not been erected or installed at or by the grave, or the condition of a Government-furnished headstone or marker erected or installed at or by the grave warrants replacement under paragraph (b)(3) of this section; and

    (A) Has not been erected or installed at or by the grave, or

    § 38.632   Emblems of belief.

#### § § 38.632

    (a)  This section contains procedures for requesting the inscription of new emblems of belief on Government-furnished headstones and markers.

    (b)  For purposes of this section:

    (1)  means the decedent's next-of-kin (NOK), a person authorized in writing by the NOK, or a personal representative authorized in writing by the decedent to apply for a new emblem of belief for inscription on a Government-furnished headstone or marker.

    (2)  means an emblem that represents the decedent's religious affiliation or sincerely held religious belief system, or a sincerely held belief system that was functionally equivalent to a religious belief system in the life of the decedent. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, VA will accept as genuine an applicant's statement regarding the sincerity of the religious or functionally equivalent belief system of a deceased eligible individual. The religion or belief system represented by an emblem need not be associated with or endorsed by a church, group or organized denomination. Emblems of belief do not include social, cultural, ethnic, civic, fraternal, trade, commercial, political, professional or military emblems. VA will not accept any emblem that would have an adverse impact on the dignity and solemnity of cemeteries honoring those who served the Nation, including (but not limited to) emblems that contain explicit or graphic depictions or descriptions of sexual organs or sexual activities that are shocking, titillating, or pandering in nature; and emblems that display coarse or abusive language or images.

    (3)  means a VA National Cemetery, Arlington National Cemetery, the Soldiers' and Airmen's Home National Cemetery, a military post or base cemetery of the Armed Forces, a service department academy cemetery, and a Department of the Interior National Cemetery.

    (4)  means headstones or markers that are furnished by the Government to mark the grave or memorialize a deceased eligible veteran or eligible family member.

    (5)  means a cemetery operated and maintained by a State or territory for the benefit of deceased eligible veterans or eligible family members.

    (c)  When there is an immediate need, and the applicant requests a new emblem of belief for inscription on a new, first Government-furnished headstone or marker for a deceased eligible individual, the following procedures will apply:

    (d)  The applicant must identify the deceased eligible individual for whom a request has been made to add a new emblem of belief to those emblems of belief available for inscription on Government-furnished headstones and markers. The application must include the following:

    (1) Certification by the applicant that the proposed new emblem of belief represents the decedent's religious affiliation or sincerely held religious belief system, or a sincerely held belief system that was functionally equivalent to a religious belief system in the life of the decedent.

    (2) A three-inch diameter digitized black and white representation of the requested emblem that is free of copyright or trademark restrictions or authorized by the owner for inscription on Government-furnished headstones and markers and can be reproduced in a production-line environment in stone or bronze without loss of graphic quality.

    (e)  If VA determines that an application for a new emblem of belief is incomplete, VA will notify the applicant in writing of any missing information and that he or she has 60 days to submit such information or no further action will be taken. If the applicant does not submit all required information or demonstrate that he or she has good cause for failing to provide the information within 60 days of the notice, then the applicant will be notified in writing that no further action will be taken on the request for a new emblem.

    (f)  The Director of NCA's Office of Field Programs shall forward to the Under Secretary for Memorial Affairs all complete applications, any pertinent records or information, and the Director's recommendation after evaluating whether:

    (1) The applicant has demonstrated that there is an immediate need to inscribe the emblem on a new, first, Government-furnished headstone or marker for a deceased eligible individual, unless good cause is shown for an exception;

    (2) The applicant has submitted a certification concerning the emblem that meets the requirements of paragraph (d)(1) of this section.

    (i) In the absence of evidence to the contrary, VA will accept as genuine an applicant's statement regarding the sincerity of the religious or functionally equivalent belief system of a deceased eligible individual. If a factual dispute arises concerning whether the requested emblem represents the sincerely held religious or functionally equivalent belief of the decedent, the Director will evaluate whether the decedent gave specific instructions regarding the appropriate emblem during his or her life and the Under Secretary will resolve the dispute on that basis.

    (ii) In the absence of such instructions, the Under Secretary will resolve the dispute in accordance with the instructions of the decedent's surviving spouse. If the decedent is not survived by a spouse, the Under Secretary will resolve the dispute in accordance with the agreement and written consent of the decedent's living next-of-kin. For purposes of resolving such disputes under this section, next-of-kin means the living person(s) first listed as follows:

    (A) The decedent's children 18 years of age or older, or if the decedent does not have children, then

    (B) The decedent's parents, or if the decedent has no surviving parents, then

    (C) The decedent's siblings.

    (3) The emblem meets the definition of an emblem of belief in paragraph (b)(2);

    (4) The emblem would not have an adverse impact on the dignity and solemnity of cemeteries honoring those who served the Nation—for example, the emblem cannot contain explicit or graphic depictions or descriptions of sexual organs or sexual activities that are shocking, titillating, or pandering in nature, or display coarse or abusive language or images. A determination that an emblem would have an adverse impact on the dignity and solemnity of cemeteries honoring those who served the Nation may not be made based on the content of the religious or functionally equivalent belief that the emblem represents.

    (5) The emblem meets the technical requirements for inscription specified in paragraph (d)(2) of this section.

    (g)  (1) A decision will be made on all complete applications. A request to inscribe a new emblem on a Government-furnished headstone or marker shall be granted if the Under Secretary for Memorial Affairs finds that the request meets each of the applicable criteria in paragraph (f) of this section. In making that determination, if there is an approximate balance between the positive and negative evidence concerning any fact material to making that determination, the Under Secretary shall give the benefit of the doubt to the applicant. The Under Secretary shall consider the Director of NCA's Office of Field Programs' recommendation and may consider information from any source.

    (2) If the Under Secretary for Memorial Affairs determines that allowing the inscription of a particular proposed emblem would adversely affect the dignity and solemnity of the cemetery environment or that the emblem does not meet the technical requirements for inscription, the Under Secretary shall notify the applicant in writing and offer to the applicant the option of either:

    (i) Omitting the part of the emblem that is problematic while retaining the remainder of the emblem, if this is feasible, or

    (ii) Choosing a different emblem to represent the religious or functionally equivalent belief that does not have such an adverse impact.

    (3) Applicants will have 60 days from the date of the notice to cure any adverse impact or technical defect identified by the Under Secretary. Only if neither option is acceptable to the applicant, the applicant's requested alternative is also unacceptable, or the applicant does not respond within the 60-day period, will the Under Secretary ultimately deny the application.

    (4) If the Under Secretary determines that the request should be denied and that decision is based wholly or partly on information received from a source other than the applicant, then the following procedure will be followed:

    (i) A tentative decision denying the request will be prepared;

    (ii) Written notice of the tentative decision accompanied by a copy of any information on which the Under Secretary intends to rely will be provided to the applicant;

    (iii) The applicant will have 60 days from the date of the written notice specified in subparagraph (ii) to present evidence and/or argument challenging the evidence and/or tentative decision; and

    (iv) The Under Secretary will consider the applicant's submission under subparagraph (iii) and will issue a final decision on the request.

    (5) The Director, Office of Field Programs, will provide the individual who made the request written notice of the Under Secretary's decision.

    (c) A group memorial monument furnished by VA may be placed only in a national cemetery in an area reserved for such purpose.

    (d) Application for a group memorial monument shall be submitted in a manner specified by the Secretary. Evidence used to establish and determine eligibility for a group memorial monument will conform to paragraph (a)(4) of this section.

      § 39.3   Priority list.

#### § § 39.3

      (a) The priority groups, with Priority Group 1 having the highest priority and Priority Group 4 the lowest priority, are:

      (1) —Projects needed to avoid disruption in burial service that would otherwise occur at existing veterans cemeteries within 4 years of the date of the preapplication. Such projects would include expansion projects as well as improvement projects (such as construction of additional or replacement facilities) when such improvements are required to continue interment operations.

      (2) —Projects for the establishment of new veterans cemeteries.

      (3) —Expansion projects at existing veterans cemeteries when a disruption in burial service due to the exhaustion of existing gravesites is not expected to occur within 4 years of the date of the preapplication.

      (4) —Improvement projects for cemetery landscaping or infrastructure, such as building expansion and upgrades to roads and irrigation systems, that are not directly related to the development of new gravesites. Operation and Maintenance Projects that address NCA's national shrine standards of appearance are included in this group.

      (b) Within Priority Groups 1, 2, and 3, highest priority will be given to projects in geographical locations with the greatest number of veterans who will benefit from the project as determined by VA. This prioritization system, based on veteran population data, will assist VA in maintaining and improving access to burial in a veterans cemetery to more veterans and their eligible family members. Within Priority Group 1, at the discretion of VA, higher priority may be given to a project that must be funded that fiscal year to avoid disruption in burial service.

      (c) Grants for projects within Priority Group 4 will be awarded in any fiscal year only after grants for all project applications under Priority Groups 1, 2, and 3 that are ready for funding have been awarded. Within Priority Group 4, projects will be ranked in priority order based upon VA's determination of the relative importance of proposed improvements and the degree to which proposed Operation and Maintenance Projects achieve NCA national shrine standards of appearance. No more than $10 million in any fiscal year will be awarded for Operation and Maintenance Projects under Priority Group 4.

      (d) By October 1 of each year, VA will make a list prioritizing all preapplications that were received on or before July 1 of that year and that were approved under § 39.31 or § 39.81, ranking them in their order of priority within the applicable Priority Group for funding during the fiscal year. Preapplications from previous years will be re-prioritized each year and do not need to be resubmitted.

        §§ 39.52-39.59   [Reserved]

#### § §§ 39.52-39.59

      Standards and Requirements

        § 39.60   General requirements for site selection and construction of veterans cemeteries.

#### § § 39.60

        (a) The various codes, requirements, and recommendations of State or Tribal Organization and local authorities or technical and professional organizations, to the extent and manner in which those codes, requirements, and recommendations are referenced in this subpart, are applicable to grants involving construction of veterans cemeteries. Additional information concerning these codes, requirements, and recommendations may be obtained from VA, National Cemetery Administration, 810 Vermont Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20420.

        (b) The standards in §§ 39.60, 39.61, 39.62, and 39.63 constitute general design and construction criteria and shall apply to all Establishment, Expansion, and Improvement Projects for which Federal assistance is requested under 38 U.S.C. 2408.

        (c) In developing these standards, no attempt has been made to comply with all of the various State and local codes and regulations. The standards contained in §§ 39.60, 39.61, 39.62, and 39.63 shall be followed where they exceed State or local codes and regulations. Departure will be permitted, however, when alternate standards are demonstrated to provide equivalent or better design criteria than the standards in these sections. Conversely, compliance is required with State and local codes where such requirements provide a standard higher than those in these sections. The additional cost, if any, in using standards that are higher than those of VA should be documented and justified in the application.

        (d) The space criteria and area requirements referred to in these standards shall be used as a guide in planning. Additional area and facilities beyond those specified as basic may be included if found to be necessary to meet the functional requirements of the project but are subject to approval by VA. Substantial deviation from the space criteria or area standards shall be carefully considered and justified. Failing to meet the criteria or standards or exceeding them by more than 10 percent in the completed plan would be regarded as evidence of inferior design or as exceeding the boundaries of professional requirements. In those projects that unjustifiably exceed maximum space criteria or area requirements, VA funding may be subject to reduction in proportion to the amount by which the space or area of the cemetery exceeds the maximum specified in these standards.

        § 39.61   Site planning standards.

#### § § 39.61

        (a) —(1)  The land should be located as close as possible to the densest veteran population in the area under consideration.

        (2)  Sufficient acreage shall be available to provide gravesites for estimated needs for at least 20 years. More acreage should be provided where feasible. Acreage could vary depending on the State veteran population and national cemetery availability.

        (3)  The site should be readily accessible by highway. Offsite improvements shall not be funded by the grant.

        (4)  The land should range from comparatively level to rolling and moderately hilly terrain. Natural rugged contours are suitable only if development and maintenance costs would not be excessive and burial areas would be accessible to elderly or infirm visitors. The land shall not be subject to flooding.

        (5)  The water table should be lower than the maximum proposed depth of burial.

        (6)  The soil should be free from rock, muck, unstable composition, and other materials that would hamper the economical excavation of graves by normal methods. In general, the soil should meet the standards of good agricultural land that is capable of supporting turf and trees, with normal care and without the addition of topsoil.

        (7)  Electricity and gas, if required, should be available. Offsite improvements shall not be funded by the grant.

        (8)  An adequate supply of water should be available. Offsite improvements shall not be funded by the grant.

        (9)  An approved means to dispose of storm flow and sewage from the facility should be available. Offsite improvements shall not be funded by the grant.

        (b) —(1)  The development plan shall provide for adequate hard-surfaced roads, walks, parking areas, public rest rooms, a flag circle, and a main gate.

        (2)  All parking facilities shall include provisions to accommodate the physically handicapped. A minimum of one space shall be set aside and identified with signage in each parking area with additional spaces provided in the ratio of 1 handicapped space to every 20 regular spaces. Handicapped spaces shall not be placed between two conventional diagonal or head-on parking spaces. Each of the handicapped parking spaces shall not be less than 9 feet wide; in addition, a clear space 4 feet wide shall be provided between the adjacent conventional parking spaces and also on the outside of the end spaces. Parking shall not be provided for large numbers of people attending ceremonial events such as Memorial Day services.

        (3)  Roads should generally follow the topography of the cemetery and allow pedestrian access to burial sections on both sides. Roads should generally not be used as “boundaries” outlining burial sections. Extensive bridging should be avoided. Grant program funding may not be used to build access roads on property that is not part of the cemetery. Road widths shall be compatible with proposed traffic flows and volumes. Primary roads shall be generally 24 feet wide.

        (4)  The pavement section of all roads, service areas, and parking areas shall be designed for the maximum anticipated traffic loads and existing soil conditions and in accordance with local and State design criteria.

        (5)  Bituminous roads may be provided with integral curbs and gutters constructed of portland cement concrete. Freestanding curbs may be substituted when the advantage of using them is clearly indicated. All curbs shall have a “roll-type” cross section for vehicle and equipment access to lawn areas except as may be necessary for traffic control. The radii of curbs at road intersections shall not be less than 20 feet-0 inches. Curb ramps shall be provided to accommodate the physically handicapped and maintenance equipment. Curb ramps shall be provided at all intersections of roads and walks. The curb ramps shall not be less than 4 feet wide; they shall not have a slope greater than 8 percent, and preferably not greater than 5 percent. The vertical angle between the surface of a curb ramp and the surface of a road or gutter shall not be less than 176 degrees; the transition between the two surfaces shall be smooth. Curb ramps shall have nonskid surfaces.

        (6)  Walks shall be designed with consideration for the physically handicapped and elderly. Walks and ramps designed on an incline shall have periodic level platforms. All walks, ramps and platforms shall have nonskid surfaces. Any walk shall be ramped if the slope exceeds 3 percent. Walks that have gradients from 2 to 3 percent shall be provided with level platforms at 200-foot intervals and at intersections with other walks. Ramps shall not have a slope greater than 8 percent, and preferably not greater than 5 percent. The ramps shall have handrails on both sides unless other protective devices are provided; every handrail shall have clearance of not less than 1  inches between the back of the handrail and the wall or any other vertical surface behind it. Ramps shall not be less than 4 feet wide between curbs; curbs shall be provided on both sides. The curbs shall not be less than 4 inches high and 4 inches wide. A level platform in a ramp shall not be less than the full width of the ramp and not less than 5 feet long. Entrance platforms and ramps shall be provided with protective weather barriers to shield them against hazardous conditions resulting from inclement weather.

        (7)  Exterior steps may be included in the site development as long as provisions are made for use by physically handicapped persons.

        (8)  Minimum lawn slopes shall be 2 percent; critical spot grade elevations shall be shown on the contract drawings. Insofar as practicable, lawn areas shall be designed without steep slopes.

        (9)  The landscaping plan should provide for a park-like setting of harmonious open spaces balanced with groves of indigenous and cultivated deciduous and evergreen trees. Shrubbery should be kept to a minimum. Steep slopes that are unsuitable for interment areas should be kept in their natural state.

        (10)  Surface grades shall be determined in coordination with the architectural, structural, and mechanical design of buildings and facilities so as to provide proper surface drainage.

        (11)  A site plan of the cemetery shall include a burial layout. If appropriate, the burial layout should reflect the phases of development in the various sections. The first phase of construction should contain sufficient burial sites to meet the foreseeable demand for at least 10 years. All applicable dimensions of roadways, fences, utilities, or other structures shall be indicated on the layout.

        (12)  Gravesites shall be laid out in uniform pattern. There shall be a minimum of 10 feet from the edge of roads and drives and a minimum of 20 feet from the boundaries or fence lines. Maximum distance from the edge of a permanent road to any gravesite shall not be over 275 feet. Temporary roads may be provided to serve areas in phase developments.

        (13)  Each grave shall be marked with an appropriate marker, and each cemetery shall maintain a register of burials setting forth the name of each person buried and the designation of the grave in which he/she is buried. Permanent gravesite control markers shall be installed based on a grid system throughout the burial area unless otherwise specified. This will facilitate the gravesite layout, placement of utility lines, and alignment of headstones.

        (14)  The entrance should be an architectural or landscape feature that creates a sense of arrival.

        (15)  Each cemetery should have an area for the display of memorials donated by veterans groups and others. Such areas may take the form of a path or walkway and should provide a contemplative setting for visitors.

        (16)  Family members and others often wish to donate items such as benches and trees. Acceptable items of donation should be specified in the cemetery plan. The plan should also designate appropriate locations for such items.

        (17)  There shall be one primary flagpole for the United States flag. This flag shall be lighted. A turf assembly area should be developed for major gatherings such as Memorial Day. The assembly area may be focused on the flag. The area may also incorporate an architectural or a landscape feature that functions as a platform or backdrop for speakers.

        (18)  Site furnishings include signage, trash receptacles, benches, and flower containers. These items should be coordinated and complement each other, the architectural design, and the cemetery as a whole. They should be simple, durable, standardized, and properly scaled.

        (19)  The cemetery development plan should include a location for a carillon tower. Carillons are normally donated. They are not provided for in the grant.

        § 39.62   Space criteria for support facilities.

#### § § 39.62

        These criteria are based on a projected average burial rate of one to six per day, staffing by position, and a defined complement of maintenance and service equipment. For cemeteries with less than one or more than six burials per day, support facilities are considered on an individual basis in accordance with § 39.60(d). In converting Net Square Feet (NSF) to Gross Square Feet (GSF), a conversion factor of 1.5 is the maximum allowed. The applicant shall, in support of the design, include the following as an attachment to the application: A list of all grounds maintenance supplies and equipment and the number of Full Time Employees (FTE) by job assignment for the next 10 years.

        (a)  The administrative building should be approximately 1,600 NSF in total, providing space, as needed, for the following:

        (1) Cemetery director's office;

        (2) Other offices (as needed);

        (3) Administrative staff (lobby/office area);

        (4) Operations (file/office/equipment/work area);

        (5) Family/conference room;

        (6) Military honors team;

        (7) Refreshment unit;

        (8) Housekeeping aide's closet; and

        (9) Restroom facilities.

        (b)  The maintenance/service building may be combined with the administrative building. The maintenance/service building should be approximately 2,200 NSF in total, providing heated and air conditioned space, as needed, for the following:

        (1) Foreman's office;

        (2) Lunch room;

        (3) Kitchen unit;

        (4) Toilet and locker room facilities;

        (5) Housekeeping aide's closet; and

        (6) Vehicle and equipment maintenance and storage.

        (c)  Approximately 275 NSF/Bay as needed. Not all types of vehicles and equipment require storage in heated space. Based on climatic conditions, it may be justified to rely completely on open structures rather than heated structures to protect the following types of vehicles and equipment: Dump trucks, pickup trucks, cemetery automobiles, gang and circular mowers.

        (d)  One permanent shelter is authorized for every five interments per day. The shelter may include a covered area to provide seating for approximately 20 people and an uncovered paved area to provide space for approximately 50 additional people. The shelter may also include a small, enclosed equipment/storage area. Provisions must be made for the playing of Taps by recorded means.

        (e)  One permanent Public Information Center is authorized per facility. A Public Information Center is used to orient visitors and funeral corteges. It should include the gravesite locator. The public restrooms may also be combined with this structure. Space determinations for separate structures for public restrooms shall be considered on an individual basis. The Public Information Center, including public restrooms, may be combined with the administrative building.

        (f)  Space determinations for other support facilities such as columbaria, preplaced graveliners (or crypts), garden niches, etc., will be considered on an individual basis in accordance with § 39.60(d).

    § 42.31   Determining the amount of penalties and assessments.

#### § § 42.31

    (a) In determining an appropriate amount of civil penalties and assessments, the ALJ and the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, upon appeal, should evaluate any circumstances that mitigate or aggravate the violation and should articulate in their opinions the reasons that support the penalties and assessments they impose. Because of the intangible costs of fraud, the expense of investigating the conduct, and the need to deter others who might be similarly tempted, ordinarily double damages and a significant civil penalty should be imposed.

    (b) Although not exhaustive, the following factors are among those that may influence the ALJ and the Secretary of Veterans Affairs in determining the amount of penalties and assessments to impose with respect to the misconduct (, the false, fictitious, or fraudulent claims or statements) charged in the complaint:

    (1) The number of false, fictitious, or fraudulent claims or statements;

    (2) The time period over which the claims or statements were made;

    (3) The degree of the defendant's culpability with respect to the misconduct;

    (4) The amount of money or the value of the property, services, or benefit falsely claimed;

    (5) The value of the Government's actual loss as a result of the misconduct, including foreseeable consequential damages and the costs of investigation;

    (6) The relationship of the amount imposed as civil penalties to the amount of the Government's loss;

    (7) The potential or actual impact of the misconduct upon national defense, public health or safety, or public confidence in the management of Government programs and operations, including particularly the impact on the intended beneficiaries of the programs;

    (8) Whether the defendant has engaged in a pattern of the same or similar misconduct;

    (9) Whether the defendant attempted to conceal the misconduct;

    (10) The degree to which the defendant has involved others in the misconduct or in concealing it;

    (11) Where the misconduct of employees or agents is imputed to the defendant, the extent to which the defendant's practices fostered or attempted to preclude such misconduct;

    (12) Whether the defendant cooperated in or obstructed an investigation of the misconduct;

    (13) Whether the defendant assisted in identifying or prosecuting other wrongdoers;

    (14) The complexity of the program or transaction, and the degree of the defendant's sophistication with respect to it, including the extent of the defendant's prior participation in the program or in similar transactions;

    (15) Whether the defendant has been found, in any criminal, civil, or administrative proceeding to have engaged in similar misconduct or to have dealt dishonestly with the Government of the United States or of a State, directly or indirectly; and

    (16) The need to deter the defendant and others from engaging in the same or similar misconduct.

    (b) At the discretion of the ALJ, testimony may be admitted in the form of a written statement or deposition. Any written statement must be provided to all other parties along with the last known address of such witness, in a manner which allows sufficient time for other parties to subpoena the witness for cross-examination at the hearing. Prior written statements of witnesses proposed to testify at the hearing and deposition transcripts shall be exchanged as provided in § 42.22(a) of this part.

    (c) The ALJ shall exercise reasonable control over the mode and order of interrogating witnesses and presenting evidence so as to:

    (1) Make the interrogation and presentation effective for the ascertainment of the truth,

    (2) Avoid needless consumption of time, and

    (3) Protect witnesses from harassment or undue embarrassment.

    (d) The ALJ shall permit the parties to conduct such cross-examination as may be required for a full and true disclosure of the facts.

    (e) At the discretion of the ALJ, a witness may be cross-examined on matters relevant to the proceeding without regard to the scope of the direct examination.

    (c) The ALJ shall exclude irrelevant and immaterial evidence.

    (d) Although relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or by considerations of undue delay or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.

    Subpart B—Activities by Own Employees

      § 45.200   Agency and legislative liaison.

#### § § 45.200

      (a) The prohibition on the use of appropriated funds, in § 45.100(a), does not apply in the case of a payment of reasonable compensation made to an officer or employee of a person requesting or receiving a Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement if the payment is for agency and legislative liaison activities not directly related to a covered Federal action.

      (b) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, providing any information specifically requested by an agency or Congress is allowable at any time.

      (c) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, the following agency and legislative liaison activities are allowable at any time only where they are not related to a specific solicitation for any covered Federal action:

      (1) Discussing with an agency (including individual demonstrations) the qualities and characteristics of the person's products or services, conditions or terms of sale, and service capabilities; and,

      (2) Technical discussions and other activities regarding the application or adaptation of the person's products or services for an agency's use.

      (d) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, the following agencies and legislative liaison activities are allowable only where they are prior to formal solicitation of any covered Federal action:

      (1) Providing any information not specifically requested but necessary for an agency to make an informed decision about initiation of a covered Federal action;

      (2) Technical discussions regarding the preparation of an unsolicited proposal prior to its official submission; and,

      (3) Capability presentations by persons seeking awards from an agency pursuant to the provisions of the Small Business Act, as amended by Pub. L. 95-507 and other subsequent amendments.

      (e) Only those activities expressly authorized by this section are allowable under this section.

      § 45.205   Professional and technical services.

#### § § 45.205

      (a) The prohibition on the use of appropriated funds, in § 45.100(a), does not apply in the case of a payment of reasonable compensation made to an officer or employee of a person requesting or receiving a Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement or an extension, continuation, renewal, amendment, or modification of a Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement if payment is for professional or technical services rendered directly in the preparation, submission, or negotiation of any bid, proposal, or application for that Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement or for meeting requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for receiving that Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement.

      (b) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, “professional and technical services” shall be limited to advice and analysis directly applying any professional or technical discipline. For example, drafting of a legal document accompanying a bid or proposal by a lawyer is allowable. Similarly, technical advice provided by an engineer on the performance or operational capability of a piece of equipment rendered directly in the negotiation of a contract is allowable. However, communications with the intent to influence made by a professional (such as a licensed lawyer) or a technical person (such as a licensed accountant) are not allowable under this section unless they provide advice and analysis directly applying their professional or technical expertise and unless the advice or analysis is rendered directly and solely in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered Federal action. Thus, for example, communications with the intent to influence made by a lawyer that do not provide legal advice or analysis directly and solely related to the legal aspects of his or her client's proposal, but generally advocate one proposal over another are not allowable under this section because the lawyer is not providing professional legal services. Similarly, communications with the intent to influence made by an engineer providing an engineering analysis prior to the preparation or submission of a bid or proposal are not allowable under this section since the engineer is providing technical services but not directly in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered Federal action.

      (c) Requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for receiving a covered Federal award include those required by law or regulation, or reasonably expected to be required by law or regulation, and any other requirements in the actual award documents.

      (d) Only those services expressly authorized by this section are allowable under this section.

      § 45.210   Reporting.

#### § § 45.210

      No reporting is required with respect to payments of reasonable compensation made to regularly employed officers or employees of a person.

    Subpart C—Activities by Other Than Own Employees

      § 45.300   Professional and technical services.

#### § § 45.300

      (a) The prohibition on the use of appropriated funds, in § 45.100(a), does not apply in the case of any reasonable payment to a person, other than an officer or employee of a person requesting or receiving a covered Federal action, if the payment is for professional or technical services rendered directly in the preparation, submission, or negotiation of any bid, proposal, or application for that Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement or for meeting requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for receiving that Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement.

      (b) The reporting requirements in § 45.110(a) and (b) regarding filing a disclosure form by each person, if required, shall not apply with respect to professional or technical services rendered directly in the preparation, submission, or negotiation of any commitment providing for the United States to insure or guarantee a loan.

      (c) For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, “professional and technical services” shall be limited to advice and analysis directly applying any professional or technical discipline. For example, drafting or a legal document accompanying a bid or proposal by a lawyer is allowable. Similarly, technical advice provided by an engineer on the performance or operational capability of a piece of equipment rendered directly in the negotiation of a contract is allowable. However, communications with the intent to influence made by a professional (such as a licensed lawyer) or a technical person (such as a licensed accountant) are not allowable under this section unless they provide advice and analysis directly applying their professional or technical expertise and unless the advice or analysis is rendered directly and solely in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered Federal action. Thus, for example, communications with the intent to influence made by a lawyer that do not provide legal advice or analysis directly and solely related to the legal aspects of his or her client's proposal, but generally advocate one proposal over another are not allowable under this section because the lawyer is not providing professional legal services. Similarly, communications with the intent to influence made by an engineer providing an engineering analysis prior to the preparation or submission of a bid or proposal are not allowable under this section since the engineer is providing technical services but not directly in the preparation, submission or negotiation of a covered Federal action.

      (d) Requirements imposed by or pursuant to law as a condition for receiving a covered Federal award include those required by law or regulation, or reasonably expected to be required by law or regulation, and any other requirements in the actual award documents.

      (e) Persons other than officers or employees of a person requesting or receiving a covered Federal action include consultants and trade associations.

      (f) Only those services expressly authorized by this section are allowable under this section.

    Subpart D—Penalties and Enforcement

      § 45.400   Penalties.

#### § § 45.400

      (a) Any person who makes an expenditure prohibited herein shall be subject to a civil penalty of not less than $10,000 and not more than $100,000 for each such expenditure.

      (b) Any person who fails to file or amend the disclosure form (see appendix B) to be filed or amended if required herein, shall be subject to a civil penalty of not less than $10,000 and not more than $100,000 for each such failure.

      (c) A filing or amended filing on or after the date on which an administrative action for the imposition of a civil penalty is commenced does not prevent the imposition of such civil penalty for a failure occurring before that date. An administrative action is commenced with respect to a failure when an investigating official determines in writing to commence an investigation of an allegation of such failure.

      (d) In determining whether to impose a civil penalty, and the amount of any such penalty, by reason of a violation by any person, the agency shall consider the nature, circumstances, extent, and gravity of the violation, the effect on the ability of such person to continue in business, any prior violations by such person, the degree of culpability of such person, the ability of the person to pay the penalty, and such other matters as may be appropriate.

      (e) First offenders under paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section shall be subject to a civil penalty of $10,000, absent aggravating circumstances. Second and subsequent offenses by persons shall be subject to an appropriate civil penalty between $10,000 and $100,000, as determined by the agency head or his or her designee.

      (f) An imposition of a civil penalty under this section does not prevent the United States from seeking any other remedy that may apply to the same conduct that is the basis for the imposition of such civil penalty.

      § 45.405   Penalty procedures.

#### § § 45.405

      Agencies shall impose and collect civil penalties pursuant to the provisions of the Program Fraud and Civil Remedies Act, 31 U.S.C. sections 3803 (except subsection (c)), 3804, 3805, 3806, 3807, 3808, and 3812, insofar as these provisions are not inconsistent with the requirements herein.

The Secretary shall transmit a copy of each such written exemption to Congress immediately after making such a determination.

      (b) The Department of Defense may issue supplemental regulations to implement paragraph (a) of this section.

    Subpart F—Agency Reports

      § 45.600   Semi-annual compilation.

#### § § 45.600

      (a) The head of each agency shall collect and compile the disclosure reports (see appendix B) and, on May 31 and November 30 of each year, submit to the Secretary of the Senate and the Clerk of the House of Representatives a report containing a compilation of the information contained in the disclosure reports received during the six-month period ending on March 31 or September 30, respectively, of that year.

      (b) The report, including the compilation, shall be available for public inspection 30 days after receipt of the report by the Secretary and the Clerk.

      (c) Information that involves intelligence matters shall be reported only to the Select Committee on Intelligence of the Senate, the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence of the House of Representatives, and the Committees on Appropriations of the Senate and the House of Representatives in accordance with procedures agreed to by such committees. Such information shall not be available for public inspection.

      (d) Information that is classified under Executive Order 12356 or any successor order shall be reported only to the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate and the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives or the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of Representatives (whichever such committees have jurisdiction of matters involving such information) and to the Committees on Appropriations of the Senate and the House of Representatives in accordance with procedures agreed to by such committees. Such information shall not be available for public inspection.

      (e) The first semi-annual compilation shall be submitted on May 31, 1990, and shall contain a compilation of the disclosure reports received from December 23, 1989 to March 31, 1990.

      (iii) Date of judgment or settlement;

      (iv) Amount paid, date of payment, and whether payment is for a judgment or a settlement;

      (v) Description and amount of judgment or settlement and any conditions attached thereto, including terms of payment;

      (vi) A description of the acts or omissions and injuries or illnesses upon which the action or claim was based; and

      (vii) Classification of the acts or omissions in accordance with a reporting code adopted by the Secretary of Health and Human Services.

      (b) Payment will be considered to have been made for the benefit of a physician, dentist, or other licensed health care practitioner only if (at least a majority of) a malpractice payment review panel concludes that payment was related to substandard care, professional incompetence, or professional misconduct on the part of the physician, dentist, or other licensed health care practitioner. For purposes of this part, a panel shall have a minimum of three individuals appointed by the Director, Medical-Legal Affairs (including at least one member of the profession/occupation of the practitioner(s) whose actions are under review). The conclusions of the panel shall, at a minimum, be based on review of documents pertinent to the care that led to the claim. These documents include the medical records of the patient whose care led to the claim, any report of an administrative investigation board appointed to investigate the care, and the opinion of any consultant which the panel may request in its discretion. These documents do not include those generated primarily for consideration or litigation of the claim of malpractice. In addition, to the extent practicable, the documents shall include written statements of the individual(s) involved in the care which led to the claim. The practitioner(s) whose actions are under review will receive a written notice, hand-delivered or sent to the practitioner's last known address (return receipt requested), from the VA facility director at the time the VA facility director receives the Notice of Payment. That notice from the VA facility director will indicate that VA is considering whether to report the practitioner to the National Practitioner Data Bank because of a specified malpractice payment made, and provide the practitioner the opportunity, within 60 days of receipt, to submit a written statement concerning the care that led to the claim. Inability to notify or non-response from the identified practitioner(s) will not preclude completion of the review and reporting process. The panel, at its discretion, may request additional information from the practitioner or the VA facility where the incident occurred. The review panel's notification to the VA facility Director shall include the acts or omissions considered, the reporting conclusion, and the rationale for the conclusion.

      (c) Attending staff (including contract employees, such as scarce medical specialists providing care pursuant to a contract under 38 U.S.C. 7409) are responsible for actions of licensed trainees assigned under their supervision. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section, actions of a licensed trainee (intern or resident) acting within the scope of his or her training program that otherwise would warrant reporting for substandard care, professional incompetence, or professional misconduct under the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section, will be reported only if the panel, by at least a majority, concludes that such actions constitute gross negligence or willful professional misconduct. For purposes of paragraph (b) of this section, payment will be considered to be made for the benefit of a physician, dentist, or other health care practitioner, in their supervisory capacity, if the panel concludes, by at least a majority, that the physician, dentist or other health care practitioner was acting in a supervisory capacity; that the payment was related to substandard care, professional incompetence, or professional misconduct of the trainee and not the supervisor; and that the trainee did not commit gross negligence or willful professional misconduct. Such report will note that the physician, dentist, or other health care practitioner is being reported in a supervisory capacity.

      (d) The Director of the facility at which the claim arose has the primary responsibility for submitting the report to the National Practitioner Data Bank and for providing a copy to the practitioner, to the State Licensing Board in each State where the practitioner holds a license, and to the State Licensing Board in which the facility is located. However, the Chief Patient Care Services Officer is also authorized to submit the report to the National Practitioner Data Bank and provide copies to the practitioner and State Licensing Boards in cases where the Chief Patient Care Services Officer deems it appropriate to do so. The Director of the facility also shall provide to the practitioner a copy of the review panel's notification to the Director.

### Part 48

**Authority:** Authority: 41 U.S.C. 701,  38 U.S.C 501

**Source:** Source: 68 FR 66557, 66619, 66620, Nov. 26, 2003, unless otherwise noted.

    Subpart A—Purpose and Coverage

      § 48.100   What does this part do?

#### § § 48.100

      This part carries out the portion of the Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988 (41 U.S.C. 701  as amended) that applies to grants. It also applies the provisions of the Act to cooperative agreements and other financial assistance awards, as a matter of Federal Government policy.

      § 48.105   Does this part apply to me?

#### § § 48.105

      (a) Portions of this part apply to you if you are either—

      (1) A recipient of an assistance award from the Department of Veterans Affairs; or

      (2) A(n) Department of Veterans Affairs awarding official. (See definitions of award and recipient in §§ 48.605 and 48.660, respectively.)

      (b) The following table shows the subparts that apply to you:

      § 48.110   Are any of my Federal assistance awards exempt from this part?

#### § § 48.110

      § 48.115   Does this part affect the Federal contracts that I receive?

#### § § 48.115

      It will affect future contract awards indirectly if you are debarred or suspended for a violation of the requirements of this part, as described in § 48.510(c). However, this part does not apply directly to procurement contracts. The portion of the Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988 that applies to Federal procurement contracts is carried out through the Federal Acquisition Regulation in chapter 1 of Title 48 of the Code of Federal Regulations (the drug-free workplace coverage currently is in 48 CFR part 23, subpart 23.5).

    Subpart B—Requirements for Recipients Other Than Individuals

      § 48.200   What must I do to comply with this part?

#### § § 48.200

      There are two general requirements if you are a recipient other than an individual.

      (a) First, you must make a good faith effort, on a continuing basis, to maintain a drug-free workplace. You must agree to do so as a condition for receiving any award covered by this part. The specific measures that you must take in this regard are described in more detail in subsequent sections of this subpart. Briefly, those measures are to—

      (1) Publish a drug-free workplace statement and establish a drug-free awareness program for your employees (see §§ 48.205 through 48.220); and

      (2) Take actions concerning employees who are convicted of violating drug statutes in the workplace (see § 48.225).

      (b) Second, you must identify all known workplaces under your Federal awards (see § 48.230).

      § 48.205   What must I include in my drug-free workplace statement?

#### § § 48.205

      You must publish a statement that—

      (a) Tells your employees that the unlawful manufacture, distribution, dispensing, possession, or use of a controlled substance is prohibited in your workplace;

      (b) Specifies the actions that you will take against employees for violating that prohibition; and

      (c) Lets each employee know that, as a condition of employment under any award, he or she:

      (1) Will abide by the terms of the statement; and

      (2) Must notify you in writing if he or she is convicted for a violation of a criminal drug statute occurring in the workplace and must do so no more than five calendar days after the conviction.

      § 48.210   To whom must I distribute my drug-free workplace statement?

#### § § 48.210

      You must require that a copy of the statement described in § 48.205 be given to each employee who will be engaged in the performance of any Federal award.

      § 48.215   What must I include in my drug-free awareness program?

#### § § 48.215

      You must establish an ongoing drug-free awareness program to inform employees about—

      (a) The dangers of drug abuse in the workplace;

      (b) Your policy of maintaining a drug-free workplace;

      (c) Any available drug counseling, rehabilitation, and employee assistance programs; and

      (d) The penalties that you may impose upon them for drug abuse violations occurring in the workplace.

      § 48.220   By when must I publish my drug-free workplace statement and establish my drug-free awareness program?

#### § § 48.220

      If you are a new recipient that does not already have a policy statement as described in § 48.205 and an ongoing awareness program as described in § 48.215, you must publish the statement and establish the program by the time given in the following table:

      § 48.225   What actions must I take concerning employees who are convicted of drug violations in the workplace?

#### § § 48.225

      There are two actions you must take if an employee is convicted of a drug violation in the workplace:

      (a) First, you must notify Federal agencies if an employee who is engaged in the performance of an award informs you about a conviction, as required by § 48.205(c)(2), or you otherwise learn of the conviction. Your notification to the Federal agencies must—

      (1) Be in writing;

      (2) Include the employee's position title;

      (3) Include the identification number(s) of each affected award;

      (4) Be sent within ten calendar days after you learn of the conviction; and

      (5) Be sent to every Federal agency on whose award the convicted employee was working. It must be sent to every awarding official or his or her official designee, unless the Federal agency has specified a central point for the receipt of the notices.

      (b) Second, within 30 calendar days of learning about an employee's conviction, you must either—

      (1) Take appropriate personnel action against the employee, up to and including termination, consistent with the requirements of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794), as amended; or

      (2) Require the employee to participate satisfactorily in a drug abuse assistance or rehabilitation program approved for these purposes by a Federal, State or local health, law enforcement, or other appropriate agency.

      § 48.230   How and when must I identify workplaces?

#### § § 48.230

      (a) You must identify all known workplaces under each Department of Veterans Affairs award. A failure to do so is a violation of your drug-free workplace requirements. You may identify the workplaces—

      (1) To the Department of Veterans Affairs official that is making the award, either at the time of application or upon award; or

      (2) In documents that you keep on file in your offices during the performance of the award, in which case you must make the information available for inspection upon request by Department of Veterans Affairs officials or their designated representatives.

      (b) Your workplace identification for an award must include the actual address of buildings (or parts of buildings) or other sites where work under the award takes place. Categorical descriptions may be used (e.g., all vehicles of a mass transit authority or State highway department while in operation, State employees in each local unemployment office, performers in concert halls or radio studios).

      (c) If you identified workplaces to the Department of Veterans Affairs awarding official at the time of application or award, as described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, and any workplace that you identified changes during the performance of the award, you must inform the Department of Veterans Affairs awarding official.

    Subpart C—Requirements for Recipients Who Are Individuals

      § 48.300   What must I do to comply with this part if I am an individual recipient?

#### § § 48.300

      As a condition of receiving a(n) Department of Veterans Affairs award, if you are an individual recipient, you must agree that—

      (a) You will not engage in the unlawful manufacture, distribution, dispensing, possession, or use of a controlled substance in conducting any activity related to the award; and

      (b) If you are convicted of a criminal drug offense resulting from a violation occurring during the conduct of any award activity, you will report the conviction:

      (1) In writing.

      (2) Within 10 calendar days of the conviction.

      (3) To the Department of Veterans Affairs awarding official or other designee for each award that you currently have, unless § 48.301 or the award document designates a central point for the receipt of the notices. When notice is made to a central point, it must include the identification number(s) of each affected award.

      § 48.301   [Reserved]

#### § § 48.301

      § 48.400   What are my responsibilities as a(n) Department of Veterans Affairs awarding official?

#### § § 48.400

      As a(n) Department of Veterans Affairs awarding official, you must obtain each recipient's agreement, as a condition of the award, to comply with the requirements in—

      § 48.500   How are violations of this part determined for recipients other than individuals?

#### § § 48.500

      A recipient other than an individual is in violation of the requirements of this part if the Secretary determines, in writing, that—

      (a) The recipient has violated the requirements of subpart B of this part; or

      (b) The number of convictions of the recipient's employees for violating criminal drug statutes in the workplace is large enough to indicate that the recipient has failed to make a good faith effort to provide a drug-free workplace.

      § 48.505   How are violations of this part determined for recipients who are individuals?

#### § § 48.505

      An individual recipient is in violation of the requirements of this part if the Secretary determines, in writing, that—

      § 48.510   What actions will the Federal Government take against a recipient determined to have violated this part?

#### § § 48.510

      If a recipient is determined to have violated this part, as described in § 48.500 or § 48.505, the Department of Veterans Affairs may take one or more of the following actions—

      (a) Suspension of payments under the award;

    § 50.1   Definitions.

#### § § 50.1

    (a)   or  means financial assistance received by an entity selected by the Government or pass-through entity (under this part) to carry out a service (e.g., by contract, grant, or cooperative agreement). References to “Federal financial assistance” will be deemed to be references to direct Federal financial assistance, unless the referenced assistance meets the definition of “indirect Federal financial assistance” or “Federal financial assistance provided indirectly.”

    (b)  or  means financial assistance received by a service provider when the service provider is paid for services by means of a voucher, certificate, or other means of government-funded payment provided to a beneficiary who is able to make a choice of a service provider. Federal financial assistance provided to an organization is considered “indirect” within the meaning of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution when—

    (1) The government program through which the beneficiary receives the voucher, certificate, or other similar means of government funded payment is neutral toward religion; and

    (2) The organization receives the assistance wholly as a result of a genuine and independent private choice of the beneficiary, not a choice of the Government. The availability of adequate secular alternatives is a significant factor in determining whether a program affords a genuine and independent private choice.

    (c)  means assistance that non-Federal entities receive or administer in the form of grants, contracts, loans, loan guarantees, property, cooperative agreements, food commodities, direct appropriations, or other assistance, but does not include a tax credit, deduction, or exemption.

    (d)  means an entity, including a nonprofit or nongovernmental organization, acting under a contract, grant, or other agreement with the Federal Government or with a State or local government, such as a State administering agency, that accepts direct Federal financial assistance as a primary recipient or grantee and distributes that assistance to other organizations that, in turn, provide government-funded social services.

    (e)  or  has the same definition as “social service program” in Executive Order 13279.

    (f)  means a non-Federal entity that receives a Federal award directly from a Federal awarding agency to carry out an activity under a Federal program. The term recipient does not include subrecipients, but does include pass-through entities.

    (g)  has the meaning given to the term in 42 U.S.C. 2000cc-5(7)(A).

    § 50.2   Faith-based organizations and Federal financial assistance.

#### § § 50.2

    (a) Faith-based organizations are eligible, on the same basis as any other organization, to participate in any VA program or service for which they are otherwise eligible. Neither the VA program nor any State or local government or other pass-through entity receiving funds under any VA program shall, in the selection of service providers, discriminate for or against an organization on the basis of the organization's religious character, motives, or affiliation, or lack thereof, or on the basis of conduct that would not be considered grounds to favor or disfavor a similarly situated secular organization.

    (b) Organizations that receive direct Federal financial assistance from a VA program may not engage in any explicitly religious activities (including activities that involve overt religious content such as worship, religious instruction, or proselytization) as part of the programs or services funded with direct Federal financial assistance from the VA program, or in any other manner prohibited by law. If an organization conducts such activities, the activities must be offered separately, in time or location, from the programs or services funded with direct Federal financial assistance from the VA program, and participation must be voluntary for beneficiaries of the programs or services funded with such assistance. The use of indirect Federal financial assistance is not subject to this restriction. Nothing in this part restricts VA's authority under applicable Federal law to fund activities, such as the provision of chaplaincy services, that can be directly funded by the Government consistent with the Establishment Clause.

    (c) A faith-based organization that participates in programs or services funded by a VA program will retain its autonomy; right of expression; religious character; and independence from Federal, State, and local governments, and may continue to carry out its mission, including the definition, development, practice, and expression of its religious beliefs. A faith-based organization that receives direct Federal financial assistance may use space in its facilities to provide programs or services funded with financial assistance from the VA program without concealing, removing, or altering religious art, icons, scriptures, or other religious symbols. In addition, a faith-based organization that receives Federal financial assistance from a VA program does not lose the protections of law. Such a faith-based organization retains its authority over its internal governance, and it may retain religious terms in its name, select its board members on the basis of their acceptance of or adherence to the religious tenets of the organization, and include religious references in its mission statements and other governing documents.

    (d) Any organization that participates in programs funded by Federal financial assistance from the VA shall not, in providing services supported in whole or in part with Federal financial assistance, or in their outreach activities related to such services, discriminate against a program beneficiary or prospective program beneficiary on the basis of religion, a religious belief, a refusal to hold a religious belief, or a refusal to attend or participate in a religious practice. However, an organization receiving indirect Federal financial assistance need not modify its program activities to accommodate a beneficiary who chooses to expend the indirect aid on the organization's program.

    (e) No grant document, agreement, covenant, memorandum of understanding, policy, or regulation that is used by a VA program or a State or local government in administering Federal financial assistance from any VA program shall require faith-based organizations to provide assurances or notices where they are not required of non-faith-based organizations. Any restrictions on the use of grant funds shall apply equally to faith-based and non-faith-based organizations. All organizations that participate in VA programs or services, including faith-based ones, must carry out eligible activities in accordance with all program requirements, including those prohibiting the use of direct financial assistance to engage in explicitly religious activities, subject to any accommodations that are granted on a case-by-case basis in accordance with the Constitution and laws of the United States. No grant document, agreement, covenant, memorandum of understanding, policy, or regulation that is used by VA or a State or local government in administering financial assistance from VA shall disqualify faith-based organizations from participating in the VA programs or services on the basis of the organization's religious character, motives, or affiliation, or lack thereof, or on the basis of conduct that would not be considered grounds to disqualify a similarly situated secular organization.

    (f) Nothing in this part shall be construed to preclude VA from making an accommodation, including for religious exercise, with respect to one or more program requirements on a case-by-case basis in accordance with the Constitution and laws of the United States.

    (g) VA shall not disqualify an organization from participating in any VA program for which it is eligible on the basis of the organization's indication that it may request an accommodation with respect to one or more program requirements, unless the organization has made clear that the accommodation is necessary to its participation and VA has determined that it would deny the accommodation.

    (h) A faith-based organization's exemption from the Federal prohibition on employment discrimination on the basis of religion, set forth in section 702(a) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000e-1), is not forfeited when the organization receives direct or indirect Federal financial assistance from a VA program. Some VA programs, however, contain independent statutory provisions affecting a recipient's ability to discriminate on the basis of religion in employment. In this case, recipients should consult with the appropriate VA program office if they have questions about the scope of any applicable requirements.

    (i) In general, VA programs do not require that a recipient, including a faith-based organization, obtain tax-exempt status under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code to be eligible for funding under VA programs. Some grant programs, however, do require an organization to be a nonprofit organization in order to be eligible for funding. Funding announcements and other grant application solicitations that require organizations to have nonprofit status will specifically so indicate in the eligibility section of the solicitation. In addition, any solicitation that requires an organization to maintain tax-exempt status will expressly state the statutory authority for requiring such status. Recipients should consult with the appropriate VA program office to determine the scope of any applicable requirements. In VA programs in which an applicant must show that it is a nonprofit organization, the applicant may do so by any of the following means:

    (1) Proof that the Internal Revenue Service currently recognizes the applicant as an organization to which contributions are tax deductible under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code;

    (2) A statement from a State or other governmental taxing body or the State secretary of State certifying that:

    (i) The organization is a nonprofit organization operating within the State; and

    (ii) No part of its net earnings may benefit any private shareholder or individual;

    (3) A certified copy of the applicant's certificate of incorporation or similar document that clearly establishes the nonprofit status of the applicant; or

    (4) Any item described in paragraphs (i)(1) through (3) of this section if that item applies to a State or national parent organization, together with a statement by the State or parent organization that the applicant is a local nonprofit affiliate.

    (j) If a recipient contributes its own funds in excess of those funds required by a matching or grant agreement to supplement VA program-supported activities, the recipient has the option to segregate those additional funds or commingle them with the Federal award funds. If the funds are commingled, the provision of this part shall apply to all of the commingled funds in the same manner, and to the same extent, as the provisions apply to the Federal funds. With respect to the matching funds, the provisions of this part apply irrespective of whether such funds are commingled with Federal funds or segregated.

    (k) Decisions about awards of Federal financial assistance must be made on the basis of merit, not on the basis of the religious affiliation, or lack thereof, of a recipient organization, and must be free from political interference or even the appearance of such interference.

    (l) Neither VA nor any State or local government or other pass-through entity receiving funds under any VA program or service shall construe these provisions in such a way as to advantage or disadvantage faith-based organizations affiliated with historic or well-established religions or sects in comparison with other religions or sects.

    (m) If a pass-through entity, acting under a contract, grant, or other agreement with the Federal Government or with a State or local government that is administering a program supported by Federal financial assistance, is given the authority under the contract, grant, or agreement to select non-governmental organizations to provide services funded by the Federal Government, the pass-through entity must ensure compliance by the subrecipient with the provisions of this part and any implementing regulations or guidance. If the pass-through entity is a non-governmental organization, it retains all other rights of a non-governmental organization under the program's statutory and regulatory provisions.

> [89 FR 15718, Mar. 4, 2024]

    § 50.3   Notice requirements.

#### § § 50.3

    (a) An organization providing social services under a program of VA supported by Federal financial assistance must give written notice to beneficiaries and prospective beneficiaries of certain protections in a manner and form prescribed by the VA program. The language for this written notice to beneficiaries must be substantially similar to the text set forth in appendix C to this part. Specifically, the notice must include the following:

    (1) The organization may not discriminate against a beneficiary or prospective beneficiary on the basis of religion, a religious belief, a refusal to hold a religious belief, or a refusal to attend or participate in a religious practice;

    (2) The organization may not require a beneficiary or prospective beneficiary to attend or participate in any explicitly religious activities that are offered by the organization, and any participation by a beneficiary in such activities must be purely voluntary;

    (3) The organization must separate in time or location any privately funded explicitly religious activities from activities supported by direct Federal financial assistance; and

    (4) A beneficiary or prospective beneficiary may report an organization's violation of these protections, including any denials of services or benefits by an organization, by contacting or filing a written complaint with the VA program or the intermediary that awarded funds to the organization.

    (b) The written notice described in paragraph (a) of this section must be given to a prospective beneficiary prior to the time the prospective beneficiary enrolls in the program or receives services from the program. When the nature of the service provided or exigent circumstances make it impracticable to provide such written notice in advance of the actual service, an organization must advise beneficiaries of their protections at the earliest available opportunity.

    (c) VA may determine that the notice described in paragraph (a) of this section must inform each beneficiary or prospective beneficiary of the option to seek information from VA, or another entity administering the program, as to whether there are any other federally funded organizations in their area that provide the services available under the applicable program.

    (d) Notices or announcements of award opportunities and notices of award or contracts shall include language substantially similar to that in appendices A and B, respectively, to this part.

**Source:** Source: 83 FR 61272, Nov. 28, 2018, unless otherwise noted.

      § 51.20   Recognition of a State home.

#### § § 51.20

      (a)  To apply for recognition of a home for purposes of receiving per diem from VA, a State must submit a letter requesting recognition to the Office of Geriatrics and Extended Care in VA Central Office, 810 Vermont Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20420. The letter must be signed by the State official authorized to make the request. The letter will be reviewed by VA, in accordance with this section.

      (b)  (1) After receipt of a letter requesting recognition, VA will survey the home in accordance with § 51.31 to determine whether the facility and program of care meet the applicable requirements of subpart C and the applicable standards in subpart D, E, or F of this part. For purposes of the recognition process including the survey, references to State homes in the standards apply to homes that are being considered by VA for recognition as State homes.

      (2) If the Director of the VA Medical Center of jurisdiction determines that the applicable requirements and standards are met, the Director will submit a written recommendation for recognition to the Under Secretary for Health.

      (3) If the Director does not recommend recognition, the Director will submit a written recommendation against recognition to the Under Secretary for Health and will notify in writing the State official who signed the letter submitted under paragraph (a) of this section and the State official authorized to oversee operations of the home. The notification will state the following:

      (i) The specific standard(s) not met; and

      (ii) The State's right to submit a response to the Under Secretary for Health, including any additional evidence, no later than 30 calendar days after the date of the notification to the State.

      (c)  After receipt of a recommendation from the Director, and allowing 30 calendar days for the state to respond to a negative recommendation and to submit evidence, the Under Secretary for Health will award or deny recognition based on all available evidence. The applicant will be notified of the decision in writing. Adverse decisions may be appealed to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (see 38 CFR part 20).

      (d)  (1) Recognition of a State home means that, at the time of recognition, the facility and its program of care meet the applicable requirements of this part. The State home must obtain certification after recognition in accordance with § 51.30.

      (2) After a State home is recognized, any new annex, new branch, or other expansion in the size or capacity of a home or any relocation of the home to a new facility must be separately recognized.

      § 51.30   Certification of a State home.

#### § § 51.30

      (a)  To be certified, the State home must allow VA to survey the home in accordance with § 51.31. A State home must be certified no later than 450 calendar days after the State home is recognized. Certifications expire 600 calendar days after the date of their issuance.

      (b)  The Director of the VA medical center of jurisdiction will certify a State home based on a survey conducted at least once every 270-450 calendar days, at VA's discretion, and will notify the State official authorized to oversee operations of the State home of the decision regarding certification.

      (c)  The State must report any decreases in the capacity for a particular program of care to the Office of Geriatrics and Extended Care in VA Central Office, 810 Vermont Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20420 no later than 30 calendar days after such decrease, and must provide an explanation for the decrease.

      (d) —(1)  After a VA survey, the Director must issue a provisional certification for the surveyed State home if the Director determines that all of the following are true:

      (i) The State home does not meet one or more of the applicable requirements or standards in this part;

      (ii) None of these deficiencies immediately jeopardize the health or safety of any resident or participant;

      (iii) No later than 20 working days after receipt by the State home of the survey report, the State submitted to the Director a written plan to remedy each deficiency in a specified amount of time; and

      (iv) The plan is reasonable and the Director has sent a written notice to the appropriate person(s) at the State home informing him or her that the Director agrees to the plan.

      (2)  VA will continue to survey the State home while it is under a provisional certification in accordance with this section and § 51.31. After such a survey, the Director will continue the provisional certification if the Director determines that the four criteria listed in paragraphs (c)(1)(i)-(iv) of this section are true.

      (e)  A State home has the right to appeal when the Director determines that a State home does not meet the requirements of this part ( denies certification). An appeal is not provided to a State for a State home that receives a provisional certification because, by providing the corrective action plan necessary to receive a provisional certification, a State demonstrates its acceptance of VA's determination that it does not meet the VA standards for which the corrective action plan was submitted.

      (1)  The Director will issue in writing a decision denying certification that sets forth the specific standard(s) not met. The Director will send a copy of this decision to the State official authorized to oversee operations of the State home, and notify that official of the State's right to submit a written appeal to the Under Secretary for Health as stated in paragraph (e)(2) of this section. If the State home does not submit a timely written appeal, the Director's decision becomes final and VA will not pay per diem for any care provided on or after the 31st day after the State's receipt of the Director's decision.

      (2)  The State must submit a written appeal no later than 30 calendar days after the date of the notice of the denial of certification. The appeal must explain why the denial of certification is inaccurate or incomplete and provide any relevant information not considered by the Director. Any appeal that does not identify a reason for disagreement will be returned to the sender without further consideration. If the State home submits a timely written appeal, the Director's decision will not take effect and VA will continue to pay per diem to the State home pending a decision by the Under Secretary for Health.

      (3)  The Under Secretary for Health will review the matter, including any relevant supporting documentation, and issue a written decision that affirms or reverses the Director's decision. The State will be notified of the decision, which may be appealed to the Board of Veterans' Appeals (see 38 CFR part 20) if it results in a loss of per diem payments to the State. VA will terminate recognition and certification and discontinue per diem payments for care provided on and after the date of the Under Secretary for Health's decision affirming a denial of certification or on a later date that must be specified by the Under Secretary for Health.

      (f)  Appeals of matters not addressed in this section will be governed by 38 CFR part 20.

      § 51.31   Surveys for recognition and/or certification.

#### § § 51.31

      (a)  Both before and after a home is recognized and certified, VA may survey the home as necessary to determine whether it complies with applicable regulations. VA will provide advance notice before a recognition survey, but advance notice is not required before other surveys. A survey, as necessary, may cover all parts of the home or only certain parts, and may include review, audit, and production of any records that have a bearing on compliance with the requirements of this part (including any reports from state or local entities), as well as the completion and submission to VA of all required forms. The Director will designate the VA officials and/or contractors to survey the home.

      (b)  VA will not conduct a recognition survey unless the following minimum requirements are met:

      (1) For nursing homes and domiciliaries, the home has at least 20 residents or has a number of residents consisting of at least 50 percent of the resident capacity of the home;

      (2) For adult day health care programs of care, the program has at least 10 participants or has a number of participants consisting of at least 50 percent of participant capacity of the program.

      (c)  If VA identifies a condition at the home that poses an immediate threat to public, resident or participant safety, or other information indicating the existence of such a threat, the Director of the VA medical center of jurisdiction will immediately report this to the VA Network Director (10N1-22); the Office of Geriatrics and Extended Care in VA Central Office; and the State official authorized to oversee operations of the home.

      § 51.32   Terminating recognition.

#### § § 51.32

      Once a home has achieved recognition, the recognition will be terminated only if the State requests that the recognition be terminated, or if VA makes a final decision that affirms the Director's decision not to certify the State home.

    Subpart C—Requirements Applicable to Eligibility, Rates, and Payments

      § 51.40   Basic per diem rates.

#### § § 51.40

      (a)  Except as provided in § 51.41, VA will pay per diem for care provided to an eligible veteran at a State home at the lesser of the following rates:

      (1) One-half of the daily cost of the care for each day the veteran is in the State home, as calculated under paragraph (b) of this section.

      (2) The basic per diem rate for each day the veteran is in the State home. The basic per diem rate is established by VA for each fiscal year in accordance with 38 U.S.C. 1741(a) and (c).

      (b)  The daily cost of care consists of those direct and indirect costs attributable to care at the State home, divided by the total number of residents serviced by the program of care. Cost principles are set forth in Office of Management and Budget (OMB) regulations. 2 CFR 200.400-200.475.

      (c) —(1)  VA will pay per diem for each day that the veteran is receiving nursing home care and has an overnight stay at the State home. Per diem also will be paid for a day when there is no overnight stay if the State home nursing home care program has an occupancy rate of 90 percent or greater on that day. However, these payments will be made only for the first 10 consecutive days during which the veteran is admitted as a patient for any stay in a VA or other hospital (a hospital stay could occur more than once in a calendar year once there is an overnight stay in the State home between hospital stays) and only for the first 12 days in a calendar year during which the veteran is absent for purposes other than receiving hospital care. Occupancy rate is calculated by dividing the total number of residents (including nonveterans) in the nursing home on that day by the total recognized nursing home capacity in that State home.

      (2)  VA will pay per diem for each day that the veteran is receiving domiciliary care and has an overnight stay at the State home. VA will also pay per diem during any absence of 96 or fewer consecutive hours for purposes other than receiving hospital care at VA expense, but VA will not pay per diem for any part of the absence if it continues for longer than 96 consecutive hours. Absences that are not interrupted by at least 24 hours of continuous residence in the State home are considered one continuous absence.

      (d)  Per diem will be paid for a day of adult day health care. For purposes of this section a day of adult day health care means:

      (1) Six hours or more in one calendar day in which a veteran receives adult day health care; or

      (2) Any two periods of at least 3 hours each but less than 6 hours each in any 2 calendar days in the same calendar month in which the veteran receives adult day health care.

      (3) Time during which the State home provides transportation between the veteran's residence and the State home or to a health care visit, or provides staff to accompany a veteran during transportation or a health care visit, will be included as time the veteran receives adult day health care.

      § 51.41   Contracts and State home care agreements for certain veterans with service-connected disabilities.

#### § § 51.41

      (a)  VA and State homes may enter into both contracts and State home care agreements. VA will pay for each eligible veteran's care through either a contract or a “State home care agreement.” Eligible veterans are those who:

      (1) Are in need of nursing home care for a VA adjudicated service-connected disability, or

      (2) Have a singular or combined rating of 70 percent or more based on one or more service-connected disabilities or a rating of total disability based on individual unemployability and are in need of nursing home care.

      (b)  Contracts under this section will be subject to this part to the extent provided for in the contract and will be governed by federal acquisition law and regulation. Contracts for payment under this section will provide for payment either:

      (1) At a rate or rates negotiated between VA and the State home; or

      (2) On request from a State home that provided nursing home care on August 5, 2012, for which the State home was eligible for payment under 38 U.S.C. 1745(a)(1), at a rate that reflects the overall methodology of reimbursement for such care that was in effect for the State home on August 5, 2012.

      (c)  (1) State homes must sign an agreement to receive payment from VA for providing care to certain eligible veterans under a State home care agreement. A State home care agreement for nursing home care under this section will provide for payments at the rate determined by the following formula.

      (i) Determine whether the Resource Utilization Groups (RUG) or Skilled Nursing Facility Prospective Payment System (SNF-PPS) applies.

      (A) For State homes in a metropolitan statistical area, use the published fiscal year Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) RUG case-mix levels for the applicable metropolitan statistical area.

      (B) For State homes in a rural area, use the published fiscal year CMS SNF-PPS case-mix levels for the applicable rural area.

      (ii) Compute the daily rate for each State home, using the following formula in the order described:

      (A) Multiply the labor component by the State home wage index for each of the applicable case-mix levels.

      (B) Add to that amount the non-labor component.

      (C) Divide the sum of the results of these calculations by the number of applicable case-mix levels.

      (D) Add to this quotient the amount based on the CMS payment schedule for physician services. The amount for physician services, based on information published by CMS, is the average hourly rate for all physicians, with the rate modified by the applicable urban or rural geographic index for physician work, then multiplied by 12, then divided by the number of days in the year. The resulting sum is the per diem baseline rate for the State home.

      (E) Multiply the per diem baseline rate from the previous year by the CMS Skilled Nursing Facilities (SNF) Market Basket increase in effect as of December 28, 2023. The sum establishes the reference total per diem baseline rate from which subsequent fiscal year per diem rates will be calculated. For calculation of SNF per diem rates for subsequent fiscal years VA will apply the CMS SNF Market Basket increase to the total per diem each year.

      (2) The State home shall not charge any individual, insurer, or entity (other than VA) for the nursing home care paid for by VA under a State home care agreement. Also, as a condition of receiving payments under paragraph (c), the State home must agree not to accept drugs and medicines from VA provided under 38 U.S.C. 1712(d) on behalf of veterans covered by this section and corresponding VA regulations (payment under this paragraph (c) includes payment for drugs and medicines).

      (3) Agreements under this paragraph (c) will be subject to this part, except to the extent that this part conflicts with this section. For purposes of this section, the term “per diem” in part 51 includes payments under State home care agreements.

      (4) If a veteran receives a retroactive VA service-connected disability rating and becomes a veteran identified in paragraph (a) of this section, the State home may request payment under the State home care agreement for nursing home care back to the retroactive effective date of the rating or February 2, 2013, whichever is later. For care provided after the effective date but before February 2, 2013, the State home may request payment at the special per diem rate that was in effect at the time that the care was rendered.

      (d)  State home care agreements must be signed by the Director of the VA medical center of jurisdiction or designee.

      (e)  Prior to entering into a State home care agreement, State homes must submit to the VA medical center of jurisdiction a completed VA Form 10-10EZ, Application for Medical Benefits (or VA Form 10-10EZR, Health Benefits Renewal Form, if a completed VA Form 10-10EZ is already on file at VA), and a completed VA Form 10-10SH, State Home Program Application for Care—Medical Certification, for the veterans for whom the State home will seek payment under the State home care agreement. After VA and the State home have entered into a State home care agreement, forms for payment must be submitted in accordance with § 51.42. Copies of VA Forms can be obtained from any VA Medical Center and are available on our website at

      (f)  (1) A State home that wishes to terminate a VA provider agreement with VA must send written notice of its intent to the Director of the VA medical center of jurisdiction at least 30 days before the effective date of termination of the agreement. The notice shall include the intended date of termination.

      (2) State home care agreements will terminate on the date of a final decision that the home is no longer recognized or certified by VA under part 51.

      (g)  Under State home care agreements entered into under this section, State homes are not required to comply with reporting and auditing requirements imposed under the Service Contract Act of 1965, as amended (41 U.S.C. 6701, ); however, State homes must comply with all other applicable Federal laws concerning employment and hiring practices including the Fair Labor Standards Act, National Labor Relations Act, the Civil Rights Acts, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, the Vocational Rehabilitation Act of 1973, Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, Occupational Health and Safety Act of 1970, Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, Consolidated Omnibus Reconciliation Act, the Family and Medical Leave Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act, the Immigration and Nationality Act, the Consumer Credit Protection Act, the Employee Polygraph Protection Act, and the Employee Retirement Income Security Act.

      § 51.42   Payment procedures.

#### § § 51.42

      (a) —(1)  As a condition for receiving payment of per diem under this part, the State home must submit the forms identified in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section to the VA medical center of jurisdiction for each veteran at the time of the veteran's admission to or enrollment in a State home. If the home is not a recognized State home, the home must, after recognition, submit forms for Veterans who received care on and after the date of the completion of the VA survey that provided the basis for determining that the home met the standards of this part. The State home must also submit the appropriate form with any request for a change in the type of per diem paid on behalf of a veteran as a result of a change in the veteran's program of care or a change in the veteran's service-connected disability rating that makes the veteran's care eligible for payment under § 51.41. Copies of VA Forms can be obtained from any VA Medical Center and are available on our website at  The required forms are:

      (i) A completed VA Form 10-10EZ, Application for Medical Benefits (or VA Form 10-10EZR, Health Benefits Renewal Form, if a completed Form 10-10EZ is already on file at VA).

      (ii) A completed VA Form 10-10SH, State Home Program Application for Care—Medical Certification.

      (2)  Except as provided in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section, VA pays per diem on a monthly basis for care provided during the prior month. To receive payment, the State must submit each month to the VA a completed VA Form 10-5588, State Home Report and Statement of Federal Aid Claimed.

      (b) —(1)  No per diem payments will be made until VA recognizes the home and each veteran resident for whom VA pays per diem is verified as being eligible; however, per diem payments will be made retroactively for care that was provided on and after the date of the completion of the VA survey that provided the basis for determining that the home met the standards of this part.

      (2)  Per diem will be paid for the care of veterans in capacity certified in accordance with § 51.30(c) retroactive to the date of the completion of the survey if the Director certifies the capacity as a result of that survey.

      (3)  When a State home admits or enrolls an eligible veteran, VA will pay per diem under this part from the date of receipt of the completed forms required by this section, except that VA will pay per diem from the date care began if the Director receives the completed forms no later than 10 calendar days after care began. VA will make retroactive payments of per diem under paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section only if the Director receives the completed forms that must be submitted under this section.

      (c)  VA will make per diem payments under this part retroactive to the date specified by paragraph (b)(3) of this section, or January 5, 2021, whichever date is later, if all the following are met:

      (1) Within 90 calendar days of [EFFECTIVE DATE OF FINAL RULE] the State home provides VA a written list of veterans' names for whom completed forms were received by VA on or after January 5, 2021, and the State home requests that VA consider them for a waiver under § 51.51(b)(2);

      (2) With respect to the veterans on the written list under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, VA denied the State's request for per diem for the veterans when their forms were originally submitted and the denial was solely because the veteran did not meet the requirements under 38 CFR 51.51(b) (2021);

      (3) Upon VA review, the veteran would have received a waiver under § 51.51(b)(2) if that paragraph had been in effect when the request for per diem was originally submitted; and

      (4) Within 90 calendar days of [EFFECTIVE DATE OF FINAL RULE] the State home submits to VA a completed VA Form 10-5588, State Home Report and Statement of Federal Aid Claimed, for each month that the State home provided domiciliary care to a veteran for whom the home is requesting a waiver. The form would only cover the veterans not originally included on the form when submitted previously for that month.

      § 51.43   Drugs and medicines for certain veterans.

#### § § 51.43

      (a) In addition to the per diem payments under § 51.40 of this part, the Secretary will furnish drugs and medicines to a State home as may be ordered by prescription of a duly licensed physician as specific therapy in the treatment of illness or injury for a veteran receiving nursing home care in a State home if—

      (1) The veteran:

      (i) Has a singular or combined rating of less than 50 percent based on one or more service-connected disabilities and needs the drugs and medicines for a service-connected disability; and

      (ii) Needs nursing home care for reasons that do not include care for a VA adjudicated service-connected disability; or

      (2) The veteran:

      (i) Has a singular or combined rating of 50 or 60 percent based on one or more service-connected disabilities and needs the drugs and medicines; and

      (ii) Needs nursing home care for reasons that do not include care for a VA adjudicated service-connected disability.

      (b) VA will also furnish drugs and medicines to a State home for a veteran receiving nursing home, domiciliary, or adult day health care in a State home pursuant to 38 U.S.C. 1712(d), as implemented by § 17.96 of this chapter, subject to the limitation in § 51.41(c)(2).

      (c) VA may furnish a drug or medicine under paragraph (a) of this section and under § 17.96 of this chapter only if the drug or medicine is included on VA's National Formulary, unless VA determines a non-Formulary drug or medicine is medically necessary.

      (d) VA may furnish a drug or medicine under this section and under § 17.96 of this chapter by having the drug or medicine delivered to the State home in which the veteran resides by mail or other means and packaged in a form that is mutually acceptable to the State home and to VA set forth in a written agreement.

      (e) As a condition for receiving drugs or medicine under this section or under § 17.96 of this chapter, the State must submit to the VA medical center of jurisdiction a completed VA Form 10-0460 with the corresponding prescription(s) for each eligible veteran.

      (g) Veterans who VA determines are unable to defray the expenses of necessary care as specified under 38 U.S.C. 1722(a);

      (h) Veterans solely seeking care for a disorder associated with exposure to a toxic substance or radiation, for a disorder associated with service in the Southwest Asia theater of operations during the Persian Gulf War, as provided in 38 U.S.C. 1710(e), or for any illness associated with service in combat in a war after the Gulf War or during a period of hostility after November 11, 1998, as provided and limited in 38 U.S.C. 1710(e);

      § 51.51   Eligible veterans—domiciliary care.

#### § § 51.51

      (a) A veteran is an eligible veteran for the purposes of payment of per diem for domiciliary care in a State home under this part if VA determines that the veteran is not barred from receiving care based on his or her service (see 38 U.S.C. 5303, 5303A), is not barred from receiving VA pension, compensation or dependency and indemnity compensation based on the character of a discharge from military service (see 38 CFR 3.12), and the veteran is:

      (1) A veteran whose annual income does not exceed the maximum annual rate of pension payable to a veteran in need of regular aid and attendance; or

      (2) A veteran who VA determines has no adequate means of support. When an applicant's annual income exceeds the rate of pension described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, VA will determine if the applicant has no adequate means of support. This determination will be made through an assessment of the veteran's deficits in health or functional status that may render the veteran incapable of achieving or sustaining independence in the community as determined by the Chief of Staff of the VA medical center of jurisdiction, or designee. Assessment of whether the veteran has no adequate means of support will be based on objective evidence that considers factors that are inclusive of but not limited to:

      (i) The impact of the severity of the veteran's medical condition, disabilities, and symptoms on the veteran's safety in the community;

      (ii) The impact of the severity of the veteran's medical condition, disabilities, and symptoms on the veteran's ability to provide self-care;

      (iii) The availability of community or family support systems;

      (iv) The impact of the severity of the veteran's medical condition, disabilities, and symptoms on the veteran's ability to access and utilize community support systems;

      (v) The risk of loss of housing in the community;

      (vi) The risk of loss of the veteran's income;

      (vii) Access to outpatient mental health and substance use disorder care; and

      (viii) The current effectiveness of any outpatient mental health and substance use disorder care provided to the veteran.

      (b)(1) For purposes of this section, the eligible veteran must be able to perform the following:

      (i) Daily ablutions, such as brushing teeth, bathing, combing hair, and body eliminations, without assistance.

      (ii) Dress himself or herself with a minimum of assistance.

      (iii) Proceed to and return from the dining hall without aid.

      (iv) Feed himself or herself.

      (v) Secure medical attention on an ambulatory basis or by use of a personally propelled wheelchair.

      (vi) Have voluntary control over body eliminations or have control by use of an appropriate prosthesis.

      (vii) Make rational and competent decisions as to the veteran's desire to remain in or leave the State home; or, if the veteran lacks the general capacity to make this residential care placement decision, as defined by State law, then the veteran's legal representative designated in accordance with State law, is authorized to make this decision on behalf of the veteran.

      (2) The Chief of Staff of the VA medical center of jurisdiction, or designee, may waive the requirements in paragraph (b)(1) of this section for purposes of payment of per diem for domiciliary care in a State home on or after January 5, 2021, if the veteran is able to perform not fewer than four of the requirements set forth in such paragraph; or such waiver would be, based on a clinical determination, in the best interest of the veteran because receipt of domiciliary care in the particular State home would likely be beneficial to the veteran. This clinical determination must consider whether receiving domiciliary care in the State home would significantly enhance the veteran's ability to live safely, would support the veteran's potential progress in rehabilitation, if such potential exists, and would create an environment that supports the health and well-being of the veteran. In granting a waiver of paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the Chief of Staff of the VA medical center of jurisdiction, or designee, must make a finding that the State home has the capability to provide the domiciliary care that the veteran needs.

      § 51.52   Eligible veterans—adult day health care.

#### § § 51.52

      A veteran is an eligible veteran for payment of per diem to a State for adult day health care if VA determines that the veteran:

      (a) Is not barred from receiving VA pension, compensation or dependency and indemnity compensation based on the character of a discharge from military service (see 38 CFR 3.12);

      (b) Is enrolled in the VA health care system;

      (c) Would otherwise require nursing home care; and

      (d) Needs adult day health care because the veteran meets any one of the following conditions:

      (1) The veteran has three or more Activities of Daily Living (ADL) dependencies.

      (2) The veteran has significant cognitive impairment.

      (3) The veteran has two ADL dependencies and two or more of the following conditions:

      (iv) Living alone in the community.

      (4) The veteran does not meet the criteria in paragraph (d)(1), (2), or (3) of this section, but nevertheless a licensed VA medical practitioner determines the veteran needs adult day health care services.

      § 51.58   Requirements and Standards applicable for payment of per diem.

#### § § 51.58

      A State home must meet the requirements in subpart C and the standards in the applicable subpart to be recognized, certified, and receive per diem for that program of care:

      (a) For nursing home care, subpart D.

      (b) For domiciliary care, subpart E.

      § 51.59   Authority to continue payment of per diem when veterans are relocated due to emergency.

#### § § 51.59

      (a)  For the purposes of this section, emergency means an occasion or instance where all of the following are true:

      (1) It would be unsafe for veterans receiving care at a State home to remain in that home.

      (2) The State is not, or believes that it will not be, able to provide care in the State home on a temporary or long-term basis for any or all of its veteran residents due to a situation involving the State home, and not due to a situation where a particular veteran's medical condition requires that the veteran be transferred to another facility, such as for a period of hospitalization.

      (3) The State determines that the veterans must be evacuated to another facility or facilities.

      (b)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, VA will continue to pay per diem for a period not to exceed 30 calendar days for any eligible veteran who resided in a State home, and for whom VA was paying per diem, if such veteran is evacuated during an emergency into a facility other than a VA nursing home, hospital, domiciliary, or other VA site of care if the State is responsible for providing or paying for the care. VA will not pay per diem under this section for more than 30 calendar days of care provided in the evacuation facility, unless the official who approved the emergency response under paragraph (e) of this section determines that it is not reasonably possible to return the veteran to a State home within the 30-calendar-day period, in which case such official will approve additional period(s) of no more than 30 calendar days in accordance with this section. VA will not pay per diem if VA determines that a veteran is or has been placed in a facility that does not meet the standards set forth in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, and VA may recover all per diem paid for the care of the veteran in that facility.

      (c)  The following standards and procedures in paragraphs (c)(1) through (3) apply to the selection of an evacuation facility in order for VA to continue to pay per diem during an emergency. These standards and procedures also apply to evacuation facilities when veterans are evacuated from a nursing home in which care is being provided pursuant to a contract under 38 U.S.C. 1720.

      (1) Each veteran who is evacuated must be placed in a facility that, at a minimum, will meet the needs for food, shelter, toileting, and essential medical care of that veteran.

      (2) For veterans evacuated from nursing homes, the following types of facilities may meet the standards under paragraph (c)(1) of this section:

      (i) VA Community Living Centers;

      (ii) VA contract nursing homes;

      (iii) Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services certified facilities; and

      (iv) Licensed nursing homes.

      (3) For veterans evacuated from domiciliaries, the following types of facilities may meet the standards in paragraph (c)(1) of this section:

      (i) Emergency evacuation facilities identified by the city or State;

      (ii) Assisted living facilities; and

      (iii) Hotels.

      (d)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, VA will continue to pay per diem for a period not to exceed 30 calendar days for any eligible veteran who was receiving adult day health care, and for whom VA was paying per diem, if the adult day health care facility becomes temporarily unavailable due to an emergency. Approval of a temporary program of care for such veteran is subject to paragraph (e) of this section. If after 30 calendar days the veteran cannot return to the adult day health care program in the State home, VA will discontinue per diem payments unless the official who approved the emergency response under paragraph (e) of this section determines that it is not reasonably possible to provide care in the State home or to relocate an eligible veteran to a different recognized or certified facility, in which case such official will approve additional period(s) of no more than 30 calendar days at the temporary program of care in accordance with this section. VA will not pay per diem if VA determines that a veteran was provided adult day health care in a facility that does not meet the standards set forth in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, and VA may recover all per diem paid for the care of the veteran in that facility.

      (e)  Per diem payments will not be made under this section unless and until the Director of the VA medical center of jurisdiction or the director of the VISN in which the State home is located (if the VAMC Director is not capable of doing so) determines, that an emergency exists and that the evacuation facility meets VA standards set forth in paragraph (c)(1) of this section.

    Subpart D—Standards Applicable to the Payment of Per Diem for Nursing Home Care.

      § 51.60   Standards applicable for payment of per diem.

#### § § 51.60

      The provisions of this subpart are the standards that a State home and facility management must meet for the State to receive per diem for nursing home care.

      § 51.70   Resident rights.

#### § § 51.70

      The resident has a right to a dignified existence, self-determination, and communication with and access to persons and services inside and outside the facility. The facility management must protect and promote the rights of each resident, including each of the following rights:

      (a)  (1) The resident has the right to exercise his or her rights as a resident of the facility and as a citizen or resident of the United States.

      (2) The resident has the right to be free of interference, coercion, discrimination, and reprisal from the facility management in exercising his or her rights.

      (3) The resident has the right to freedom from chemical or physical restraint.

      (4) In the case of a resident determined incompetent under the laws of a State by a court of jurisdiction, the rights of the resident are exercised by the person appointed under State law to act on the resident's behalf.

      (5) In the case of a resident who has not been determined incompetent by the State court, any legal-surrogate designated in accordance with State law may exercise the resident's rights to the extent provided by State law.

      (b)  (1) The facility management must inform the resident both orally and in writing in a language that the resident understands of his or her rights and all rules and regulations governing resident conduct and responsibilities during the stay in the facility. Such notification must be made prior to or upon admission and periodically during the resident's stay.

      (2) The resident or his or her legal representative has the right:

      (i) Upon an oral or written request, to access all records pertaining to himself or herself including current clinical records within 24 hours (excluding weekends and holidays); and

      (ii) After receipt of his or her records for review, to purchase at a cost not to exceed the community standard photocopies of the records or any portions of them upon request and with 2 working days advance notice to the facility management.

      (3) The resident has the right to be fully informed in language that he or she can understand of his or her total health status;

      (4) The resident has the right to refuse treatment, to refuse to participate in experimental research, and to formulate an advance directive as specified in paragraph (b)(7) of this section; and

      (5) The facility management must inform each resident before, or at the time of admission, and periodically during the resident's stay, of services available in the facility and of charges for those services to be billed to the resident.

      (6) The facility management must furnish a written description of legal rights which includes:

      (i) A description of the manner of protecting personal funds, under paragraph (c) of this section;

      (ii) A statement that the resident may file a complaint with the State (agency) concerning resident abuse, neglect, misappropriation of resident property in the facility, and non-compliance with the advance directives requirements.

      (7) The facility management must have written policies and procedures regarding advance directives (e.g., living wills) that include provisions to inform and provide written information to all residents concerning the right to accept or refuse medical or surgical treatment and, at the individual's option, formulate an advance directive. This includes a written description of the facility's policies to implement advance directives and applicable State law. If an individual is incapacitated at the time of admission and is unable to receive information (due to the incapacitating conditions) or articulate whether or not he or she has executed an advance directive, the facility may give advance directive information to the individual's family or surrogate in the same manner that it issues other materials about policies and procedures to the family of the incapacitated individual or to a surrogate or other concerned persons in accordance with State law. The facility management is not relieved of its obligation to provide this information to the individual once he or she is no longer incapacitated or unable to receive such information. Follow-up procedures must be in place to provide the information to the individual directly at the appropriate time.

      (iii) Reviewed periodically and revised consistent with the most recent comprehensive assessment by a team of qualified persons no less often than semi-annually; and

      (iv) Revised promptly after a comprehensive assessment reveals a significant change in the resident's condition.

      (3) The services provided by the facility must

      (i) Meet professional standards of quality; and

      (ii) Be provided by qualified persons in accordance with each resident's written comprehensive care plan.

      (d)  (1) Prior to discharging a resident, the State home must prepare a discharge summary that includes

      (i) A summary of the resident's stay, the resident's status at the time of the discharge, and the resident's progress on the comprehensive care plan in paragraph (b)(2) of this section; and

      (ii) A post-discharge comprehensive care plan that is developed with the participation of the resident.

  PART 53—PAYMENTS TO STATES FOR PROGRAMS TO PROMOTE THE HIRING AND RETENTION OF NURSES AT STATE VETERANS HOMES

### Part 53

**Authority:** Authority: 38 U.S.C. 101, 501, 1744.

**Source:** Source: 73 FR 73560, Dec. 3, 2008, unless otherwise noted.

    § 53.1   Purpose and scope.

#### § § 53.1

    In accordance with the provisions of 38 U.S.C. 1744, this part sets forth the mechanism for a State to obtain payments to assist a State Veterans Home (SVH) in the hiring and retention of nurses for the purpose of reducing nursing shortages at that SVH.

    § 53.2   Definitions.

#### § § 53.2

    For the purpose of this part:

    means an individual who is a registered nurse, a licensed practical nurse, a licensed vocational nurse, or a _nursing_ assistant certified in the State in which payment is made and who is a bedside caregiver at least a majority of the time (e.g., this would generally not include an individual acting in the capacity of an advance practice nurse, an administrative nurse, or a director of nursing) (the terms  and  shall be construed consistent with this definition).

    means each of the several _State_s, Territories, and possessions of the United States, the District of Columbia, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.

    means the official designated in accordance with State authority with responsibility for matters relating to payments under this part.

    means a home approved by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) which a State established primarily for veterans disabled by age, disease, or otherwise, who by reason of such disability are incapable of earning a living. A SVH may provide domiciliary care, nursing home care, adult day health care, and hospital care. Hospital care may be provided only when the SVH also provides domiciliary and/or nursing home care.

    § 53.10   Decision makers, notifications, and additional information.

#### § § 53.10

    The Director, Geriatrics and Extended Care Operations, will make all determinations regarding payments under this part, and will provide written notice to affected State representatives of approvals, denials, or requests for additional information under this part.

> [73 FR 73560, Dec. 3, 2008, as amended at 77 FR 73313, Dec. 10, 2012]

    § 53.11   General requirements for payments.

#### § § 53.11

    (a) VA will make payment under this part to a State for an employee incentive program to reduce the shortage of nurses at the SVH, when the following conditions are met:

    (1) The State representative applies for payment in accordance with the provisions of § 53.20;

    (2) The SVH receives per diem payments from VA under the provisions of 38 U.S.C. 1741 for one or more of the following: Adult day health care, domiciliary care, hospital care, or nursing home care;

    (3) The SVH has a nursing shortage that is documented by credible evidence, including but not limited to SVH records showing nursing vacancies, SVH records showing nurse overtime use, and reports documenting that nurses are difficult to hire in the local area and difficult to retain as employees at the SVH;

    (4) The SVH does not use payments under this part to pay for all or part of a nurse's standard employee benefits, such as salary, health insurance, or retirement plan;

    (5) The SVH provides to the Director, Geriatrics and Extended Care Operations, documentation establishing that it has an employee incentive program that:

    (i) Is likely to be effective in promoting the hiring and retention of nurses for the purpose of reducing nursing shortages at that home, and

    (ii) Is in operation or ready for immediate implementation if VA payments are made under this part;

    (6) The payment amount applied for by the State is no more than 50 percent of the funding for the employee incentive program during the Federal fiscal year;

    (7) The SVH employee incentive program includes a mechanism to ensure that an individual receiving benefits under the program works at the SVH as a nurse for a period commensurate with the benefits provided, and, insofar as possible, the program is designed to eliminate any nursing shortage at the SVH within a 3-year period from the initiation of VA payments;

    (8) The SVH, if it received payments under this part during a previous Federal fiscal year, has met the reporting requirements of § 53.31(a) regarding such payments;

    (9) The SVH credits to its employee incentive program any funds refunded to the SVH by an employee because the employee was in breach of an agreement for employee assistance funded with payments made under this part and the SVH credits the amount returned as a non-Federal funding source; and

    (10) The project does not involve the construction, acquisition, expansion, remodeling or alteration of the SVH.

    (b) VA intends to allow flexibility and innovation in determining the types of employee incentive programs at SVHs eligible for payments. Programs could include such things as the provision of short-term scholarships for continuing nursing education, sign-on bonuses for nurses, student loan forgiveness programs, and improvements to working conditions. In determining whether an employee incentive program is likely to be effective, VA will consider any information available, including past performance of the SVH's program funded by payments made under this part.

    § 53.20   Application requirements.

#### § § 53.20

    (a) To apply for payments during a Federal fiscal year, a State representative must submit to VA, in accordance with § 53.40, a completed VA Form 10-0430 and documentation specified by the form (VA Form 10-0430 is available at VA medical centers and on the Internet at  or may be obtained by contacting the Geriatrics and Extended Care Office at 202-461-6750, VHA Headquarters, 810 Vermont Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20420). The submission for payments for a fiscal year must be received by VA during the last quarter (July 1-September 30) of the preceding fiscal year. The State must submit a new application for each fiscal year that the State seeks payments for an incentive program.

    (b) As part of the application, the State representative must submit to VA evidence that the State has sufficient funding, when combined with the VA payments, to fully operate its employee incentive program through the end of the fiscal year. To meet this requirement, the State representative must provide to VA a letter from an authorized State official certifying that, if VA were to approve payments under this part, the non-VA share of the funds for the program would be by a date or dates specified in the certification, available for the employee incentive program without further State action to make such funds available. If the certification is based on a State law authorizing funds for the employee incentive program, a copy of the State law must be submitted with the certification.

    (c) If an application does not contain sufficient information for a determination under this part, the State representative will be notified in writing (electronically and by mail) of any additional submission required and that the State has 30 calendar days from the date of the notice to submit such additional information or no further action will be taken. If the State representative does not submit all of the required information or demonstrate that he or she has good cause for failing to provide the information within 30 calendar days of the notice (which may extend beyond the last quarter of the preceding Federal fiscal year), then the State applicant will be notified in writing that the application for VA assistance will be deemed withdrawn and no further action will be taken.

    § 59.10   General requirements for a grant.

#### § § 59.10

    For a State to obtain a grant under this part and grant funds, its initial application for the grant must be approved under § 59.20, and the project must be ranked sufficiently high on the priority list for the current fiscal year so that funding is available for the project. It must meet the additional application requirements in § 59.60, and it must meet all other requirements under this part for obtaining a grant and grant funds.

    § 59.20   Initial application requirements.

#### § § 59.20

    (a) For a project to be considered for inclusion on the priority list in § 59.50 of this part for the next fiscal year, a State must submit to VA an original and one copy of a completed VA Form 10-0388-1 and all information, documentation, and other forms specified by VA Form 10-0388-1 (these forms are available on the internet Web sites provided in § 59.170 of this part).

    (b) The Secretary, based on the information submitted for a project pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, will approve the project for inclusion on the priority list in § 59.50 of this part if the submission includes all of the information requested under paragraph (a) of this section and if the submission represents a project that, if further developed, could meet the requirements for a grant under this part.

    (c) The items requested under paragraph (a) of this section must be received by VA no later than April 15 in order for VA to include the application on the priority list for the award of grants during the next fiscal year.  § 59.50, Priority List.

    § 59.30   Documentation.

#### § § 59.30

    For a State to obtain a grant and grant funds under this part, the State must submit to VA documentation that the site of the project is in reasonable proximity to a sufficient concentration and population of veterans that are 65 years of age and older and that there is a reasonable basis to conclude that the facility when complete will be fully occupied. This documentation must be included in the initial application submitted to VA under § 59.20.

    § 59.40   Maximum number of nursing home care and domiciliary care beds for veterans by State.

#### § § 59.40

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, a state may not request a grant for a project to construct or acquire a new state home facility, to increase the number of beds available at a state home facility, or to replace beds at a state home facility if the project would increase the total number of state home nursing home and domiciliary beds in that state beyond the maximum number designated for that state, as shown in the following chart. The provisions of 38 U.S.C. 8134 require VA to prescribe for each state the number of nursing home and domiciliary beds for which grants may be furnished (, the unmet need). A state's unmet need for state home nursing home and domiciliary beds is the number in the following chart for that state minus the sum of the number of nursing home and domiciliary beds in operation at state home facilities and the number of state home nursing home and domiciliary beds not yet in operation but for which a grant has either been requested or awarded under this part.

    (b) A State may request a grant for a project that would increase the total number of State nursing home and domiciliary beds beyond the maximum number for that State, if the State submits to VA, documentation to establish a need for the exception based on travel distances of at least two hours (by land transportation or any other usual mode of transportation if land transportation is not available) between a veteran population center sufficient for the establishment of a State home and any existing State home. The determination regarding a request for an exception will be made by the Secretary.

    § 59.50   Priority list.

#### § § 59.50

    (a) The Secretary will make a list prioritizing the applications that were received on or before April 15 and that were approved under § 59.20 of this part. Except as otherwise provided in this section, applications will be prioritized from the highest to the lowest in the following order:

    (1)  An application from a State that has made sufficient funds available for the project for which the grant is requested so that such project may proceed upon approval of the grant without further action required by the State (such as subsequent issuance of bonds) to make such funds available for the project. To meet this criteria, the State must provide to VA a letter from an authorized State budget official certifying that the State funds are, or will be, available for the project, so that if VA awards the grant, the project may proceed without further State action to make such funds available (such as further action to issue bonds). If the certification is based on an Act authorizing the project and making available the State's matching funds for the project, a copy of the Act must be submitted with the certification.

    (i)  An application for a life or safety project, which means a project to remedy a condition, or conditions, at an existing facility that have been cited as threatening to the lives or safety of one or more of the residents or program participants in the facility by a VA safety office, VA engineering office, or other VA office with responsibility for life and safety inspections; a State or local government agency (including a Fire Marshal); or an accrediting institution (including the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations). Unless an addition or replacement of building utility systems or features is necessary to remedy a cited threat to the lives or safety of residents and program participants, this priority group does not include applications for the addition or replacement of building utility systems or features; such applications will be prioritized in accordance with the criteria in subpriority group 5 of priority group 1. An application may be included in this subpriority group only if all of the funds requested would be used for a life or safety project; or, if the estimated cost of the life or safety project is under $400,000.00, and the majority of the funds requested would be used for such a project. Projects in this subpriority group will be further prioritized in the following order:

    (A) Seismic;

    (B) Building construction;

    (C) Egress;

    (D) Building compartmentalization (e.g., smoke barrier, fire walls);

    (E) Fire alarm/detection;

    (F) Security;

    (G) Asbestos/hazardous materials; and

    (H) All other projects (e.g., nurse call systems, patient lifts).

    (ii)  An application from a State that has not previously applied for a grant under 38 U.S.C. 8131-8137 for construction or acquisition of a State nursing home.

    (iii)  An application for construction or acquisition of a nursing home or domiciliary from a State that has a great need for the beds that the State, in that application, proposes to establish.

    (iv)  An application from a State for renovations to a State Home facility other than renovations that would be included in subpriority group 1 of priority group 1. Projects will be further prioritized in the following order:

    (A) Adult day health care renovation and construction of a new adult day health care facility that replaces an existing facility;

    (B) Nursing home renovation (e.g., patient privacy) and construction of a new nursing home that replaces an existing nursing home;

    (C) Code compliance under the Americans with Disabilities Act;

    (D) Building systems and utilities (e.g., electrical; heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC); boiler; medical gasses; roof; elevators);

    (E) Clinical-support facilities (e.g., for dietetics, laundry, rehabilitation therapy); and

    (F) General renovation/upgrade (e.g., warehouse, storage, administration/office, multipurpose).

    (v)  An application for construction or acquisition of a nursing home or domiciliary from a State that has a significant need for the beds that the State in that application proposes to establish.

    (vi)  An application for construction or acquisition of a nursing home or domiciliary from a State that has not demonstrated that State funds are being used to protect the lives or safety of the residents and program participants of the facility as required in § 59.50(e).

    (vii)  An application for construction or acquisition of a nursing home or domiciliary from a State that has a limited need for the beds that the State, in that application, proposes to establish.

    (2)  An application not meeting the criteria of paragraph (a)(1) of this section but meeting the criteria of paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section. Projects within this priority group will be further prioritized the same as in paragraphs (a)(1)(i)(A) through (a)(1)(i)(H) of this section.

    (3)  An application not meeting the criteria of paragraph (a)(1) of this section but meeting the criteria of paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section.

    (4)  An application not meeting the criteria of paragraph (a)(1) of this section but meeting the criteria of paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section.

    (5)  An application not meeting the criteria of paragraph (a)(1) of this section but meeting the criteria of paragraph (a)(1)(iv) of this section. Projects within this priority group will be further prioritized the same as in paragraphs (a)(1)(iv)(A) through (a)(1)(iv)(F) of this section.

    (6)  An application not meeting the criteria of paragraph (a)(1) of this section but meeting the criteria of paragraph (a)(1)(v) of this section.

    (7)  An application not meeting the criteria of paragraph (a)(1) of this section but meeting the criteria of paragraph (a)(1)(vi) of this section.

    (8)  An application not meeting the criteria of paragraph (a)(1) of this section but meeting the criteria of paragraph (a)(1)(vii) of this section.

    (b)(1) If a State accepts a partial grant for a project under § 59.80(a)(2), VA will give that project the highest priority for the next fiscal year within the priority group to which it is assigned (without further prioritization of that priority group) to receive up to 30 percent of the funds available for that year. Funds available do not include funds conditionally obligated in the previous fiscal year under § 59.70(a)(2).

    (2) If, in a given fiscal year, more than one State previously accepted a partial grant under § 59.80(a)(2), these partial-grant recipients will be further prioritized on the priority list for that fiscal year based on the date that VA first awarded a partial grant for the project (the earlier the grant was awarded, the higher the priority given). The partial-grant recipients, in aggregate, may receive up to 30 percent of the funds available for that year that would be set aside for partial-grant recipients.

    (c) An application will be given priority on the priority list (after applications described in paragraph (b) of this section) for the next fiscal year ahead of all applications that had not been approved under § 59.20 on the date that the application was approved under § 59.20, if:

    (1) During the current fiscal year VA would have awarded a grant based on the application except for the fact that VA determined that the State did not, by July 1, provide evidence that it had its matching funds for the project, and

    (2) The State was notified prior to July 1 that VA had funding available for this grant application.

    (d) Applications in each priority or subpriority group will be further prioritized based on the date the application was received in VA (the earlier the application was received, the higher the priority given). Projects will be prioritized under this paragraph after all prioritization is completed under the projects' priority or subpriority group, as specified in paragraph (a) of this section, and only if necessary to give separate priorities to applications that have the same priority ranking after the prioritization specified in paragraph (a) of this section is accomplished.

    (e) If any State home in a State has been cited by a VA safety office, VA engineering office, or other VA office with responsibility for life and safety inspections; a State or local government agency (including a Fire Marshal); or an accrediting institution (including the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations) for conditions that threaten the lives or safety of one or more of the residents or program participants in the facility, the State must include in any application submitted under § 59.20 or its updates to such application its plan to address all such citations. If VA determines that the State's plan fails to set forth how it will address such citations in a reasonable period of time, then VA will prioritize all applications of such State as follows:

    (1) Applications that meet the criteria of paragraph (a)(1) of this section, but do not meet the criteria of paragraphs (a)(1)(i) or (vii) of this section, will be prioritized in subpriority group 6 of priority group 1 (paragraph (a)(1)(vi) of this section).

    (2) Applications not meeting the criteria for placement in priority group 1 (paragraph (a)(1) of this section) and not meeting the criteria of subpriority group 1 of priority group 1 (paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section) will be prioritized in priority group 7 (paragraph (a)(7) of this section).

    (f) The priority list will not contain any project for the construction or acquisition of a hospital or hospital beds.

    (g) For purposes of establishing priorities under this section:

    (1) A State has a great need for nursing home and domiciliary beds if the State:

    (i) Has no State homes with nursing home or domiciliary beds, or

    (ii) Has an unmet need of 2,000 or more nursing home and domiciliary beds;

    (2) A State has a significant need for nursing home and domiciliary beds if the State has an unmet need of 1,000 to 1,999 nursing home and domiciliary beds; and

    (3) A State has a limited need for nursing home and domiciliary beds if the State has an unmet need of 999 or fewer nursing home and domiciliary beds.

    (h) Except for applications that must be included in subpriority group 1 of priority group 1, applications for projects with components that could be prioritized in more than one priority group will be placed in the priority group toward which the largest share of the cost of the project is allocated. Once the correct priority group is determined, applications for projects with components that could be prioritized in more than one subpriority group in that priority group will be placed in the subpriority group toward which the largest share of the cost of the project is allocated. For example, if a project for which 25 percent of the funds needed would address seismic issues and 75 percent of the funds needed would be for building construction in a State with a great need for new beds, the project would be placed in subpriority group 3. If the highest-cost component of an application for multiple projects does not meet the criteria for placement in priority group 1, subpriority group 1, because it is estimated to cost $400,000.00 or more, it will be prioritized based on the component with the next largest share of the cost.

    (i) Once the Secretary prioritizes the applications in the priority list, VA will not change the priorities unless a change is necessary as a result of an appeal.

    § 59.60   Additional application requirements.

#### § § 59.60

    For a project to be eligible for a grant under this part for the fiscal year for which the priority list was made, during that fiscal year the State must submit to VA an original and a copy of the following:

    (a) Complete, updated Standard Forms 424 (mark the box labeled application and submit the information requested for an application), 424C, and 424D (these forms are available on the internet Web site provided in § 59.170 of this part), and

    (b) A completed VA Form 10-0388-5 and all information and documentation specified by VA Form 10-0388-5 (this form is available on the internet Web site provided in § 59.170).

    § 59.70   Award of grants.

#### § § 59.70

    (a) The Secretary, during the fiscal year for which a priority list is made under this part, will:

    (1) Award a grant for each application that has been approved under § 59.20, that is sufficiently high on the priority list so that funding is available for the application, that meets the additional application requirements in § 59.60, and that meets all other requirements under this part for obtaining a grant, or

    (2) Conditionally approve a grant for a project for which a State has submitted an application that substantially meets the requirements of this part if the State representative requests conditional approval and provides written assurance that the State will meet all requirements for a grant not later than 180 calendar days after the date of conditional approval. If a State that has obtained conditional approval for a project does not meet all of the requirements within 180 calendar days after the date of conditional approval, the Secretary will rescind the conditional approval and the project will be ineligible for a grant in the fiscal year in which the State failed to fully complete the application. The funds that were conditionally obligated for the project will be deobligated.

    (b) As a condition of receiving a grant, a State must make sufficient funds available for the project for which the grant is requested so that such project may proceed upon approval of the grant without further action required by the State (such as subsequent issuance of bonds) to make such funds available for such purpose. To meet this criteria, the State must provide to VA a letter from an authorized State budget official certifying that the State funds are, or will be, available for the project, so that if VA awards the grant, the project may proceed without further State action to make such funds available (such as further action to issue bonds). If the certification is based on an Act authorizing the project and making available the State's matching funds for the project, a copy of the Act must be submitted with the certification. To be eligible for inclusion in priority group 1 under this part, a State must make such funds available by August 1 of the year prior to the fiscal year for which the grant is requested. To otherwise be eligible for a grant and grant funds based on inclusion on the priority list in other than priority group 1, a State must make such funds available by July 1 of the fiscal year for which the grant is requested.

    (c) As a condition of receiving a grant, the State representative and the Secretary will sign three originals of the Memorandum of Agreement documents (one for the State and two for VA). A sample is in § 59.170.

    § 59.80   Amount of grant.

#### § § 59.80

    (a) The total cost of a project (VA and State) for which a grant is awarded under this part may not be less than $400,000 and, except as provided in paragraph (i) of this section, the total cost of a project will not exceed the total cost of new construction. The amount of a grant awarded under this part will be the amount requested by the State and approved in accordance with this part, not to exceed 65 percent of the total cost of the project except that:

    (1) The total cost of a project will not include the cost of space that exceeds the maximum allowable space specified in this part, and

    (2) The amount of the grant may be less than 65 percent of the total cost of the project if the State accepts less because VA did not have sufficient funds to award the full amount of the grant requested.

    (b) The total cost of a project under this part for acquisition of a facility may also include construction costs.

    (c) The total cost of a project under this part will not include any costs incurred before the date VA sent the State written notification that the application in § 59.20 was approved.

    (e) The total cost of a project under this part may include the cost of projects on the grounds of the facility, e.g., parking lots, landscaping, sidewalks, streets, and storm sewers, only if they are inextricably involved with the construction of the project.

    (f) The total cost of a project under this part may include the cost of equipment necessary for the operation of the State home facility. This may include the cost of:

    (1) Fixed equipment included in the construction or acquisition contract. Fixed equipment must be permanently affixed to the building or connected to the heating, ventilating, air conditioning, or other service distributed through the building via ducts, pipes, wires, or other connecting device. Fixed equipment must be installed during construction. Examples of fixed equipment include kitchen and intercommunication equipment, built-in cabinets, and cubicle curtain rods; and

If demolition of an existing building or facility on, or eligible for inclusion in, the National Register of Historic Places is deemed necessary and such demolition action is taken in compliance with National Historic Preservation Act procedures, any mitigation cost negotiated in the compliance process and/or the cost to professionally record the building or facility in the Historic American Buildings Survey (HABS), plus the total cost for demolition and site restoration, shall be included by the State in calculating the total cost of new construction.

    (j) The cost of demolition of a building cannot be included in the total cost of construction unless the proposed construction is in the same location as the building to be demolished or unless the demolition is inextricably linked to the design of the construction project.

    (k) With respect to the final award of a conditionally-approved grant, the Secretary may not award a grant for an amount that is 10 percent more than the amount conditionally-approved.

    § 59.90   Line item adjustments to grants.

#### § § 59.90

    After a grant has been awarded, upon request from the State representative, VA may approve a change in a line item (line items are identified in Form 424C which is set forth in § 59.170(o) of this part) of up to 10 percent (increase or decrease) of the cost of the line item if the change would be within the scope or objective of the project and would not change the amount of the grant.

    § 59.100   Payment of grant award.

#### § § 59.100

    The amount of the grant award will be paid to the State or, if designated by the State representative, the State home for which such project is being carried out or any other State agency or instrumentality. Such amount shall be paid by way of reimbursement, and in such installments consistent with the progress of the project as the Chief Consultant, Geriatrics and Extended Care, may determine and certify for payment to the appropriate Federal institution. Funds paid under this section for an approved project shall be used solely for carrying out such project as so approved. As a condition for the final payment, the State must comply with the requirements of this part based on an architectural and engineering inspection approved by VA, must obtain VA approval of the final equipment list submitted by the State representative, and must submit to VA a completed VA Form 10-0388-13 (this form is available on the internet Web site provided in § 59.170).

    § 59.110   Recapture provisions.

#### § § 59.110

    (a) If less than 20 years has lapsed since the grant was awarded, and VA provided 65 percent of the estimated cost to construct, acquire or renovate a State home facility principally for furnishing domiciliary care, nursing home care, adult day health care, hospital care, or non-institutional care to veterans, VA shall be entitled to recover 65 percent of the current value of such facility (but in no event an amount greater than the amount of assistance provided for such under these regulations), as determined by agreement of the parties or by action brought in the district court of the United States for the district in which the facility is situated.

    (b) Based on the time periods for grant amounts set forth below, if VA provided between 50 and 65 percent of the estimated cost of expansion, remodeling, or alteration of an existing State home facility, VA shall be entitled to recover the amount of the grant as determined by agreement of the parties or by action brought in the district court of the United States for the district in which the facility is situated:

    (c) If the magnitude of the VA contribution is below 50 percent of the estimated cost of the expansion, remodeling, or alteration of an existing State home facility recognized by the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Under Secretary for Health may authorize a recovery period between 7 and 20 years depending on the grant amount involved and the magnitude of the project.

  PART 60—FISHER HOUSES AND OTHER TEMPORARY LODGING

### Part 60

**Authority:** Authority: 38 U.S.C. 501, 1708.

**Source:** Source: 77 FR 59089, Sept. 26, 2012, unless otherwise noted.

    § 60.1   Purpose and scope.

#### § § 60.1

    This part applies to Fisher House and other temporary lodging furnished by VA while a veteran is experiencing an episode of care at a VA health care facility.

    § 60.2   Definitions.

#### § § 60.2

    For the purposes of this part:

    means an individual seeking Fisher House or other temporary lodging, who provides familial support or the equivalent of familial support, to a veteran while the veteran is experiencing an episode of care. This term is defined broadly to include relatives, close friends, and caregivers.

    means an examination requested by VA's Veterans Benefits Administration to be conducted at a VA health care facility for the purpose of evaluating a veteran's claim.

    means a course of outpatient treatment, or a period of hospitalization, during which a veteran receives health care under 38 U.S.C. chapter 17, or 38 U.S.C. 8111 or 8153. Examples of episodes of care include (but are not limited to) the following:

    (1) An appointment at a VA health care facility to receive health care or a compensation and pension examination.

    (2) Extended outpatient treatment, such as treatment associated with organ transplant, chemotherapy, or radiation.

    (3) Hospitalization for a critical injury or illness; where death is imminent; or where a veteran is unable to make medical decisions for him/herself and the accompanying individual is authorized to make such decisions on the veteran's behalf.

    means a housing facility that is located at or near a VA health care facility and was constructed by and donated to VA by the _Fisher House_ Foundation (formerly the Zachary and Elizabeth M. Fisher Armed Services Foundation), or a facility that is treated as if it were Fisher House lodging under § 60.3.

    includes:

    (1) Lodging at a temporary lodging facility, other than a Fisher House, located at a VA health care facility (generally referred to as a “hoptel”);

    (2) A hotel or motel;

    (3) Non-utilized beds at a VA health care facility designated as lodging beds; and

    (4) Other donated lodging to be used on a temporary basis in accordance with 38 U.S.C. 1708.

    means the Department of Veterans Affairs.

    § 60.3   Other donated temporary lodging.

#### § § 60.3

    Whenever VA receives, from a source other than the Fisher House Foundation, an undesignated donation of lodging to be used on a temporary basis, the lodging will be designated as if it were Fisher House lodging or be treated as other temporary lodging based upon the types of lodging available in the area. If VA receives a gift that specifies the terms of the lodging provided, VA will use the lodging provided in the manner specified by the donor.

    § 60.10   Eligibility criteria for Fisher House or other temporary lodging.

#### § § 60.10

    (a)  While a veteran is undergoing an episode of care, VA may provide either Fisher House or other temporary lodging, as appropriate, if the request meets the requirements of this part 60. These are the only types of lodging provided by VA under this part. Note: Lodging provided for under this part will not be used by a person participating in a VA residential treatment program, or as a substitute for participation in such a program.

    (b) —(1)  VA may provide Fisher House lodging to accompanying individual(s) and, in limited circumstances of immediate need and no alternative temporary lodging, to a veteran with one or more accompanying individual(s). Fisher House lodging will not be used to lodge unaccompanied veterans or individuals in need of transitional or permanent housing.

    (2)  VA may provide other temporary lodging to a veteran or to a veteran and his or her accompanying individual(s). Accompanying individuals may not stay in other temporary lodging unless the veteran is also staying in temporary lodging.

    (c)  Fisher House or other temporary lodging will not be provided to a veteran unless the VA official reviewing the request determines, based on the request and on any necessary clinical information, that the veteran is:

    (1) Medically stable and capable of self-care; or

    (2) Accompanied by an individual who is able to provide all necessary care.

    (d)  Fisher House or other temporary lodging may be provided only if the applicant seeking lodging must travel at least 50 miles, or for 2 hours, from his or her home to the VA health care facility. VA may waive these requirements based on exceptional circumstances, such as when the physical condition of an accompanying individual and/or the veteran, inclement weather, road conditions, or the mode of transportation, make it difficult or dangerous to travel to or return from the VA health care facility without an overnight stay.

    (e)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, VA may provide Fisher House or other temporary lodging for individuals who must be present on site for evaluation, donation, and care related to their status as an organ donor for a veteran. VA may also provide Fisher House or other temporary lodging for the donor's accompanying individuals at all phases of the transplant process.

> [77 FR 59089, Sept. 26, 2012, as amended at 82 FR 26594, June 8, 2017]

    § 60.15   Process for requesting Fisher House or other temporary lodging.

#### § § 60.15

    (a)  An accompanying individual requesting Fisher House or other temporary lodging must contact directly the provider, social worker, case manager, or Fisher House Manager at the veteran's VA health care facility of jurisdiction. Upon receiving a request, VA will determine the accompanying individual's eligibility for the requested housing, as provided in paragraph (b)(5) of this section.

    (b)  (1) Requests for all temporary housing are generally processed in the order that they are received by VA, and temporary lodging is then granted on a first come, first served basis; however, in extraordinary circumstances, such as imminent death, critical injury, or organ donation, requests may be processed out of order.

    (2) Temporary lodging is granted on a space-available basis, with some consideration given to the compatibility of the applicant(s) and the room(s) available. For example, although VA may require an applicant to share a room with another veteran's accompanying individual, VA would not do so if the persons affected are not the same gender.

    (3) Temporary lodging at a VA health care facility, such as non-utilized beds in a VA health care facility, may be made available only if not barred by law and if the Director of the VA health care facility determines that such action would not have a negative impact on patient care. Non-utilized beds provided to accompanying individuals must be reassigned to VA patients when necessary.

    (4) The Director of the VA health care facility of jurisdiction will determine whether local funding is sufficient to allow the use of temporary lodging in hotels and motels.

    (5) Subject to all criteria provided in this part, the person responsible for coordinating the Fisher House and other temporary lodging program(s) at the VA health care facility of jurisdiction is responsible for making decisions to grant temporary lodging. These decisions are considered to be final VA decisions concerning individual medical treatment plans and the scheduling and use of VA lodging facilities, and they are not appealable to the Board of Veterans' Appeals.

    (6) If VA denies a request for one type of lodging, such as at a Fisher House, the request will be considered for other temporary lodging and vice versa, if the requester is eligible.

Applicants will then be ranked, within their respective funding category if applicable. The highest-ranked applications for which funding is available, within highest priority funding category if applicable, will be conditionally selected to receive a capital grant in accordance with their ranked order, as determined under § 61.13. If funding priorities have been established and funds are still available after selection of those applicants in the highest priority group VA will continue to conditionally select applicants in lower priority categories in accordance with the selection method set forth in this paragraph subject to available funding.

      (b) In the event of a tie between applicants, VA will use the score from § 61.13(g) to determine the ranking. If the score from § 61.13(g) is also tied, VA will use the score from § 61.13(d) to determine the ranking.

      (c) VA may reject an application where the project is not cost effective based on the cost and number of new supportive housing beds made available—or based on the cost, amount, and types of supportive services made available—when compared to other supportive housing or services projects, and when adjusted for high cost areas.

      (1) Reduce the award; or

      (2) Not select the application for funding.

      (d) VA may not reject an application solely on the basis that the entity proposes to use funding from other private or public sources, if the entity demonstrates that a private nonprofit organization will provide oversight and site control for the project. In this section “private nonprofit organization” means one of the following:

      (1) An incorporated private institution, organization, or foundation—

      (i) That has received, or has temporary clearance to receive, tax-exempt status under paragraph (2), (3), or (19) of section 501(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986;

      (e) In the case of a previously awarded project that can no longer provide services and or housing and the recipient agency has decided to withdraw or the project has been terminated for failure to comply with the terms and conditions of the award; VA may transfer a capital grant or non-capital grant to another eligible entity in the same geographical area without competition, in order to prevent a loss of capacity of services and housing to homeless veterans. The new entity must meet all of the requirements to which the original grantee was subject. In the case of a capital grant transfer the new grantee will only be entitled to the funding that remains from the original capital obligation and remains responsible for all commitments made by the original grantee.

      (c) Following receipt of the additional information in acceptable form, VA will execute an agreement and make payments to the grant recipient in accordance with § 61.61 and other applicable provisions of this part.

      § 61.16   Matching funds for capital grants.

#### § § 61.16

      (a) VA cannot award a capital grant for more than 65 percent of the total allowable costs of the project. The grantee must provide funding (“matching funding”) for the remaining 35 percent of the total cost, using non-federal funds. VA requires that applicants provide documentation of all costs related to the project including those that are not allowable under the Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards under 2 CFR part 200. Allowable costs means those related to the portion (percentage) of the property that would be used to provide supportive housing and services under this part.

      (b) Capital grants may include application costs, including site surveys, architectural, and engineering fees, but may not include relocation costs or developer's fees.

      (c)  The matching funds described in paragraph (a) of this section must be documented as follows; no other format will be accepted as evidence of a firm commitment of matching funds:

      (1) Donations must be on the donor's letterhead, signed and dated.

      (2) The applicant's own cash must be committed on the applicant's letterhead, signed, and dated.

      (3) No conditions may be placed on the matching funds other than the organization's receipt of the capital grant.

      (4) Funds must be committed to the same activity as the capital grant application (, acquisition, renovation, new construction, or a van), and must not relate to operating costs or services.

      (5) The value of matching funds must be for a cost that is included in the calculation of the total project cost, thereby decreasing the total expenditures of the grantee.

      (d)  The requirements of this section also apply to applications for a capital grant for a van under § 61.18.

      § 61.17   Site control for capital grants.

#### § § 61.17

      (a) In order to receive a capital grant for supportive housing or a fixed site service center, an applicant must demonstrate site control. Site control must be demonstrated through a deed or an executed contract of sale, or a capital lease, which assigns control or ownership to the entity whose Federal employer or taxpayer identification number is on the Application for Federal Assistance (SF424), unless one of the following apply:

      (1) VA gives written permission for an alternate assignment. VA will permit alternate assignments except when:

      (i) The alternate assignment is to a for-profit entity which is neither controlled by the applicant or by the applicant's parent organization or the entity is controlled by the applicant's parent organization which is a for-profit entity; or

      (ii) VA has a reasonable concern that the assignment may provide an economic or monetary benefit to the assignee other than the benefit that would have inured to the applicant had the applicant not made the alternate assignment.

      (2) The site is in a building or on land owned by VA, and the applicant has an agreement with VA for site control.

      (b) A capital grant recipient may change the site to a new site meeting the requirements of this part subject to VA approval under § 61.62. However, the recipient is responsible for and must demonstrate ability to provide for any additional costs resulting from the change in site.

      (c) If site control is not demonstrated within 1 year after execution of an agreement under § 61.61, the grantee may request a reasonable extension from the VA national GPD office, or the grant may be terminated. VA will authorize an extension request if the grantee was not at fault for being unable to exercise site control and the lack of site control does not affect the grantee's ability to complete the project.

      § 61.18   Capital grants for vans.

#### § § 61.18

      (a)  A capital grant may be used to procure one or more vans, as stated in a NOFA, to provide transportation or outreach for the purpose of providing supportive services. The grant may cover the purchase price, sales taxes, and title and licensing fees. Title to the van must vest solely in the applicant, and the applicant must insure the van to the same extent they would insure a van bought with their own funds.

      (b)  VA will only award vans to applicants who currently have an operational grant under this part, or in conjunction with a new application.

      (c)  In order to receive a van, the application must demonstrate the following:

      (1) Clear need for the van(s);

      (2) Specific use of the van(s);

      (3) Frequency of use of the van(s);

      (4) Qualifications of the van driver(s);

      (5) Training of the van driver(s);

      (6) Type of van(s) to be obtained; and

      (7) Adequate financial support will be available for the completion of the project or for the purchase and maintenance, repair, and operation of the van(s).

      (d)  Applications will be scored using the selection criteria listed in this section. To be eligible for a van grant, an applicant must receive at least 80 points (out of a possible 100) of this section.

      (1)  VA will award up to 60 points based on the extent to which the applicant demonstrates a substantial unmet need for transportation due to:

      (i) Lack of alternative public transportation,

      (ii) Project location,

      (iii) Expired life use of current van, or

      (iv) Special disabled individual transportation.

      (2)  VA will award up to 20 points based on the extent to which the applicant demonstrates:

      (i) Frequency of use,

      (ii) Type of use, and

      (iii) Type of van, e.g., whether there is a justification for a van with a wheelchair lift or other modifications.

      (3)  VA will award up to 20 points based on the extent to which the applicant demonstrates a job description for the van operator that details:

      (i) Requirements of the position, and

      (ii) Training that will be provided to the driver.

      § 61.19   Transfer of capital grants.

#### § § 61.19

      In the case of a previously awarded project that can no longer provide services and/or housing and the recipient agency has decided to withdraw or the project has been terminated for failure to comply with the terms and conditions of the award, VA may transfer a capital grant or non-capital grant to another eligible entity in the same geographical area without competition, in order to prevent a loss of capacity of services and housing to homeless veterans. The new entity must meet all of the requirements to which the original grantee was subject. In the case of a capital grant transfer the new grantee will only be entitled to the funding that remains from the original capital obligation and remains responsible for all commitments made by the original grantee.

    Subpart C—Per Diem Payments

      § 61.30   Per diem—general.

#### § § 61.30

      (a)  VA may provide per diem funds to offset operating costs for a program of supportive housing or services. VA may provide:

      (1) Per diem funds to capital grant recipients; or

      (2) Per diem only (PDO) funds to entities eligible to receive a capital grant, if the entity established a program of supportive housing or services after November 10, 1992.

      (b)  Capital grant recipients may request per diem funds after completion of a project funded by a capital grant and a site inspection under § 61.80 to ensure that the grantee is capable of providing supportive services.

      (c)  PDO awards to entities eligible to receive a capital grant must provide supportive housing or services to the homeless veteran population within 180 days after the date on the notification of award letter, or VA will terminate the PDO payments.

      § 61.31   Per diem—application packages.

#### § § 61.31

      (a)  To apply for per diem, a capital grant recipient need only indicate the intent to receive per diem on the capital grant application or may separately request per diem by submitting to VA a written statement requesting per diem.

      (b)  To apply for per diem only, a non-capital grant applicant must obtain from VA a non-capital grant application package and submit to VA the information called for in the application package within the time period established in the Notice of Fund Availability. The application package includes exhibits to be prepared and submitted as part of the application process, including:

      (1) Documentation on eligibility to receive per diem under this part;

      (2) Documentation on operating budget and cost sharing;

      (3) Documentation on supportive services committed to the project;

      (4) Comments or recommendations by appropriate state (and area wide) clearinghouses pursuant to E.O. 12372 (3 CFR, 1982 Comp., p. 197), if the applicant is a state; and

      (5) Reasonable assurances with respect to receipt of per diem under this part that:

      (i) The project will be used principally to furnish to veterans the level of care for which such application is made; that not more than 25 percent of participants at any one time will be non-veterans; and that such services will meet the requirements of this part;

      (ii) Adequate financial support will be available for the per diem program; and

      (iii) The recipient will keep records and submit reports as VA may reasonably require, within the time frames required; and give VA, upon demand, access to the records upon which such information is based.

      § 61.32   Per diem application packages—rating criteria.

#### § § 61.32

      (a)  Application packages for per diem only (, from non-capital grant applicants) in response to a Notice of Fund Availability (NOFA) will be reviewed and grouped in categories according to the funding priorities set forth in the NOFA, if any. Such applications will then be ranked within their respective funding category according to scores achieved only if the applicant scores at least 750 cumulative points out of a possible 1000 from each of the following paragraphs: (b), (c), (d), (e), (f), and (g) of § 61.13. The highest-ranked applications for which funding is available, within highest funding priority category if applicable, will be conditionally selected for eligibility to receive per diem payments or special need payment in accordance with their ranked order. If funding priorities have been established and funds are still available after selection of those applicants in the highest priority group, VA will continue to conditionally select applicants in lower priority categories in accordance with the selection method set forth in this paragraph subject to available funding. Conditional selectees will be subsequently awarded per diem, if they otherwise meet the requirements of this part, including passing the inspection required by § 61.80.

      (b)  In the event of a tie between applicants, VA will use the score from § 61.13(g) to determine the ranking. Note: Capital grant recipients are not required to be ranked; however, continuation of per diem payments to capital grant recipients will be subject to limitations set forth in § 61.33.

      (c)  VA will execute per diem agreements with an applicant whose per diem application was conditionally selected under this section using the same procedures applicable to a capital grant under § 61.15.

      § 61.33   Payment of per diem.

#### § § 61.33

      (a)  VA will pay per diem to recipients that provide a bed day of care:

      (1) For a homeless veteran:

      (i) Who VA referred to the recipient; or

      (ii) For whom VA authorized the provision of supportive housing or supportive service;

      (2) For providers of both supportive housing and services. When the referral or authorization of the homeless veteran will not result in the project exceeding the total number of bed days of care or total obligated funding as indicated in the grant agreement and funding action document; or

      (3) For service centers. When the total hours of service or total obligated funding as indicated in the grant agreement and funding action document.

      (b)  VA may at any time review the provision of supportive housing and services to individual veterans by the provider to ensure the care provided continues to be needed and appropriate.

      (c)  The rate of per diem for each veteran in supportive housing will be the lesser of:

      (1) The daily cost of care estimated by the per diem recipient minus other sources of payments to the per diem recipient for furnishing services to homeless veterans that the per diem recipient certifies to be correct (other sources include payments and grants from other departments and agencies of the United States, from departments of local and State governments, from private entities or organizations, and from program participants); or

      (2) The current VA state home program per diem rate for domiciliary care, as set by the Secretary under 38 U.S.C. 1741(a)(1).

      (d)  The per diem amount for service centers shall be 1-8 of the lesser of the amount in paragraph (c)(1) or (c)(2) of this section, per hour, not to exceed eight (8) hours in any day.

      (e)  Per diem may be paid retroactively for services provided not more than three (3) days before VA approval is given or where, through no fault of the recipient, per diem payments should have been made but were not made.

      (f)  VA will pay per diem up to a maximum of seventy-two (72) consecutive hours for the scheduled or unscheduled absence of a veteran, or, in the case of an in-patient hospitalization, will pay per diem up to a maximum of seven (7) days.

      (g)  For circumstances where a veteran is receiving supportive housing and supportive services from the same per diem recipient, VA will not pay a per diem for the supportive services.

      (h)  At the time of receipt of a federal award from VA, a per diem recipient must report to VA all other sources of income for the project for which per diem was awarded. The report provides a basis for adjustments to the per diem payment under paragraph (c)(1) of this section.

      § 61.62   Program changes.

#### § § 61.62

      (a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section, a recipient may not make any significant changes to a project for which a grant has been awarded without prior written approval from the VA National Grant and Per Diem Program Office. Significant changes include, but are not limited to, a change in the recipient, a change in the project site (including relocating, adding an annex, a branch, or other expansion), additions or deletions of activities, shifts of funds from one approved type of activity to another, and a change in the category of participants to be served.

      (b) Recipients of grants involving both construction and non-construction projects must receive prior written approval from the VA National Grant and Per Diem Program Office for cumulative transfers among direct cost categories which exceed or are expected to exceed 10 percent of the current total approved budget.

      (c) Recipients of grants for projects involving both construction and non-construction who are state or local governments must receive prior written approval from the VA National Grant and Per Diem Program Office for any budget revision which would transfer funds between non-construction and construction categories.

      (d) Approval for changes is contingent upon the application ranking remaining high enough after the approved change to have been competitively selected for funding in the year the application was selected.

      (e) Any changes to an approved program must be fully documented in the recipient's records.

      (f) Recipients must inform the VA National Grant and Per Diem Program Office in writing of any key position and address changes in/of their organization within 30 days of the change, , new executive director or chief financial officer, permanent change of address for corporate communications.

      § 61.63   Procedural error.

#### § § 61.63

      If an application would have been selected but for a procedural error committed by VA, VA may reconsider that application in the next funding round. A new application will not be required for this purpose so long as there is no material change in the information.

      § 61.64   Faith-based organizations.

#### § § 61.64

      (a) Organizations that are faith-based are eligible, on the same basis as any other organization, to participate in VA programs under this part. Decisions about awards of Federal financial assistance must be free from political interference or even the appearance of such interference and must be made on the basis of merit, not on the basis of religion or religious belief or lack thereof.

      (b)(1) No organization may use direct financial assistance from VA under this part to pay for any of the following:

      (i) Explicitly religious activities such as, religious worship, instruction, or proselytization; or

      (ii) Equipment or supplies to be used for any of those activities.

      (2) For purposes of this section, “indirect Federal financial assistance” means Federal financial assistance in which a service provider receives program funds through a voucher, certificate, agreement, or other form of disbursement, wholly as a result of the genuinely independent and private choice of a beneficiary, not a choice of the Government. The availability of adequate secular alternatives is a significant factor in determining whether a program affords true private choice. “Direct Federal financial assistance” means Federal financial assistance received by an entity selected by the Government or a pass-through entity as defined in 38 CFR 50.1(d) to provide or carry out a service ( by contract, grant, or cooperative agreement). References to “financial assistance” will be deemed to be references to direct Federal financial assistance, unless the referenced assistance meets the definition of “indirect Federal financial assistance” in this paragraph (b)(2).

      (c) Organizations that engage in explicitly religious activities, such as worship, religious instruction, or proselytization, must offer those services separately in time or location from any programs or services funded with direct financial assistance from VA, and participation in any of the organization's explicitly religious activities must be voluntary for the beneficiaries of a program or service funded by direct financial assistance from VA.

      (d) A faith-based organization that participates in VA programs under this part will retain its independence from Federal, State, or local governments and may continue to carry out its mission, including the definition, practice and expression of its religious beliefs, provided that it does not use direct financial assistance from VA under this part to support any explicitly religious activities, such as worship, religious instruction, or proselytization. Among other things, faith-based organizations may use space in their facilities to provide VA-funded services under this part, without concealing, removing, or altering religious art, icons, scripture, or other religious symbols. In addition, a VA-funded faith-based organization retains its authority over its internal governance, and it may retain religious terms in its organization's name, select its board members and otherwise govern itself on a religious basis, and include religious reference in its organization's mission statements and other governing documents.

      (e) An organization that participates in a VA program under this part shall not, in providing direct program assistance, discriminate against a program beneficiary or prospective program beneficiary regarding housing, supportive services, or technical assistance, on the basis of religion, a religious belief, a refusal to hold a religious belief, or a refusal to attend or participate in a religious practice.

      (f) If a State or local government voluntarily contributes its own funds to supplement federally funded activities, the State or local government has the option to segregate the Federal funds or commingle them. However, if the funds are commingled, this provision applies to all of the commingled funds.

      (g) To the extent otherwise permitted by Federal law, the restrictions on explicitly religious activities set forth in this section do not apply where VA funds are provided to faith-based organizations through indirect assistance wholly as a result of a genuinely independent and private choice of a beneficiary, provided the faith-based organizations otherwise satisfy the requirements of this part. A faith-based organization may receive such funds as the result of a beneficiary's genuine and independent choice if, for example, a beneficiary redeems a voucher, coupon, or certificate, allowing the beneficiary to direct where funds are to be paid, or a similar funding mechanism provided to that beneficiary and designed to give that beneficiary a choice among providers.

      § 61.65   Inspections.

#### § § 61.65

      VA may inspect the facility and records of any applicant or recipient when necessary to determine compliance with this part or an agreement under § 61.61. The authority to inspect does not authorize VA to manage or control the applicant or recipient.

      § 61.66   Financial management.

#### § § 61.66

      (a) All recipients must comply with applicable requirements of the Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards under 2 CFR part 200.

      (b) All entities receiving assistance under this part must use a financial management system that follows generally accepted accounting principles and meets the requirements set forth under 2 CFR part 200. All recipients must implement the requirements of 2 CFR part 200 when determining costs reimbursable under all awards issued under this part.

> [80 FR 43323, July 22, 2015]

      § 61.67   Recovery provisions.

#### § § 61.67

      (a)  VA may recover from the grant recipient all of the grant amounts provided for the project if, after 3 years after the date of an award of a capital grant, the grant recipient has withdrawn from the VA Homeless Providers Grant and Per Diem Program (Program), does not establish the project for which the grant was made, or has established the project for which the grant was made but has not passed final inspection. Where a recipient has no control over causes for delays in implementing a project, VA may extend the 3-year period, as appropriate. VA may obligate any recovered funds without fiscal year limitation.

      (b)  If a capital grant recipient is not subject to recovery under paragraph (a) of this section, VA will seek recovery of the grant amount on a prorated basis where the grant recipient ceases to provide services for which the grant was made or withdraws from the Program prior to the expiration of the applicable period of operation, which period shall begin on the date shown on the activation document produced by the VA National GPD Program. In cases where capital grant recipients have chosen not to receive per diem payments, the applicable period of operation shall begin on the date the VA Medical Center Director approved placement at the project site as shown on the inspection documents. The amount to be recaptured equals the total amount of the grant, multiplied by the fraction resulting from using the number of years the recipient was not operational as the numerator, and using the number of years of operation required under the following chart as the denominator.

      (c)  In addition to being subject to recovery under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, capital grantees are subject to real property disposition as required by 2 CFR part 200 when the grantee no longer is providing services through a grant awarded under this part.

      (d)  VA will seek to recover from the recipient of per diem, a special need non-capital grant, or a technical assistance grant any funds that are not used in accordance with the requirements of this part.

      (e)  Before VA takes action to recover funds, VA will issue to the recipient a notice of intent to recover funds. The recipient will then have 30 days to submit documentation demonstrating why funds should not be recovered. After review of any such documentation, VA will issue a decision regarding whether action will be taken to recover funds.

      (f)  All recovery provisions will apply to vans with the exception of the period of time for recovery. The period of time for recovery will be 7 years. Disposition provisions of 2 CFR part 200 apply to vans. Grantees are required to notify the VA National Grant and Per Diem Program Office for disposition of any van funded under this part.

      (c) VA will provide performance goals to recipients in its initial federal award and update annually thereafter:

      (1) Each recipient must conduct an ongoing assessment of the supportive housing and services needed by their residents and the availability of housing and services to meet this need. Recipients are expected to make adjustments to meet resident needs.

      (2) The recipient will provide to the VA GPD Liaison evidence of its ongoing assessment of the plan described in the grant application. The assessment must show how it is using the plan to meet the GPD performance goals.

      (B) The VA GPD Liaison will forward the PIP to the VA National GPD Program Office. The VA National GPD Program Office will review the PIP and notify the recipient in writing whether the PIP is approved or disapproved. If disapproved, the VA GPD Liaison will make suggestions for improving the proposed PIP, and the recipient may resubmit the PIP to the VA National GPD Program Office.

      (vii) If the recipient is not compliant after the PIP, then VA may impose any combination of the following enforcement actions by award revision:

      (A) Withhold placements;

      (B) Withhold payment;

      (n) The recipient will inform within 24 hours its VA liaison of any sentinel events occurring within the program (, drug overdose, death, injury).

      (o) The grantee, or sub-grantee, will provide appropriate orientation and training to staff to enable them to provide quality services that are appropriate to homeless veteran or homeless special need veteran population.

      (p) The grantee will maintain systematic participant enrollment information and participant tracking records designed to facilitate the uniform compilation and analysis of programmatic data necessary for verification of veteran status and case management, reporting, monitoring, and evaluation purposes.

      (q) The grantee will also document in each participant record at a minimum:

      (1) Family status.

      (2) Verification of veteran status (DD214, Department of Veterans Affairs confirmation report and/or identification card).

      (3) Education, employment history, and marketable skills/licenses/credentials.

      (5) Duration and outcome of supportive service.

      (6) The grantee must verify service outcomes each calendar year quarter through the participant and provide documentation of this verification in the participant case management files.

      (r) The grantee will ensure that no more than 25 percent of the grant awarded beds are occupied by non-veterans, or VA may take actions as appropriate to decrease the beds, grant amounts, or terminate the grant and seek recapture in the case of capital funding. To calculate the occupancy rate, divide the actual number of bed days of care for veterans eligible to reside in the project, by the total number of possible bed days of care (the previous 180 days from the most current 6 month period).

      § 61.81   Outreach activities.

#### § § 61.81

      Recipients of capital grants and per diem relating to supportive housing or service centers must use their best efforts to ensure that eligible hard-to-reach veterans are found, engaged, and provided assistance. To achieve this goal, recipients may search for homeless veterans at places such as shelters, soup kitchens, parks, bus or train stations, and the streets. Outreach particularly should be directed toward veterans who have a nighttime residence that is an emergency shelter or a public or private place not ordinarily used as a regular sleeping accommodation for human beings (e.g., cars, streets, or parks).

      § 61.82   Participant fees for supportive housing.

#### § § 61.82

      (a) Each participant of supportive housing may be required to pay a participant fee in an amount determined by the recipient, except that such participant fee may not exceed 30 percent of the participant's monthly income after deducting medical expenses, child care expenses, court ordered child support payments, or other court ordered payments; nor may it exceed the program's set maximum rate or the HUD Fair Market Rent for that type of housing and its location, whichever is less. The participant fee determination and collection process/procedures should be documented in the grant recipient's operating procedures to ensure consistency, fairness, and accuracy of fees collected. The participant's monthly income includes all income earned by or paid to the participant.

      (b) Retroactive benefit payments from any source to program participants, for the purpose of this part, may be considered income in the month received and therefore may be used in calculating the participant fee for that month.

      (c) Participant fees may be used for costs of operating the supportive housing or to assist supportive housing residents' move to permanent housing, and must have a therapeutic benefit.

      (d) In addition to a participant fee, recipients may charge residents reasonable fees for extracurricular services and activities (extracurricular fee) that participants are not required to receive under the terms of the grant award, are not paid for by VA per diem, or provided by VA. Extracurricular fees must be voluntary on the part of the participant.

      (e) In projects funded under this part where participants sign agreements, VA treats the costs associated with participant eviction to be as unallowable.

      (f) Use of participant agreements.

      (1) Participant agreements must be between the grant recipient of record and the program participant.

      (2) Participant agreements must be part of a therapeutic plan to increase self-determination and responsibility.

      (3) Participant agreements must include a clause that allows program participants the ability to break the lease or program agreement without penalty for medical or clinical necessity.

      (4) Participant agreements may not be used to exclude homeless veterans with little or no income from the program.

      (5) Participant agreements and conditions must be fully disclosed to potential participants and acknowledged in writing by both parties.

    (g) Legal services, including court filing fees, to assist a participant with issues that interfere with the participant's ability to obtain or retain permanent housing or supportive services, including issues that affect the participant's employability and financial security (such as the lack of a driver's license).

    § 62.34   Other supportive services.

#### § § 62.34

    Grantees may provide the following services which are necessary for maintaining independent living in permanent housing and housing stability:

    (a)  Payment of rent, penalties or fees to help the participant remain in permanent housing or obtain permanent housing.

    (1) A participant may receive rental assistance for a maximum of 10 months during a 2-year period (consecutive or nonconsecutive), such period beginning on the date that the grantee first pays rent on behalf of the participant; however, a participant cannot receive rental assistance for more than 6 months in any 12-month period beginning on the date that the grantee first pays rent on behalf of the participant. For extremely low-income veteran families, payments for rent cannot exceed 9 months in any 12-month period and 12 months during a 2-year period, such period beginning on the date that the grantee first pays rent on behalf of the participant. The rental assistance may be for rental payments that are currently due or are in arrears, and for the payment of penalties or fees incurred by a participant and required to be paid by the participant under an existing lease or court order. In all instances, rental assistance may only be provided if the payment of such rental assistance will directly allow the participant to remain in permanent housing or obtain permanent housing.

    (2) Rental assistance must be paid by the grantee directly to the third party to whom rent is owed.

    (3) As a condition of providing rental assistance, the grantee must help the participant develop a reasonable plan to address the participant's future ability to pay rent. Grantees must assist the participant to implement such plan by providing any necessary assistance or helping the participant to obtain any necessary public or private benefits or services.

    (4) The rental assistance paid by a grantee must be in compliance with the following “rent reasonableness” standard. “Rent reasonableness” means the total rent charged for a unit must be reasonable in relation to the rents being charged during the same time period for comparable units in the private unassisted market and must not be in excess of rents being charged by the property owner during the same time period for comparable non-luxury unassisted units. To make this determination, the grantee should consider:

    (i) The location, quality, size, type, and age of the unit; and

    (ii) Any amenities, housing services, maintenance, and utilities to be provided by the property owner. Comparable rents can be checked by using a market study, by reviewing comparable units advertised for rent, or using a note from the property owner verifying the comparability of charged rents to other units owned by the property owner. Prior to providing rental assistance in the form of payment of penalties or fees incurred by a participant, the grantee must determine that such penalties or fees are reasonable.

    (5) With respect to shared housing arrangements, the rent charged for a participant must be in relation to the size of the private space for that participant in comparison to other private space in the shared unit, excluding common space. A participant may be assigned a pro rata portion based on the ratio derived by dividing the number of bedrooms in their private space by the number of bedrooms in the unit. Participation in shared housing arrangements must be voluntary.

    (6) Rental assistance payments cannot be provided on behalf of participants for the same period of time and for the same cost types that are being provided through another Federal housing subsidy program; however, such payments may be provided even though the participant is receiving State and local housing subsidy funds as long as the total subsidy received (including payments under this section) does not exceed the rent.

    (7) Grantees may require participants to share in the cost of rent as a condition of receiving rental assistance.

    (8) Extremely low-income veteran families and very low-income veteran families who meet the criteria of § 62.11 may be eligible to receive a rental subsidy as follows:

    (i) For a 2-year period without recertification.

    (ii) The applicable counties will be published annually in the  A family must live in one of these applicable counties to be eligible for this subsidy. The counties will be chosen based on the cost and availability of affordable housing for both individuals and families within that county.

    (iii) The maximum amount of this rental subsidy is 50 percent of reasonable rent as defined by paragraph (a)(4) of this section. Grantees must collaborate with their local Continuum of Care (CoC) as defined at 24 CFR 578.3 to determine the proper subsidy amounts to be used by all grantees in each applicable county.

    (iv) Grantees must provide a letter of support from their local CoC to the Supportive Services for Veteran Families (SSVF) Program Office when requesting VA approval of this subsidy. The SSVF Program Office must approve all subsidy requests before the subsidy is used.

    (v) Very low-income veteran families may receive this subsidy for a period of two years before recertification minus the number of months in which the recipient received the rental assistance provided under paragraph (a)(1) of this section.

    (vi) Extremely low-income veteran families may receive this subsidy for up to a 2-year period before recertification following receipt of rental assistance under paragraph (a)(1) of this section.

    (vii) For any month, the total rental payments provided to a family under this paragraph (a)(8) cannot be more than the total amount of rent. Payment of this subsidy by a grantee must conform to the requirements set forth in paragraphs (a)(2) through (7) of this section. The rental subsidy amount will not change for the veteran family in the second year of the two-year period, even if the annual amount published changes.

    (viii) A veteran family will not need to be recertified as a very low-income veteran family as provided for by § 62.36(a) during the initial two-year period. After an initial two-year period, a family receiving this subsidy, or a combination of the rental assistance under paragraph (a)(1) of this section and this subsidy, may continue to receive rental payments under this section, but would require recertification at that time and once every two years.

    (b)  Payment of utility fees to help the participant to remain in permanent housing or obtain permanent housing.

    (1) A participant may receive payments for utilities for a maximum of 10 months during a 2-year period, such period beginning on the date that the grantee first pays utility fees on behalf of the participant; provided, however, that a participant cannot receive payments for utilities for more than 6 months in any 12-month period beginning on the date that the grantee first pays a utility payment on behalf of the participant. For extremely low-income veteran families, payments for utilities cannot exceed 9 months in any 12-month period and 12 months during a 2-year period, such periods beginning on the date that the grantee first pays a utility payment on behalf of the participant. The payment for utilities may be for utility payments that are currently due or are in arrears, provided that the payment of such utilities will allow the participant to remain in permanent housing or obtain permanent housing.

    (2) Payments for utilities must be paid by the grantee directly to a utility company. Payments for utilities only will be available if a participant, a legal representative of the participant, or a member of his/her household, has an account in his/her name with a utility company or proof of responsibility to make utility payments, such as cancelled checks or receipts in his/her name from a utility company.

    (3) As a condition of providing payments for utilities, the grantee must help the participant develop a reasonable plan to address the participant's future ability to pay utility payments. Grantees must assist the participant to implement such plan by providing any necessary assistance or helping the participant to obtain any necessary public or private benefits or services.

    (4) Payments for utilities cannot be provided on behalf of participants for the same period of time and for the same cost types that are being provided through another Federal, State, or local program.

    (5) Grantees may require participants to share in the cost of utility payments as a condition of receiving payments for utilities.

    (c)  Payment of security deposits or utility deposits to help the participant remain in permanent housing or obtain permanent housing.

    (1) A participant may receive assistance with the payment of a security deposit a maximum of one time in every 2-year period, such period beginning on the date the grantee pays a security deposit on behalf of a participant.

    (2) A participant may receive assistance with the payment of a utility deposit a maximum of one time in every 2-year period, such period beginning on the date the grantee pays a utility deposit on behalf of a participant.

    (3) Any security deposit or utility deposit must be paid by the grantee directly to the third party to whom the security deposit or utility deposit is owed. The payment of such deposit must allow the participant to remain in the participant's existing permanent housing or help the participant to obtain and remain in permanent housing selected by the participant.

    (4) As a condition of providing a security deposit payment or a utility deposit payment, the grantee must help the participant develop a reasonable plan to address the participant's future housing stability. Grantees must assist the participant to implement such plan by providing any necessary assistance or helping the participant to obtain any necessary public or private benefits or services.

    (5) Security deposits and utility deposits covering the same period of time in which assistance is being provided through another housing subsidy program are eligible, as long as they cover separate cost types.

    (6) Grantees may require participants to share in the cost of the security deposit or utility deposit as a condition of receiving assistance with such deposit.

    (d)  Payment of moving costs to help the participant to obtain permanent housing.

    (1) A participant may receive assistance with moving costs a maximum of one time in every 3-year period, such period beginning on the date the grantee pays moving costs on behalf of a participant.

    (2) Moving costs assistance must be paid by the grantee directly to a third party. Moving costs assistance includes reasonable moving costs, such as truck rental, hiring a moving company, or short-term storage fees for a maximum of 3 months or until the participant is in permanent housing, whichever is shorter.

    (3) As a condition of providing moving costs assistance, the grantee must help the participant develop a reasonable plan to address the participant's future housing stability. Grantees must assist the participant to implement such plan by providing any necessary assistance or helping the participant to obtain any necessary public or private benefits or services.

    (4) Moving costs assistance payments cannot be provided on behalf of participants for the same period of time and for the same cost types that are being provided through another Federal, State, or local program.

    (5) Grantees may require participants to share in the cost of moving as a condition of receiving assistance with moving costs.

    (e)  (1) A grantee may provide to a participant items necessary for a participant's life or safety on a temporary basis, in order to address a participant's emergency situation.

    (2) A grantee may pay directly to a third party (and not to a participant), in an amount not to exceed $1,800, per participant during any 2-year period, beginning on the date that the grantee first submits a payment to a third party. This cap will be adjusted annually based on the Consumer Price Index for all Urban Consumers (CPI-U). This amount is for the following types of expenses:

    (i) Expenses associated with gaining or keeping employment, such as obtaining uniforms, tools, certifications, and licenses.

    (ii) Expenses associated with moving into permanent housing, such as obtaining basic kitchen utensils, bedding, and other supplies.

    (iii) Expenses necessary for securing appropriate permanent housing, such as fees for housing applications, housing inspections, or background checks.

    (3) A grantee may pay directly to a third party (and not to a participant) a reasonable amount for a broker's fee when such a third party has assisted in identifying permanent housing. The reasonableness of a fee will be determined based on conditions in the local housing market.

    (f)  If permanent housing, appropriate shelter beds and transitional housing are not available and subsequent rental housing has been identified generally but is not immediately available for move-in by the participant, then a grantee may place a participant in emergency housing, subject to the following limitations:

    (1) Placement for a single veteran may not exceed 72 hours, unless the grantee can certify that appropriate shelter beds and transitional housing are still unavailable at the end of the 72 hour period.

    (2) Placement for a veteran and his or her spouse with dependent(s) may not exceed 60 days.

    (3) A participant may be placed in emergency housing only once during any 2-year period, beginning on the date that the grantee first pays for emergency housing on behalf of the participant.

    (4) Permanent housing will be available before the end of the period during which the participant is placed in emergency housing.

    (5) The cost of the emergency housing must be reasonable in relation to the costs charged for other available emergency housing considering the location, quality, size, and type of the emergency housing.

    (g)  Other services as set forth in the Notice of Fund Availability or as approved by VA that are consistent with the Supportive Services for Veteran Families Program. Applicants may propose additional services in their supportive services grant application, and grantees may propose additional services by submitting a written request to modify the supportive services grant in accordance with § 62.60.

    (c)  If a veteran becomes absent from a household or dies while other members of the veteran family are receiving supportive services, then such supportive services must continue for a grace period following the absence or death of the veteran. The grantee must establish a reasonable grace period for continued participation by the veteran's family member(s), but that period may not exceed 1 year from the date of absence or death of the veteran, subject to the requirements of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section. The grantee must notify the veteran's family member(s) of the duration of the grace period.

    (d)  If a participant becomes ineligible to receive supportive services under this section, the grantee must provide the participant with information on other available programs or resources.

    (e)  Notwithstanding the limitations in § 62.34 concerning the maximum amount of assistance a family can receive during defined periods of time, a household may receive additional assistance if it otherwise qualifies for assistance under this Part and is fleeing from a domestic violence situation. A family may qualify for assistance even if the veteran is the aggressor or perpetrator of the domestic violence. Receipt of assistance under this provision resets the tolling period for the limitations on the maximum amount of support that can be provided in a given amount of time under § 62.34.

The supportive services grant agreement will contain the same provisions described in paragraph (a) of this section.

    (c) No funds provided under this part may be used to replace Federal, State, tribal, or local funds previously used, or designated for use, to assist very low-income veteran families.

    § 62.51   Payments under the supportive services grant.

#### § § 62.51

    Grantees are to be paid in accordance with the timeframes and manner set forth in the Notice of Fund Availability.

    § 62.60   Program or budget changes and corrective action plans.

#### § § 62.60

    (a) A grantee must submit to VA a written request to modify a supportive services grant for any proposed significant change that will alter the supportive services grant program. If VA approves such change, VA will issue a written amendment to the supportive services grant agreement. A grantee must receive VA's approval prior to implementing a significant change. Significant changes include, but are not limited to, a change in the grantee or any subcontractors identified in the supportive services grant agreement; a change in the area or community served by the grantee; additions or deletions of supportive services provided by the grantee; a change in category of participants to be served; and a change in budget line items that are more than 10 percent of the total supportive services grant award.

    (1) VA's approval of changes is contingent upon the grantee's amended application retaining a high enough rank to have been competitively selected for funding in the year that the application was granted.

    (2) Each supportive services grant modification request must contain a description of the revised proposed use of supportive services grant funds.

    (b) VA may require that the grantee initiate, develop and submit to VA for approval a Corrective Action Plan (CAP) if, on a quarterly basis, actual supportive services grant expenditures vary from the amount disbursed to a grantee for that same quarter or actual supportive services grant activities vary from the grantee's program description provided in the supportive services grant agreement.

    (1) The CAP must identify the expenditure or activity source that has caused the deviation, describe the reason(s) for the variance, provide specific proposed corrective action(s), and provide a timetable for accomplishment of the corrective action.

    (2) After receipt of the CAP, VA will send a letter to the grantee indicating that the CAP is approved or disapproved. If disapproved, VA will make beneficial suggestions to improve the proposed CAP and request resubmission, or take other actions in accordance with this part.

    (c) Grantees must inform VA in writing of any key personnel changes (e.g., new executive director, supportive services grant program director, or chief financial officer) and grantee address changes within 30 days of the change.

    § 62.61   Procedural error.

#### § § 62.61

    If an applicant would have been selected but for a procedural error committed by VA, VA may select that applicant for funding when sufficient funds become available if there is no material change in the information that would have resulted in the applicant's selection. A new application will not be required for this purpose.

    § 62.62   Faith-based organizations.

#### § § 62.62

    (a) Organizations that are faith-based are eligible, on the same basis as any other organization, to participate in the Supportive Services for Veteran Families Program under this part. Decisions about awards of Federal financial assistance must be free from political interference or even the appearance of such interference and must be made on the basis of merit, not on the basis of religion or religious belief or lack thereof.

    (b)(1) No organization may use direct financial assistance from VA under this part to pay for any of the following:

    (i) Explicitly religious activities such as, religious worship, instruction, or proselytization; or

    (ii) Equipment or supplies to be used for any of those activities.

    (2) For purposes of this section, “indirect Federal financial assistance” means Federal financial assistance in which a service provider receives program funds through a voucher, certificate, agreement, or other form of disbursement, wholly as a result of the genuinely independent and private choice of a beneficiary, not a choice of the Government. The availability of adequate secular alternatives is a significant factor in determining whether a program affords true private choice. “Direct Federal financial assistance” means Federal financial assistance received by an entity selected by the Government or a pass-through entity as defined in 38 CFR 50.1(d) to provide or carry out a service ( by contract, grant, or cooperative agreement). References to “financial assistance” will be deemed to be references to direct Federal financial assistance, unless the referenced assistance meets the definition of “indirect Federal financial assistance” in this paragraph (b)(2).

    (c) Organizations that engage in explicitly religious activities, such as worship, religious instruction, or proselytization, must offer those services separately in time or location from any programs or services funded with direct financial assistance from VA under this part, and participation in any of the organization's explicitly religious activities must be voluntary for the beneficiaries of a program or service funded by direct financial assistance from VA under this part.

    (d) A faith-based organization that participates in the Supportive Services for Veteran Families Program under this part will retain its independence from Federal, State, or local governments and may continue to carry out its mission, including the definition, practice and expression of its religious beliefs, provided that it does not use direct financial assistance from VA under this part to support any explicitly religious activities, such as worship, religious instruction, or proselytization. Among other things, faith-based organizations may use space in their facilities to provide VA-funded services under this part, without concealing, removing, or altering religious art, icons, scripture, or other religious symbols. In addition, a VA-funded faith-based organization retains its authority over its internal governance, and it may retain religious terms in its organization's name, select its board members and otherwise govern itself on a religious basis, and include religious reference in its organization's mission statements and other governing documents.

    (e) An organization that participates in a VA program under this part shall not, in providing direct program assistance, discriminate against a program beneficiary or prospective program beneficiary regarding housing, supportive services, or technical assistance, on the basis of religion, a religious belief, a refusal to hold a religious belief, or a refusal to attend or participate in a religious practice.

    (f) If a State or local government voluntarily contributes its own funds to supplement federally funded activities, the State or local government has the option to segregate the Federal funds or commingle them. However, if the funds are commingled, this provision applies to all of the commingled funds.

    (g) To the extent otherwise permitted by Federal law, the restrictions on explicitly religious activities set forth in this section do not apply where VA funds are provided to faith-based organizations through indirect assistance wholly as a result of a genuinely independent and private choice of a beneficiary, provided the faith-based organizations otherwise satisfy the requirements of this part. A faith-based organization may receive such funds as the result of a beneficiary's genuine and independent choice if, for example, a beneficiary redeems a voucher, coupon, or certificate, allowing the beneficiary to direct where funds are to be paid, or a similar funding mechanism provided to that beneficiary and designed to give that beneficiary a choice among providers.

    § 62.63   Visits to monitor operations and compliance.

#### § § 62.63

    (a) VA has the right, at all reasonable times, to make visits to all grantee locations where a grantee is using supportive services grant funds in order to review grantee accomplishments and management control systems and to provide such technical assistance as may be required. VA may conduct inspections of all program locations and records of a grantee at such times as are deemed necessary to determine compliance with the provisions of this part. In the event that a grantee delivers services in a participant's home, or at a location away from the grantee's place of business, VA may accompany the grantee. If the grantee's visit is to the participant's home, VA will only accompany the grantee with the consent of the participant. If any visit is made by VA on the premises of the grantee or a subcontractor under the supportive services grant, the grantee must provide, and must require its subcontractors to provide, all reasonable facilities and assistance for the safety and convenience of the VA representatives in the performance of their duties. All visits and evaluations will be performed in such a manner as will not unduly delay services.

    (b) The authority to inspect carries with it no authority over the management or control of any applicant or grantee under this part.

    § 62.70   Financial management and administrative costs.

#### § § 62.70

    (a) Grantees must comply with applicable requirements of the Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards under 2 CFR part 200.

    (b) Grantees must use a financial management system that provides adequate fiscal control and accounting records and meets the requirements set forth in 2 CFR part 200.

    (c) Payment up to the amount specified in the supportive services grant must be made only for allowable, allocable, and reasonable costs in conducting the work under the supportive services grant. The determination of allowable costs must be made in accordance with the applicable Federal Cost Principles set forth in 2 CFR part 200.

    (d) Grantees are subject to the Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants and Agreements with Institutions of Higher Education, Hospitals and other Non-Profit Organizations, codified at 38 CFR Part 49.

    (e) Costs for administration by a grantee must not exceed 10 percent of the total amount of the supportive services grant. Administrative costs will consist of all direct and indirect costs associated with the management of the program. These costs will include the administrative costs, both direct and indirect, of subcontractors.

    § 62.71   Grantee reporting requirements.

#### § § 62.71

    (a) VA may require grantees to provide, in such form as may be prescribed, such reports or answers in writing to specific questions, surveys, or questionnaires as VA determines necessary to carry out the Supportive Services for Veteran Families Program.

    (b) If, on a quarterly basis, actual supportive services grant expenditures vary from the amount disbursed to a grantee for that same quarter or actual supportive services grant activities vary from the grantee's program description provided in the supportive services grant agreement, grantees must report the deviation to VA.

    (c) At least once per year, or at the frequency set by VA, each grantee must submit to VA a report containing information relating to operational effectiveness, fiscal responsibility, supportive services grant agreement compliance, and legal and regulatory compliance, including a description of the use of supportive services grant funds, the number of participants assisted, the types of supportive services provided, and any other information that VA may request.

    (d) Grantees must relate financial data to performance data and develop unit cost information whenever practical.

    (e) All pages of the reports must cite the assigned supportive services grant number and be submitted in a timely manner.

    (f) Grantees must provide VA with consent to post information from reports on the Internet and use such information in other ways deemed appropriate by VA. Grantees shall clearly mark information that is confidential to individual participants.

    § 62.72   Recordkeeping.

#### § § 62.72

    Grantees must ensure that records are maintained for at least a 3-year period to document compliance with this part. Grantees must produce such records at VA's request.

    § 62.73   Technical assistance.

#### § § 62.73

    VA will provide technical assistance, as necessary, to eligible entities to meet the requirements of this part. Such technical assistance will be provided either directly by VA or through grants or contracts with appropriate public or non-profit private entities.

    § 62.80   Withholding, suspension, deobligation, termination, and recovery of funds by VA.

#### § § 62.80

    (a)  VA will recover from the grantee any supportive services grant funds that are not used in accordance with the requirements of this part. VA will issue to the grantee a notice of intent to recover supportive services grant funds. The grantee will then have 30 days to submit documentation demonstrating why the supportive services grant funds should not be recovered. After review of all submitted documentation, VA will determine whether action will be taken to recover the supportive services grant funds.

    (b)  When a grantee fails to comply with the terms, conditions, or standards of the supportive services grant, VA may, on 7-days notice to the grantee, withhold further payment, suspend the supportive services grant, or prohibit the grantee from incurring additional obligations of supportive services grant funds, pending corrective action by the grantee or a decision to terminate in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section. VA will allow all necessary and proper costs that the grantee could not reasonably avoid during a period of suspension if such costs meet the provisions of the applicable Federal Cost Principles.

    (c)  Supportive services grants may be terminated in whole or in part only if paragraphs (c)(1), (2), or (3) of this section apply.

    (1) By VA, if a grantee materially fails to comply with the terms and conditions of a supportive services grant award and this part.

    (2) By VA with the consent of the grantee, in which case VA and the grantee will agree upon the termination conditions, including the effective date and, in the case of partial termination, the portion to be terminated.

    (3) By the grantee upon sending to VA written notification setting forth the reasons for such termination, the effective date, and, in the case of partial termination, the portion to be terminated. However, if VA determines in the case of partial termination that the reduced or modified portion of the supportive services grant will not accomplish the purposes for which the supportive services grant was made, VA may terminate the supportive services grant in its entirety under either paragraphs (c)(1) or (2) of this section.

    (d)  (1) VA may deobligate all or a portion of the amounts approved for use by a grantee if:

    (i) The activity for which funding was approved is not provided in accordance with the approved application and the requirements of this part;

    (ii) Such amounts have not been expended within a 1-year period from the date of the signing of the supportive services grant agreement;

    (iii) Other circumstances set forth in the supportive services grant agreement authorize or require deobligation.

    (2) At its discretion, VA may re-advertise in a Notice of Fund Availability the availability of funds that have been deobligated under this section or award deobligated funds to an applicant or existing grantee. If VA chooses to award deobligated funds to an applicant or existing grantee, funds will be awarded as follows:

    (i) VA will first offer to award the deobligated funds to the applicant or grantee with the highest grant score under the relevant Notice of Fund Availability that applied for or was awarded funds in the same community as, or proximate community to, the affected community. Such applicant or grantee must have the capacity and agree to provide prompt services to the affected community. Under this section the relevant Notice of Fund Availability is the most recently published Notice of Fund Availability which covers the geographic area that includes the affected community, or for multi-year grant awards, the most recently published Notice of Fund Availability which covers the geographic area that includes the affected community for which the grantee, who is offered the additional funds, received the multi-year award.

    (ii) If the first such applicant or grantee offered the deobligated funds refuses the funds, VA will offer to award funds to the next highest-ranked such applicant or grantee, per to the criteria in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section, and continue on in rank order until all deobligated funds are awarded.

#### § § 62.81

    Supportive services grants will be closed out in accordance with the following procedures upon the date of completion:

    (a) No later than 90 days after the date of completion, the grantee must refund to VA any unobligated (unencumbered) balance of supportive services grant funds that are not authorized by VA to be retained by the grantee.

    (b) No later than 90 days after the date of completion, the grantee must submit all financial, performance and other reports required by VA to closeout the supportive services grant. VA may authorize extensions when requested by the grantee.

    (c) If a final audit has not been completed prior to the date of completion, VA retains the right to recover an appropriate amount after considering the recommendations on disallowed costs once the final audit has been completed.

      (b) A claimant must apply for payment of beneficiary travel within 30 calendar days after completing beneficiary travel that does not include a special mode of transportation.

      (c) For beneficiary travel that includes a special mode of transportation, a claimant must apply for payment of beneficiary travel and obtain approval from VA prior to the travel; however, if the travel included a special mode of transportation and the claimant without prior approval applies for payment of the beneficiary travel within 30 calendar days after the travel is completed, the application will be considered timely submitted if the travel was for emergency treatment.

      (d) Notwithstanding other provisions of this section, for travel that includes meals and/or lodging, a claimant must apply for and receive approval prior to obtaining the meals and/or lodging in order to receive payment in accordance with § 70.30(a)(3) for the meals and/or lodging.

      (e) If VA determines that additional information is needed to make a determination concerning an application under this part, VA will notify the claimant in writing of the deficiency and request additional information.

      § 70.30   Payment principles.

#### § § 70.30

      (a) Subject to the other provisions of this section and subject to the deductibles required under § 70.31, VA will pay the following for beneficiary travel by an eligible beneficiary when travel expenses are actually incurred:

      (1) The per mile rate established by the Secretary for the period of travel for use of privately owned vehicle or the actual cost for use of the most economical common carrier (bus, train, taxi, airplane, etc.), for travel to and from VA or VA-authorized health care subject to the following:

      (i) Travel by a privately owned vehicle for a compensation and pension examination that is solely for the convenience of the Government (e.g., repeat a laboratory test, redo a poor quality x-ray) may have a different per mile rate if deemed appropriate by the Secretary.

      (ii) Per mile payment for use of privately owned vehicle may not exceed the cost of such travel by public transportation (even if it is for the convenience of the government) unless determined to be medically necessary.

      (iii) Payment for a common carrier may not exceed the amount allowed for a privately owned vehicle unless travel by a privately owned vehicle is not reasonably accessible or travel by a common carrier is determined to be medically necessary.

      (iv) As required by law, each time the Federal government makes a change in mileage rates payable under 5 U.S.C. 5702 and 5704 for Federal employee travel by privately owned vehicle, but not less frequently than annually, the Secretary shall conduct an investigation of the actual costs of travel, including lodging and subsistence. In conducting the investigation, the Secretary shall consult with the Administrator of the General Services Administration, the Secretary of Transportation, the Comptroller General of the United States, and veterans' service organizations. As part of the investigation, the Secretary shall review and consider various factors including vehicle depreciation, State and Federal vehicle taxes and the costs of gasoline, oil, maintenance, accessories, parts, tires, and insurance. However, to the extent that the Administrator of General Services has, within a reasonable period of time, conducted an investigation of travel costs that included the factors described in this paragraph, the Secretary may consider that investigation in lieu of conducting a separate investigation with respect to the findings of those individual factors. The Secretary is not obligated to accept or rely on any conclusions of the Administrator's investigation. Based on the investigation required by this subsection, VA shall determine whether there is a need to change the mileage rates payable under paragraph (a) of this section. If a determination is made that a change is warranted the new rate(s) will be published in the notices section of the  Current rate(s) can be found at  or by contacting the Beneficiary Travel office at the closest VA health care facility.

      (2) The actual cost of ferry fares, bridge tolls, road tolls, and tunnel tolls (supported by receipts for such expenses as required by § 70.20(a)).

      (3) The actual cost for meals, lodging, or both, not to exceed 50 percent of the amount allowed for government employees under 5 U.S.C. 5702, when VA determines that an overnight stay is required. Factors VA may consider in making that determination include, but are not limited to the following:

      (i) The distance the veteran must travel.

      (ii) The time of day when VA scheduled the veteran's appointment.

      (iii) The weather conditions or congestion conditions affecting the travel.

      (iv) The veteran's medical condition and its impact on the ability to travel.

      (4) The actual cost of a special mode of transportation.

      (b) Payments under this section are subject to the following:

      (1) Except as otherwise allowed under this section, payment is limited to travel from the beneficiary's residence to the nearest VA facility where the care or services could be provided and from such VA facility to the beneficiary's residence.

      (2) Payment may be made for travel from the beneficiary's residence to the nearest non-VA facility where the care or services could be provided and from such facility to the beneficiary's residence if VA determines that it is necessary to obtain the care or services at a non-VA facility.

      (3) Payment may be made for travel from or to a place where the beneficiary is staying (if the beneficiary is not staying at the beneficiary's residence) but the payment may not exceed the amount that would be payable for travel under paragraph (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section, as applicable.

      (4) If the beneficiary's residence changed while receiving care or services, payment for the return trip will be for travel to the new residence, except that payment may not exceed the amount that would be allowed from the facility where the care or services could have been provided that is nearest to the new residence (for example, if during a period of care or services in Baltimore, a beneficiary changed his or her address from Baltimore to Detroit, payment for the return trip would be limited to that allowed for traveling to the new residence from the nearest facility to the new residence in Detroit where the care or services could have been provided).

      (5) If the beneficiary is in a terminal condition at a VA facility or other facility under VA auspices and travels to a non-VA medical facility for the purpose of being nearer to his or her residence, payment may be made for travel to the medical facility receiving the beneficiary for such purpose.

      (6) Payment may be made for travel from a non-VA health care facility where the beneficiary is receiving care or services to the nearest VA facility where the appropriate care or services could be provided.

      (7) Payment will not be made for return travel for a beneficiary receiving an irregular discharge.

      (8) On a case-by-case basis, payment for travel may be paid for any distance if it is financially favorable to the government (for example, payment for travel could be allowed to a more distant nursing home when admission to that nursing home is a prerequisite to qualify for community assistance that would more than offset the additional travel payment).

      (c) Payment for travel of an attendant under this section will be calculated on the same basis as for the beneficiary.

      (d) For shared travel in a privately-owned vehicle, payments are limited to the amount for one beneficiary (for example, if a beneficiary and an attendant travel in the same automobile or if two beneficiaries travel in the same automobile, the amount for mileage will be limited to the amount for one beneficiary).

      (e) Beneficiary travel will not be paid under the following circumstances:

      (1) The payment of the travel allowance would be counterproductive to the therapy being provided and such determination is recorded in the patient's medical records, and

      (2) The chief of the service or a designee reviewed and approved the determination by signature in the patient's medical record.

      § 70.70   Purpose and definitions.

#### § § 70.70

      (a)  This subpart implements the Veterans Transportation Service (VTS), through which VA transports eligible persons to or from a VA or VA-authorized facility or other place for the purpose of examination, treatment, or care.

      (b)  For purposes of this subpart:

      has the meaning set forth in § 70.2, and also means an individual traveling with a veteran or servicemember who is eligible for travel under VTS and requires the aid and/or assistance of another person.

      means a person described in § 70.71.

      means any individual the veteran or servicemember would like to have accompany him or her to an appointment but whose presence is not medically required.

      means that a VA beneficiary had an appointment that was made before she or he appeared at a VA, or VA-authorized, facility, or that a VA beneficiary was specifically authorized to appear at such facility on the date of the visit in order to obtain examination, treatment, or care. Examples of scheduled visits include: Regular appointments for examination, treatment, or care; visits to undergo laboratory work; or doctor-recommended visits to clinics with open hours.

      means a visit to a VA, or VA-authorized, facility for purposes of examination, treatment, or care that was not recorded in VA's scheduling system prior to the veteran's visit. For example, an unscheduled visit may be for a simple check of a person's blood pressure, for counseling, or for clinical intervention.

      § 70.71   Eligibility.

#### § § 70.71

      Except as provided in paragraph (j) of this section, VA facilities may provide VTS benefits to the following:

      (a)  All persons eligible for beneficiary travel benefits in § 70.10 are eligible for VTS benefits (however, persons cannot claim benefits under both programs for the same trip or portion of a trip).

      (b)  Regardless of a veteran's eligibility for beneficiary travel, VA may provide VTS to veterans enrolled in VA's health care system who need transportation authorized under § 70.72 for:

      (1) A scheduled visit or urgent care;

      (2) Retrieval of, adjustment of, or training concerning medications and prosthetic appliances, or a service dog (as defined in 38 CFR 17.148);

      (3) An unscheduled visit; or

      (4) To participate and attend other events or functions, as clinically determined by VA, for the purposes of examination, treatment, or care.

      (c)  VA may provide VTS to veterans not enrolled in VA's health care system who need transportation authorized under § 70.72 for:

      (1) A compensation and pension examination;

      (2) An unscheduled or walk-in visit;

      (3) To apply for enrollment or health care benefits; or

      (4) To participate and attend other events or functions, as clinically determined by VA, for the purposes of examination, treatment, or care.

      (d)  VA may provide VTS to a member of the Armed Forces (including the National Guard or Reserve) traveling to a VA or VA-authorized facility for VA hospital care or medical services, including examination, treatment or care, a compensation and pension examination, or to enroll or otherwise receive benefits for which they are eligible.

      (e)  (1) VA may provide VTS to a prospective Family Caregiver who has applied for designation as a Family Caregiver under 38 CFR 71.25(a) when the travel is for purposes of assessment and training under 38 CFR 71.25(c) and (d).

      (2) VA may provide VTS to a Family Caregiver (who is approved and designated under 38 CFR 71.25) of veteran or servicemember described in paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section to:

      (f)  VA may provide VTS to an attendant of a veteran or servicemember described in paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section.

      (g)  VA may provide VTS to persons receiving counseling, training, or mental health services under 38 U.S.C. 1782 and 38 CFR 71.50.

      (h)  VA may provide VTS to persons eligible for health care under the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Department of Veterans Affairs (CHAMPVA) under 38 CFR 17.270 through 17.278, provided that such care is being provided at a VA facility through the CHAMPVA Inhouse Treatment Initiative (CITI).

      (i)  For each veteran described in paragraph (b) or (c) of this section or member of the Armed Forces described in paragraph (d) of this section, a guest may travel with the veteran or servicemember provided resources are still available after providing services to individuals identified in paragraphs (b) through (h) of this section.

      (j)  Notwithstanding an individual's eligibility under this section:

      (1) A person may be ineligible for transportation services if VA determines the person's behavior has jeopardized or could jeopardize the health or safety of other eligible users of VTS or VA staff, or otherwise has interfered or could interfere with the safe transportation of eligible persons to or from a VA facility or other place.

      (2) Only one person may travel with an eligible veteran or servicemember as a Family Caregiver, attendant, or guest, unless a VA clinician determines that more than one such person is needed or would otherwise be beneficial to the examination, treatment, or care of the eligible veteran or servicemember. Family Caregivers traveling for benefits under paragraph (e)(1) or (e)(2)(ii) of this section are not subject to this limitation.

      (3) Persons under the age of 18 may accompany another person using VTS with the consent of their parent or legal guardian and the medical facility director or designee. VA transportation of children is not available if State law requires the use of a child restraint, such as a child safety seat or booster seat. In making determinations under this provision, the medical facility director or designee will consider:

      (i) The special transportation needs of the child, if any;

      (ii) The ability to transport the child safely using the available resources;

      (iii) The availability of services at the facility to accommodate the needs of the child;

      (iv) The appropriateness of transporting the child; and

      (v) Any other relevant factors.

      § 70.72   Types of transportation.

#### § § 70.72

      The following types of transportation may be provided by VA facilities through VTS:

      (a)  VA facilities may use VTS to transport, on a scheduled or unscheduled basis, eligible persons between a VA or VA-authorized facility and their residence or a place where the person is staying. VA facilities may use VTS to transport eligible persons to and from a VA or VA-authorized facility and another location identified by the person when it is financially favorable to the government to do so.

      (b)  VA facilities may use VTS to provide transportation between a VA or VA-authorized facility and a designated location in the community on a scheduled basis.

      (c)  VA facilities may use VTS to provide scheduled or unscheduled transportation between VA or VA-authorized health care facilities. This includes travel from one building to another within a single VA campus.

      (d)  VA facilities may use VTS to provide scheduled or unscheduled transportation to and/or from a VA or VA-authorized facility or other places when a VA clinician has determined that such transportation of the veteran, servicemember, their attendant(s), or CHAMPVA beneficiary receiving benefits through the CITI program would be needed to promote, preserve, or restore the health of the individual and is in accord with generally accepted standards of medical practice, as defined in 38 CFR 17.38(b).

      § 70.73   Arranging transportation services.

#### § § 70.73

      (a)  An eligible person may request transportation services by contacting the facility director or designee at the VA facility providing or authorizing the examination, treatment, or care to be delivered. The person must provide the facility director or designee with information necessary to arrange these services, including the name of the person, the basis for eligibility, the name of the veteran or servicemember they are accompanying (if applicable), the time of the appointment (if known), the eligible person's departure location and destination, any special needs that must be accommodated to allow for transportation (e.g., wheelchair, oxygen tank, or service animal as defined in 38 CFR 1.218(a)(11)(viii)), and other relevant information. Transportation services generally will be provided on a first come, first served basis.

      (b)  Eligible persons who have provided the facility director or designee with the information referred to in the previous paragraph may travel without a reservation for the purpose of examination, treatment, or care when, for example:

      (1) The person is being discharged from inpatient care;

      (2) The person is traveling for an unscheduled visit, pursuant to a recommendation for such a visit by an attending VA clinician; or

      (3) The person is being transported to another VA or VA-authorized facility.

      (c)  When the facility director or designee determines there are insufficient resources to transport all persons requesting transportation services, he or she will assist any person denied VTS in identifying and accessing other transportation options. VTS resources will be allocated using the following criteria, which are to be assessed in the context of the totality of the circumstances, so that no one factor is determinative:

      (1) The eligible person's basis for eligibility. Enrolled veterans will receive first priority, followed in order by non-enrolled veterans; servicemembers; Family Caregivers; persons receiving counseling, training, or mental health services under 38 U.S.C. 1782 and 38 CFR 71.50; CITI beneficiaries; and guests. Persons eligible under more than one designation will be considered in the highest priority category for which that trip permits. VA will provide transportation to any attendant accompanying a veteran or servicemember who is approved for transportation.

      (2) First in time request.

      (3) An eligible person's clinical need.

      (4) An eligible person's inability to transport him or herself (e.g., visual impairment, immobility, etc.).

      (5) An eligible person's eligibility for other transportation services or benefits.

      (6) The availability of other transportation services (e.g., common carriers, veterans' service organizations, etc.).

      (7) The VA facility's ability to maximize the use of available resources.

    § 71.25   Approval and designation of Primary and Secondary Family Caregivers.

#### § § 71.25

    (a)  (1) Individuals who wish to be considered for designation by VA as Primary or Secondary Family Caregivers must submit a joint application, along with the veteran or servicemember. Individuals interested in serving as Family Caregivers must be identified as such on the joint application, and no more than three individuals may serve as Family Caregivers at one time for an eligible veteran, with no more than one serving as the Primary Family Caregiver and no more than two serving as Secondary Family Caregivers.

    (2)(i) Upon receiving such application, VA (in collaboration with the primary care team to the maximum extent practicable) will perform the evaluations required to determine the eligibility of the applicants under this part, and if eligible, determine the applicable monthly stipend amount under § 71.40(c)(4). Notwithstanding the first sentence, VA will not evaluate a veteran's or servicemember's eligibility under § 71.20 when a joint application is received to add a Secondary Family Caregiver for an eligible veteran who has a designated Primary Family Caregiver.

    (ii) Individuals who apply to be Family Caregivers must complete all necessary eligibility evaluations (along with the veteran or servicemember), education and training, and the initial home-care assessment (along with the veteran or servicemember) so that VA may complete the designation process no later than 90 days after the date the joint application was received by VA. If such requirements are not complete within 90 days from the date the joint application is received by VA, the joint application will be denied, and a new joint application will be required.

    (ii) Joint applications received by VA on or after October 1, 2020 will be evaluated by VA based on the provisions of this part in effect on or after October 1, 2020.

    (A) VA will deny any joint application of an individual described in § 71.20(a)(2)(ii), if such joint application is received by VA before October 1, 2020.

    (B) VA will deny any joint application of an individual described in § 71.20(a)(2)(iii), if such joint application is received by VA before October 1, 2022. A veteran or servicemember seeking to qualify for the Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers pursuant to § 71.20(a)(2)(iii) should submit a joint application that is received by VA on or after October 1, 2022.

    (b)  In order to serve as a Primary or Secondary Family Caregiver, the applicant must meet all of the following requirements:

    (1) Be at least 18 years of age.

    (2) Be either:

    (3) There must be no determination by VA of abuse or neglect of the eligible veteran by the applicant.

    (4) Meet the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section, and any other applicable requirements of this part.

    (c)  Before VA approves an applicant to serve as a Primary or Secondary Family Caregiver, the applicant must:

    (1) Be initially assessed by VA as being able to complete caregiver education and training. Such assessment will consider any relevant information specific to the needs of the eligible veteran, as well as:

    (i) Whether the applicant can communicate and understand the required personal care services and any specific instructions related to the care of the eligible veteran (accommodation for language or hearing impairment will be made to the extent possible and as appropriate); and

    (ii) Whether the applicant will be capable of performing the required personal care services without supervision, in adherence with the eligible veteran's treatment plan in support of the needs of the eligible veteran.

    (2) Complete caregiver training and demonstrate the ability to carry out the specific personal care services, core competencies, and additional care requirements.

    (d)  For the purposes of this section, caregiver training is a program of education and training designed and approved by VA that consists of issues that are generally applicable to Family Caregivers, as well as issues specific to the needs of the eligible veteran. During this program of education and training, family members are eligible for beneficiary travel under 38 CFR part 70. Respite care will be provided during the period of initial caregiver instruction, preparation, and training if the participation would interfere with the provision of personal care services to the eligible veteran. Caregiver training will cover, at a minimum, education and training concerning the following core competencies:

    (1) Medication management;

    (2) Vital signs and pain control;

    (3) Infection control;

    (f)  VA will approve the joint application and designate Primary and/or Secondary Family Caregivers, as appropriate, if the applicable requirements of this part are met. Approval and designation is conditioned on the eligible veteran and designated Family Caregiver(s) remaining eligible for Family Caregiver benefits under this part, the Family Caregiver(s) providing the personal care services required by the eligible veteran, and the eligible veteran and designated Family Caregiver(s) complying with all applicable requirements of this part, including participating in reassessments pursuant to § 71.30 and wellness contacts pursuant to § 71.40(b)(2). Refusal to comply with any applicable requirements of this part will result in revocation from the program pursuant to § 71.45, Revocation and Discharge of Family Caregivers.

    (b) Reassessments may occur more frequently than annually if a determination is made and documented by VA that more frequent reassessment is appropriate.

    (c) Reassessments may occur on a less than annual basis if a determination is made and documented by VA that an annual reassessment is unnecessary.

    (d) Failure of the eligible veteran or Family Caregiver to participate in any reassessment pursuant to this section will result in revocation pursuant to § 71.45, Revocation and Discharge of Family Caregivers.

    (e)(1) If the eligible veteran meets the requirements of § 71.20(b) or (c) ( is a legacy participant or a legacy applicant), the eligible veteran and Family Caregiver will be reassessed by VA (in collaboration with the primary care team to the maximum extent practicable) within the five-year period beginning on October 1, 2020 to determine whether the eligible veteran meets the requirements of § 71.20(a).

    (4) Primary Family Caregivers will receive a monthly stipend for each month's participation as a Primary Family Caregiver.

    (i)  (A) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(4)(i)(C) of this section, if the eligible veteran meets the requirements of § 7_1_._2_0(a), the Primary Family Caregiver's monthly stipend is the amount set forth in paragraph (c)(4)(i)(A)() or () of this section.

    () The Primary Family Caregiver's monthly stipend is calculated by multiplying the monthly stipend rate by 0.625.

    (B) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(4)(i)(C) of this section, for five years beginning on October 1, 2020, if the eligible veteran meets the requirements of § 71.20(b) or (c), ( is a legacy participant or a legacy applicant), the Primary Family Caregiver's monthly stipend is calculated based on the clinical rating in 38 CFR 71.40(c)(4)(i) through (iii) (2019) and the definitions applicable to such paragraphs under 38 CFR 71.15 (2019). If the sum of all of the ratings assigned is:

    () 2_1_ or higher, then the Primary Family Caregiver's monthly stipend is calculated by multiplying the monthly stipend rate by 1.00.

    () 13 to _2_0, then the Primary Family Caregiver's monthly stipend is calculated by multiplying the monthly stipend rate by 0.625.

    () 1 to 12, then the Primary Family Caregiver's monthly stipend is calculated by multiplying the monthly stipend rate by 0.25.

    (C) For f_i_ve years beginning on October 1, _2_020, if the eligible veteran meets the requirements of § 71.20(a) and (b) or (c), the Primary Family Caregiver's monthly stipend is the amount the Primary Family Caregiver is eligible to receive under paragraph (c)(4)(i)(A) or (B) of this section, whichever is higher. If the higher monthly stipend rate is the amount the Primary Family Caregiver is eligible to receive under paragraph (c)(4)(i)(A) of this section, the stipend rate will be adjusted and paid in accordance with paragraph (c)(4)(ii)(C)()() of this section.

    (D) Notwithstanding paragraphs (c)(4)(i)(A) through (C) of this section, for five years beginning on October 1, 2020, if the eligible veteran meets the requirements of § 71.20(b), the Primary Family Caregiver's monthly stipend is not less than the amount the Primary Family Caregiver was eligible to receive as of the day before October 1, 2020 (based on the eligible veteran's address on record with the Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers on such date) so long as the eligible veteran resides at the same address on record with the Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers as of the day before October 1, 2020. If the eligible veteran relocates to a different address, the stipend amount thereafter is determined pursuant to paragraph (c)(4)(i)(A), (B), or (C) of this section and adjusted in accordance with paragraph (c)(4)(ii)(B) of this section.

    (ii)  (A) Adjustments to stipend payments that result from OPM's updates to the General Schedule (GS) Annual Rate for grade 4, step 1 for the locality pay area in which the eligible veteran resides take effect prospectively following the date the update to such rate is made effective by OPM.

    (B) Adjustments to stipend payments that result from the eligible veteran relocating to a new address are effective the first of the month following the month in which VA is notified that the eligible veteran has relocated to a new address. VA must receive notification within 30 days from the date of relocation. If VA does not receive notification within 30 days from the date of relocation, VA will seek to recover overpayments of benefits under this paragraph (c)(4) back to the latest date on which the adjustment would have been effective if VA had been notified within 30 days from the date of relocation, as provided in § 71.47.

    (C) The Primary Family Caregiver's monthly stipend may be adjusted pursuant to the reassessment conducted by VA under § 71.30.

    () If the eligible veteran meets the requirements of § 7_1_.20(a) only (and does not meet the requirements of § 71.20(b) or (c)), the Primary Family Caregiver's monthly stipend is adjusted as follows:

    () In the case of a reassessment that results _i_n an increase in the monthly stipend payment, the increase takes effect as of the date of the reassessment.

    () In the case of a reassessment that results in a decrease in the monthly stipend payment, the decrease takes effect as of the effective date provided in VA's final notice of such decrease to the eligible veteran and Primary Family Caregiver. The effective date of the decrease will be no earlier than 60 days after VA provides advanced notice of its findings to the eligible veteran and Primary Family Caregiver.

    () If the eligible veteran meets the requirements of § 71._2_0(b) or (c), the Primary Family Caregiver's monthly stipend may be adjusted as follows:

    () In the case of a reassessment that results __i__n an increase in the monthly stipend payment, the increase takes effect as of the date of the reassessment. The Primary Family Caregiver will also be paid the difference between the amount under paragraph (c)(4)(i)(A) of this section that the Primary Family Caregiver is eligible to receive and the amount the Primary Family Caregiver was eligible to receive under paragraph (c)(4)(i)(B) or (D) of this section, whichever the Primary Family Caregiver received for the time period beginning on October 1, _2_020 up to the date of the reassessment, based on the eligible veteran's address on record with the Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers on the date of the reassessment and the monthly stipend rate on such date. If there is more than one reassessment for an eligible veteran during the five-year period beginning on October 1, 2020, the retroactive payment described in the previous sentence applies only if the first reassessment during the five-year period beginning on October 1, 2020 results in an increase in the monthly stipend payment, and only as the result of the first reassessment during the five-year period. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, if the first reassessment during the five-year period beginning on October 1, 2020 was completed by VA before March 25, 2022, and such reassessment did not result in an increase in the monthly stipend payment, the retroactive payment described in this paragraph (c)(4)(ii)(C)()() applies to the first reassessment initiated by VA on or after March 25, 2022 that applies the criteria in 38 U.S.C. 1720G(a)(2)(C)(ii) and (iii) in place of the definition of “need for supervision, protection, or instruction” that was invalidated by  v.  29 F.4th 1320, 1342-43 (Fed. Cir. 2022), if such reassessment results in an increase in the monthly stipend payment, and only as a result of such reassessment.

    () In the case of a reassessment that results in a decrease in the monthly stipend payment and the eligible veteran meets the requirements of § 71.20(a), the new stipend amount under paragraph (c)(4)(i)(A) of this section takes effect as of the effective date provided in VA's final notice of such decrease to the eligible veteran and Primary Family Caregiver. The effective date of the decrease will be no earlier than 60 days after October 1, 2025. On October 1, 2025, VA will provide advanced notice of its findings to the eligible veteran and Primary Family Caregiver.

    (D) Adjustments to stipend payments for the first month will take effect on the date specified in paragraph (d) of this section. Stipend payments for the last month will end on the date specified in § 71.45.

    (iii)  Nothing in this section shall be construed to create an employment relationship between the Secretary and an individual in receipt of assistance or support under this part.

    (iv)  In consultation with other appropriate agencies of the Federal government, VA shall periodically assess whether the monthly stipend rate meets the requirements of 38 U.S.C. 1720G(a)(3)(C)(ii) and (iv). If VA determines that adjustments to the monthly stipend rate are necessary, VA shall make such adjustments through future rulemaking.

    (5) Primary Family Caregivers are eligible for financial planning services as that term is defined in § 71.15. Such services will be provided by entities authorized pursuant to any contract entered into between VA and such entities.

    (6) Primary Family Caregivers are eligible for legal services as that term is defined in § 71.15. Such services will be provided by entities authorized pursuant to any contract entered into between VA and such entities.

    (d)  Except for paragraphs (b)(6) and (c)(3) and (4) of this section, caregiver benefits under paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section are effective upon approval and designation under § 71.25(f). Caregiver benefits under paragraphs (b)(6) and (c)(3) and (4) are effective on the latest of the following dates:

    (1) The date the joint application that resulted in approval and designation of the Family Caregiver is received by VA.

    (2) The date the eligible veteran begins receiving care at home.

    (3) The date the Family Caregiver begins providing personal care services to the eligible veteran at home.

    (4) In the case of a new Family Caregiver applying to be the Primary Family Caregiver for an eligible veteran, the day after the effective date of revocation or discharge of the previous Primary Family Caregiver for the eligible veteran (such that there is only one Primary Family Caregiver designated for an eligible veteran at one time).

    (5) In the case of a new Family Caregiver applying to be a Secondary Family Caregiver for an eligible veteran who already has two Secondary Family Caregivers approved and designated by VA, the day after the effective date of revocation or discharge of a previous Secondary Family Caregiver for the eligible veteran (such that there are no more than two Secondary Family Caregivers designated for an eligible veteran at one time).

    (6) In the case of a current or previous Family Caregiver reapplying with the same eligible veteran, the day after the date of revocation or discharge under § 71.45, or in the case of extended benefits under § 71.45(b)(1)(iii), (b)(2)(iii), (b)(3)(iii)(A) or (B), and (b)(4)(iv), the day after the last date on which such Family Caregiver received caregiver benefits.

    (7) The day after the date a joint application is denied.

    § 71.50   Provision of certain counseling, training, and mental health services to certain family members of veterans.

#### § § 71.50

    (a)  VA will provide consultation, professional counseling, marriage and family counseling, training, and mental health services to a family member when necessary in connection with the treatment of a disability for which the veteran is receiving treatment through VA. For the purposes of this section, provision of a benefit is “in connection with the treatment” of a veteran's disability if, in the clinical judgment of a VA medical professional who is providing treatment to the veteran, the provision of the benefit to the family member would further the objectives of the veteran's medical treatment plan. The listed benefits provided under this section are to be provided within the following guidelines:

    (1) All benefits will consist of psychotherapy, counseling, training, or education; VA will not provide prescriptions or medications to family members. VA also will not provide inpatient services under this section.

    (2) This section does not authorize the provision of clinical evaluation or treatment that is not necessary in connection with the veteran's treatment or that involves treatment other than consultation, professional counseling, marriage and family counseling, training, and mental health services.

    (3) Marriage and family counseling includes services to help the veteran address mental health issues, manage physical health problems, and strengthen environmental supports as specified in the veteran's treatment plan. It also includes interventions to reduce the negative impact for the veteran of mental illnesses or other medical conditions in family members.

    (b)  For the purpose of this section, which provides certain benefits and services to eligible family members, a family member is:

    (1) A person related to the veteran by birth or marriage who lives with the veteran or has regular personal contact with the veteran;

    (2) The veteran's legal guardian or surrogate;

    (3) A Primary or Secondary Family Caregiver or a General Caregiver; or

    (4) The individual in whose household the veteran has certified an intention to live.

    (c)  Where a VA clinician believes that medical care or services are needed for a family member but cannot provide benefits under this section because such need is not necessary in connection with the treatment of the veteran, VA may refer such family member to an appropriate provider in the community, so that the family member may obtain care through other health coverage including care to which a Primary or Secondary Family Caregiver may be eligible under this part.

CVE receives and reviews all applications for eligibility under this part and maintains the VIP database. CVE assists VA contracting offices to identify veteran-owned small businesses and communicates with the Small Business Administration (SBA) with regard to small business status.

      are calendar days unless otherwise specified. In computing any period of time described in this part, the day from which the period begins to run is not counted, and when the last day of the period is a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal holiday, the period extends to the next day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal holiday. Similarly, in circumstances where CVE is closed for all or part of the last day, the period extends to the next day on which the agency is open.

      § 74.2   What are the eligibility requirements a concern must meet for the VIP Verification Program?

#### § § 74.2

      (a)  A small business concern must be unconditionally owned and controlled by one or more eligible veterans, service-disabled veterans or surviving spouses, have completed the online VIP database forms, submitted required supplemental documentation at  and have been examined by VA's CVE. Such businesses appear in the VIP database as “verified”.

      (b)  Individuals having an ownership or control interest in verified businesses must have good character. Debarred or suspended concerns or concerns owned or controlled by debarred or suspended persons are ineligible for VIP Verification. Concerns owned or controlled by a person(s) who is currently incarcerated, or on parole or probation (pursuant to a pre-trial diversion or following conviction for a felony or any crime involving business integrity) are ineligible for VIP Verification. Concerns owned or controlled by a person(s) who is formally convicted of a crime set forth in 48 CFR 9.406-2(b)(3) are ineligible for VIP Verification during the pendency of any subsequent legal proceedings. If, after verifying a participant's eligibility, the person(s) controlling the participant is found to lack good character, CVE will immediately remove the participant from the VIP database, notwithstanding the provisions of § 74.22.

      (c)  If, during the processing of an application, CVE determines, by a preponderance of the evidence standard, that an applicant has knowingly submitted false information, regardless of whether correct information would cause CVE to deny the application, and regardless of whether correct information was given to CVE in accompanying documents, CVE will deny the application. If, after verifying the participant's eligibility, CVE discovers that false statements or information have been submitted by a firm, CVE will remove the participant from the VIP database immediately, notwithstanding the provisions of § 74.22. Whenever CVE determines that the applicant submitted false information, the matter will be referred to the VA Office of Inspector General for review. In addition, CVE will request that debarment proceedings be initiated by the Department.

      (d)  Neither an applicant firm nor any of its eligible individuals that fails to pay significant financial obligations, including unresolved tax liens and defaults on Federal loans or State or other government assisted financing, owed to the federal government, the District of Columbia or any state, district, or territorial government of the United States, is eligible for VIP Verification. If after verifying the participant's eligibility CVE discovers that the participant no longer satisfies this requirement, CVE will remove the participant from the VIP database in accordance with § 74.22.

      (e)  Any firm verified in the VIP database that is found to be ineligible by a SDVOSB/VOSB status protest decision will be immediately removed from the VIP database, notwithstanding the provisions of § 74.22. Any firm verified in the VIP database that is found to be ineligible due to a U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) protest decision or other negative finding may be immediately removed from the VIP database, notwithstanding the provisions of § 74.22. Until such time as CVE receives official notification that the firm has proven that it has successfully overcome the grounds for the determination, that the decision is overturned on appeal, or the firm applies for and receives verified status from CVE, the firm will not be eligible to participate in the 38 U.S.C. 8127 program.

      (f)  All applicants for VIP Verification must be registered in SAM at  prior to application submission.

> [83 FR 48229, Sept. 24, 2018]

      § 74.3   Who does CVE consider to own a veteran-owned small business?

#### § § 74.3

      (a)  Ownership is determined in accordance with 13 CFR part 125. However, where 13 CFR part 125 is limited to SDVOSBs, CVE applies the same ownership criteria to firms seeking verified VOSB status.

      (b)  (1) A participant may remain eligible after a change in its ownership or business structure, so long as one or more veterans own and control it after the change. The participant must file an updated VA Form 0877 and supporting documentation identifying the new veteran owners or the new business interest within 30 days of the change.

      (2) Any participant that is performing contracts and desires to substitute one veteran owner for another shall submit a proposed novation agreement and supporting documentation in accordance with FAR subpart 42.12 to the contracting officer prior to the substitution or change of ownership for approval.

      (3) Where the transfer results from the death or incapacity due to a serious, long-term illness or injury of an eligible principal, prior approval is not required, but the concern must file an updated VA Form 0877 with CVE within 60 days of the change. Existing contracts may be performed to the end of the instant term. However, no options may be exercised.

      (4) Continued eligibility of the participant with new ownership requires that CVE verify that all eligibility requirements are met by the concern and the new owners.

      § 74.4   Who does CVE consider to control a veteran-owned small business?

#### § § 74.4

      Control is determined in accordance with 13 CFR part 125. However, where 13 CFR part 125 is limited to SDVOSBs, CVE applies the same control criteria to firms seeking verified VOSB status.

      § 74.5   How does CVE determine affiliation?

#### § § 74.5

      (b) Joint ventures may apply for inclusion in the VIP Verification Program. To be eligible for inclusion in the VIP Verification Program, a joint venture must demonstrate that:

      (1) The underlying VOSB upon which eligibility is based is verified in accordance with this part; and

      (2) The joint venture agreement complies with the requirements set forth in 13 CFR part 125 for SDVOSBs. However, while 13 CFR part 125 is limited to SDVOSBs, CVE will apply the same requirements to joint venture firms seeking verified VOSB status.

Once an applicant registers, CVE will contact the applicant within 30 days to initiate the process. If CVE is unsuccessful in its attempts to contact the applicant, the application will be administratively removed. If CVE is successful in initiating contact with the applicant, CVE will advise the applicant of required documents and the timeline for submission. If the applicant would be unable to provide conforming documentation, the applicant will be given the option to withdraw its application. CVE will process an application for VIP Verification status within 90 application days, when practicable, of receipt of a registration. Incomplete application packages will not be processed.

      (b) CVE, in its sole discretion, may request clarification of information relating to eligibility at any time in the eligibility determination process. CVE will take into account any clarifications made by an applicant in response to a request for such by CVE.

      (c) CVE, in its sole discretion, may request additional documentation at any time in the eligibility determination process. Failure to adequately respond to the documentation request shall constitute grounds for a denial or administrative removal.

      (d) An applicant's eligibility will be based on the totality of circumstances existing on the date of application, except where clarification is made pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, additional documentation is submitted pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section, as provided in paragraph (e) of this section or in the case of amended documentation submitted pursuant to § 74.13(a). The applicant bears the burden to establish its status as a VOSB.

      (e) Changed circumstances for an applicant occurring subsequent to its application and which affect eligibility will be considered and may constitute grounds for denial of the application. The applicant must inform CVE of any changed circumstances that could affect its eligibility for the program ( ownership or control changes) during its application review.

      (1)  Bankruptcy is a change in circumstance requiring additional protection for the agency. Should a VOSB enter into bankruptcy the participant must:

      (i) Inform CVE of the filing event within 30 days;

      (ii) Specify to CVE whether the concern has filed Chapter 7, 11, or 13 under U.S. Bankruptcy code; and

      (2) [Reserved]

      (f) The decision of the Director, CVE, to approve or deny an application will be in writing. A decision to deny verification status will state the specific reasons for denial and will inform the applicant of any appeal rights.

      (g) If the Director, CVE, approves the application, the date of the approval letter is the date of participant verification for purposes of determining the participant's verification eligibility term.

      (h) The decision may be sent by mail, commercial carrier, facsimile transmission, or other electronic means. It is the responsibility of the applicant to ensure all contact information is current in the applicant's profile.

#### § § 74.13

      (a) An applicant may appeal CVE's decision to deny an application by filing an appeal with the United States Small Business Administration (SBA) Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA) after the applicant receives the denial in accordance with 13 CFR part 134. The filing party bears the risk that the delivery method chosen will not result in timely receipt by OHA.

      (b) A denial decision that is based on the failure to meet any veteran eligibility criteria is not subject to appeal and is the final decision of CVE.

      (c) If the Director, CVE, denies the application solely on issues not raised in the initial denial, the applicant may ask for reconsideration as if it were an initial denial.

      (d) If CVE determines that a concern may not qualify as small, they may directly deny an application for VetBiz VIP Verification or may request a formal size determination from the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA). A concern whose application is denied because it is other than a small business concern by CVE may request a formal size determination from the SBA Associate Administrator, Office of Government Contracting (ATTN: Director, Office of Size Standards), 409 3rd Street, SW., Washington, DC 20416. A favorable determination by SBA will enable the firm to immediately submit a new VetBiz VIP Verification.

      (e) A denial decision that is based on the failure to meet any veteran or service-disabled veteran eligibility criteria is not subject to a request for reconsideration and is the final decision of CVE.

      (f) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, the decision on the request for reconsideration shall be final.

      (g) The decision may be sent by mail, commercial carrier, facsimile transmission, or other electronic means.

#### § § 74.20

      (a)  A verification examination is an investigation by CVE officials, which verifies the accuracy of any statement or information provided as part of the VIP Verification application process. Thus, examiners may verify that the concern currently meets the eligibility requirements, and that it met such requirements at the time of its application or its most recent size recertification. An examination may be conducted on a random, unannounced basis, or upon receipt of specific and credible information alleging that a participant no longer meets eligibility requirements.

      (b)  CVE may conduct the examination at one or all of the participant's offices or work sites. CVE will determine the location(s) of the examination. CVE may review any information related to the concern's eligibility requirements including, but not limited to, documentation related to the legal structure, ownership, and control. Examiners may review any or all of the organizing documents, financial documents, and publicly available information as well as any information identified in § 74.12.

#### § § 74.22

      (a)  When CVE believes that a participant's verified status should be cancelled prior to the expiration of its eligibility term, CVE will notify the participant in writing. The Notice of Proposed Cancellation Letter will set forth the specific facts and reasons for CVE's findings and will notify the participant that it has 30 days from the date CVE sent the notice to submit a written response to CVE explaining why the proposed ground(s) should not justify cancellation.

      (b)  Following the 30-day response period, the Director, CVE, will consider any information submitted by the participant. Upon determining that cancellation is not warranted, the Director, CVE, will notify the participant in writing. If cancellation appears warranted, the Director, CVE, will make a decision whether to cancel the participant's verified status.

      (c)  Upon deciding that cancellation is warranted, the Director, CVE, will issue a Notice of Verified Status Cancellation. The Notice will set forth the specific facts and reasons for the decision, and will advise the concern that it may re-apply after it has met all eligibility criteria.

      § 75.113   Data breach.

#### § § 75.113

      Consistent with the definition of data breach in § 75.112 of this subpart, a data breach occurs under this subpart if there is a loss or theft of, or other unauthorized access to, other than an unauthorized access incidental to the scope of employment, data containing sensitive personal information, in electronic or printed form, that results in the potential compromise of the confidentiality or integrity of the data. The term “unauthorized access” used in the definition of “data breach” includes access to an electronic information system and includes, but is not limited to, viewing, obtaining, or using data containing sensitive personal information in any form or in any VA information system. The phrase “unauthorized access incidental to the scope of employment” includes instances when employees of contractors and other entities need access to VA sensitive information in order to perform a contract or agreement with VA but incidentally obtain access to other VA sensitive information. Accordingly, an unauthorized access, other than an unauthorized access incidental to the scope of employment, to data containing sensitive personal information, in electronic or printed form, that results in the potential compromise of the confidentiality or integrity of the data, constitutes a data breach. In addition to these circumstances, VA also interprets data breach to include circumstances in which a user misuses sensitive personal information to which he or she has authorized access. The following circumstances do not constitute a data breach and, consequently, are not subject to the provisions of this subpart:

      (a) An unauthorized access to data containing sensitive personal information that was determined by the Secretary to be incidental to the scope of employment, such as an inadvertent unauthorized viewing of sensitive personal information by a VA employee or a person acting on behalf of VA.

      (b) A loss, theft, or other unauthorized access to data containing sensitive personal information that the Secretary determined to have no possibility of compromising the confidentiality or integrity of the data, such as the inability of compromising the confidentiality or integrity of the data because of encryption or the inadvertent disclosure to another entity that is required to provide the same or a similar level of protection for the data under statutory or regulatory authority.

      § 75.114   Accelerated response.

#### § § 75.114

      (a) The Secretary, in the exercise of his or her discretion, may provide notice to records subjects of a data breach and/or offer them other credit protection services prior to the completion of a risk analysis if:

      (1) The Secretary determines, based on the information available to the agency when it learns of the data breach, that there is an immediate, substantial risk of identity theft of the individuals whose data was the subject of the data breach, and providing timely notice may enable the record subjects to promptly take steps to protect themselves, and/or the offer of other credit protection services will assist in timely mitigation of possible harm to individuals from the data breach; or

      (2) Private entities would be required to provide notice under Federal law if they experienced a data breach involving the same or similar information.

      (3) In situations described in paragraphs (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section, the Secretary may provide notice of the breach prior to completion of a risk analysis, and subsequently advise individuals whether the agency will offer additional credit protection services upon completion, and consideration of the results, of the risk analysis, if the Secretary directs that one be completed.

      (b) In determining whether to promptly notify individuals and/or offer them other credit protection services under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the Secretary shall make the decision based upon the totality of the circumstances and information available to the Secretary at the time of the decision, including whether providing notice and offering other credit protection services would be likely to assist record subjects in preventing, or mitigating the results of, identity theft based on the compromised VA sensitive personal information. The Secretary's exercise of this discretion will be based on good cause, including consideration of the following factors:

      (1) The nature and content of the lost, stolen or improperly accessed data, e.g., the data elements involved, such as name, social security number, date of birth;

      (2) The ability of an unauthorized party to use the lost, stolen or improperly accessed data, either by itself or with data or applications generally available, to commit identity theft or otherwise misuse the data to the disadvantage of the record subjects, if able to access and use the data;

      (3) Ease of logical data access to the lost, stolen or improperly accessed data in light of the degree of protection for the data, e.g., unencrypted, plain text;

      (4) Ease of physical access to the lost, stolen or improperly accessed data, e.g., the degree to which the data is readily available to unauthorized access, such as being in a dumpster readily accessible by members of the general public;

      (5) The format of the lost, stolen or improperly accessed data, e.g., in a standard electronic format, such as ASCII, or in paper;

      (6) Evidence indicating that the lost, stolen or improperly accessed data may have been the target of unlawful acquisition; and

      (7) Evidence that the same or similar data had been acquired from other sources improperly and used for identity theft.

      (c) VA will provide notice and/or other credit protection services under this section as provided in §§ 75.117 and 75.118.

      § 75.115   Risk analysis.

#### § § 75.115

      If a data breach involving sensitive personal information that is processed or maintained by VA occurs and the Secretary has not determined under § 75.114 that an accelerated response is appropriate, the Secretary shall ensure that, as soon as possible after the data breach, a non-VA entity with relevant expertise in data breach assessment and risk analysis or VA's Office of Inspector General conducts an independent risk analysis of the data breach. The preparation of the risk analysis may include data mining if necessary for the development of relevant information. The risk analysis shall include a finding with supporting rationale concerning whether the circumstances create a reasonable risk that sensitive personal information potentially may be misused. If the risk analysis concludes that the data breach presents a reasonable risk for the potential misuse of sensitive personal information, the risk analysis must also contain operational recommendations for responding to the data breach. Each risk analysis, regardless of findings and operational recommendations, shall also address all relevant information concerning the data breach, including the following:

      (a) Nature of the event (loss, theft, unauthorized access).

      (b) Description of the event, including:

      (1) Date of occurrence;

      (2) Data elements involved, including any personally identifiable information, such as full name, social security number, date of birth, home address, account number, disability code;

      (3) Number of individuals affected or potentially affected;

      (4) Individuals or groups affected or potentially affected;

      (5) Ease of logical data access to the lost, stolen or improperly accessed data in light of the degree of protection for the data, e.g., unencrypted, plain text;

      (6) Time the data has been out of VA control;

      (7) The likelihood that the sensitive personal information will or has been compromised (made accessible to and usable by unauthorized persons); and

      (8) Known misuses of data containing sensitive personal information, if any.

      (c) Assessment of the potential harm to the affected individuals.

      (d) Data breach analysis, as appropriate.

      § 75.116   Secretary determination.

#### § § 75.116

      (a) Upon receipt of a risk analysis prepared under this subpart, the Secretary will consider the findings and other information contained in the risk analysis to determine whether the data breach caused a reasonable risk for the potential misuse of sensitive personal information. If the Secretary finds that such a reasonable risk does not exist, the Secretary will take no further action under this subpart. However, if the Secretary finds that such a reasonable risk exists, the Secretary will take responsive action as specified in this subpart based on the potential harms to individuals subject to a data breach.

      (b) In determining whether the data breach resulted in a reasonable risk for the potential misuse of the compromised sensitive personal information, the Secretary shall consider all factors that the Secretary, in his or her discretion, considers relevant to the decision, including:

      (1) The likelihood that the sensitive personal information will be or has been made accessible to and usable by unauthorized persons;

      (2) Known misuses, if any, of the same or similar sensitive personal information;

      (3) Any assessment of the potential harm to the affected individuals provided in the risk analysis;

      (4) Whether the credit protection services that VA may offer under 38 U.S.C. 5724 may assist record subjects in avoiding or mitigating the results of identity theft based on the VA sensitive personal information that had been compromised;

      (5) Whether private entities are required under Federal law to offer credit protection services to individuals if the same or similar data of the private entities had been similarly compromised; and

      (6) The recommendations, if any, concerning the offer of, or benefits to be derived from, credit protection services in this case that are in the risk analysis report.

      § 75.117   Notification.

#### § § 75.117

      (a) With respect to individuals found under this subpart by the Secretary to be subject to a reasonable risk for the potential misuse of any sensitive personal information, the Secretary will promptly provide written notification by first-class mail to the individual (or the next of kin if the individual is deceased) at the last known address of the individual. The notification may be sent in one or more mailings as information is available and will include the following:

      (1) A brief description of what happened, including the date[s] of the data breach and of its discovery if known;

      (2) To the extent possible, a description of the types of personal information that were involved in the data breach (e.g., full name, Social Security number, date of birth, home address, account number, disability code);

      (3) A brief description of what the agency is doing to investigate the breach, to mitigate losses, and to protect against any further breach of the data;

      (4) Contact procedures for those wishing to ask questions or learn additional information, which will include a toll-free telephone number, an e-mail address, Web site, and/or postal address;

      (5) Steps individuals should take to protect themselves from the risk of identity theft, including steps to obtain fraud alerts (alerts of any key changes to such reports and on demand personal access to credit reports and scores), if appropriate, and instruction for obtaining other credit protection services offered under this subpart; and

      (6) A statement whether the information was encrypted or protected by other means, when determined such information would be beneficial and would not compromise the security of the system.

      (b) In those instances where there is insufficient, or out-of-date contact information that precludes direct written notification to an individual subject to a data breach, a substitute form of notice may be provided, such as a conspicuous posting on the home page of VA's Web site and notification in major print and broadcast media, including major media in geographic areas where the affected individuals likely reside. Such a notice in media will include a toll-free phone number where an individual can learn whether or not his or her personal information is possibly included in the data breach.

      (c) In those cases deemed by the Secretary to require urgency because of possible imminent misuse of sensitive personal information, the Secretary, in addition to notification under paragraph (a) of this section, may provide information to individuals by telephone or other means, as appropriate.

      (d) Notwithstanding other provisions in this section, notifications may be delayed upon lawful requests, from other Federal agencies, for the delay of notifications in order to protect data or computer resources from further compromise or to prevent interference with the conduct of an investigation or efforts to recover the data. A lawful request is one made in writing by the entity or VA component responsible for the investigation or data recovery efforts that may be adversely affected by providing notification. Any lawful request for delay in notification must state an estimated date after which the requesting entity believes that notification will not adversely affect the conduct of the investigation or efforts to recover the data. However, any delay should not exacerbate risk or harm to any affected individual(s). Decisions to delay notification should be made by the Secretary.

      § 75.118   Other credit protection services.

#### § § 75.118

      (a) With respect to individuals found under this subpart by the Secretary to be subject to a reasonable risk for the potential misuse of any sensitive personal information under this subpart, the Secretary may offer one or more of the following as warranted based on considerations specified in paragraph (b) of this section:

      (1) One year of credit monitoring services consisting of automatic daily monitoring of at least 3 relevant credit bureau reports;

      (2) Data breach analysis;

      (3) Fraud resolution services, including writing dispute letters, initiating fraud alerts and credit freezes, to assist affected individuals to bring matters to resolution; and/or

      (4) One year of identity theft insurance with $20,000.00 coverage at $0 deductible.

      (b) Consistent with the requirements of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (15 U.S.C. 1681 ) as interpreted and applied by the Federal Trade Commission, the notice to the individual offering other credit protection services will explain how the individual may obtain the services, including the information required to be submitted by the individual to obtain the services, and the time period within which the individual must act to take advantage of the credit protection services offered.

      (c) In determining whether any or all of the credit protection services specified in paragraph (a) of this section will be offered to individuals subject to a data breach, the Secretary will consider the following:

      (1) The data elements involved;

      (2) The number of individuals affected or potentially affected;

      (3) The likelihood the sensitive personal information will be or has been made accessible to and usable by unauthorized persons;

      (4) The risk of potential harm to the affected individuals; and

      (5) The ability to mitigate the risk of harm.

      (c) The Secretary will take action to obtain data mining and data breach analyses services, as appropriate, to obtain information relevant for making determinations under this subpart.

      § 75.119   Finality of Secretary determination.

#### § § 75.119

      A determination made by the Secretary under this subpart will be a final agency decision.

    § 77.4   Applications.

#### § § 77.4

    (a)  To apply for an initial grant, an applicant must submit to VA a complete grant application package, as described in the NOFA.

    (b)  After receiving an initial grant, grantees may apply for a renewal grant if the grantee's program will remain substantially the same. The grantee must submit to VA a complete renewal application as described in the NOFA. Because evaluations of renewal applications rely on performance data related to the initial grant, the application and supporting documentation may vary from the initial application; however, renewal applications are competitive grants and will be evaluated under competitive grant selection processes.

    § 77.7   Withdrawal of grant application.

#### § § 77.7

    An applicant may withdraw its application by submitting to VA a written document that withdraws the application.

    § 77.8   Additional requirements and procedures for applications.

#### § § 77.8

    (a)  An applicant may submit, on or before the submission deadline date established in a NOFA, an application in accordance with the instructions in the NOFA and including the forms specified in the NOFA. Such application must be signed by the applicant or an official or representative of the applicant duly authorized to make such application and to assume on behalf of the applicant the obligations imposed by law, applicable regulations, and any additional terms and conditions of the grant. VA may require in the NOFA for applicants to submit a pre-application for review and approval prior to the submission of an application.

    (b)  (1) Eligible entities may enter into partnerships with other eligible entities, including those in other States, and submit joint applications for adaptive sports grants.

    (2) A joint application made by two or more applicants may have separate budgets corresponding to the programs, services and activities performed by each of the joint applicants or may have a combined budget. If a joint application presents separate budgets, VA may make separate awards, or may award a single award authorizing separate amounts for each joint applicant.

    (c)  All applications submitted shall be evaluated. After the initial internal or peer review, additional internal evaluations and/or peer reviews may be used.

    (d)  When the applicant has previously received an award from VA or another Federal agency, the applicant's noncompliance with requirements applicable to such prior award as reflected in past written evaluation reports and memoranda on performance, and the completeness of required prior submissions, may be considered by VA. In any case where VA proposes to deny a grant based upon the applicant's noncompliance with requirements applicable to the prior award, VA shall do so only after affording the applicant notice and a reasonable opportunity to rebut the proposed basis for denial of a grant.

    (e)  Applicants must meet and maintain standards of fiscal integrity for participation in Federal grant programs as reflected in 2 CFR part 200.

    (f)  Upon review of an application and dependent on availability of funds, VA will:

    (1) Approve the application for funding, in whole or in part, for such amount of funds, and subject to such conditions that VA deems necessary or desirable;

    (2) Determine that the application is of acceptable quality for funding, in that it meets minimum criteria, but disapprove the application for funding because it did not rank sufficiently high in relation to other applications to qualify for an award based on the level of funding available;

    (3) Disapprove the application for failure to meet the applicable selection criteria at a sufficiently high level in comparison to other applications to justify an award of funds, or for another reason as provided in the documentation of the decision; or

    (4) Defer action on the application for such reasons as lack of funds or a need for further review.

    (g)  VA will notify the applicant in writing of the disposition of the application. A signed grant agreement form will be issued to the applicant of an approved application.

    (h)  Federal financial assistance is normally available only with respect to obligations incurred subsequent to the effective date of the grant. The effective date of grant will be set forth in the grant agreement. Recipients may be reimbursed for costs resulting from obligations incurred before the effective date of the grant, if such costs are authorized by VA in the NOFA, the grant agreement or subsequently by VA in writing, and otherwise would be allowable as costs of the grant under applicable guidelines, regulations, and terms and conditions of the grant agreement.

#### § § 77.10

    (a) VA may subject both pre-applications and formal applications to a peer review process. For both competitive and noncompetitive applications, peer review will normally consist of written comments based on the selection criteria established in § 77.5 and any weighting factors identified in the NOFA or conveyed in writing to the noncompetitive applicant, together with the assignment of numerical values. Peer review may occur at meetings of peer reviewers that are held under VA oversight, through mail reviews, or a combination of both. When advisable, site visits may also be employed. The method of peer review anticipated for each announced competitive program, including the weighting factors to be used by peer reviewers, will be specified in each NOFA.

    (b) When formal applications are required in response to a NOFA, an initial review will be conducted by qualified VA staff, in order to eliminate from peer review consideration applications which do not meet minimum program requirements. Such requirements as listed in § 77.5 and weighting factors will be specified in the NOFA. Applications determined to be qualified and eligible for further consideration may then be considered under the peer review process.

    § 77.11   Outreach required.

#### § § 77.11

    (a) As a condition of receiving a grant under this part, an eligible entity must agree to conduct a joint outreach campaign with VA to inform all eligible veterans and separating members of the Armed Forces with physical disabilities about the existence of the adaptive sports activities funded by the grant, as appropriate, and shall provide for, facilitate, and encourage participation of such veterans and separating members of the Armed Forces in programs under this part to the extent possible.

    (b) For grantees conducting adaptive sports activities at the community level, outreach must include active liaison with local VA and DoD facilities; State, local, and tribal governments; and VSOs, private agencies, and organizations providing adaptive sport activities to disabled veterans and disabled members of the Armed Forces to be served by the grantee.

    (c) For grantees conducting adaptive sports activities occurring at the national and regional levels, outreach must include active liaison with VA and DoD, State governments, VSOs, and private agencies and organizations providing adaptive sport services to disabled veterans and disabled members of the Armed Forces to be served by the grantee and tailored as appropriate to the deliverables of the grant.

    § 77.12   Notice of funding availability.

#### § § 77.12

    When funds are available for grants, VA will publish a NOFA in the OMB-designated government-wide Web site. The notice will identify:

    (a) The information required to be in notices of funding opportunities in 2 CFR Part 200;

    (b) The location for obtaining grant applications;

    (c) The date, time, and place for submitting completed grant applications;

    (d) The estimated amount and type of grant funding available;

    (g) The timeframe and manner for payments under the grant.

    § 77.13   Applications for noncompetitive adaptive sports grants.

#### § § 77.13

    (a) When VA identifies that an eligible entity is the only entity capable of providing an adaptive sports activity for disabled veterans and disabled members of the Armed Forces, and VA determines that the award of a grant to this entity is warranted to enable adaptive sports activities for disabled veterans and disabled members of the Armed Forces, VA may request that entity to submit a grant application. To verify that only one entity is capable of providing an adaptive sports activity:

    (1) VA must determine that the adaptive sports activity is available only from one eligible entity;

    (2) VA must receive a written statement from an entity which verifies that a particular adaptive sports activity is only available from a named non-Federal entity; or

    (3) After VA attempts to find competition for a grant by issuing a NOFA, VA receives only one application to provide the adaptive sports activity sought under the NOFA or having received no applications, engages a qualified adaptive sport entity to negotiate provision of the adaptive sports activity sought.

    (b) To submit an application for a noncompetitive adaptive sports grant, an applicant must obtain from VA an adaptive sports grant application package and submit to VA the information called for in the adaptive sports grant application package within the time period established in the NOFA.

    (c) The noncompetitive adaptive sports grant application must include:

    (1) Information regarding the program design and supporting evidence directly linking the program to the achievement of the program's objectives;

    (2) Documentation on the eligibility of the applicant to receive an adaptive sports grant and on why the award of a noncompetitive grant is warranted;

    (3) Description of the type of adaptive sports activities that would be provided;

    (4) Documentation concerning the estimated operating costs and operating budget for the adaptive sports activities for which a grant is sought;

    (5) Documentation that the applicant has the technical expertise needed; and

    (6) Reasonable assurances that if the applicant receives an adaptive sports grant under this part:

    (i) It will provide adequate financial and administrative support for providing the services set forth in the adaptive sports grant application and will actually provide such services; and

    (ii) It will keep records and submit reports as VA may reasonably require, within the time frames required; and give VA, upon demand, access to the records upon which such information is based.

Under this section, the relevant NOFO is the most recently published NOFO which covers the affected area, or for multi-year grant awards, the NOFO for which the grantee, who is offered the additional funds, received the multi-year award.

    (2) If the first such applicant or grantee offered the non-renewed funds refuses the funds, VA will offer to award the funds to the next highest-ranked such applicant or grantee, per the criteria in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, and continue on in rank order until the non-renewed funds are awarded.

    (e) If an applicant would have been selected but for a procedural error committed by VA, VA may select that applicant for funding when sufficient funds become available if there is no material change in the information that would have resulted in the applicant's selection.

This standard is met by an emergency medical condition manifesting itself by acute symptoms of sufficient severity (including severe pain) that a prudent layperson who possesses an average knowledge of health and medicine could reasonably expect the absence of immediate medical attention to result in placing the health of the individual in serious jeopardy, serious impairment to bodily functions, or serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part.

    (e) The direct provision of clinical services for emergency treatment by grantees under this section is not prohibited by § 78.80(a).
