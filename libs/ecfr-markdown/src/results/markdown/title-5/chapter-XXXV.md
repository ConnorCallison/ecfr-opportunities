In addition to the regulations in 5 CFR part 2635 and this part, OPM employees are subject to the responsibilities and conduct regulations contained in 5 CFR parts 735 and 1001, the executive branch-wide financial disclosure regulations contained in 5 CFR part 2634, and the executive branch regulations regarding outside employment at 5 CFR part 2636.

The employee also must give such notice if he knows that his spouse, minor child, or business general partner intends to take any of these examinations.

    (b) The employee's supervisor or other appropriate authority will arrange the employee's duty assignments to prevent his contact with materials related to the examination or examinations that will be taken.

    (c)  Approval shall be granted only upon a determination by the agency designee, in consultation with an agency ethics official when such consultation is deemed necessary by the agency designee, that the outside activity is not expected to involve conduct prohibited by statute or Federal regulation, including 5 CFR part 2635.
