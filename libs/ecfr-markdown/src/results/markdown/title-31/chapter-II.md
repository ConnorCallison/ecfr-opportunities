        (a)  Treasury may assess interest on a financial institution in instances where a taxpayer that failed to meet a tax due date proves to the IRS that the delivery of Federal tax payment instructions to the financial institution was timely and that the taxpayer satisfied the conditions imposed by the financial institution pursuant to § 203.10(b). Treasury also may assess interest where a financial institution fails to respond to an ACH prenotification entry on an ACH debit as required under part 210 of this title, or fails to originate an ACH prenotification or zero dollar entry on an ACH credit at a taxpayer's request, which then results in a late payment.

        (b)  Any interest assessed under this section will be at the TT&L rate of interest. Treasury will assess the interest from the day the taxpayer specified that its payment should settle to the Treasury until the day Treasury receives the payment, subject to the following limitations: for ACH debit transactions, interest will be limited to no more than seven calendar days; For ACH credit and same-day transactions, interest will be limited to no more than 45 calendar days. The limitation of liability in this paragraph does not apply to any interest assessment in which there is an indication of fraud, the presentation of a false claim, or misrepresentation or embezzlement on the part of the financial institution or any employee or agent of the financial institution.

        (c)  A financial institution that processes Federal tax payments made electronically under this subpart is deemed to authorize the TSC to debit its reserve account for any interest assessed under this section. Upon the direction of Treasury, the TSC will debit the financial institution's reserve account for the amount of the assessed interest.

        (d)  (1) Treasury will not assess interest on a taxpayer's financial institution if a taxpayer fails to meet a tax due date because the taxpayer has not satisfied conditions imposed by the financial institution pursuant to § 203.10(b) and the financial institution has not contributed to the delay. The burden is on the financial institution to establish, pursuant to the procedures in § 203.13, that the taxpayer has not satisfied the conditions and that the financial institution has not caused or contributed to the delay.

        (2) Treasury will not assess interest on a financial institution if a taxpayer fails to meet a tax due date because the FRB or the TFA caused a delay and the financial institution did not contribute to the delay. The burden is on the financial institution to establish, pursuant to the procedures in § 203.13, that it did not cause or contribute to the delay.

        § 203.13   Appeal and dispute resolution.

#### § § 203.13

        (a)  A financial institution may contest any interest assessed under § 203.12 or any late fees assessed under § 203.17. To do so, the financial institution must submit information supporting its position and the relief sought. The information must be received, in writing, by the Treasury officer or Fiscal agent identified in the procedural instructions, no later than 90 calendar days after the date the TSC debits the Federal reserve account of the financial institution under § 203.12 or § 203.17. The Treasury officer or Fiscal agent will make a decision to: Uphold, reverse, or modify the assessment, or mandate other action.

        (b)  The financial institution may appeal the decision referenced in subsection (a) to Treasury as set forth in the procedural instructions. No further administrative review of Treasury's decision is available under this part.

        (c)  In the event of an over or under recovery of interest, principal, or late fees, Treasury will instruct the TSC to credit or debit the financial institution's reserve account.

      Subpart C—PATAX

        § 203.14   Scope of the subpart.

#### § § 203.14

        This subpart applies to all TT&L depositaries that accept FTD coupons and governs the acceptance and processing of those coupons.

        § 203.15   Tax deposits using FTD coupons.

#### § § 203.15

        A TT&L depositary processing FTD coupons may choose to be designated as a retainer depositary, an investor depositary, or a collector depositary. A TT&L depositary that accepts FTD coupons through any of its offices that accept demand and/or savings deposits must:

        (a) Accept from a taxpayer that presents an FTD coupon: cash, a postal money order drawn to the order of the depositary, or a check or draft drawn on and to the order of the depositary, covering an amount to be deposited as Federal taxes. A TT&L depositary may accept, at its discretion, a check drawn on another financial institution, but it does so at its option and absorbs for its own account any float and other costs involved.

        (b) Place a stamp impression on the face of each FTD coupon in the space provided. The stamp must reflect the date on which the TT&L depositary received the tax deposit and the name and location of the depositary. The IRS will determine whether the tax payment is on time by referring to the date stamped on the FTD coupon.

        (c) Forward, each day, to the IRS Service Center serving the geographical area in which the TT&L depositary is located, the FTD coupons for all FTD deposits received that day and a copy of the AOC reflecting the total amount of all FTD coupons.

        (d) Establish an adequate record of all FTD deposits prior to transmitting them to 36 the IRS Service Center so that the TT&L depositary will be able to identify deposits in the event the FTD coupons are lost in shipment. To be adequate, the record must show, at a minimum for each deposit, the date of the deposit, the taxpayer identification number, the amount of the deposit, the tax period ending date, the type of tax deposited, and the employer name. Alternatively, the TT&L depositary may retain a copy of each FTD coupon forwarded to the IRS Service Center.

        (e) On the business day following receipt of an FTD coupon, submit the AOC information electronically to the TSC.

        (f) Not accept compensation from taxpayers for accepting FTDs and handling them as required by this section.

        § 203.16   Retainer and investor depositaries.

#### § § 203.16

        (a)  On the business day that the TSC receives an AOC from a retainer or investor depositary, the TSC will credit the depositary's TIP main account balance for the amount reported on the AOC unless there isn't sufficient capacity. In that case, any amount in excess of the capacity will be debited to the reserve account and credited to the TGA.

        (b)  If an AOC does not arrive at the TSC before the designated cutoff time for receipt, the TSC will credit the amount of funds to the depositary's TIP main account balance as of the date of receipt of the AOC. However, the date on which funds will begin to earn interest for Treasury is the next business day after the AOC date.

        § 203.17   Collector depositaries.

#### § § 203.17

        (a)  On the business day that the TSC receives an AOC from a collector depositary, the TSC will debit the depositary's reserve account for the amount reported on the AOC and credit that amount to Treasury's account.

        (b)  If an AOC does not arrive at the TSC before the designated cutoff time on the first business day after the AOC date, an FTD late fee in the form of interest at the TT&L rate of interest will.be assessed for each day's delay in receipt of the AOC. Upon the direction of Treasury, the TSC will debit the depositary's reserve account for the amount of the late fee.

      Subpart D—Investment Program and Collateral Security Requirements for TT&L Depositaries

        § 203.18   Scope of the subpart.

#### § § 203.18

        This subpart governs the operation of the investment program, including the rules that TT&L depositaries must follow in crediting and debiting TIP main account balances, SDI account balances, and TIO account balances, and pledging collateral security.

        § 203.19   Sources of balances.

#### § § 203.19

        A financial institution must be a collector depositary that accepts term investments, an investor depositary, or a retainer depositary to participate in the investment program. Depositaries electing to participate in the investment program can receive Treasury's investments in obligations of the depositary from the following sources:

        (a) FTDs that have been credited to the depositary's TIP main account balance pursuant to subpart C of this part;

        (b) EFTPS ACH credit and debit transactions, Fedwire ® non-value transactions, and Fedwire ® value transfers pursuant to subpart B of this part;

        (c) Direct investments, SDIs, dynamic investments, and term investments pursuant to subpart D of this part; and

        (d) Other excess Treasury operating funds.

        § 203.20   Investment account requirements.

#### § § 203.20

        (a)  Treasury will invest funds in obligations of collector depositaries that accept term investments, investor depositaries, or retainer depositaries. Such obligations will be in the form of open-ended interest-bearing notes, or in the case of term investments, interest-bearing notes maintained for a predetermined period of time, and additions and reductions will be reflected on the books of the TSC.

        (1)  The TSC will credit the TIP main account balance as stated in § 203.16(a) for an investor or retainer depositary processing tax deposits through _PATAX._

        (2) —(i)  The TSC will credit a depositary's TIP main account balance, and credit the depositary's reserve account if capacity exists, for the amount of _EFTPS_ ACH debit and credit entries on the day such entries settle.

        (ii)  ®  The TSC will credit a depositary's TIP main account balance if capacity exists, throughout the day on the day of settlement, for the amount of _Fedwire_ ® _value and non-value transactions._ In the case of Fedwire ® value transactions, the depositary's reserve account will also be credited.

        (b)  Other funds from Treasury may be offered from time to time to depositaries participating in the investment program through direct investments, SDIs, term investments, or other investment programs.

        (c)  The amount of a TIP main account balance or SDI account balance is payable on demand without prior notice. The TSC will make calls for payment at the direction of the Secretary. On behalf of Treasury, the TSC will debit the depositary's reserve account on the day specified in the call for payment.

        (d)  The TIP main account balance and the SDI account balance bear interest at the TT&L rate of interest. Such interest is payable by a charge to the depositary's reserve account in the manner prescribed in the procedural instructions.

        (e) —(1)  A retainer or investor depositary must establish an initial balance limit for its TIP main account balance by providing notice to that effect in writing to the TSC. The balance limit is the amount of funds for which a retainer or investor depositary is willing to provide collateral in accordance with § 203.21(c)(1). The depositary must follow the procedural instructions before reducing the established balance limit unless the reduction results from a collateral revaluation as determined by the FRB. That portion of any PATAX or EFTPS tax payment which, when posted at the FRB, would cause the TIP main account balance to exceed the balance limit specified by the depositary, will be withdrawn by the FRB that day.

        (2)  An investor depositary that participates in direct investments must set a balance limit for direct investment purposes which is higher than the peak balance normally generated by the depositary's PATAX and EFTPS tax payment inflow. The depositary must follow the procedural instructions before reducing the established balance limit.

        (3)  SDIs are credited to the SDI account balance and are not considered in setting the amount of the TIP main account balance limit or in determining the amounts to be withdrawn where a depositary exceeds its TIP main account balance limit.

        (f)  Treasury may, from time to time, invest excess operating funds in obligations of depositaries awarded funds under _TIO._ Such obligations will be in the form of interest-bearing notes payable upon a predetermined period of time not to exceed 90 days. Such notes will bear interest at a rate prescribed by the Secretary by auction or otherwise taking into consideration prevailing market interest rates.

        § 203.21   Collateral security requirements.

#### § § 203.21

        Financial institutions that process EFTPS tax payments, but that are not TT&L depositaries, have no collateral requirements under this part. Financial institutions that are TT&L depositaries have collateral security requirements, as follows:

        (a) —(1)  _Investor and retainer depositaries_ must pledge collateral security in accordance with the requirements of paragraphs (c)(l), (d), and (e) of this section in an amount that is sufficient to cover the TIP main account balance and the balance in the TT&L account that exceeds the recognized insurance coverage.

        (2)  An investor depositary is required to pledge collateral in accordance with the requirements of paragraphs (c), (d), and (e) of this section no later than the day before a direct investment is placed. However, each investor depositary participating in same-day direct investments must pledge, prior to the announcement, collateral up to its balance limit to obtain the depositary's maximum portion of the same-day direct investment.

        (3)  The day before SDIs are credited to an investor depositary's SDI account balance, the depositary must pledge collateral security, in accordance with the requirements of paragraphs (c)(2), (d), and (e) of this section, to cover the total of the SDIs to be received.

        (4)  Each depositary participating in the term investment program must pledge, prior to the time the term investment is placed, collateral in accordance with paragraphs (c)(1), (c)(2) for certain term investments as determined by Treasury, (d), and (e) of this section sufficient to cover the total TIO account balance.

        (b)  Prior to crediting FTD deposits to the TT&L account, a collector depositary must pledge collateral security, in accordance with the requirements of paragraphs (c)(1), (d), and (e) of this section, in an amount which is sufficient to cover the balance in the TT&L account that exceeds the recognized insurance coverage.

        (c)  (1) Collateral security required under paragraphs (a)(1), (2), (4) (except as provided in subparagraph (2) below), and (b) of this section must be deposited with the depositary's FRB, or with a custodian or custodians within the United States designated by the TSC or FRB, under terms and conditions prescribed by the TSC or FRB.

        (2) A depositary pledging collateral security as required under paragraph (a)(3) or paragraph (a)(4) (when permitted) of this section must pledge the collateral under a written security agreement on a form provided by the FRB. The collateral security pledged to satisfy the requirements of paragraphs (a)(3) and (a)(4) (when permitted) of this section may remain in the pledging depositary's possession provided that the pledging is evidenced by advices of custody incorporated by reference in the written security agreement. The depositary must provide the written security agreement and all advices of custody covering collateral security pledged under that agreement to the FRB. Collateral security pledged under the agreement may not be substituted for or released without the advance approval of the FRB, and any collateral security subject to the security agreement will remain so subject until an approved substitution is made. No substitution or release will be approved until an advice of custody containing the description required by the written security agreement is received by the FRB.

        (3) Treasury's security interest in collateral security pledged by a depositary in accordance with paragraphs (c)(2) of this section to secure SDIs and certain term investments is perfected without Treasury taking possession of the collateral security by filing or, absent filing, for a period not to exceed 20 calendar days from the day of the depositary's receipt of the special direct or term investment.

        (d)  The types of securities that may be used as collateral, and how those securities are valued, are set forth in 31 CFR part 380.

        (e)  By pledging acceptable securities which are not negotiable without the depositary's endorsement or assignment, a TT&L depositary, in lieu of placing its unqualified endorsement on each security, appoints the FRB or its assigns as the depositary's attorney-in-fact with full irrevocable power and authority to endorse, assign or transfer the securities, and represents and warrants that an appropriate resolution authorizing the granting of such irrevocable power of attorney has been executed and adopted. The powers of attorney so granted are coupled with an interest and are irrevocable, and full power of substitution is granted to the assignee or holder.

        (f) —(1)  Treasury, without notice or demand, may sell or otherwise collect the proceeds of all or part of the collateral, including additions, substitutions, interest, and distribution of principal, and apply the proceeds to satisfy any claims of the United States against the depositary, if any of the following events occur:

        (i) The depositary fails to pay, when due, the whole or any part of the funds received by it for credit to the TT&L account and, if applicable, its TIP main account balance, SDI account balance, or TIO account balance;

        (ii) The depositary fails to pay when due amounts owed to the United States or the United States Treasury;

        (iii) The depositary otherwise violates or fails to perform any of the terms of this part or any of the procedural instructions entered into hereunder; or

        (iv) The depositary is closed for business by regulatory action or by proper corporate action, or a receiver, conservator, liquidator, or any other officer is appointed for the depositary. All principal and interest payments on any security pledged to protect the TIP main account balance, the SDI account balance, the TIO account balance or the TT&L account, as applicable, due as of the date of the insolvency or closure or thereafter becoming due, will be held separate and apart from any other assets and will constitute a part of the pledged security available to satisfy any claim of the United States.

        (2)  (i) Subject to the waiver in paragraph (f)(2)(iii) of this section, each depositary (including, with respect to such depositary, an assignee for the benefit of creditors, a trustee in bankruptcy, or a receiver in equity) will, as soon as possible, remit to the FRB, as Fiscal agent, each payment of principal and/or interest received by it with respect to collateral pledged pursuant to this section. The remittance will be made no later than 10 days after receipt of such a payment.

        (ii) Subject to the waiver in paragraph (f)(2)(iii) of this section, each obligor on a security pledged by a depositary pursuant to this section, upon notification that Treasury is entitled to any payment associated with that pledged security, must make each payment of principal and/or interest due with respect to such security directly to the FRB, as Fiscal agent of the United States.

        (iii) The requirements of paragraphs (f)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section are hereby waived for only so long as a pledging depositary avoids both termination from the program under § 203.7 and also those circumstances identified in paragraph (f)(1) which may lead to the collection of the proceeds of collateral or the waiver is otherwise terminated by Treasury.

      Subpart A—Rules Applicable to Federal Assistance Programs Included in a Treasury-State Agreement

        § 205.3   What Federal assistance programs are subject to this subpart A?

#### § § 205.3

        (a) Generally, this subpart prescribes the rules that apply to Federal assistance programs which:

        (1) Are listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance;

        (2) Meet the funding threshold for a major Federal assistance program; and

        (3) Are included in a Treasury-State agreement or default procedures.

        (b) Upon a State's request, we will make additional Federal assistance programs subject to subpart A by lowering the funding threshold in the Treasury-State agreement. All of a State's programs that meet this lower threshold would be subject to this subpart A.

        (c) We may make additional Federal assistance programs subject to subpart A if a State or Federal Program Agency fails to comply with subpart B of this part.

        § 205.4   Are there any circumstances where a Federal assistance program that meets the criteria of § 205.3 would not be subject to this subpart A?

#### § § 205.4

        (a) A Federal assistance program that meets or exceeds the threshold for major Federal assistance programs in a State is not subject to this subpart A until it is included in a Treasury-State agreement or in default procedures.

        (b) We and a State may agree to exclude components of a major Federal assistance program from interest calculations if the State administers the program through several State agencies and meets the following requirements:

        (1) The dollar amount of the exempted cash flow does not exceed 5% of the State's major Federal assistance program threshold and the total amount excluded under a single program by all State agencies administering the program does not exceed 10% of that Federal assistance program's total expenditures;

        (2) If less than the total amount of Federal assistance program funding is subject to interest calculation procedures, the interest liabilities should be pro-rated to 100% of the Federal assistance program funding;

        (3) A State may not use this exclusion if a Federal assistance program is administered by only one State agency; and

        (4) We may request Federal assistance program specific data on funding levels to determine exemptions.

        (c) We and a State may exclude a Federal assistance program from this subpart A if the Federal assistance program has been discontinued since the most recent Single Audit and the remaining funding is below the threshold, or if the Federal assistance program is funded by an award not limited to one fiscal year and the remaining Federal assistance program funding is below the State's threshold.

        § 205.5   What are the thresholds for major Federal assistance programs?

#### § § 205.5

        (a) Table A of this section defines major Federal assistance programs based on the dollar amount of an individual Federal assistance program and the dollar amount of all Federal assistance being received by a State for all Federal assistance programs including non-cash programs. A State must locate the appropriate row in Column A based upon the total amount of Federal assistance received. In that same row, a State must apply the percentage from Column B to the dollar value of all its Federal assistance programs to determine the State's threshold for major Federal assistance programs. For example, if the total amount received by a State for all Federal assistance programs is $50 million, then that State's threshold for major Federal assistance programs is 6% of $50 million or $3 million. A State which receives more than $10 billion under Federal assistance programs will have a minimum default threshold of $60 million.

        (b) To ensure adequate coverage of all State programs, a State must, on an annual basis, compare its program coverage using the percentage obtained from Table A to the program coverage which would result using a percentage which is half of the percentage obtained from Table A. For example, a State receiving $1 billion in Federal Assistance would use Table A to learn that its threshold level would be .60 percent of $1 billion. A State would compare program coverage at .60 percent of $1 billion to program coverage at .30 percent of $1 billion.

        (c) If the comparison conducted under paragraph (b) of this section results in a reduction of program coverage that is greater than 10%, a State must lower its threshold, or add programs, until the difference is less than or equal to 10%.

        (d) In accordance with § 205.3(b), a State may lower its threshold to include additional programs. All of a State's programs that meet this lower threshold would be subject to this subpart A.

        (e) Unless specified otherwise, major Federal assistance programs must be determined from the most recent Single Audit data available.

        § 205.6   What is a Treasury-State agreement?

#### § § 205.6

        (a) A Treasury-State agreement documents the accepted funding techniques and methods for calculating interest agreed upon by us and a State and identifies the Federal assistance programs governed by this subpart A. If anything in a Treasury-State agreement is inconsistent with this subpart A, that part of the Treasury-State agreement will not have any effect and this subpart A will govern.

        (b) A Treasury-State agreement will be effective until terminated unless we and a State agree to a specific termination date. We or a State may terminate a Treasury-State agreement on 30 days written notice.

        § 205.7   Can a Treasury-State agreement be amended?

#### § § 205.7

        (a) We or a State may amend a Treasury-State agreement at any time if both we and the State agree in writing.

        (b) The effective date of an amendment shall be the date both parties agree to the amendment in writing unless otherwise agreed to by both parties.

        (c) We and a State must amend a Treasury-State agreement as needed to change or clarify its language when the terms of the existing agreement are either no longer correct or no longer applicable. A State must notify us in writing within 30 days of the time the State becomes aware of a change, describing the Federal assistance program change. The notification must include a proposed amendment for our review and a current list of all programs included in the Treasury-State agreement. Amendments may address, but are not limited to:

        (1) Additions or deletions of Federal assistance programs subject to this subpart A;

        (2) Changes in funding techniques; and

        (3) Changes in clearance patterns.

        (d) Additions or deletions to the list of Federal assistance programs subject to this subpart A take effect when a Treasury-State agreement is amended, unless otherwise agreed to by the parties.

        (e) Federal assistance programs that are to be added to a Treasury-State agreement are not subject to this subpart A until the Treasury-State agreement is amended, except when a Federal assistance program subject to this subpart A is being replaced by a Federal assistance program governed by subpart B of this part, in which case the replacement program is immediately subject to this subpart A.

        (f) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, if no changes to the Treasury-State agreement are required, States must notify us annually.

        § 205.8   What if there is no Treasury-State agreement in effect?

#### § § 205.8

        When a State does not have a Treasury-State agreement in effect, we will prescribe default procedures to implement this subpart A. The default procedures will prescribe efficient funds transfer procedures consistent with State and Federal law and identify the covered Federal assistance programs and designated funding techniques. When we and a State reach agreement on some but not all Federal assistance programs administered by the State, we and the State may enter into a Treasury-State agreement for all programs on which we are in agreement and we may prescribe default procedures governing those programs on which we are unable to reach agreement.

        § 205.9   What is included in a Treasury-State agreement?

#### § § 205.9

        We will prescribe a uniform format for all Treasury-State agreements. A Treasury-State agreement must include, but is not limited to, the following:

        (a) State agencies, instrumentalities, and fiscal agents that administer the Federal assistance programs subject to this subpart A.

        (b) Federal assistance programs subject to this subpart A, consistent with §§ 205.3 and 205.4. A State must use its most recent Single Audit report as a basis for determining the funding thresholds for major Federal assistance programs, unless otherwise specified in the Treasury-State agreement. A State may use budget or appropriations data for a more recent period instead of Single Audit data, if specified in the Treasury-State agreement.

        (c) Funding techniques to be applied to Federal assistance programs subject to this subpart A.

        (d) Methods the State will use to develop and maintain clearance patterns and estimates, consistent with § 205.11. The method must include, at a minimum, a clear indication of:

        (1) The data used;

        (2) The sources of the data;

        (3) The development process;

        (4) For estimates, when and how the State will update the estimate to reflect the most recent data available;

        (5) For estimates, when and how the State will make adjustments, if any, to reconcile the difference between the estimate and the State's actual cash needs; and

        (6) Any assumptions, standards, or conventions used in converting the data into the clearance pattern or estimate.

        (e) Federal Program Agency provisions requiring reconciliation of estimates to actual outlays may be included in a Treasury-State agreement. The supporting documentation must be retained by the State for three years.

        (f) States must include the results of the clearance pattern process in the Treasury-State agreement for programs where the timing of drawdowns is based on clearance patterns. For programs where the timing of drawdowns is not based on clearance patterns, the results of the clearance pattern process may be provided with the annual report required under § 205.26. The supporting documentation must be retained by the State for three years.

        (g) Methods used by the State and Federal agencies to calculate interest liabilities pursuant to this subpart A. The method must include, but is not limited to, a clear indication of:

        (1) The data used;

        (2) The sources of the data;

        (3) The calculation process; and

        (4) Any assumptions, standards, or conventions used in converting the data into the interest liability amounts.

        (h) Treasury-State agreements must include language describing how a State and Federal Program Agency will address a State request for supplemental funding. This language must include, but is not limited to, the following provisions:

        (1) What constitutes a timely request for supplemental funds for Federal assistance program purposes by a State; and

        (2) What constitutes a timely transfer of supplemental funds for Federal assistance program purposes from a Federal Program Agency to a State.

        § 205.10   How do you document funding techniques?

#### § § 205.10

        The Treasury-State agreement must include a concise description for each funding technique that a State will use. The description must include the following:

        (a) What constitutes a timely request for funds;

        (b) How the State determines the amount of funds to request;

        (c) What procedures are used to project or reconcile estimates with actual and immediate cash needs;

        (d) What constitutes the timely receipt of funds; and

        (e) Whether a State or Federal interest liability accrues when the funding technique, including any associated procedure for projection or reconciliation, is properly applied.

        § 205.11   What requirements apply to funding techniques?

#### § § 205.11

        (a) A State and a Federal Program Agency must minimize the time elapsing between the transfer of funds from the United States Treasury and the State's payout of funds for Federal assistance program purposes, whether the transfer occurs before or after the payout of funds.

        (b) A State and a Federal Program Agency must limit the amount of funds transferred to the minimum required to meet a State's actual and immediate cash needs.

        (c) A State must not draw down funds from its account in the Unemployment Trust Fund (UTF) or from a Federal account in the UTF in advance of actual immediate cash needs for any purpose including maintaining a compensating balance.

        (d) A Federal Program Agency must allow a State to submit requests for funds daily. This requirement should not be construed as a change to Federal Program Agency guidelines defining a properly completed request for funds.

        (e) In accordance with the electronic funds transfer provisions of the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996 (31 U.S.C. 3332), a Federal Program Agency must use electronic funds transfer methods to transfer funds to States unless a waiver is available.

        § 205.12   What funding techniques may be used?

#### § § 205.12

        (a) We and a State may negotiate the use of mutually agreed upon funding techniques. We may deny interest liability if a State does not use a mutually agreed upon funding technique. Funding techniques should be efficient and minimize the exchange of interest between States and Federal agencies.

        (b) We and a State may base our agreement on the sample funding techniques listed in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(5) of this section, or any other technique upon which both parties agree.

        (1) Zero balance accounting means that a Federal Program Agency transfers the actual amount of Federal funds to a State that are paid out by the State each day.

        (2) Projected clearance means that a Federal Program Agency transfers to a State the projected amount of funds that the State pays out each day. The projected amount paid out each day is determined by applying a clearance pattern to the total amount the State will disburse.

        (3) Average clearance means that a Federal Program Agency, on the dollar-weighted average day of clearance of a disbursement, transfers to a State a lump sum equal to the actual amount of funds that the State is paying out. The dollar-weighted average day of clearance is the day when, on a cumulative basis, 50 percent of the funds have been paid out. The dollar-weighted average day of clearance is calculated from a clearance pattern, consistent with § 205.20.

        (4) Cash advance (pre-issuance or post-issuance) funding means that a Federal Program Agency transfers the actual amount of Federal funds to a State that will be paid out by the State, in a lump sum, not more than three business days prior to the day the State issues checks or initiates EFT payments.

        (5) Reimbursable funding means that a Federal Program Agency transfers Federal funds to a State after that State has already paid out the funds for Federal assistance program purposes.

        § 205.13   How do you determine when State or Federal interest liability accrues?

#### § § 205.13

        (a) State or Federal interest liability may or may not accrue when mutually agreed to funding techniques are applied, depending on the terms of the Treasury-State agreement.

        (b) We and a State may agree in a Treasury-State agreement that no State or Federal interest liability will accrue for indirect costs or indirect allocated costs based on an indirect cost rate. This indirect cost must be consistent with OMB Circular A-87 (For availability, see 5 CFR 1310.3.) and be in accordance with this subpart A. The indirect cost rate may be a Statewide indirect cost rate or a public assistance cost rate, where appropriate.

        § 205.14   When does Federal interest liability accrue?

#### § § 205.14

        (a) Federal interest liabilities may accrue in accordance with the following provisions:

        (1) The Federal Program Agency incurs interest liability if a State pays out its own funds for Federal assistance program purposes with valid obligational authority under Federal law, Federal regulation, or Federal-State agreement. A Federal interest liability will accrue from the day a State pays out its own funds for Federal assistance program purposes to the day Federal funds are credited to a State bank account.

        (2) If a State pays out its own funds for Federal assistance program purposes without obligational authority, the Federal Program Agency will incur an interest liability if obligational authority subsequently is established. However, if the lack of obligational authority is the result of the failure of the State to comply with a Federal Program Agency requirement established by statute, regulation, or agreement, interest liability may be denied. A Federal interest liability will accrue from the day a State pays out its own funds for Federal assistance program purposes to the day Federal funds are credited to a State bank account.

        (3) If a State pays out its own funds prior to the day a Federal Program Agency officially notifies the State in writing that a discretionary grant project is approved, the Federal Program Agency does not incur an interest liability, notwithstanding any other provision of this section.

        (4) If a State pays out its own funds prior to the availability of Federal funds authorized or appropriated for a future Federal fiscal year, the Federal Program Agency does not incur an interest liability, notwithstanding any other provision of this section.

        (5) If a State fails to request funds timely as set forth in § 205.29, or otherwise fails to apply a funding technique properly, we may deny any resulting Federal interest liability, notwithstanding any other provision of this section.

        (b) Federal Program Agency programs that have specific payment dates set by the Federal Program Agency that create interest liabilities are subject to this part.

        (c) States must adhere to Federal Program Agency disbursement schedules when requesting funds. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, we may deny a State's claim for Federal interest liability for the period prior to a late drawdown request. States must time their funds drawdown so that it does not create Federal interest liability. The drawdown request must allow the Federal Program Agency sufficient time to meet its disbursement schedule. If the Federal Program Agency does not make a timely payout in accordance with the terms of the Treasury-State agreement, a State may submit a claim for interest liability.

        § 205.15   When does State interest liability accrue?

#### § § 205.15

        (a)  State interest liability may accrue if Federal funds are received by a State prior to the day the State pays out the funds for Federal assistance program purposes. State interest liability accrues from the day Federal funds are credited to a State account to the day the State pays out the Federal funds for Federal assistance program purposes.

        (b)  (1) A State incurs interest liability on refunds of Federal funds from the day the refund is credited to a State account to the day the refund is either paid out for Federal assistance program purposes or credited to the Federal government.

        (2) We and a State may agree, in a Treasury-State agreement, that a State does not incur an interest liability on refunds in refund transactions under $50,000.

        (c)  A State does not incur an interest liability to the Federal government if a Federal statute requires the State to retain or use for Federal assistance program purposes the interest earned on Federal funds, notwithstanding any other provision in this section.

        (d)  In programs utilizing mandatory matching of Federal funds with State funds, a State must not arbitrarily assign its earliest costs to the Federal government. A State incurs interest liabilities if it draws Federal funds in advance and/or in excess of the required proportion of agreed upon levels of State contributions in programs utilizing mandatory matching of Federal funds with State funds.

        § 205.16   What special rules apply to Federal assistance programs and projects funded by the Federal Highway Trust Fund?

#### § § 205.16

        The following applies to Federal assistance programs and projects funded out of the Federal Highway Trust Fund, notwithstanding any other provision of this part:

        (a) A State must request funds at least weekly for current project costs, or Federal interest liability will not accrue prior to the day a State submits a request for funds.

        (b) If a State pays out its own funds in the absence of a project agreement or in excess of the Federal obligation in a project agreement, the Federal Program Agency will not incur an interest liability.

        § 205.17   Are funds transfers delayed by automated payment systems restrictions based on the size and timing of the drawdown request subject to this part?

#### § § 205.17

        Funds transfers delayed due to payment processes that automatically reject drawdown requests that fall outside a pre-determined set of parameters are subject to this part.

        § 205.18   Are administrative costs subject to this part?

#### § § 205.18

        (a) A State and Fiscal Service may agree, in a Treasury-State agreement, to the following funding conventions for indirect costs and administrative costs:

        (1) The State will draw down a prorated amount of administrative costs on the date of the State payday. For example, the State would draw one-third of its quarterly administrative costs if payroll is monthly, or one-sixth of its quarterly administrative costs if payroll is semi-monthly.

        (2) If an indirect cost rate is applied to a program, the State will include a proportionate share of the indirect cost allowance on each drawdown by applying the indirect cost rate to the appropriate direct costs on each drawdown.

        (3) If costs must be allocated to various programs pursuant to a labor distribution or other system under an approved cost allocation plan, the State will draw down funds to meet cash outlay requirements based on the most recent, certified cost allocations, with subsequent adjustments made pursuant to the actual allocation of costs.

        (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, no interest liabilities will be incurred or calculated for indirect costs and administrative costs, provided the funding conventions described in paragraph (a) of this section are properly applied.

        § 205.19   How is interest calculated?

#### § § 205.19

        (a) A State must calculate Federal interest liabilities and State interest liabilities for each Federal assistance program subject to this subpart A.

        (b) The interest rate for all interest liabilities for each Federal assistance program subject to this subpart A is the annualized rate equal to the average equivalent yields of 13-week Treasury Bills auctioned during a State's fiscal year. We provide this rate to each State.

        (c) A State must calculate and report interest liabilities on the basis of its fiscal year. A State must ensure that its interest calculations are auditable and retain a record of the calculations.

        (d) As set forth in § 205.9, a Treasury-State agreement must include the method a State uses to calculate and document interest liabilities.

        (e) A State may use actual data, a clearance pattern, or statistical sampling to calculate interest. A clearance pattern used to calculate interest must meet the standards of § 205.20. If a State uses statistical sampling to calculate interest, the State must sample transactions separately for each Federal assistance program subject to this subpart A. Each sample must be representative of the pool of transactions and be of sufficient size to accurately represent the flow of Federal funds under the Federal assistance program, including seasonal or other periodic variations.

        (f) For the first year in which a Federal assistance program is covered in a Treasury-State agreement, funds transfers that occur prior to the first day of the State's fiscal year must not be included in interest calculations and are not subject to the interest liability provisions of this part.

        § 205.20   What is a clearance pattern?

#### § § 205.20

        States use clearance patterns to project when funds are paid out, given a known dollar amount and a known date of disbursement. A State must ensure that clearance patterns meet the following standards:

        (a) A clearance pattern must be auditable.

        (b) A clearance pattern must accurately represent the flow of Federal funds under the Federal assistance programs to which it is applied.

        (c) A clearance pattern must include seasonal or other periodic variations in clearance activity.

        (d) A clearance pattern must be based on at least three consecutive months of disbursement data, unless additional data is required to accurately represent the flow of Federal funds.

        (e) If a State uses statistical sampling to develop a clearance pattern, the sample size must be sufficient to ensure a 96 percent confidence interval no more than plus or minus 0.25 weighted days above or below the estimated mean.

        (f) A clearance pattern must extend, at a minimum, until 99 percent of the dollars in a disbursement have been paid out for Federal assistance program purposes.

        (g) We and a State may agree to other procedures, such as estimates to project when funds are paid out when the dollar amount and/or the timing of disbursements are not known.

        § 205.21   When may clearance patterns be used?

#### § § 205.21

        (a) A State may develop a clearance pattern for:

        (1) An individual Federal assistance program;

        (2) A logical group of Federal assistance programs that have the same disbursement method and type of payee;

        (3) A bank account;

        (4) A specific type of payment, such as payroll or vendor payments; or

        (5) Anything that is agreed upon by us and a State. If a clearance pattern is used for multiple Federal assistance programs, a State must apply the clearance pattern separately to each Federal assistance program when scheduling funds transfers or calculating interest.

        (b) As set forth in § 205.9, a Treasury-State agreement must include the method a State uses to develop and maintain clearance patterns.

        § 205.22   How are accurate clearance patterns maintained?

#### § § 205.22

        (a) If a State has knowledge, at any time, that a clearance pattern no longer reflects a Federal assistance program's actual clearance activity, or if a Federal assistance program undergoes operational changes that may affect clearance activity, the State must notify us, develop a new clearance pattern, and certify that the new pattern corresponds to the Federal assistance program's clearance activity. Clearance patterns will remain in effect until a new clearance pattern is certified.

        (b) An authorized State official must certify that a clearance pattern corresponds to the clearance activity of the Federal assistance program to which it is applied. An authorized State official must re-certify the accuracy of a clearance pattern at least every five years. If a State develops a clearance pattern for a bank account or a specific type of payment, or on another basis, as set forth in § 205.21, we may prescribe other requirements for re-certifying the accuracy of the clearance pattern. A State can begin to use a new clearance pattern on the date the new clearance pattern is certified.

        § 205.23   What requirements apply to estimates?

#### § § 205.23

        The following requirements apply when we and a State negotiate a mutually agreed upon funds transfer procedure based on an estimate of the State's immediate cash needs:

        (a) The State must ensure that the estimate reasonably represents the flow of Federal funds under the Federal assistance program or program component to which the estimate applies. The estimate must take into account seasonal or other periodic variations in activity throughout the period for which the Federal funds are available.

        (b) As set forth in §§ 205.9 and 205.10, a Treasury-State agreement must include the method a State uses to develop, maintain, and document the estimate.

        § 205.24   How are accurate estimates maintained?

#### § § 205.24

        (a) If a State has knowledge that an estimate does not reasonably correspond to the State's cash needs for a Federal assistance program or program component, or if a Federal assistance program undergoes operational changes that may affect cash needs, the State must immediately notify us in writing. We and the State will amend the funding technique provisions in the Treasury-State agreement or take other mutually agreed upon corrective action.

        (b) When estimates are properly updated and applied, a State or Federal interest liability may or may not accrue, depending on the terms of the Treasury-State agreement.

        (c) We may require a State to justify in writing that it is not feasible to use a more efficient basis for determining the amount of funds to be transferred under the Federal assistance program or program component to which an estimate is applied. We may prescribe requirements for certifying the reasonableness of an estimate.

        § 205.25   How does this part apply to certain Federal assistance programs or funds?

#### § § 205.25

        (a) Special rules apply to certain Federal assistance programs or funds described in this section. To the extent the provisions of this section are inconsistent with other provisions of this part, this section applies.

        (b) A State's interest liability on funds withdrawn from its account in the UTF equals the actual interest earned on such funds less the related banking costs. Actual interest earned does not include non-cash bank earnings. If funds withdrawn from the State account in the UTF are commingled with other funds, a proportionate share of interest earnings and banking costs must be allocated to the funds withdrawn from the State account. Interest liabilities on funds withdrawn from a Federal account in the UTF, except the Federal Unemployment Account, are calculated in accordance with § 205.19.

        (c)  (1) Except as provided in 42 U.S.C. 1382e(d), the Federal government incurs an interest liability from the day State funds are credited to the Federal government's account to the day a Federal Program Agency pays out the State funds for Federal assistance program purposes. A State incurs an interest liability from the day a Federal Program Agency pays out Federal funds for Federal assistance program purposes to the day State funds are credited to the Federal government's account.

        (2) Interest liability must be calculated on the difference between a State's monthly Supplemental Security Income payment and the State's actual liability for the month.

        (3) The Federal government will not incur interest liabilities on refunds of State funds under the Supplemental Security Income Program.

        (4) Administrative fees charged by the Social Security Administration to States under the Supplemental Security Income program are not subject to this part.

        (5) Supplemental State payments made in conjunction with Supplemental Security Income are not subject to this part.

        (d)  (1) Funds collected by States from absent parents pursuant to Title IV-D of the Social Security Act are not subject to this part.

        (2) Interest earned by States on undistributed collections must be treated as Federal assistance program income under 45 CFR 304.50(b) and is not subject to this part.

        (3) Late payment fees collected by States from absent parents are not subject to interest liabilities under this part and are not subject to this part. However, such fees must be treated as Federal assistance program income in accordance with 45 CFR 302.75(b)(6).

        (e) A State that earns interest on Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants, and Children rebates is not subject to interest liability if the funds earned are used for Federal assistance program purposes.

        (f)  (1) This part applies to any transfer of funds from the Federal Program Agency to the State for the Revolving Loan Fund.

        (2) This part does not apply to interest a State earns on Revolving Loan Funds when Federal Program Agency regulations require that all interest earned on invested funds be used for Federal assistance program purposes.

        § 205.26   What are the requirements for preparing Annual Reports?

#### § § 205.26

        (a) A State must submit to us an Annual Report accounting for State and Federal interest liabilities of the State's most recently completed fiscal year. Adjustments to the Annual Report must be limited to the two State fiscal years prior to the State fiscal year covered by the report. The authorized State official must certify the accuracy of a State's Annual Report. A signed original of the Annual Report must be received by December 31 of the year in which the State's fiscal year ends. We will provide copies of Annual Reports to Federal agencies. We will prescribe the format of the Annual Report, and may prescribe that the Annual Report be submitted by electronic means.

        (b) A State must submit a description and supporting documentation for liability claims greater than $5,000. This information must include the following:

        (1) The amount of funds requested;

        (2) The date the funds were requested;

        (3) The date the funds were paid out for Federal assistance program purposes;

        (4) The date the funds were received by the State; and

        (5) The date of award.

        (c) A State claiming reimbursement of Interest Calculation Costs must submit its claim with its Annual Report in accordance with § 205.27. An authorized State official must certify the accuracy of a State's claim for Interest Calculation Costs.

        § 205.27   How are Interest Calculation Costs calculated?

#### § § 205.27

        (a) We will compensate a State annually for the costs of calculating interest, including the cost of developing and maintaining clearance patterns in support of interest calculations, pursuant to this subpart A, subject to the conditions and limitations of this section.

        (b) We may deny an interest calculation cost claim if a State does not:

        (1) Have a Treasury-State agreement with us, as set forth in §§ 205.6 through 205.9;

        (2) Submit timely a Treasury-State agreement, as set forth in §§ 205.6 through 205.9;

        (3) Submit timely an updated list of Federal assistance programs subject to this subpart A, as set forth in §§ 205.6 through 205.9;

        (4) Submit timely a claim for Interest Calculation Costs with its Annual Report, as set forth in § 205.26; or

        (5) Submit timely its Annual Report, as set forth in § 205.26.

        (c) A State must maintain documentation to substantiate its claim for Interest Calculation Costs. We may require a State to provide documentation to support its interest calculation cost claims. We will review all interest calculation cost claims for reasonableness. If we determine that a cost claim is unreasonable, we will not reimburse a State for that cost, notwithstanding any other provision of this section.

        (d)  (1) Interest Calculation Costs do not include expenses for normal disbursing services, such as processing checks or maintaining records for accounting and reconciliation of cash accounts, or expenses for upgrading or modernizing accounting systems.

        (2) Interest Calculation Costs in excess of $50,000 in any year are not eligible for reimbursement, unless a State can justify to us that the State is unable to develop and maintain clearance patterns in support of interest calculations, or perform the actual calculation of interest, without incurring such costs. Supporting documentation must accompany State requests for reimbursement in excess of $50,000.

        (3) Interest Calculation Costs that a State incurs in fiscal years prior to its most recently completed Annual Report are not eligible for reimbursement.

        (4) A State must not include Interest Calculation Costs in its Statewide cost allocation plan, as defined and provided for in OMB Circular A-87. All costs incurred by a State to implement this subpart A, other than Interest Calculation Costs, are subject to the procedures and principles of OMB Circular A-87.

        (e) The payments from the Federal government to individual States to offset Interest Calculation Costs incurred are funded from the aggregate interest payments States make to the Federal government. The following limitations apply:

        (1) We will not reduce or adjust interest liabilities for Federal assistance programs funded out of trust funds for which the Secretary is trustee. These programs include, but are not limited to, Unemployment Insurance Trust Fund (CFDA 17.225); Highway & Planning Trust Fund (CFDA 20.205); Airport Improvement Trust Fund (CFDA 20.106); Federal Transit Capital Improvement Trust Fund (CFDA 20.500); Federal Transit Capital & Operating Assistance Trust Fund (CFDA 20.507); and Social Security—Disability Insurance Trust Fund (CFDA 96.001); and

        (2) The aggregate payments from the Federal government to States to offset Interest Calculation Costs will not be greater than the aggregate interest payments States make to the Federal government.

        § 205.28   How are interest payments exchanged?

#### § § 205.28

        (a) We offset the adjusted total State interest liability and the adjusted total Federal interest liability for each State to determine the net interest payable to or from each specific State. The payment of net interest and any Interest Calculation Costs, as set forth in § 205.27, for the most recently completed fiscal year must occur no later than March 31. We will notify a State of the final net interest liability. A State must submit a claim to receive payment.

        (b) A State may appeal a decision by us on interest liabilities and interest calculation cost claims in accordance with § 205.31.

        (c) If a State appeals the amount of interest payable in accordance with the provisions of § 205.31, payment must occur by March 31 for any portions not subject to the appeal.

        (d) The Federal government will not be liable for interest on any payment of interest to a State.

        § 205.29   What are the State oversight and compliance responsibilities?

#### § § 205.29

        (a) A State must designate an official representative with the statutory or administrative authority to coordinate all interaction with the Federal government concerning this subpart A, and must notify us in writing of the representative's name and title. A State must notify us immediately of any change in the official representative.

        (b) A State must maintain records supporting interest calculations, clearance patterns, Interest Calculation Costs, and other functions directly pertinent to the implementation and administration of this subpart A for audit purposes. A State must retain the records for each fiscal year for three years from the date the State submits its Annual Report, or until any pending dispute or action involving the records and documents is completed, whichever is later. We, the Comptroller General, and the Inspector General or other representative of a Federal Program Agency must have the right of access to, and may require submission of, all records for the purpose of verifying interest calculations, clearance patterns, interest calculation cost claims, and the State's accounting for Federal funds.

        (c) A State's implementation of this subpart A is subject to audit in accordance with 31 U.S.C. Chapter 75, “Requirements for Single Audits.”

        (d) If a State repeatedly or deliberately fails to request funds in accordance with the procedures established for its funding techniques, as set forth in § 205.11, § 205.12, or a Treasury-State agreement, we may deny the State payment or credit for the resulting Federal interest liability, notwithstanding any other provision of this part.

        (e) If a State materially fails to comply with this subpart A, we may, in addition to the action described in paragraph (d) of this section, take one or more of the following actions, as appropriate under the circumstances:

        (1) Deny the reimbursement of all or a part of the State's interest calculation cost claim;

        (2) Send notification of the non-compliance to the affected Federal Program Agency for appropriate action, including, where appropriate, a determination regarding the impact of non-compliance on program funding;

        (3) Request a Federal Program Agency or the General Accounting Office to conduct an audit of the State to determine interest owed to the Federal government, and to implement procedures to recover such interest;

        (4) Initiate a debt collection process to recover claims owed to the United States; or

        (5) Take other remedies legally available.

        § 205.30   What are the Federal oversight and compliance responsibilities?

#### § § 205.30

        (a) A Federal Program Agency must designate an official representative to coordinate all interaction with us and the States concerning this subpart A, and must notify us in writing of the representative's name and title. A Federal Program Agency must notify us immediately of any change in the official representative.

        (b) A Federal Program Agency's implementation of this subpart A is subject to review pursuant to procedural instructions that we issue.

        (c) We will consult with Federal agencies as necessary and appropriate before entering into or amending a Treasury-State agreement.

        (d) We will distribute Annual Reports to Federal agencies, as set forth in § 205.26. Upon our request, a Federal Program Agency must review a State's Annual Report for reasonableness and must report its findings to us within 30 days.

        (e) A Federal Program Agency must notify us in writing if the program agency has knowledge, at any time, that:

        (1) A State's clearance pattern does not correspond to a Federal assistance program's clearance activity; or

        (2) Corrective action needs to be taken by a State, us, or another Federal Program Agency, with respect to the implementation of this subpart. We will notify the State or Federal Program Agency as appropriate in writing with a description of the Federal Program Agency's assertion.

        (f) A Federal Program Agency must notify us in writing of new Federal assistance programs listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance.

        (g) If a Federal Program Agency causes an interest liability by failing to comply with this subpart A, we may collect a charge from the Federal Program Agency. A Federal interest liability resulting from circumstances beyond the control of a Federal Program Agency does not constitute noncompliance. We will determine the charge using the following procedures:

        (1) We will issue a Notice of Assessment to the Federal Program Agency, indicating the nature of the noncompliance, the amount of the charge, the manner in which it was calculated, and the right to file an appeal.

        (2) To the maximum extent practicable, a Federal Program Agency must pay a charge for noncompliance out of appropriations available for the Federal Program Agency's operations and not from the Federal Program Agency's program funds.

        (3) If a Federal Program Agency does not pay a charge for noncompliance within 45 days after receiving a Notice of Assessment, we will debit the appropriate Federal Program Agency account.

        (4) In the event a Federal Program Agency appeals a charge imposed under the Notice of Assessment, we will defer the charge until we decide the appeal. If we deny the appeal, the effective date of the charge may be retroactive to the date indicated in the Notice of Assessment.

        § 205.31   How does a State or Federal Program Agency appeal a determination made by us and resolve disputes?

#### § § 205.31

        (a) This section documents the procedures for:

        (1) A State to appeal the net interest charge that we have assessed;

        (2) A State to appeal a determination we have made regarding the State's claim for Interest Calculation Costs in accordance with § 205.27;

        (3) A Federal Program Agency to appeal a charge for noncompliance that we have assessed in accordance with § 205.30; or

        (4) A State or a Federal Program Agency to resolve other disputes with us or between or among each other concerning the implementation of this subpart A.

        (b) A State or Federal Program Agency must submit a written petition (Petition) to the Assistant Commissioner, Federal Finance, Bureau of the Fiscal Service, (Assistant Commissioner), within 90 days of the date of the notice of assessment or the event that initiated the appeal or dispute. The Petition must include a concise factual statement, not to exceed 15 pages, with supporting documentation in the appendices, of the conditions forming the basis of the Petition and the action requested of the Assistant Commissioner. In the case of a dispute, the party submitting the petition to us must concurrently provide a copy of the petition to the other concerned parties. The other concerned parties may submit to the Assistant Commissioner a rebuttal within 90 days of the date of the petition. The rebuttal must include a concise factual statement, not to exceed 15 pages, with supporting documentation in the appendices.

        (c) The Assistant Commissioner will review the Petition, any rebuttal, and all supporting documentation. As part of the review process, the Assistant Commissioner may request to meet with any or all parties and may request additional information.

        (d) The Assistant Commissioner will issue a written decision within the later of 120 days of the date of the Petition or the rebuttal, in case of a dispute, or 120 days from receipt of any additional information. The Assistant Commissioner's decision will be the final program agency action on our part for purposes of judicial review procedures under the Administrative Procedures Act, 5 U.S.C. 701-706 (APA), unless either the State or Federal Program Agency invokes the provisions of the Administrative Dispute Resolution Act of 1990 (ADRA), 5 U.S.C. 581-593.

        (e) Either a State or Federal Program Agency may seek to invoke the provisions of the ADRA within 45 days after the date of the Assistant Commissioner's written decision.

        (1) The party invoking the ADRA must notify the Assistant Commissioner and any other concerned parties in writing. If all parties, including the Assistant Commissioner, agree in writing, a neutral party appointed under the provisions of the ADRA may assist in resolving the dispute through the use of alternate means of dispute resolution as defined in the ADRA.

        (2) If the party invoking the ADRA is unable to reach a satisfactory resolution, the Assistant Commissioner's decision will be the final agency action on our part for purposes of the judicial review procedures under the APA.

        (f) Any amount due as a result of an appeal or dispute must be paid within 30 days of the date of the decision of the Assistant Commissioner or the date of the resolution under the ADRA. If a State fails to pay, the State will be subject to collection techniques under 31 U.S.C. 3701  including accrual of interest on outstanding balances and administrative offset.

For example, on the first day payments were issued, multiply the percentage of dollars paid out on that day by zero, since zero days have elapsed. On the day after payments were issued, multiply the percentage of dollars paid out on that day by one, since one day has elapsed; and so forth.

**Source:** Source: 59 FR 4538, Jan. 31, 1994, unless otherwise noted.

      § 206.1   Scope and application.

#### § § 206.1

      (a) This subpart applies to all Government departments and agencies in the executive branch (except the Tennessee Valley Authority) and all monies collected and disbursed by these departments and agencies. This subpart does not apply to interagency transfers of funds, except that agencies are to use the Treasury's On-Line Payment and Collection (OPAC) system for interagency payments between executive agencies, when cost-effective.

      (b) Policies and guidelines are prescribed for promoting efficient, effective cash management through improved billing, collection, deposit, and payment of funds. These objectives seek to improve funds availability and the efficiency and effectiveness with which funds are transferred.

      (c) Authority to implement this regulation has been delegated within the Department of the Treasury (hereinafter, “Treasury”) to the Commissioner (hereinafter, “the Commissioner”) of the Bureau of the Fiscal Service (hereinafter, “the Service).” The Service maintains the final authority as granted under the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984 to specify use of a particular method or mechanism of collection and deposit and to recover costs that result from noncompliance. Authority is also granted to the Service, under the Cash Management Improvement Act of 1990, as amended by the Cash Management Improvement Act Amendments of 1992, to provide for the timely disbursement of funds. An agency will require the collection or disbursement of funds by the agency via EFT as a provision of new contractual agreements or renewal of existing contracts that impact agency collection or payment mechanisms.

      § 206.2   Definitions.

#### § § 206.2

      For the purpose of this part, the following definitions apply:

      means any department, instrumentality, office, commission, board, service, Government corporation, or other establishment in the executive branch, except the Tennessee Valley Authority.

      means any of a variety of means by which the Government places a demand for payment against an entity that is indebted to the Government. The term encompasses invoices, notices, initial demand letters, and other forms of notification.

      means practices and techniques designed to accelerate and control collections, ensure prompt deposit of receipts, improve control over disbursement methods, and eliminate idle cash balances. “Cash Management Review Process” means periodic examinations of collection and disbursement cash flows to ensure that the most effective mechanisms are used to process the funds.

      means any one of a number of tools or systems by which monies are transferred to the Government from a source outside the Government.

      means a time predesignated by a financial institution beyond which transactions presented or actions requested will be considered the next banking day's business.

      means a calendar day unless otherwise specified.

      means as a noun, money that is being or has been presented for credit to the Treasury. _Deposit_s can be made by an agency or directly by the remitter. All such transfers are effected through a Federal Reserve Bank or other financial institution. As a verb, deposit means the act of presenting monies for credit to the Treasury by an official of an agency.

      means a bank or other financial institution that has been authorized by the Treasury to receive monies for credit to the Treasury.

      means the initiation of an Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) transaction or other methods of drawing funds from accounts maintained by the Government.

      means any transfer of funds, other than a transaction originated by cash, check or similar paper instrument, that is initiated through an electronic terminal, telephone, computer, or magnetic tape, for the purpose of ordering, instructing, or authorizing a financial institution to debit or credit an account. The term includes, but is not limited to, Fed Wire transfers, Automated Clearing House (ACH) transfers, transfers made at automatic teller machines (ATM) and Point-of-Sale (POS) terminals (to include use of the Government small purchase card), and other means of credit card transactions.

      means the Cash Management Improvements _Fund_.

      (or “receipts”) means EFT transactions, currency, negotiable instruments, and/or demand deposits owed to or collected by an agency.

      means a deposit made before the cutoff time on the day following the day on which the funds were received by an agency. For example, if an agency receives funds for deposit at 3 p.m. on Monday and transmits the deposits to the depositary by 2 p.m. on Tuesday (the depositary's next cutoff time), then next-day deposit requirements are met.

      means a sum of money transferred to a recipient in satisfaction of an obligation. A payment includes any Federal Government benefit or nonbenefit payment.

      (1) A benefit payment is a disbursement for a Federal Government entitlement program or annuity. Benefit payments may be one-time or recurring payments including, but not limited to, payments for Social Security, Supplemental Security Income, Black Lung, Civil Service Retirement, Railroad Retirement Board Retirement/Annuity, Department of Veterans Affairs Compensation/Pension, Central Intelligence Agency Annuity, Military Retirement Annuity, Coast Guard Retirement, and Worker's Compensation.

      (2) A nonbenefit payment is a Federal Government disbursement other than a benefit payment. Nonbenefit payments may be one-time or recurring payments including, but not limited to, payments for vendors, Internal Revenue Service tax refunds, Federal salaries and allotments therefrom, grants, travel disbursements and reimbursements, loans, principal and/or interest related to U.S. savings bonds, notes, and other savings-type securities, and payments of service fees to organizations qualified to issue and/or redeem savings bonds.

      means that agencies will presume that new payment recipients will elect EFT as the means of payment delivery. Enrollment forms for use in establishing routine payments will be designed with this approach in mind, to obtain the required written consent of the recipient.

      means a person, corporation, or other public or private entity receiving benefit or nonbenefit payments from the Government.

      means a deposit made before the cutoff time on the day on which the funds were received by an agency. For example, if an agency receives funds for deposit at 10 a.m. on Monday and transmits the deposits by 2 p.m. on Monday (the depositary's cutoff time), then a same-day deposit has been achieved.

Volume I, Chapter 6-8000 (I TFM 6-8000) contains agency cash management procedures to be followed pertaining to these regulations.

      § 206.3   Billing policy and procedures.

#### § § 206.3

      The billing process is considered an integral part of an effective cash management collection program. In those situations where bills are required and the failure to bill would affect the cash flow, bills will be prepared and transmitted within 5 business days after goods have been shipped or released, services have been rendered, or payment is otherwise due. An agency may prepare and transmit bills later than the 5-day timeframe if it can demonstrate that it is cost-effective to do so. In addition, the bill must include the terms and dates of payments, and late payment provisions, if applicable. Terms and dates of payments will be consistent with industry practices. I TFM 6-8000 describes detailed billing policies, procedures, and industry standards for agencies.

      § 206.4   Collection and payment mechanisms.

#### § § 206.4

      (a) All funds are to be collected and disbursed by EFT when cost-effective, practicable, and consistent with current statutory authority.

      (b) Collections and payments will be made by EFT when cost- effective, practicable, and consistent with current statutory authority. When consistent with these criteria, specific cash flows will utilize EFT as follows:

      (1)  EFT will be adopted as the presumed method of collecting fees and fines, especially when these collection cash flows are recurring or of large dollar amounts.

      (2)  EFT will be adopted as the primary method for collecting taxes. EFT mechanisms may include ACH credit or debit cards.

      (3)  Presumed EFT will be adopted as the method for paying employees, and entrance enrollment forms for establishing regular payments will be designed to use this approach.

      (4)  Each department and agency will exercise its authority under the Federal Acquisition Regulation to require that all contractors are paid by EFT, unless a determination is made that it is not in the best interest of the Federal Government to do so. EFT will be adopted as the standard method of payment for all Federal program payments originated by agencies or their agents.

      (5)  EFT will be presented to new beneficiaries as the presumed method for receiving benefits. EFT payment methods, such as Electronic Benefit Transfer, will be adopted and implemented to make EFT accessible to all benefit recipients.

      (c)(1) Selection of the best collection and payment mechanism is a joint responsibility of an agency and the Service. An agency has responsibility for conducting cash management reviews; gathering volume and dollar data relative to the operation of the systems; and funding any implementation and operational costs above those normally funded by Treasury. The Service is the required approval authority when an agency desires to convert from one collection mechanism to another. The Service's written approval is required prior to an agency entering into new contractual agreements or renewing existing contracts for agency collections or payments systems. Agencies will follow guidelines for the cost-effective usage of collection and payment mechanisms, published in the TFM, Volume I, Part 6-8000, in their selection and recommendation to the Service of an appropriate funds transfer mechanism. The agency will provide the Service with a recommended mechanism for any new or modified cash flows. The Service will review the recommendations, approve a mechanism, and assist with implementation.

      (2) If an agency proposes a collection or payment mechanism other than EFT, it may be required to provide a cost-benefit analysis to justify its use. Cost/benefit analyses must include, at a minimum, known or estimated agency personnel costs, costs of procurement, recurring operational costs, equipment and system implementation and maintenance costs, costs to payment recipients, and costs to remitters. Agencies should consult with Treasury to determine the need to include interest costs associated with float in their computations of benefits and costs.

      (d) An agency will require the collection of funds by the agency to be made via EFT and the disbursement of funds by the agency to be made via EFT as a provision of new contractual agreements or renewal of existing contracts that impact agency collection or payment mechanisms, when cost-effective, practicable, and consistent with current statutory authority.

      § 206.5   Collection and deposit procedure exceptions.

#### § § 206.5

      (a) The following collection and deposit timeframe requirements are to be followed in exception cases where EFT mechanisms are not utilized:

      (1) An agency will achieve same-day deposit of monies. Where same day deposit is not cost-effective or is impracticable, next day deposit of monies must be achieved except in those cases covered by I TFM 6-8000.

      (2) Deposits will be made at a time of the day prior to the depositary's specified cutoff time, but as late as possible in order to maximize daily deposit amounts.

      (3) When cost-beneficial to the Government, an agency may make multiple deposits.

      (b) Any additional exceptions to the above policies are listed in I TFM 6-8000.

      § 206.6   Cash management planning and review.

#### § § 206.6

      (a) An agency shall periodically perform cash management reviews to identify areas needing improvement.

      (b) As part of its cash management review process, an agency is expected to document cash flows in order to provide an overview of its cash management activities and to identify areas that will yield savings after cash management initiatives are implemented. The Service will evaluate an agency's EFT policy and application, to include mitigating circumstances that may prevent the use of EFT, as part of the cash management reviews.

      (c) An agency's cash management reviews will provide the basis for identification of improvements and preparation of cash flow reports for submission to the Service as prescribed by I TFM 6-8000. That Chapter provides requirements for an agency in performing periodic cash management reviews, identifying improvements, and preparing cash flow reports. In addition, the Chapter describes the timing and content of periodic reports that must be submitted by an agency to the Service on progress made in implementing cash management initiatives and associated savings.

      (d) The Service will periodically review an agency's cash management program to ensure that adequate progress is being made to improve overall cash management at an agency. As part of its oversight authority, the Service may visit an agency and review all or specific cash management activities of an agency. An agency will be notified in advance of the Service's review and will be required to provide the Service with documentation of the agency cash management review within the timeframes required by I TFM 6-8000.

      § 206.7   Compliance.

#### § § 206.7

      (a) The Service will monitor agency cash management performance. Part of the monitoring process will include establishing implementation end dates for conversion to, or expansion of, EFT mechanisms, as well as the identification of mitigating circumstances that may prevent the use of EFT.

      (b) In cases where an agency fails to meet a scheduled date within its control, or where an agency converts to a less cost-effective transfer mechanism without prior, written Service approval as determined in accordance with § 206.4(c), the Service will send a formal Notice of Deficiency to an agency's designated cash management official. A separate Notice will be sent for each initiative.

      (1)  For collections cash flows, the Notice of Deficiency will include the nature of the deficiency, the amount of the proposed charge, the method of calculation, the right to file an appeal, and the date the charge will be imposed in the absence of an appeal. The amount of the charge will be equal to the cost of such noncompliance to the Treasury's General Fund.

      (2)  [Reserved]

      § 206.8   Appeals.

#### § § 206.8

      (a) An agency that chooses to file an appeal must submit the appeal in writing to the Commissioner within 45 days of the date of the Notice of Deficiency. In the event of an appeal, the charge imposed under Notice of Deficiency will be deferred pending the results of the appeal. If an appeal is not submitted (, received by the Commissioner) within 45 days, the amount indicated in the Notice of Deficiency will be charged per § 206.9(a).

      (b) The appeal will contain the elements and follow the submission procedures specified in I TFM 6-8000. The appeal will include the background leading to the Notice of Deficiency, the basis of the appeal, and the action requested by an agency. An agency should state its disagreements with the Notice of Deficiency which may include cost-benefit factors, the amount of the charge, and other items.

      (c) An agency must state what action it requests in its appeal. An agency may request that the Notice of Deficiency be completely overturned for cost-benefit or other considerations. Alternatively, an agency may request a reduced charge, deferral of the charge, an alternative solution to cash management improvement, or a combination of these actions.

      (d)  The Commissioner will refer the appeal to an _Appeals Board._ The Appeals Board will consist of three members—two permanent members and one temporary member. The permanent members will be the Deputy Chief Financial Officer, Department of the Treasury, and the Assistant Commissioner, Federal Finance, of the Service. The temporary board member will be a cash management official from an agency other than the agency appealing the Notice of Deficiency. The Board will be convened on an as-needed basis. The order of agency assignment to the Board will be published by Treasury in Volume I, Chapter 6-8000 of the TFM. The Deputy Chief Financial Officer, Department of the Treasury, the Assistant Commissioner, Federal Finance, and the designated agency cash management official may delegate their responsibility to a staff subordinate having sufficient experience in cash management matters. The Assistant Commissioner's designee may be from any area other than that which issued the Notice of Deficiency.

      (e)  The Appeals Board will review the Notice of Deficiency, any additional information submitted by the Service, and the written appeal from an agency. Based on this review, the Board may decide additional investigation is required. The Board may request an agency and/or the Service to meet with the Board as part of the review process.

      (f)  A written majority decision will be rendered by the Appeals Board within 30 days of receipt of the appeal. The Board may extend this period for an additional period, not to exceed 30 days, if required. The Appeals Board will notify the Commissioner and the agency of the decision. The decision of the Board whether to uphold the Notice of Deficiency, to overturn the Notice of Deficiency, or to mandate some other action will be stated in the finding. Other action mandated may include a reduced charge, a deferral of the charge, an alternate solution to cash management improvement, or a combination of these actions. The basis of the decision, the amount of the charge, and the effective date of the charge will be stated in the finding. The effective date of the charge may be retroactive to the date indicated in the Notice of Deficiency.

      (g) Any terms related to charge deferral shall be stated; the Service and an agency will be required to submit evidence of compliance to such terms at a future specified date. At this future time, the Appeals Board will review the evidence of compliance. Based on this evidence, the Board will decide whether to impose a charge.

      § 206.9   Charges.

#### § § 206.9

      (a) Within 30 days of the effective date of the charge or the appeals decision, an agency must submit appropriate accounting information to the Service's Assistant Commissioner, Federal Finance. The charge will be calculated following procedures outlined in I TFM 6-8000, and will be assessed for each month that noncompliance continues.

      (b)  In the case of cash management collection noncompliance, an agency will absorb the charge from amounts appropriated or otherwise made available to carry out the program to which the collections relate. Charges collected from an executive agency in the case of cash management collection noncompliance will be deposited in the Cash Management Improvements Fund as outlined in § 206.10.

      (c)  [Reserved]

      (d) If an agency does not voluntarily pay the charge assessed under § 206.9(a), the Service will debit the appropriate account automatically. By failing to pay voluntarily the charges as required by the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984, an agency will be deemed to authorize the automatic debit to its account.

      (e) The Commissioner will formally terminate the charge when the Commissioner has determined that an agency has complied. In addition, on an annual basis, the Commissioner will review an agency's performance and calculation of the charge, and will notify an agency in writing of any changes to the amount being charged.

      § 206.10   Operation of and payments from the Cash Management Improvements Fund.

#### § § 206.10

      (a) The Cash Management Improvements Fund (Fund) will be operated as a revolving fund by the Service. Charges assessed under § 206.9(a) for cash management collection noncompliance will be deposited into the Fund according to the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984. The Service will also disburse any payments from the Fund based on projects selected by a project selection and approval committee.

      (b)  The committee will consist of three members—two permanent members and one temporary member. The permanent members will be the Commissioner and the Assistant Commissioner, Federal Finance, of the Service. The temporary committee member will be a cash management official from an agency other than an agency being considered for funds. The order of agency assignment to the Committee will be published in a TFM Bulletin, when funds are first deposited to the Fund. Decisions of the project selection and approval committee cannot be appealed. Agencies will be notified of any available amounts in the Fund and requirements to apply for such monies through a TFM bulletin.

      (c) As provided by 31 U.S.C. 3720, sums in the Fund will be available without fiscal year limitation for the payment of expenses incurred in developing improved methods of collection and deposit and the expenses incurred in carrying out collections and deposits using such methods, including the costs of personal services and the costs of the lease or purchase of equipment and operating facilities.

      (d) In addition to all reports required by law and regulation, for each fiscal year during which there is a balance in Fund, the Service will prepare and publish, by the 60th day following the close of the fiscal year, a full report on payments, receipts, disbursements, balances of the Fund, and full disclosure on projects financed by the Fund.

      § 208.4   Waivers.

#### § § 208.4

      (a) Payment by electronic funds transfer is not required in the following cases:

      (1) Where an individual:

      (i) Was born prior to May 1, 1921, and was receiving payment by check on March 1, 2013;

      (ii) Receives a type of payment for which Treasury does not offer delivery to a Treasury-sponsored account. In such cases, those payments are not required to be made by electronic funds transfer, unless and until such payments become eligible for deposit to a Treasury-sponsored account. However, if Treasury provides an agency with an option to begin delivering a type of Federal benefit payment to a Treasury-sponsored account, the agency must file a waiver request with Treasury to make Federal benefit payments of that type by any means other than by electronic funds transfer;

      (iii) Is ineligible for a Treasury-sponsored account because of suspension or cancellation of the individual's Treasury-sponsored account by the Financial Agent;

      (iv) Has filed a waiver request with Treasury certifying that payment by electronic funds transfer would impose a hardship because of the individual's inability to manage an account at a financial institution or a Treasury-sponsored account due to a mental impairment, and Treasury has not rejected the request; or

      (v) Has filed a waiver request with Treasury certifying that payment by electronic funds transfer would impose a hardship because of the individual's inability to manage an account at a financial institution or a Treasury-sponsored account due to the individual living in a remote geographic location lacking the infrastructure to support electronic financial transactions, and Treasury has not rejected the request;

      (2) Where the political, financial, or communications infrastructure in a foreign country does not support payment by electronic funds transfer;

      (3) Where the payment is in a foreign currency and Treasury does not support electronic payment in that currency.

      (4) Where the payment is to a recipient within an area designated by the President or an authorized agency administrator as a disaster area. This waiver is limited to payments made within 120 days after the disaster is declared. An agency must file a waiver request with Treasury (which must be approved by Treasury) to extend this waiver beyond 120 days after the disaster is declared.

      (5) Where either:

      (i) A military operation is designated by the Secretary of Defense in which uniformed services undertake military actions against an enemy; or

      (ii) A call or order to, or retention on, active duty of members of the uniformed services is made during a war or national emergency declared by the President or Congress;

      (6) Where a threat may be posed to national security, the life or physical safety of any individual may be endangered, or a law enforcement action may be compromised;

      (7) Where the agency does not expect to make multiple payments to the same recipient within a one-year period on a regular, recurring basis but only if the payments are made to an individual or a small business concern where “small business concern” has the meaning given the term in section 3 of the Small Business Act at 15 U.S.C. 632 and its implementing regulations; and

      (8) Where an agency's need for goods and services is of such unusual and compelling urgency that the Government would be seriously injured unless payment is made by a method other than electronic funds transfer; or, where there is only one source for goods or services and the Government would be seriously injured unless payment is made by a method other than electronic funds transfer. An agency must file a waiver request with Treasury (which must be approved by Treasury) to utilize this waiver.

      (b) An individual who requests a waiver under paragraphs (a)(1)(iv) and (v) or an agency who requests a waiver under paragraphs (a)(1)(ii), (a)(4), or (a)(8) of this section shall provide, in writing, to Treasury a certification supporting that request, in such form that Treasury may prescribe. The individual shall attest to the certification before a notary public, or otherwise file the certification in such form that Treasury may prescribe. Treasury reserves the right to reject any waiver request it receives.

      (c) If application of an agency's waiver, together with any waiver request previously granted under paragraphs (a)(1)(ii), (a)(4), or (a)(8), would, in Treasury's determination, lead to the agency initiating an unusually large number or proportion of payments by means other than electronic funds transfer, Treasury reserves the right to nullify the waiver in this class of cases and require the agency to work with Treasury to identify and implement ways to make the payments by electronic funds transfer.

      § 208.5   Accounts for disbursement of Federal payments.

#### § § 208.5

      Treasury may designate a Financial Agent to establish and administer Treasury-sponsored accounts for individuals for the disbursement of Federal payments, including benefit, retirement, salary, miscellaneous, vendor, expense reimbursement and tax payments. Such accounts may be established upon terms and conditions that the Secretary considers appropriate or necessary and shall be made available at a reasonable cost and with the same consumer protections provided to other account holders at the financial institution. Treasury may deliver payments to such accounts and the maintenance of accounts and the provision of account-related services under this section shall constitute reasonable duties of a Financial Agent of the United States.

      § 208.6   Availability of Treasury-sponsored accounts.

#### § § 208.6

      An individual who receives a Federal payment shall be eligible to open a Treasury-sponsored account under terms and conditions established by Treasury.

      § 208.7   Agency responsibilities.

#### § § 208.7

      (a) An agency shall put into place procedures that allow recipients to provide the information necessary for the delivery of payments to the recipient by electronic funds transfer to an account at the recipient's financial institution or a Treasury-sponsored account.

      (b) Upon request from Treasury, an agency shall provide Treasury with a list of the employer identification numbers (EINs) assigned to the agency that the agency has used to make or receive a Federal intragovernmental payment during the 12- month period preceding the request from Treasury as well as a list of the EINs for all Federal agencies to whom the agency has made a Federal intragovernmental payment during the same 12-month period.

> [89 FR 12960, Feb. 21, 2024]

      § 208.8   Recipient responsibilities.

#### § § 208.8

      Each recipient who is required to receive payment by electronic funds transfer shall provide the information necessary to effect payment by electronic funds transfer. For recipients who do not designate a bank account for the receipt of payments, Treasury may disburse payments to a Treasury-sponsored account or to an account to which the recipient is receiving other Federal payments.

      § 208.9   Compliance.

#### § § 208.9

      (a) Treasury will monitor agencies' compliance with this part. Treasury may require agencies to provide information about their progress in converting payments to electronic funds transfer.

      (b) If an agency fails to make payment by electronic funds transfer as prescribed under this part, Treasury will consider that payment to be not timely pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3335, as electronic funds transfer payments are processed, disbursed, and settled more quickly than checks and, accordingly, Treasury may assess a charge to the agency pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3335.

> [85 FR 25291, May 1, 2020, as amended at 89 FR 12960, Feb. 21, 2024]

      § 208.10   Reservation of rights.

#### § § 208.10

      The Secretary reserves the right, in the Secretary's discretion, to waive any provision(s) of this part in any case or class of cases.

      § 208.11   Accounts for disaster victims.

#### § § 208.11

      Treasury may establish and administer accounts at any financial institution designated as a Financial Agent for disaster victims in order to allow for the delivery by electronic funds transfer of one or more Federal payments. Such accounts may be established upon terms and conditions that the Secretary considers appropriate or necessary in light of the circumstances. Treasury may deliver payments to these accounts notwithstanding any other payment instructions from the recipient and without regard to the requirements of §§ 208.4 and 208.7 and § 210.5 of this chapter. For purposes of this section, “disaster victim” means an individual or entity located within an emergency area, or an individual or entity that has relocated or been displaced from an emergency area as a result of a major disaster or emergency. “Emergency area” means a geographical area in which there exists an emergency or disaster declared by the President pursuant to the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 ) or the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5121 ). The maintenance of accounts and the provision of account-related services under this section shall constitute reasonable duties of a Financial Agent of the United States.

        (2) Unless authorized in writing, or similarly authenticated, by an agency, no person or entity shall initiate or transmit a debit entry to that agency, other than a reversal of a credit entry previously sent to the agency.

        (b)  By executing an authorization for an agency to initiate entries, a recipient agrees:

        (1) To the provisions of this part;

        (2) To provide accurate information;

        (3) To verify the recipient's identity to the satisfaction of the RDFI or agency, whichever has accepted the authorization;

        (a)  An agency may receive ACH debit or credit entries only with the prior written authorization of the Service.

        (b)  An agency will be liable to the recipient for any loss sustained by the recipient as a result of the agency's failure to originate a credit or debit entry in accordance with this part. The agency's liability shall be limited to the amount of the entry(ies).

        (c)  An agency will be liable to an Originator or an ODFI for any loss sustained by the originator or ODFI as a result of the agency's failure to credit an ACH entry to the agency's account in accordance with this part. The agency's liability shall be limited to the amount of the entry(ies).

        (d)  Except as otherwise provided in this part, an agency will be liable to an RDFI for losses sustained in processing duplicate or erroneous credit and debit entries originated by the agency. An agency's liability shall be limited to the amount of the entry(ies), and shall be reduced by the amount of the loss resulting from the failure of the RDFI to exercise due diligence and follow standard commercial practices in processing the entry(ies). This section does not apply to credits received by an RDFI after the death or legal incapacity of a recipient of benefit payments or the death of a beneficiary as governed by subpart B of this part. An agency shall not be liable to any ACH association.

        (e)  The final crediting of the amount of an entry to a recipient's account shall constitute full acquittance of the Federal Government.

        (f)  An agency may reverse any duplicate or erroneous entry, and the Federal Government may reverse any duplicate or erroneous file. In initiating a reversal, an agency shall certify to the Service that the reversal complies with applicable law related to the recovery of the underlying payment. An agency that reverses an entry shall indemnify the RDFI as provided in the applicable ACH Rules, but the agency's liability shall be limited to the amount of the entry. If the Federal Government reverses a file, the Federal Government shall indemnify the RDFI as provided in the applicable ACH Rules, but the extent of such liability shall be limited to the amount of the entries comprising the duplicate or erroneous file. Reversals under this section shall comply with the time limitations set forth in the applicable ACH Rules.

        (g)  An agency may originate a Point-of-Purchase (POP) entry using a check drawn on a consumer or business account and presented at a point-of-purchase. The requirements of the applicable ACH Rules, incorporated by reference, see § 210.3(b), shall be met for such an entry if the Receiver presents the check at a location where the agency has posted the notice required by the ACH Rules and has provided the Receiver with a copy of the notice.

        (h)  An agency that has authority to collect returned item service fees may do so by originating a Return Fee Entry if the agency provides notice to the Receiver in accordance with the ACH Rules.

        (a)  Each Federal Reserve Bank serves as Fiscal Agent of the Treasury in carrying out its duties as the Federal Government's ACH Operator under this part. As Fiscal Agent, each Federal Reserve Bank shall be responsible only to the Treasury and not to any other party for any loss resulting from the Federal Reserve Bank's action, notwithstanding Section 11.5 and Article 8 of the ACH Rules. Each Federal Reserve Bank may issue operating circulars not inconsistent with this part which shall be binding on financial institutions.

        (b)  All routing numbers issued by a Federal Reserve Bank to an agency require the prior approval of the Service.

        § 210.8   Financial institutions.

#### § § 210.8

        (a)  The origination or receipt of an entry subject to this part does not render a financial institution a Treasury depositary. A financial institution shall not advertise itself as a Treasury depositary on such basis.

        (b)  Notwithstanding ACH Rules Subsections 2.4.5, 2.8.4, 4.3.5, 2.9.2, 3.2.2, and 3.13.3, if the Federal Government sustains a loss as a result of a financial institution's failure to handle an entry in accordance with this part, the financial institution shall be liable to the Federal Government for the loss, up to the amount of the entry, except as otherwise provided in this section. A financial institution shall not be liable to any third party for any loss or damage resulting directly or indirectly from an agency's error or omission in originating an entry. Nothing in this section shall affect any obligation or liability of a financial institution under Regulation E, 12 CFR part 1005, or the Electronic Funds Transfer Act, 12 U.S.C. 1693

        (c)  The final crediting of the correct amount of an entry received and processed by the Federal Reserve Bank and posted to the TGA shall constitute full acquittance of the ODFI and the originator for the amount of the entry. Full acquittance shall not occur if the entries do not balance, are incomplete, are incorrect, or are incapable of being processed. In the case of funds collected by an agency through origination of a debit entry, full acquittance shall not occur until the underlying payment becomes final.

        (d)  If an RDFI becomes aware that an agency has originated an ACH credit entry to an account that is not owned by the payee whose name appears in the ACH payment information, the RDFI shall promptly notify the agency. An RDFI that originates a Notification of Change (NOC) entry with the correct account and/or Routing and Transit Number information, or returns the original ACH credit entry to the agency with an appropriate return reason code, shall be deemed to have satisfied this requirement.

      Subpart B—Reclamation of Benefit Payments

        § 210.9   Parties to the reclamation.

#### § § 210.9

        (a)  An RDFI's acceptance of a benefit payment pursuant to this part shall constitute its agreement to this subpart. By accepting a benefit payment subject to this part, the RDFI authorizes the debiting of the Federal Reserve Bank account utilized by the RDFI in accordance with the provisions of § 210.10(e).

        (b)  In processing reclamations pursuant to this subpart, the Service shall act pursuant to the direction of the agency that certified the benefit payment(s) being reclaimed.

        § 210.10   RDFI liability.

#### § § 210.10

        (a)  An RDFI shall be liable to the Federal Government for the total amount of all benefit payments received after the death or legal incapacity of a recipient or the death of a beneficiary unless the RDFI has the right to limit its liability under § 210.11 of this part. An RDFI shall return any benefit payments received after the RDFI becomes aware of the death or legal incapacity of a recipient or the death of a beneficiary, regardless of the manner in which the RDFI discovers such information. If the RDFI learns of the death or legal incapacity of a recipient or death of a beneficiary from a source other than notice from the agency issuing payments to the recipient, the RDFI shall immediately notify the agency of the death or incapacity. The proper use of the R15 or R14 return reason code shall be deemed to constitute such notice.

        (b)  Actual or constructive knowledge, when used in reference to an RDFI's or agency's knowledge of the death or incapacity of a recipient or death of a beneficiary, means that the RDFI or agency received information, by whatever means, of the death or incapacity and has had a reasonable opportunity to act on such information or that the RDFI or agency would have learned of the death or incapacity if it had followed commercially reasonable business practices. For purposes of this subpart, an agency is presumed to have constructive knowledge of death or incapacity at the time it stops certifying recurring payments to a recipient if the agency:

        (1) Does not re-initiate payments to the recipient; and

        (2) Subsequently initiates a reclamation for one or more payments made to the recipient.

        (c)  An RDFI shall not be liable for post-death benefit payments sent to a recipient acting as a representative payee or fiduciary on behalf of a beneficiary, if the beneficiary was deceased at the time the authorization was executed and the RDFI did not have actual or constructive knowledge of the death of the beneficiary.

        (d)  An agency that initiates a request for a reclamation must do so within 120 calendar days after the date that the agency first has actual or constructive knowledge of the death or legal incapacity of a recipient or the death of a beneficiary. An agency may not reclaim any post-death or post-incapacity payment made more than six years prior to the date of the notice of reclamation; provided, however, that if the account balance at the time the RDFI receives the notice of reclamation exceeds the total amount of post-death or post-incapacity payments made by the agency during such six-year period, this limitation shall not apply and the RDFI shall be liable for the total amount of all post-death or post-incapacity payments made, up to the amount in the account at the time the RDFI receives the notice of reclamation and has had a reasonable opportunity to act on the notice (not to exceed one business day).

        (e)  If an RDFI does not return the full amount of the outstanding total or any other amount for which the RDFI is liable under this subpart in a timely manner, the Federal Government will collect the amount outstanding by instructing the appropriate Federal Reserve Bank to debit the account utilized by the RDFI. The Federal Reserve Bank will provide advice of the debit to the RDFI.

        § 210.11   Limited liability.

#### § § 210.11

        (a)  If an RDFI does not have actual or constructive knowledge of the death or legal incapacity of a recipient or the death of a beneficiary at the time it receives one or more benefit payments on behalf of the recipient, the RDFI's liability to the agency for those payments shall be limited to:

        (1) An amount equal to:

        (i) The amount in the account at the time the RDFI receives the notice of reclamation and has had a reasonable opportunity (not to exceed one business day) to act on the notice, plus any additional benefit payments made to the account by the agency before the RDFI responds in full to the notice of reclamation, or

        (ii) The outstanding total, whichever is less; plus

        (2) If the agency is unable to collect the entire outstanding total, an additional amount equal to:

        (i) The benefit payments received by the RDFI from the agency within 45 days after the death or legal incapacity of the recipient or death of the beneficiary, or

        (ii) The balance of the outstanding total, whichever is less.

        (b)  In order to limit its liability as provided in this section, an RDFI shall:

        (1) Certify that at the time the benefit payments were credited to or withdrawn from the account, the RDFI had no actual or constructive knowledge of the death or legal incapacity of the recipient or death of the beneficiary;

        (2) Certify the date the RDFI first had actual or constructive knowledge of the death or legal incapacity of the recipient or death of the beneficiary, regardless of how and where such information was obtained;

        (3)(i) Provide the name, last known address and phone number, as shown on the RDFI's records, of the following person(s):

        (A) The recipient and any co-owner(s) of the recipient's account;

        (B) All other person(s) authorized to withdraw funds from the recipient's account; and

        (C) All person(s) who withdrew funds from the recipient's account after the death or legal incapacity of the recipient or death of the beneficiary.

        (ii) If persons are not identified for any of these subcategories, the RDFI must certify that no such information is available and why no such information is available; and

        (4) Fully and accurately complete all certifications on the notice of reclamation and comply with the requirements of this part.

        (c)  If the RDFI qualifies for limited liability under this subpart, it shall immediately return to the Federal Government the amount specified in § 210.11(a)(1). The agency will then attempt to collect the amount of the outstanding total not returned by the RDFI. If the agency is unable to collect that amount, the Federal Government will instruct the appropriate Federal Reserve Bank to debit the account utilized by the RDFI at that Federal Reserve Bank for the amount specified in § 210.11(a)(2).

        (d)  An RDFI that fails to comply with any provision of this subpart in a timely and accurate manner, including but not limited to the certification requirements at § 210.11(b) and the notice requirements at § 210.13, shall be liable to the Federal Government for any loss resulting from its act or omission. Any such liability shall be in addition to the amount(s) for which the RDFI is liable under § 210.10 or § 210.11, as applicable.

> [64 FR 17487, Apr. 9, 1999, as amended at 69 FR 13189, Mar. 19, 2004; 76 FR 59031, Sept. 23, 2011]

        § 210.12   RDFI's rights of recovery.

#### § § 210.12

        (a)  This subpart does not authorize or direct an RDFI to debit or otherwise affect the account of a recipient. Nothing in this subpart shall be construed to affect the right an RDFI has under state law or the RDFI's contract with a recipient to recover any amount from the recipient's account.

        (b)  The liability of the RDFI under this subpart is not affected by actions taken by the RDFI to recover any portion of the outstanding total from any party.

        § 210.13   Notice to account owners.

#### § § 210.13

        Upon receipt by an RDFI of a notice of reclamation, the RDFI immediately shall mail to the last known address of the account owner(s) or otherwise provide to the account owner(s) a copy of any notice required by the Service to be provided to account owners as specified in the Green Book. Proof that this notice was sent may be required by the Service.

        § 210.14   Erroneous death information.

#### § § 210.14

        (a)  If, after the RDFI responds fully to the notice of reclamation, the RDFI learns that the recipient or beneficiary is not dead or legally incapacitated or that the date of death is incorrect, the RDFI shall inform the agency that certified the underlying payment(s) and directed the Service to reclaim the funds in dispute.

        (b)  The agency that certified the underlying payment(s) and directed the Service to reclaim the funds will attempt to resolve the dispute with the RDFI in a timely manner. If the agency determines that the reclamation was improper, in whole or in part, the agency shall notify the RDFI and shall return the amount of the improperly reclaimed funds to the RDFI. Upon certification by the agency of an improper reclamation, the Service may instruct the appropriate Federal Reserve Bank to credit the account utilized by the RDFI at the Federal Reserve Bank in the amount of the improperly reclaimed funds.

      (f)  The financial institution shall perform the account review separately for each account in the name of an account holder against whom a garnishment order has been issued.

      § 212.6   Rules and procedures to protect benefits.

#### § § 212.6

      The following provisions apply if an account review shows that a benefit agency deposited a benefit payment into an account during the lookback period.

      (a)  The financial institution shall immediately calculate and establish the protected amount for an account. The financial institution shall ensure that the account holder has full and customary access to the protected amount, which the financial institution shall not freeze in response to the garnishment order. An account holder shall have no requirement to assert any right of garnishment exemption prior to accessing the protected amount in the account.

      (b)  The financial institution shall calculate and establish the protected amount separately for each account in the name of an account holder, consistent with the requirements in § 212.5(f) to conduct distinct account reviews.

      (c)  A protected amount calculated and established by a financial institution pursuant to this section shall be conclusively considered to be exempt from garnishment under law.

      (e)  The financial institution shall issue a notice to the account holder named in the garnishment order, in accordance with § 212.7.

      (f)  The financial institution shall perform the account review only one time upon the first service of a given garnishment order. The financial institution shall not repeat the account review or take any other action related to the order if the same order is subsequently served again upon the financial institution. If the financial institution is subsequently served a new or different garnishment order against the same account holder, the financial institution shall perform a separate and new account review.

      (g)  The financial institution shall not continually garnish amounts deposited or credited to the account following the date of account review, and shall take no action to freeze any funds subsequently deposited or credited, unless the institution is served with a new or different garnishment order, consistent with the requirements of this part.

      (h)  The financial institution may not charge or collect a garnishment fee against a protected amount. The financial institution may charge or collect a garnishment fee up to five business days after the account review if funds other than a benefit payment are deposited to the account within this period, provided that the fee may not exceed the amount of the non-benefit deposited funds.

      § 223.9   Determination of financial condition and other required information.

#### § § 223.9

      In determining the financial condition of every company applying for a certificate of authority or renewal of a certificate of authority under this part, Treasury will generally compute the company's assets and liabilities in accordance with paragraphs (a) through (f) of this section, provided that Treasury may exercise discretion in valuing the assets and liabilities of such companies. While paragraphs (a) through (f) specify how Treasury will value certain classes of assets and liabilities and the analysis that Treasury will perform, they are not intended to be an exhaustive list of all assets and liabilities that Treasury may require to be reported and may evaluate as part of this analysis. Additionally, Treasury will annually publish supplemental guidance on the financial analysis performed by Treasury, including applicable ratios and acceptable ranges for ratios.

      (a) —(1)  The cash capital and other funds included in the financial statement must be safely invested in accordance with the laws of the state in which the company is incorporated. Admissible assets must be reported in U.S. Dollars and are generally limited to investments in cash, cash equivalents, short term investments, mortgage loans (within certain limits), and real property necessary for the conduct of a company's business. In cases where an investment (other than U.S. Government securities and securities of affiliates or subsidiaries) exceeds 10 percent of the total admitted assets, Treasury may require additional supporting documentation as needed on a case-by-case basis in order for the asset to be admissible. Additionally, Treasury considers normal account balances (such as, but not limited to, investment income due and accrued, agents' balances and premiums receivables, reinsurance recoverables on paid losses, and funds held by or deposited with ceding reinsuring companies) to be admissible provided they meet Treasury's standards. In order to be admissible, normal account balances may be evaluated for transactional substance, quality, and liquidity. Some assets that may be admissible under codification and/or certain state permitted practices may require supporting documentation as needed on a case-by-case basis in order to be admissible under Treasury's criteria. _Assets_ resulting from reinsurance transactions must meet the credit for reinsurance standards listed under paragraph (c) of this section.

      (2)  Bonds, unaffiliated common stocks, and unaffiliated preferred stocks must be valued and reported in accordance with the NAIC's Accounting Practices and Procedures Manual (as updated or amended from time to time) and the NAIC Securities Valuation Office (SVO). Those with an investment grade designation will be admissible and those with a non-investment grade designation will be considered on a case-by-case basis.

      (i)  The value of all other securities should be valued as of December 31 and reported in U.S. Dollars. For securities that do not have a SVO designation or have a SVO non-investment grade designation and are significant for Treasury purposes, Treasury may consider, if it deems appropriate, other relevant data (e.g., prospectus, marketability/liquidity information, internal investment strategies/philosophies) and perform an analysis to determine whether the securities meet Treasury's criteria for admissibility.

      (ii)  Investments in subsidiaries, controlled entities, and affiliated entities must be reported in accordance with the NAIC Accounting Practices and Procedures Manual (as updated or amended from time to time).

      (A)  Companies owning securities of other insurance companies, which are under the same direction and control as the reporting company, must furnish copies of the NAIC File Upload of the subsidiaries. The assets of these subsidiaries will be analyzed according to the criteria set forth in this section.

      (B)  Companies owning securities of non-insurance companies, which are under the same direction and control as the reporting company, must furnish copies of independently audited financial statements of such companies as of the reporting date.

      (3)  Only real estate essential to the operating needs of the company for conducting its business, and conventional first mortgage loans on unencumbered, improved, or productive real estate located within the United States, are admissible. These must be reported in accordance with the NAIC's Accounting Practices and Procedures Manual (as updated or amended from time to time). The real estate and mortgaged property must be supported by an appraisal report that includes the information and computations normally used in arriving at a competent appraised value. In instances where the aggregate values exceed 20 percent of the policyholders' surplus, Treasury may, if it deems appropriate, require additional supporting documentation.

      (b)  Companies transacting surety bail business must submit a schedule showing bail premiums in force, bail liability, and the amount of any associated unearned premium reserve.

      (c)  (1) Companies are required to submit Treasury Schedule F (Treasury Form No. TFS 6314) reflecting information in the company's annual statements. Credit for reinsurance may be taken (to the extent specified in the referenced provisions of § 223.12) for reinsurance in all classes of risk provided that it is ceded to the following companies:

      (i) Companies holding a current certificate of authority from Treasury;

      (ii) U.S. domiciled non-Treasury certified or recognized parents, subsidiaries, and/or affiliates if Treasury determines that the parent, subsidiary, and/or affiliate is financially solvent;

      (iii) Admitted reinsurers as defined under § 223.12(h);

      (iv) Complementary reinsurers as defined under § 223.12(i);

      (v) Alien reinsurers as defined under § 223.12(j), up to the extent credit is allowed for reinsurance ceded to the alien reinsurer by the ceding company's state of domicile (subject to paragraph (c)(3) of this section); and

      (vi) An instrumentality or agency of the United States that is permitted by Federal law or regulation to execute reinsurance contracts.

      (2) Treasury may give credit for reinsurance not covered in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, to the extent of funds withheld or letters of credit or trust agreements from such reinsurers, provided the company advises Treasury and provides sufficient documentation of the amount of funds held, letters of credit posted or funds secured in trust for each company. Treasury may also give credit for trust account assets associated with multi-beneficiary trust agreements established and maintained in the United States by overseas accredited or trusteed reinsurers listed online at  to the extent the relevant ceded business is covered by these trust account assets.

      (3) If, after its review of the financial documentation submitted by an alien reinsurer recognized pursuant to § 223.12(j) and of the financial documentation submitted by the ceding company, Treasury determines that either company may be unable to carry out its obligations, Treasury may require additional collateral for the ceding company to receive credit for reinsurance to the extent credit is given for reinsurance ceded to the alien reinsurer by the ceding company's state of domicile.

      (d)  Treasury uses RBC in determining the financial solvency of companies, together with such companies' overall financial results, ratios, and trends. Companies must maintain RBC results that fall within acceptable ranges as established by the NAIC or provide a satisfactory explanation for results that do not.

      (e)  Treasury uses the NAIC IRIS ratios to measure companies' solvency, profitability, and liquidity. Companies must maintain results for these ratios that fall within acceptable ranges as established by the NAIC or provide a satisfactory explanation for results that do not.

      (f)  Treasury analyzes financial results from annual and quarterly financial statements required under this part for evidence of negative financial results or trends. Treasury may require companies to submit additional documentation or explanation regarding financial statements with evidence of negative financial results or trends such as decreasing policyholders' surplus, large underwriting losses, negative cashflows, or unsatisfactory IRIS ratio results.

      (g)  Noncompliance with paragraphs (a) through (f) of this section may result in Treasury denying a company's application for its certificate of authority, or renewal of its certificate, or in Treasury revoking a company's certificate.

      § 223.10   Limitation of risk.

#### § § 223.10

      (a) Except as provided in § 223.11, no company holding a certificate of authority shall underwrite any _single risk_ on any bond or policy on behalf of any individual, firm, association, or corporation, whether or not the United States is interested as a party thereto, the amount of which is greater than 10 percent of the paid-up capital and surplus of such company, as determined by Treasury. Such figure ( 10 percent of a company's paid-up capital and surplus as determined by Treasury) is hereinafter referred to as the underwriting limitation. For purposes of this part,  means the total risk under one bond or policy regardless of the number of individual risks under that bond or policy.

      (b) In determining the underwriting limitation, the full penalty of any surety and fidelity obligation will be regarded as the liability, and no offset will be allowed on account of any estimate of risk that is less than such full penalty, except in the following cases:

      (1) Appeal bonds; in which case the liability will be regarded as the amount of the judgment appealed from, plus 10 percent of said amount to cover interest and costs;

      (2) Bonds of executors, administrators, trustees, guardians, and other fiduciaries, where the penalty of the bond or other obligation is fixed in excess of the estimated value of the estate; in which cases the estimated value of the estate, upon which the penalty of the bond was fixed, will be regarded as the liability;

      (3) Indemnifying agreements executed by sole heirs or beneficiaries of an estate releasing the surety from liability;

      (4) Contract bonds given in excess of the amount of the contract; in which cases the amount of the contract will be regarded as the liability; or

      (5) Bonds for banks or trust companies as principals, conditioned to repay moneys on deposit, whereby pursuant to any law or decree of a court, the amount to be deposited shall be less than the penalty of the bond; in which cases the maximum amount on deposit at any one time will be regarded as the liability.

      § 223.11   Limitation of risk: Protective methods.

#### § § 223.11

      In the case of risks otherwise in excess of a company's limitation of risk prescribed in § 223.10, compliance may be achieved by the following methods:

      (a)  Two or more companies holding a certificate of authority may underwrite a single risk on any bond or policy, the amount of which does not exceed their aggregate underwriting limitations. Each company must limit its liability upon the face of the bond or policy to an amount which must be within its respective underwriting limitation.

      (b) —(1)  (i) With respect to all bonds running to the United States to the extent that its excess liability is not addressed through another protective method specified in this section, a company writing such bonds must reinsure liability in excess of the underwriting limitation with one or more companies holding a certificate of authority from Treasury within 45 days from the date of execution and delivery of the bond. Such reinsurance shall not be in excess of the underwriting limitation of the reinsuring company. Federal agencies may accept a bond from the direct writing company in satisfaction of the total bond requirement even though it may exceed the direct writing company's underwriting limitation. Within the 45-day period, the direct writing company shall furnish to the Federal agency any requested reinsurance agreements. However, a Federal agency may, in its discretion, require that the direct writing company obtain reinsurance within a lesser period than 45 days, and may require the direct writing company to provide completely executed reinsurance agreements before making a final determination that any bond is acceptable.

      (ii) For bonds required to be furnished to the United States by the Miller Act (40 U.S.C. 3131, as amended), in addition to complying with the requirements of paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, the direct writing company must execute the following reinsurance agreement forms: Standard Form 273 (Reinsurance Agreement for a Bonds Statute Performance Bond), Standard Form 274 (Reinsurance Agreement for a Bonds Statute Payment Bond), and Standard Form 275 (Reinsurance Agreement in Favor of the United States). These forms are available on the General Services Administration website at

      (2)  A company holding a certificate of authority from Treasury writing risks covered by bonds or policies not running to the United States, to the extent that its excess liability is not addressed through another protective method specified in this section, must reinsure liability in excess of its underwriting limitation within 45 days from the date of execution and delivery of the bond or policy with any of:

      (i) One or more companies holding a certificate of authority from Treasury;

      (ii) One or more companies recognized as a reinsurer in accordance with § 223.12, except for any reinsurer who is required by a U.S. state to post 100 percent collateral;

      (iii) A pool, association, etc., to the extent that it is composed of such companies; or

      (iv) An instrumentality or agency of the United States that is permitted by Federal law or regulation to execute reinsurance contracts.

      (3)  No certificate-holding company may cede to a reinsuring company recognized under § 223.12 any single risk in excess of 10 percent of the latter company's paid-up capital and surplus.

      (c)  With respect to all risks other than bonds required to be furnished to the United States by the Miller Act (40 U.S.C. 3131, as amended), which must be either coinsured or reinsured in accordance with paragraph (a) or (b)(1)(ii) of this section respectively, the excess liability may be protected:

      (1) By the deposit with the company in pledge, or by conveyance to it in trust for its protection, of assets admitted by Treasury, the current market value of which is at least equal to the liability in excess of its underwriting limitation. Treasury may, on a case-by-case basis, consider a letter of credit provided by a financial institution to be adequate security under this paragraph (c) if Treasury can verify that the assets referenced in the letter of credit are pledged exclusively to secure the excess risk, and if the letter of credit meets other requirements Treasury might prescribe. Assets used to protect excess liability pursuant to this paragraph (c) cannot also be used to obtain credit for reinsurance pursuant to § 223.9(c).; or

      (2) If such obligation was incurred on behalf of or on account of a fiduciary holding property in a trust capacity, by a joint control agreement providing that the whole or a sufficient portion of the property so held may not be disposed of or pledged in any way without the consent of the insuring company.

If Treasury shall take any exceptions to the financial statements submitted by a company or other information pertinent to the company's financial solvency, before issuing Department Circular 570, Treasury shall give a company due notice of such exceptions. Copies of the Circular are available at  or from the Surety Bonds Program, upon request. Bonds underwritten by certified companies on the Department Circular No. 570 list may be presented to an agency bond-approving official for acceptance. Selection of a particular qualified company from among all companies holding certificates of authority is discretionary with the principal required to furnish the bond, but the acceptance of a bond by an agency bond-approving official is subject to § 223.17.

      § 223.17   Acceptance and non-acceptance of bonds.

#### § § 223.17

      (a)  A bond underwritten by a certified company on the § 223.16 Department Circular No. 570 list may be presented to any agency-bond approving official for acceptance, and such agency bond-approving official may accept such bonds.

      (b)  (1) An agency bond-approving official may decline to accept bonds underwritten by a certified company for cause, but only if the company has been given advance written notice by such agency. The advance written notice shall:

      (i) State the intention of the agency to decline bonds underwritten by the company;

      (ii) State the reasons for or cause of the proposed declination of such bonds;

      (iii) Provide the company with an opportunity to rebut the stated reasons or cause; and

      (iv) Provide the company with an opportunity to cure the stated reasons or cause.

      (2) The agency may decline to accept bonds underwritten by the company if, after consideration of any submission by the company or failure of the company to respond to the agency's notice, the agency issues a written determination that the bonds should not be accepted, consistent with agency authorities.

      (3) The agency shall articulate its procedures and for cause standards for declining to accept bonds in an agency regulation prior to declining any bonds in specific cases. The agency regulation should be subject to notice and comment rulemaking. “For cause” includes, but is not limited to, circumstances when a surety has not paid or satisfied an administratively final bond obligation due the agency. The agency regulation should define when a bond obligation becomes administratively final under the agency's procedures. Existing agency rules or regulations that substantially comply with, or that are consistent with, the requirement to articulate procedures and standards in advance meet the requirements of this paragraph.

      (4) Agencies that decline bonds under this section are encouraged to use best efforts to ensure that persons conducting business with the agency are aware that bonds underwritten by the particular certified company will not be accepted.

      (5) The agency's authority to decline bonds under this section does not apply:

      (i) When the underlying obligation or other for cause reason that forms the basis for the agency's written determination to decline bonds under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, or the agency written determination to decline bonds, has been stayed or enjoined by a court of competent jurisdiction, or

      (ii) To otherwise acceptable payment and performance contract bonds, when the agency has already accepted a project bid bond on a contract before making the written determination under paragraph (b)(2) of this section.

      (6) Notwithstanding any provision of this section, an agency bond-approving official may decline a bond from a Treasury-certified surety without advance notice if the bond is not executed in proper form, or is not in the correct penal sum amount, or is otherwise technically deficient on its face.

      § 223.18   Revocation.

#### § § 223.18

      (a) Treasury may initiate a revocation proceeding against a Treasury-certified company in one of two ways:

      (1) Treasury, of its own accord, under § 223.19, may initiate revocation proceedings against the company when it has reason to believe that the company is not complying with 31 U.S.C. 9304-9308 and/or the regulations under this part; or

      (2) Treasury, under § 223.20, may initiate revocation proceedings against the company upon receipt of a complaint from an agency that the company has not paid or satisfied one or more administratively final bond obligations due the agency.

      (b) A revocation of a company's certificate of authority under § 223.19 or § 223.20 precludes the company from underwriting or reinsuring additional bonds for any agency, and therefore revokes the company's opportunity to have its bonds presented to any agency bond-approving official for acceptance.

#### § § 223.19

      Whenever Treasury has reason to believe that a company is not complying with the requirements of 31 U.S.C. 9304-9308 and/or the regulations under this part, including but not limited to a failure to satisfy corporate and financial standards, Treasury shall:

      (a) Notify the company of the facts or conduct which indicate such non-compliance, and provide the company an opportunity to respond, and

      (b) Revoke a company's certificate of authority after providing notice to the company if:

      (1) The company does not respond satisfactorily to Treasury's notification of non-compliance, or

      (2) The company responded, was provided an opportunity to demonstrate or achieve compliance, and failed to do so.

      § 223.20   Revocation proceedings initiated by Treasury upon receipt of an agency complaint.

#### § § 223.20

      (a)  If an agency determines that a company has not promptly made full payment or fully satisfied one or more bond obligations naming the agency as obligee, the head of the agency, or his or her designee, may submit a written complaint to the designated Treasury official (with executive oversight over the Treasury surety program, at the Assistant Commissioner level or equivalent), requesting that the company's certificate of authority be revoked for nonperformance. Under such complaint, the agency shall certify that:

      (1) The bond obligations that are the subject of the complaint are administratively final under the agency's regulations or other authorities;

      (2) The company has not paid or satisfied those bond obligations; and

      (3) The company's obligation to pay or satisfy the bond obligations has not been stayed or enjoined by a court of competent jurisdiction.

      (b)  The agency shall include in its complaint copies of the bonds, and documentation indicating that, for each such bond provided:

      (1) The agency has determined, consistent with agency authorities, the principal is in default on the obligation covered by the bond. Alternatively, if the default has been litigated, documentation indicating a court of competent jurisdiction has determined the principal is in default;

      (2) The agency made a written demand with the company on the bond requesting payment or satisfaction on its own behalf, consistent with agency authorities, or on behalf of laborers, materialmen, or suppliers (on payment bonds), based on the default status of the principal;

      (3) The agency afforded the company the opportunity to request administrative review within the agency contesting the agency's demand on the bond;

      (4) The agency made a final administrative determination that the bond obligation was due after the completion of such administrative review, or after the time period for the company to request administrative review within the agency has expired;

      (5) The agency provided the company the opportunity to enter into a written agreement to pay or satisfy the bond; and

      (6) The company has not made full payment or fully satisfied the demand, and the claim on the bond is past due.

      (c)  On receipt of a complaint meeting the requirements of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, Treasury will notify the company of the agency complaint. The notice will require the company to submit a written explanatory response to Treasury within 20 business days of the date of the notice. The notice will advise the company of the facts and conduct referenced in the complaint. Treasury will attach a copy of the incoming complaint to the notice. The notice will afford the company the opportunity to address the complaint and demonstrate its qualifications to retain its certificate of authority.

      (d)  The designated Treasury official (with executive oversight over the Treasury surety program, at the Assistant Commissioner level or equivalent) will appoint a Treasury Reviewing Official to conduct a review of the agency complaint referenced in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, and the company response referenced in paragraph (c) of this section, to determine whether revocation of the company's certificate of authority is warranted. To ensure appropriate consideration of relevant factual or legal issues, the Reviewing Official is authorized to require the submission of additional documentation from the complaining agency and the company. Upon completion of such review, the Reviewing Official shall prepare a written Recommendation Memorandum addressed to the designated Treasury official setting forth findings and a recommended disposition. The designated Treasury official will be the Deciding Official who will make the final decision whether the company's certificate of authority to write and reinsure bonds should be revoked based on the administrative record. The administrative record consists of the agency complaint referenced in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, the company response referenced in paragraph (c) of this section, any other documentation submitted to, or considered by, the Reviewing Official, and the Reviewing Official's Recommendation Memorandum.

      (e)  (1) If the Deciding Official's final decision is that revocation is not warranted, the company and the agency will be notified of the basis of this decision and the complaint against the company will be dismissed.

      (2) If the Deciding Official's final decision is that the company's certificate of authority shall be revoked, the Deciding Official will notify the company and the agency of the revocation decision and the basis for such decision. Except as provided in paragraph (g) of this section, the notice will afford the company an opportunity to cure its noncompliance by paying or satisfying the bonds (including payment of any interest, penalties, and fees) forming the basis of the final decision within 20 business days. If the company cures its noncompliance within 20 business days, the complaint against the company will be deemed moot and the company will retain its certificate of authority to write Federal bonds. If the company does not cure its noncompliance within 20 business days, the company's certificate of authority shall be revoked by Treasury without further notice.

      (f)  In reviewing whether the revocation of the company's certificate of authority is warranted under this section, the Reviewing Official will recommend, and the Deciding Official will determine, whether the default is clear and whether the company's failure to pay or satisfy the bonds is based on inadequate grounds.

      (g)  The company is not entitled to an opportunity to cure its noncompliance if its conduct in failing to carry out its contracts is willful. For purposes of this regulation, “willful” means a careless or reckless disregard of a known legal obligation to satisfy an administratively final bond obligation. In considering whether a company's conduct is willful, the Deciding Official may consider whether:

      (1) An agency has filed a prior complaint with Treasury requesting that the company's certificate be revoked for a substantially similar bond obligation;

      (2) The company asserted substantially similar defenses to such bond obligation;

      (3) Such defenses were considered by the agency under pertinent authorities and dismissed;

      (4) Treasury made a final decision that revocation of the company's certificate was justified; and

      (5) Other pertinent factors.

      (h)  (1) If a company that is the subject of a complaint under paragraph (a) and (b) of this section believes the opportunity to make known its views, as provided for under paragraph (c) of this section, is inadequate, it may, within 20 business days of the date of the notice required by paragraph (c), request, in writing, that an informal hearing be convened.

      (2) As soon as possible after a written request for an informal hearing is received, the Reviewing Official shall convene an informal hearing, at such time and place as he or she deems appropriate, for the purpose of determining whether the company's certificate of authority should be revoked.

      (3) The company shall be advised, in writing, of the time and place of the informal hearing and shall be directed to bring all documents, records and other information as it may find necessary and relevant to support its position.

      (4) The company may be represented by counsel and shall have a fair opportunity to present any relevant material and to examine the administrative record.

      (5) The complaining agency may be requested by the Reviewing Official to send a representative to the hearing to present any relevant material, and the agency representative may examine the administrative record.

      (6) The Reviewing Official is authorized to require the submission of additional documentation from the complaining agency and the company to ensure appropriate consideration of relevant factual or legal issues.

      (7) Formal rules of evidence will not apply at the informal hearing.

      (8) The formal adjudication standards under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 554, 556, and 557, do not apply to the informal hearing or adjudication process.

      (9) Treasury may promulgate additional procedural guidance governing the conduct of informal hearings.

      (10) Upon completion of the informal hearing, the Reviewing Official shall prepare a written Recommendation Memorandum addressed to the Deciding Official setting forth findings and a recommended disposition. The Deciding Official will make the final decision whether the company's certificate of authority to write and reinsure Federal bonds should be revoked based on the administrative record. The administrative record consists of the Federal agency complaint referenced in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, the company response referenced in paragraph (c), any other documentation submitted to, considered by, or entered into the administrative record by the Reviewing Official, the hearing transcript, and the Reviewing Official's Recommendation Memorandum.

      (11) The provisions of paragraphs (e), (f), and (g) of this section shall apply to the adjudication of the agency complaint when an informal hearing is conducted.

    PART 226—RECOGNITION OF INSURANCE COVERING TREASURY TAX AND LOAN DEPOSITARIES

### Part 226

**Authority:** Authority: Secs. 2 and 3, Pub. L. 95-147. 91 Stat. 1227 (31 U.S.C. 1038).

**Source:** Source: 43 FR 18972, May 2, 1978, unless otherwise noted.

      § 226.1   Scope.

#### § § 226.1

      The regulations in this part apply to insurance covering public money of the United States held by banks, savings banks, savings and loan associations, building and loan associations, homestead associations, or credit unions designated as Treasury tax and loan depositaries under 31 CFR part 203. Approval of the adequacy of the insurance coverage provided to Treasury tax and loan funds shall be governed by the regulations contained herein, which will be supplemented by guidelines issued by the Treasury and updated from time to time to meet changing conditions in the industry.

      § 226.2   General.

#### § § 226.2

      (a) Deposit or account insurance provided by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation, and the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund, is hereby recognized. Deposits or accounts which are insured by a State or agency thereof, or by a corporation chartered by a State for the sole purpose of insuring deposits or accounts of financial institutions eligible to be Treasury tax and loan depositaries (hereinafter referred to as Insurance Arrangement), shall be approved as provided herein. Such approval constitutes recognition for the purpose of reducing the amount of collateral required of a tax and loan depositary by the amount of recognized insurance coverage pursuant to 31 CFR 203.15.

      (b) Generally, these regulations and their associated guidelines require that an organization providing insurance maintain a corpus of sufficient value and liquidity, and/or that it have sufficient State borrowing authority, in relation to its liabilities and total insured savings (or deposits) to provide adequate security to the Government's deposits and that adequate monitoring of the financial condition of the insured institutions is conducted.

      § 226.3   Application—termination.

#### § § 226.3

      (a) Every Insurance Organization applying for recognition as a qualified insurer of financial institutions designated as Treasury tax and loan depositaries shall address a written request to the Assistant Commissioner, Comptroller, Bureau of the Fiscal Service, Department of the Treasury, Washington, DC 20226, who will notify the applicant of the data which is necessary to make application. If the Secretary of the Treasury is satisfied that:

      (1) One or more institutions insured by the applicant otherwise meet the Secretary's requirements for designation as a Treasury tax and loan depositary or Federal tax depositary,

      (2) The insurance provided by the applicant covers public money of the United States, and

      (3) The insurance coverage provided affords adequate security to the Government's deposits, the Secretary shall recognize the applicant as a qualified insurer of financial institutions designated as Treasury tax and loan depositaries.

      (b) If and when the Secretary of the Treasury determines that a qualified insurance organization's financial condition is such that it no longer provides adequate security or that it is not complying with the regulations of this part, the Secretary will notify the Insurance Organization of the facts or conduct which cause him to make such determination, and in those cases where the safety of the Government's funds allows, provide the Insurance Organization with an opportunity to correct the deficiency. When any deficiency has not been corrected to his satisfaction or, where the safety of Government funds makes immediate revocation imperative, the Secretary will revoke the recognition previously granted.

> [43 FR 18972, May 2, 1978, as amended at 44 FR 19406, Apr. 3, 1979; 49 FR 47002, Nov. 30, 1984]

      § 226.4   Adequacy of security—how computed.

#### § § 226.4

      (a) In qualifying Insurance Organizations, the Treasury will use a ratio (equity (net worth) of the insurance organization divided by insured accounts or deposits) to determine if the security is adequate. The ratio will be computed as determined by the Treasury, and is required to equal 0.0045 or greater for an Insurance Organization to be recognized (, net worth is required to equal 0.45 of 1 percent of insured accounts or deposits).

      (b) If, in the judgment of the Secretary of the Treasury, any of the Insurance Organization's assets which cannot be liquidated promptly or are subject to restriction, encumbrance, or discredit, all or part of the value of such assets may be deducted from equity in making the computation. The Secretary of the Treasury may value the assets and liabilities in his discretion.

      (c) An Insurance Organization's unqualified borrowing authority from its sponsoring State will be added to its equity in making the computation because such authority is equivalent to additional capitalization. An Insurance Organization's commercial borrowing authority and its reinsurance will be disregarded in making the computation, because these are not adequate substitutes for undercapitalization.

      General Provisions

        § 240.1   Scope of regulations.

#### § § 240.1

        (a) The regulations in this part prescribe the requirements for indorsement and the conditions for payment of checks drawn on the United States Treasury. These regulations also establish procedures for collection of amounts due the United States Treasury based on claims arising from the breach of presentment guarantees by presenting banks and other indorsers of Treasury checks when checks bearing material defects or alterations or forged disbursing officer (drawer) signatures are presented for payment and are paid.

        (b) Standards contained in this regulation supersede existing Federal common law to the extent that they are inconsistent with Federal common law rules relating to counterfeit checks. Under the provisions of this regulation, the risk of loss on certain counterfeit checks is placed on presenting banks and other indorsers unless Treasury fails to timely reclaim on a check payment in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3712(a) and § 240.8 of this regulation. Treasury will reclaim on counterfeit checks that are deemed paid under § 240.6(d) of this regulation when a presenting bank or other indorser fails to make all reasonable efforts to ensure that a check is an authentic Treasury check.

        (c) Nothing in this regulation supercedes the rights or obligations of Treasury or any other person that are set forth in Regulation CC, 12 CFR part 229, with respect to substitute checks, as defined therein.

        (d) A financial institution's indorsement or presentment of a U.S. Treasury check shall constitute its agreement to this part. The financial institution hereby authorizes its servicing Federal Reserve Bank to debit the financial institution's Federal Reserve Master Account for the amount of the reclamation and any accrued interest, penalties and/or administrative costs in accordance with the provisions of § 240.9.

        § 240.3   Electronic checks and substitute checks.

#### § § 240.3

        (a)  An electronic check for which a presenting bank has provided the guarantees described in § 240.4 is the legal equivalent of an original or substitute check for purposes of this part if the electronic check accurately represents all of the information on the front and back of the check that the presenting bank truncated. If a financial institution presents an electronic check for payment and the check is subject to return, Treasury may effect the return using an electronic check, but this part does not create any right for the presenting bank to return the check to the payee or any other person using an electronic check.

        (b)  Any financial institution that creates a substitute check or electronic check shall prevent unauthorized access to the original or substitute check that was truncated by storing the check, until it is destroyed, in a manner consistent with federal banking agency guidelines for safeguarding customer information.

        § 240.4   Presentment guarantees.

#### § § 240.4

        The guarantors of a check presented to the Treasury for payment are deemed to guarantee to the Treasury all of the following:

        (a)  That all prior indorsements are genuine, whether or not an express guarantee is placed on the check. When the first indorsement has been made by one other than the payee personally, the presenting bank and the indorsers are deemed to guarantee to the Treasury, in addition to other guarantees, that the person who so indorsed had unqualified capacity and authority to indorse the check on behalf of the payee.

        (b)  That the check has not been materially altered.

        (c)  That the guarantors have no knowledge that the signature of the drawer is forged or unauthorized.

        (d)  That the guarantors have made all reasonable efforts to ensure that a check is both an authentic Treasury check ( it is not a counterfeit check) and a valid Treasury check ( it has not been previously negotiated or canceled).

        (e)  If the check is an electronic check, that—

        (1) The check accurately represents all of the information on the front and back of the original or substitute check that was truncated and meets the technical requirements for sending electronic items to a Federal Reserve Bank as set forth in the Federal Reserve Banks' operating circulars;

        (2) Treasury will not receive presentment of, or otherwise be charged for, the electronic check, the original check, or a substitute check (or a paper or electronic reproduction of any of the foregoing) such that Treasury will be asked to make payment based on a check it already has paid; and

        (3) Treasury's receipt of the electronic check instead of the original or substitute check will not result in the loss of Treasury's ability to determine whether the check contains a material defect or alteration.

        (f)  If the check is a substitute check, that the guarantors make the warranties set forth at 12 CFR 229.52(a)(1) and (2) and the indemnity set forth at 12 CFR 229.53.

        § 240.5   Limitations on payment; cancellation and distribution of proceeds of checks.

#### § § 240.5

        (a)  (1) Treasury shall not be required to pay any check that is not negotiated to a financial institution within 12 months after the date on which the check was issued.

        (2) All checks shall bear a legend, stating “Void After One Year.” The legend is notice to payees and indorsers of a general limitation on the payment of checks. The legend, or the inadvertent lack thereof, does not limit, or otherwise affect, the rights of Treasury under the law.

        (b)  (1) Any check that has not been paid and remains outstanding for more than 12 months after the issue date will be canceled by Treasury.

        (2) The proceeds from checks canceled pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section will be returned to the payment certifying or authorizing agency for ultimate credit to the appropriation or fund account initially charged for the payment.

        (3) On a monthly basis, Treasury will provide to each agency that authorizes the issuance of checks a list of those checks issued for such agency which were canceled during the preceding month pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section.

        § 240.6   Provisional credit; first examination; declination; final payment.

#### § § 240.6

        (a) Any credit issued by a Federal Reserve Bank to a financial institution shall be a provisional credit until Treasury completes first examination of the check, or as provided in paragraph (d) of this section.

        (b) Treasury shall have the right as a drawee to complete first examination of checks presented for payment, to reconcile checks, and, when appropriate, to make a declination on any check.

        (c) Treasury will decline payment on a check when first examination by Treasury establishes that:

        (1) The check has a material defect or alteration;

        (2) The check bears a forged or unauthorized drawer's signature;

        (3) Treasury has already received presentment of a substitute check, electronic check, or original check relating to the check being presented, such that Treasury is being requested to make payment on a check it has already paid; or Treasury is being requested to make payment on a check that is not valid due to a stop payment or other cancellation.

        (4) In the case of an electronic check, Treasury cannot determine whether the check contains a material defect or alteration without examining the original check or a better quality image of the check and Treasury is on notice of a question of law or fact about whether the check is properly payable; or

        (5) In the case of a substitute check, Treasury has a warranty or indemnity claim arising under 12 CFR 229.52 or 229.53.

        (d) Treasury shall have a reasonable amount of time to complete first examination. However, except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, if Treasury has not declined payment on a check within 60 days after the check is presented to a Federal Reserve Processing Center for payment, Treasury will be deemed to have made final payment on the check.

        (e) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (d) of this section, in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3328(a)(2), if, upon presentment for payment, Treasury is on notice of a question of law or fact about whether a check is properly payable, Treasury may defer final payment until the question is settled.

        (f) If a Federal Reserve Bank debits a financial institution's reserve account as a result of an erroneous declination, Treasury will promptly refund the amount of the payment.

#### § § 240.7

        (a)  Only a presenting bank may protest the declination of a check that it has presented to a Federal Reserve Bank for payment.

        (b)  Where Treasury, in accordance with § 240.6, has made a declination of a check presented for payment and a Federal Reserve Bank has reversed its provisional credit to the presenting bank, the presenting bank may file a protest challenging the factual basis for such declination. Protests may be filed challenging the following determinations:

        (1)  The presenting bank may offer evidence that the check is not a counterfeit.

        (2)  The presenting bank may offer evidence that the check is not altered.

        (3)  The presenting bank may offer evidence that the drawer's signature was authentic or was authorized.

        (d)  The responsible Fiscal Service Director, or an authorized designee, will make every effort to decide any protest properly submitted under this section within 60 days, and will notify the presenting bank of Treasury's decision. In those cases where it is not possible to render a decision within 60 days, the responsible Fiscal Service Director, or an authorized designee, will notify the presenting bank of the delay. Neither the responsible Fiscal Service Director, nor an authorized designee, will have any involvement in the decision to deny payment of a check under § 240.6 of this part.

        (1) If, based on the evidence provided, the responsible Fiscal Service Director, or an authorized designee, finds that the presenting bank has met, by a preponderance of the evidence, the criteria in paragraph (b) of this section, Treasury will reverse its decision to decline payment on the check by directing a Federal Reserve Bank to provide credit in the amount of the check to the presenting bank.

        (2) If, based on the evidence provided, the responsible Fiscal Service Director, or an authorized designee, finds that the presenting bank has failed to meet, by a preponderance of the evidence, the criteria in paragraph (b) of this section, the declination will not be reversed.

        (d) Reclamation debts are due to be paid upon receipt of the reclamation by the reclamation debtor. Interest, penalties, and administrative costs associated with unpaid balances will accrue as follows:

        (1)  Treasury will assess interest on the unpaid principal of the reclamation debt beginning on the 61st day following the reclamation date, and will calculate interest based on the rate published annually by Treasury in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3717. Interest will continue to accrue until the full amount of the reclamation is paid or Treasury determines that payment is not required.

        (2)  Treasury will assess a penalty beginning on the 91st day following the reclamation date. The penalty will be assessed in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3717 on the unpaid principal of the reclamation debt, and will continue to accrue until the full amount of the reclamation debt is paid or Treasury determines that payment is not required.

        (3)  Treasury will assess administrative costs associated with the unpaid reclamation debt beginning on the 61st day following the reclamation date. Administrative costs will continue to accrue until the full amount of the reclamation debt is paid or Treasury determines that payment is not required.

        (e) If Treasury is unable to fully collect a reclamation debt from a reclamation debtor, after pursuing all appropriate means of collection (including, but not limited to, administrative offset in accordance with § 240.10 and Treasury Check Offset in accordance with § 240.11), Treasury will discharge the unpaid reclamation debt. See 31 CFR 903.5 (Discharge of indebtedness; reporting requirements). Treasury or the certifying agency will report the amount of the unpaid reclamation debt to the Internal Revenue Service in accordance with the requirements of 26 U.S.C. 6050P and 26 CFR 1.6050P-1.

        § 240.9   Reclamation procedures; reclamation protests.

#### § § 240.9

        (a)  (1) Treasury will send a “NOTICE OF DIRECT DEBIT (RECLAMATION)” to the reclamation debtor in accordance with § 240.8(a). This notice will advise the reclamation debtor of the amount demanded and the reason for the demand. Treasury will provide notice to the reclamation debtor that:

        (i) If the reclamation debt is not paid within 30 days after the reclamation date, Treasury intends to collect the amount outstanding by instructing the appropriate Federal Reserve Bank to debit on the 31st day the Master Account used by the reclamation debtor. The Federal Reserve Bank will provide advice of the debit to the reclamation debtor;

        (ii) The reclamation debtor has an opportunity to inspect and copy Treasury's records with respect to the reclamation debt;

        (iii) The reclamation debtor may, by filing a protest in accordance with § 240.9(b), request Treasury to review its decision that the reclamation debtor is liable for the reclamation debt. If such a protest is filed within 30 days after the reclamation date, Treasury will not instruct the appropriate Federal Reserve Bank to debit the Master Account used by the reclamation debtor while the protest is still pending; and

        (iv) The reclamation debtor has an opportunity to enter into a written agreement with Treasury for the repayment of the reclamation debt. A request for a repayment agreement must be accompanied by documentary proof that satisfies Treasury that the reclamation debtor is unable to repay the entire amount owed when due.

        (2) Requests by a reclamation debtor for an appointment to inspect and copy Treasury's records with respect to a reclamation debt and requests to enter into repayment agreements must be sent in writing to the address provided on the Check Claims Web site at  or to such other address as Treasury may publish in the Goldbook: The Check Reclamation Guide, which can be found at

        (3) If Treasury determines a reclamation debt is due and the Federal Reserve Bank is unable to debit the financial institution's Master Account, Fiscal Service will assess interest, penalties, and administrative costs in accordance with § 240.8. Additionally, Treasury will proceed to collect the reclamation debt through offset in accordance with § 240.10 and Treasury Check Offset in accordance with § 240.11.

        (4) If Treasury determines a reclamation has been made in error, Treasury will abandon the reclamation. If Treasury already has collected the amount of the reclamation from the reclamation debtor, Treasury will promptly refund to the reclamation debtor the amount of its payment.

        (b) —(1)  Only a reclamation debtor may protest a reclamation.

        (2)  Where Treasury, in accordance with § 240.8 and paragraph (a) of this section, reclaims the amount of a check payment, the reclamation debtor may file a protest challenging such reclamation. Protests may be filed challenging the following determinations:

        (i)  The reclamation debtor may offer evidence that it made all reasonable efforts to ensure that a check is authentic. The reclamation debtor must include evidence that the check was examined for a watermark as required under §§ 240.2(bb) and 240.4. Depending on the circumstances, Fiscal Service may require evidence that the reclamation debtor also examined the check for evidence of additional security features as described in guidance provided by Treasury or on Treasury's behalf.

        (ii)  The reclamation debtor may offer evidence that the check is not altered.

        (iii)  The reclamation debtor may offer evidence that the reclamation debtor did not have knowledge of the forged or unauthorized drawer's signature.

        (iv)  The reclamation debtor may offer evidence that the indorsement was not forged or was otherwise authorized in accordance with the requirements of §§ 240.13 through 240.17.

        (v)  The presenting bank may offer evidence that the check or a paper or electronic representation thereof has not already been presented to, and paid by, Treasury.

        (vi)  The presenting bank may offer an original check or a copy of the check that is sufficient to support a determination that the check does not contain a material defect or alteration.

        (3)  A reclamation protest must be sent in writing to the address provided on the Check Claims Web site at  or to such other address as Treasury may publish in the Goldbook: The Check Reclamation Guide, which can be found at

        (i) The reclamation protest must include supporting documentation (including, but not limited to, affidavits, account agreements, and signature cards) for the purpose of establishing that the reclamation debtor is not liable for the reclamation debt.

        (ii) Treasury will not consider reclamation protests received more than 60 days after the reclamation date.

        (iii) Treasury may, at its discretion, consider information received from a guarantor other than the reclamation debtor. However, in so doing, Treasury does not waive any of its rights under this part, nor does Treasury grant rights to any guarantor that are not otherwise provided in this part.

        (4)  The responsible Fiscal Service Director, or an authorized designee, will make every effort to decide any protest properly submitted under this section within 60 days, and will notify the reclamation debtor of Treasury's decision. In those cases where it is not possible to render a decision within 60 days, the responsible Fiscal Service Director, or an authorized designee, will notify the reclamation debtor of the delay. Neither the responsible Fiscal Service Director, nor an authorized designee, will have any involvement in the process of making determinations under § 240.8(a) of this part or sending a “REQUEST FOR REFUND (CHECK RECLAMATION)” under § 240.9(a) of this part.

        (i) Treasury will refrain from the collection activities identified in §§ 240.10 and 240.11 while a timely protest is being considered. However, interest, penalties, and administrative costs will continue to accrue and will be added to the reclamation debt until a final determination on the protest has been made.

        (ii) If, based on the evidence provided, the responsible Fiscal Service Director, or an authorized designee, finds that the reclamation debtor has met, by a preponderance of the evidence, the criteria in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, Treasury will notify the reclamation debtor, in writing, of his or her decision to terminate collection and will refund any amounts previously collected for the reclamation debt. Treasury may refund the amount either by applying the amount to another reclamation debt owed by the reclamation debtor in accordance with this part or other applicable law, or by returning the amount to the reclamation debtor.

        (iii) If the responsible Fiscal Service Director, or an authorized designee, finds, by a preponderance of the evidence, the reclamation debtor is liable for the reclamation debt, Treasury will notify the reclamation debtor of his or her decision in writing. If the reclamation debtor has not paid the reclamation in full, Treasury will direct the Federal Reserve Bank to debit the financial institution's Master Account immediately, provided at least 30 days have passed after the date of the NOTICE OF DIRECT DEBIT (RECLAMATION). If at least 30 days have not yet passed after the date of the NOTICE OF DIRECT DEBIT (RECLAMATION), Treasury will direct the Federal Reserve Bank to debit the financial institution's Master Account on the 31st day after the date of the NOTICE OF DIRECT DEBIT (RECLAMATION). The Federal Reserve Bank will provide advice of the debit to the reclamation debtor. If the appropriate Federal Reserve Bank is unable to debit a reclamation debtor's Master Account, Treasury will proceed to collect the reclamation debt through offset in accordance with § 240.10 and § 240.11.

        (5)  The notice provided to the reclamation debtor under paragraph (b)(4)(iii) of this section shall serve as the final agency determination under the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 701, ). No civil suit may be filed until the reclamation debtor has filed a protest under this section, and Treasury has provided notice of its final determination.

        § 240.10   Offset.

#### § § 240.10

        (a) If a reclamation debt remains unpaid for 120 days after the reclamation date, Treasury will refer the reclamation debt, if eligible, to Treasury's centralized offset program (see 31 CFR part 285) or another Federal agency for offset in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3716. Prior to making a referral for offset, Treasury, in accordance with § 240.9(a)(3), will send at least one monthly statement to the reclamation debtor informing the reclamation debtor that Treasury intends to collect the reclamation debt by administrative offset and Treasury Check Offset.

        (b) If a reclamation debtor wishes to make payment on a reclamation debt referred for offset, the reclamation debtor should contact Treasury at the address listed in § 240.9(b) to resolve the debt and avoid offset.

        (c) If Treasury is unable to collect a reclamation debt by use of the offset described in paragraph (a) of this section, Treasury shall take such action against the reclamation debtor as may be necessary to protect the interests of the United States, including, but not limited to, Treasury Check Offset in accordance with § 240.11, or referral to the Department of Justice.

        (d) If Treasury effects offset under this section and it is later determined that the reclamation debtor already had paid the amount of the reclamation debt, or that a reclamation debtor which had timely filed a protest was not liable for the amount of the reclamation, Treasury will promptly refund to the reclamation debtor the amount of its payment. Treasury may refund the amount either by applying the amount to another reclamation debt owed by the reclamation debtor in accordance with this part or other applicable law, or by returning the amount to the reclamation debtor.

        § 240.11   Treasury Check Offset.

#### § § 240.11

        (a) If Treasury is unable to effect collection pursuant to § 240.8, § 240.9, or § 240.10, of this part, Treasury will collect the amount of the reclamation debt through Treasury Check Offset. Treasury Check Offset occurs when, at the direction of the Treasury, a Federal Reserve Bank withholds, that is, offsets, credit from a presenting bank. The amount of credit offset is applied to the reclamation debt owed by the presenting bank. By presenting Treasury checks for payment, the presenting bank is deemed to authorize Treasury Check Offset.

        (b) If Treasury effects offset under this section and it is later determined that the presenting bank paid the reclamation debt in full, or that a presenting bank was not liable for the amount of the reclamation debt, Treasury will promptly refund to the presenting bank the amount of its overpayment. Treasury may refund the amount either by applying the amount to another reclamation debt in accordance with this part or other applicable law, or by returning the amount to the presenting bank.

        (c) Treasury Check Offset is used for the purpose of collecting debt owed by a presenting bank to the Federal Government. As a consequence, presenting banks shall not be able to use the fact that Treasury checks have not been paid as the basis for a claim against Treasury, a Federal Reserve Bank, or other persons or entities, including payees or other indorsers of checks, for the amount of the credit offset pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3712(e) and this section.

        (d) This section does not apply to a claim based upon a reclamation that has been outstanding for more than 10 years from the date of delinquency.

        § 240.12   Processing of checks.

#### § § 240.12

        (a)  (1) Federal Reserve Banks must cash checks for Government disbursing officials when such checks are drawn by the disbursing officials to their own order, except that payment of such checks must be refused if:

        (i) A check bears a material defect or alteration;

        (ii) A check was issued more than one year prior to the date of presentment;

        (iii) The Federal Reservice Bank has been notified by Treasury, in accordance with § 240.15(c), that a check was issued to a deceased payee; or

        (iv) The Federal Reserve Bank has been notified by Treasury that a check is not valid.

        (2) Federal Reserve Banks are not required to cash checks presented directly to them by the general public.

        (3) As a depositary of public funds, each Federal Reserve Bank shall:

        (i) Receive checks from its member banks, nonmember clearing banks, or other depositors, when indorsed by such banks or depositors who guarantee all prior indorsements thereon;

        (ii) Give immediate provisional credit therefore in accordance with their current Time Schedules and charge the amount of the checks cashed or otherwise received to the General Account of the United States Treasury, subject to first examination and payment by Treasury;

        (iii) Forward payment records and requested checks to Treasury; and

        (iv) Release the original checks and substitute checks to a designated Regional Records Services Facility upon notification from Treasury.

        (4) If a check is to be declined under § 240.6, Treasury will provide the Federal Reserve Bank with notice of declination upon the completion of first examination. Federal Reserve Banks must give immediate credit therefor to Treasury's General Account, thereby reversing the previous charge to the General Account for such check.

        (5) Treasury authorizes each Federal Reserve Bank to release a copy of the check to the presenting bank when payment is declined.

        (b)  (1) Financial institutions outside the United States designated by Treasury as depositaries of public money in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3303 and permitted to charge checks to the General Account of the United States Treasury in accordance with Treasury implementing instructions shall be governed by the operating instructions contained in the letter of authorization to them from Treasury and are, as presenting banks, subject to the provisions of §§ 240.4, 240.8, and 240.9.

        (2) If a check is to be declined under § 240.6, Treasury will provide the presenting bank with notice of declination upon the completion of first examination and will provide the presenting bank with a copy or image of the check. Such presenting bank must give immediate credit therefore to the General Account of the United States Treasury, thereby reversing the previous charge to the Account for such check. Treasury authorizes the designated Federal Reserve Bank to return to such presenting bank the original check when payment is declined in accordance with § 240.5(a) or § 240.15(c).

        (3) To ensure complete recovery of the amount due, reclamation refunds require payment in United States dollars with checks drawn on or payable through United States financial institutions located in the United States. Reclamation refunds initiated by financial institutions outside of the United States must be sent through their headquarters or U.S. correspondent financial institution only. The payments should be accompanied by documentation identifying the check that was the subject of the reclamation (such as a copy of the reclamation notice or the current monthly statement). Reclamation refunds shall not be deposited to Treasury's General Account.

        (4) Additional information relating to designated depositaries outside the United States may be found in Volume VI, Chapter 2000, of the Treasury Financial Manual, which can be found at

      Indorsement of Checks

        § 240.13   Indorsement by payees.

#### § § 240.13

        (a)  Checks shall be indorsed by the named payee or by another on behalf of such named payee as set forth in this part.

        (b)  (1) A check is properly indorsed when:

        (i) The check is indorsed by the payee in a form recognized by general principles of law and commercial usage for negotiation, transfer or collection of negotiable instruments.

        (ii) The check is indorsed by another on behalf of the named payee, and sufficiently indicates that the indorser has indorsed the check on behalf of the payee pursuant to authority expressly conferred by or under law or other regulation. An example would be: “John Jones by Mary Jones.” This example states the minimum indication acceptable. However, §§ 240.14, 240.15, and 240.17(f) specify the addition of an indication in specified situations of the actual capacity in which the person other than the named payee is indorsing.

        (iii) Absent a signature, the check is indorsed “for collection” or “for deposit only to the credit of the within named payee or payees.” The presenting bank shall be deemed to guarantee good title to checks without signatures to all subsequent indorsers and to Treasury.

        (iv) The check is indorsed by a financial institution under the payee's authorization.

        (2)  The individual or institution accepting a check from a person other than the named payee is responsible for determining whether such person is authorized and has the capacity to indorse and negotiate the check. Evidence of the basis for such a determination may be required by Treasury in the event of a dispute.

        (3)  When a check is credited by a financial institution to the payee's account under the payee's authorization, the financial institution may use an indorsement substantially as follows: “Credit to the account of the within-named payee in accordance with the payee's instructions. XYZ [Name of financial institution].” A financial institution using this form of indorsement will be deemed to guarantee to all subsequent indorsers and to the Treasury that it is acting as an attorney-in-fact for the payee, under the payee's authorization, and that this authority is currently in force and has neither lapsed nor been revoked either in fact or by the death or incapacity of the payee.

        (4)  All checks drawn in favor of a financial institution, for credit to the account of a person designating payment so to be made, must be indorsed in the name of the financial institution as payee in the usual manner. However, no check drawn in favor of a financial institution for credit to the account of a payee may be negotiated by the financial institution after the death of the payee.

        (c)  (1) A check is not properly indorsed when the check is signed or otherwise is indorsed by a person without the payee's consent or authorization.

        (2) Failure to include the signature of the person signing the check as required by paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section will create a rebuttable presumption that the indorsement is a forgery and is unacceptable.

        (3) Failure to include sufficient indication of the indorser's authority to act on behalf of the payee as required by paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section will create a rebuttable presumption that the indorsing person is not authorized to indorse a check for the payee.

        § 240.14   Checks issued to incompetent payees.

#### § § 240.14

        (a)  (1) A guardian appointed in accordance with applicable State law, or a fiduciary appointed in accordance with other applicable law, may indorse checks issued for the following classes of payments the right to which under law does not terminate with the death of the payee: payments for the redemption of currencies or for principal and/or interest on U.S. securities; payments for tax refunds; and payments for goods and services.

        (i) A guardian or other fiduciary indorsing any such check on behalf of an incompetent payee, must include, as part of the indorsement, an indication of the capacity in which the guardian or fiduciary is indorsing. An example would be: “John Jones by Mary Jones, guardian of John Jones.”

        (ii) When a check indorsed in this fashion is presented for payment by a financial institution, it will be paid by Treasury without submission of documentary proof of the authority of the guardian or other fiduciary, with the understanding that evidence of such claimed authority to indorse may be required by Treasury in the event of a dispute.

        (2) A guardian or other fiduciary may not indorse a check issued for any class of payment other than one specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. When a check other than one specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section is received by a guardian or other fiduciary, the check must be returned to the certifying agency with information as to the incompetence of the payee and documentary evidence showing the appointment of the guardian or other fiduciary in order that a replacement check, and future checks, may be drawn in favor of the guardian or other fiduciary.

        (b)  If a guardian or other fiduciary has not been appointed, all checks issued to an incompetent payee must be returned to the certifying agency for determination as to whether, under applicable law, payment is due and to whom it may be made.

        (c)  Notwithstanding paragraph (a)(2) of this section, if a check was issued for a class of payments the right to which under law terminates upon the death of the beneficiary, such as a recurring benefit payment or annuity, the check may be negotiated under a durable special power of attorney or springing durable special power of attorney subject to the restrictions enumerated in § 240.17. After the end of the six-month period provided in §§ 240.17(d) and (e), such checks must be handled in accordance with paragraph (a)(2) of this section.

        § 240.15   Checks issued to deceased payees.

#### § § 240.15

        (a)  (1) An executor or administrator of an estate that has been appointed in accordance with applicable State law may indorse checks issued for the following classes of payments the right to which under law does not terminate with the death of the payee: payments for the redemption of currencies or for principal and/or interest on U.S. securities; payments for tax refunds; and payments for goods and services.

        (i) An executor or administrator indorsing any such check must include, as part of the indorsement, an indication of the capacity in which the executor or administrator is indorsing. An example would be: “John Jones by Mary Jones, executor of the estate of John Jones.”

        (ii) When a check indorsed in this fashion is presented for payment by a financial institution, it will be paid by Treasury without the submission of documentary proof of the authority of the executor or administrator, with the understanding that evidence of such claimed authority to indorse may be required by Treasury in the event of a dispute.

        (2) An executor or administrator of an estate may not indorse a check issued for any class of payment other than one specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. Other checks, such as recurring benefit payments and annuity payments, may not be negotiated after the death of the payee. Such checks must be returned to the certifying agency for determination as to whether, under applicable law, payment is due and to whom it may be made.

        (b)  If an executor or administrator has not been appointed, all checks issued to a deceased payee must be returned to the certifying agency for determination as to whether, under applicable law, payment is due and to whom it may be made.

        (c)  (1) A recurring benefit payment check, issued after a payee's death, is not payable. As a consequence, when a certifying agency learns that a payee has died, the certifying agency must give immediate notice to Treasury, as prescribed at Volume I, Part 4, Chapter 7000 of the Treasury Financial Manual, which can be found at  Upon receipt of such notice from a certifying agency, Treasury will instruct the Federal Reserve Bank to refuse payment of the check upon presentment. Upon receipt of such instruction from Treasury, the Federal Reserve Bank will make every appropriate effort to intercept the check. If the check is successfully intercepted, the Federal Reserve Bank will refuse payment, and will return the check unpaid to the presenting bank with an annotation that the payee is deceased. If a financial institution learns that a date of death triggering action under this section is erroneous, the financial institution must advise the payee to contact the payment certifying agency.

        (2) Nothing in this section shall limit the right of Treasury to institute reclamation proceedings under the provisions of §§ 240.8 and 240.9 with respect to a check issued to a deceased payee that has been negotiated and paid over a forged or unauthorized indorsement.

        § 240.16   Checks issued to minor payees.

#### § § 240.16

        (a) Checks in payment of principal and/or interest on U.S. securities that are issued to minors may be indorsed by:

        (1) Either parent with whom the minor resides; or

        (2) If the minor does not reside with either parent, by the person who furnishes the minor's chief support.

        (b) The parent or other person indorsing on behalf of the minor must present with the check the indorser's signed statement giving the minor's age, and stating that the payee either resides with the parent or receives his or her chief support from the person indorsing on the minor's behalf and that the proceeds of the check will be used for the minor's benefit.

        § 240.17   Powers of attorney.

#### § § 240.17

        (a)  Any check may be negotiated under a specific power of attorney executed in accordance with applicable State or Federal law after the issuance of the check and describing the check in full (check serial and symbol numbers, date of issue, amount, and name of payee).

        (b)  Checks may be negotiated under a general power of attorney executed, in accordance with applicable State or Federal law, in favor of a person for the following classes of payments:

        (1) Payments for the redemption of currencies or for principal and/or interest on U.S. securities;

        (2) Payments for tax refunds, but subject to the limitations concerning the mailing of Internal Revenue refund checks contained in 26 CFR 601.506(c); and

        (3) Payments for goods and services.

        (c)  Checks issued for classes of payments other than those specified in paragraph (b) of this section, such as a recurring benefit payment, may be negotiated under a special power of attorney executed in accordance with applicable State or Federal law, which describes the purpose for which the checks are issued, names a person as attorney-in-fact, and recites that the special power of attorney is not given to carry into effect an assignment of the right to receive such payment, either to the attorney-in-fact or to any other person.

        (d)  A durable special power of attorney is a special power of attorney that continues despite the principal's later incompetency, and is created by the principal's use of words explicitly stating such intent. Classes of checks other than those specified in paragraph (b) of this section may be negotiated under a durable special power of attorney executed in accordance with applicable State or Federal law, which describes the purpose for which the checks are issued, names a person as attorney-in-fact, and recites that the special power of attorney is not given to carry into effect an assignment of the right to receive such payment, either to the attorney-in-fact or to any other person. For the purpose of negotiating Treasury checks, durable special powers of attorney are effective only during the six-month period following a determination that the named payee is incompetent.

        (e)  A springing durable special power of attorney is similar to a durable power of attorney except that its terms do not become effective until the principal's subsequent incompetence. As with a durable special power of attorney, a springing durable special power of attorney is created by the principal's use of language explicitly stating that its terms become effective at such time as the principal is determined to be incompetent. Classes of checks other than those specified in paragraph (b) of this section may be negotiated under a springing durable special power of attorney executed in accordance with applicable State or Federal law, which describes the purpose for which the checks are issued, names a person as attorney-in-fact, and recites that the springing durable special power of attorney is not given to carry into effect an assignment of the right to receive payment, either to the attorney-in-fact or to any other person. For the purpose of negotiating Treasury checks, springing durable special powers of attorney are effective only during the six-month period following a determination that the named payee is incompetent.

        (f)  Checks indorsed by an attorney-in-fact must include, as part of the indorsement, an indication of the capacity in which the attorney-in-fact is indorsing. An example would be: “John Jones by Paul Smith, attorney-in-fact for John Jones.” Such checks when presented for payment by a financial institution, will be paid by Treasury without the submission of documentary proof of the claimed authority, with the understanding that evidence of such claimed authority to indorse may be required by Treasury in the event of a dispute.

        (g)  Notwithstanding any other law, for purposes of negotiating Treasury checks, all powers of attorney are deemed revoked by the death of the principal and may also be deemed revoked by notice from the principal to the parties known, or reasonably expected, to be acting on the power of attorney.

        (h)  Optional use power of attorney forms are listed in the appendix to this part. These forms are available on the Fiscal Service website at:

        § 240.18   Lack of authority to shift liability.

#### § § 240.18

        (a) This part neither authorizes nor directs a financial institution to debit the account of any person or to deposit any funds from any account into a suspense account or escrow account or the equivalent. Nothing in this part shall be construed to affect a financial institution's contract with its depositor(s) under authority of state law.

        (b) A financial institution's liability under this part is not affected by any action taken by it to recover from any person the amount of the financial institution's liability to the Treasury.

        § 240.19   Reservation of rights.

#### § § 240.19

        The Secretary of the Treasury reserves the right, in the Secretary's discretion, to waive any provision(s) of this regulation not otherwise required by law.

      Action To Be Taken by Claimants

        § 248.3   Advice of nonreceipt or loss.

#### § § 248.3

        The payee or owner of a depositary check which is not received, or which has been lost, stolen, destroyed or mutilated or defaced to such an extent that it is rendered non-negotiable, should immediately notify the disbursing officer who issued such check or the administrative agency exercising jurisdiction over such disbursing officer, over his signature and current address, giving information as to the circumstances of the loss, theft or destruction of the check and whether it was endorsed, and also requesting that payment of the check be stopped. A claimant who is one other than the payee of the check, should present a statement in support of his ownership of the check. If the check has been mutilated or defaced, it should be forwarded to the issuing disbursing officer with request for the issuance of a substitute.

        § 248.4   Undertaking of indemnity.

#### § § 248.4

        (a) If the check is found to be outstanding and unpaid and it appears that the proceeds are due the claimant, the disbursing officer will request the claimant to execute an undertaking of indemnity, Form 2244, in a penal sum equal to the amount of the check (or checks).

        (b) Except in the circumstances set forth below, a corporate surety authorized by the Secretary of the Treasury to act as an acceptable surety on bonds in favor of the United States or two responsible individual sureties will be required on the undertaking of indemnity. It will be the responsibility of the claimant in a foreign country to secure a certification as to the financial sufficiency of the individual sureties executed by one of the persons listed in, and in the manner prescribed by, the instruction appearing under the Certificate as to Sureties on the face of Form 2244.

        (c) Where the amount of the original check (or checks) is $200 or less, or the equivalent in foreign currency, one financially responsible individual surety may be accepted.

        (d) Unless it is determined that the requirement of sureties is essential in the public interest, sureties will not be required under the following circumstances:

        (1) If the officer authorized to issue a substitute check is satisfied that the loss, theft, destruction, mutilation or defacement of the original check occurred without fault of the owner or holder and while the check was in the custody or control of the United States or of a person duly authorized as an agent of the United States when performing services in connection with an official function of the United States;

        (2) If substantially the entire check is presented and surrendered by the owner or holder and the disbursing officer is satisfied as to the identity of the check presented and that any missing portions are not sufficient to form the basis of a valid claim against the United States;

        (3) If the owner or holder is the United States or an officer or employee thereof in his official capacity, a State, the District of Columbia, a territory or possession of the United States, a municipal corporation or political subdivision of any of the foregoing, a corporation the entire capital of which is owned by the United States, a foreign government or agency thereof, a foreign central bank, or a Federal Reserve Bank.

        § 248.5   Exception to requirement of undertaking of indemnity Form 2244.

#### § § 248.5

        Notwithstanding the provisions of § 248.4, if in any case involving a financially responsible claimant it is impracticable to obtain the execution of Standard Form 2244, with or without sureties, the officer or employee responsible for handling the claim, in his discretion, may accept an undertaking of indemnity in the form of a written statement or letter, substantially as follows:

> [25 FR 10869, Nov. 16, 1960. Redesignated at 39 FR 20969, June 17, 1974, as amended at 54 FR 35648, Aug. 29, 1989]

        § 248.6   Recovery of original check.

#### § § 248.6

        (a) If the claimant recovers an original check after he has furnished advice of non-receipt but before receipt of a substitute check, he should immediately notify the disbursing officer or agency concerned and hold the check until receipt of advice from the disbursing officer or agency concerned regarding the negotiability of such original check.

        (b) In the event the substitute check has been received prior to the recovery of the original check, the original check should be returned immediately to the disbursing officer.

        (c) Under no circumstances should the claimant attempt to cash both the original and substitute check.

        § 248.7   Claims requiring settlement action.

#### § § 248.7

        There are certain types of claims on which the disbursing officer will not be authorized to take final action. These include:

        (a) Claims on original checks which have been outstanding more than one full fiscal year following the fiscal year in which the checks were issued, and

        (b) Claims involving doubtful questions of law and fact.

        § 248.8   Inquiries.

#### § § 248.8

        Claimants should direct any inquiries regarding the application of these regulations to the department or agency or disbursing officer concerned.

        § 248.9   Amendments and waivers.

      § 250.3   Voucher applications.

#### § § 250.3

      (a)  No payment of any part of the amount due on account of an award will be made unless a voucher application therefor properly executed (preferably in ink or indelible pencil) is received by the Treasury Department. A voucher application for each payment on account of an award must be signed by each person whose name appears on such voucher application as payee exactly as his name appears thereon, with the following two exceptions:

      (1) If only the name of the payee, and not his identity, has changed, the payee shall sign the voucher application with his changed name and return it to the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, Treasury Department, Hyattsville, MD 20782; the voucher application shall be accompanied by an explanatory affidavit and appropriate supporting documents, e.g., a copy of a marriage certificate or court order of change of name.

      (2) If the identity of the payee has changed, paragraph (b) of this section shall apply. A signature by mark (X) must be witnessed by two persons; the signature and address of each must appear on the voucher application. In the case of a corporation the voucher application must be signed by an appropriate officer thereof having authority to do so, whose authority to sign on behalf of the corporation must be duly certified to thereon over the seal of the corporation.

      (b)  If the person named in the voucher application as payee is no longer the proper person to receive the payment by reason of assignment, incompetency or death, or of termination of a partnership or corporation named, the voucher shall be executed by the person entitled to payment as provided in 250.4 and returned to the Credit Accounting Branch with the relevant information and the appropriate supporting documents required by that section.

> [31 FR 9418, July 9, 1966, as amended at 49 FR 47001, Nov. 30, 1984; 58 FR 4578, Jan. 15, 1993]

      § 250.4   Payment on awards.

#### § § 250.4

      Payment will be made only to the person or persons on behalf of whom the award is made, except in the following circumstances:

      (a) If such person is incompetent, payment will be made to his guardian, committee, or other equivalent legal representative. The law of the residence of the incompetent will determine whether the legal representative must be court appointed. If court appointment is required, the legal representative shall submit a certificate of the clerk of the appointing court, under its seal, dated within 6 months of the date of the voucher application for payment, showing that his appointment is in full force and effect. If court appointment is not required, the legal representative shall submit a notarized statement showing:

      (1) His relationship to the incompetent;

      (2) The name and address of the person having care and custody of the incompetent;

      (3) That any money received will be applied to the use and benefit of the incompetent, and

      (4) That there was no appointment of a guardian or committee.

      (b) If such person is deceased, payment will be made to his legal representative.

      (1) If any payment to be made is not over $1,000 and there is no qualified executor or administrator, the legal representative will be the person found by the Comptroller General to be entitled thereto, without the necessity of compliance with the requirements of law with respect to the administration of estates, upon execution and submission of Standard Form No. 1055 to the Bureau of the Fiscal Service for transmittal to the Comptroller General. That form is available from the Credit Accounting Branch.

      (2) In all other cases, the term legal representative shall include court-appointed or statutory administrators or executors, and successors in interest of the decedent, e.g., his legatees or heirs as determined by an appropriate court or by the law of his residence. If administration of the decedent's estate is closed, the legal representative shall submit a copy of the appropriate court's final order of distribution or other pertinent order, identifying the distributees and their addresses. If administration continues and the legal representative is court-appointed, he shall submit a certificate of the clerk of the appointing court, under its seal, dated within 6 months of the date of the voucher application for payment, showing that such appointment is in full force and effect. If the legal representative is not court-appointed, he shall submit evidence sufficient to prove his interest and authority to apply for payment. If that evidence is a copy of the decedent's will, it shall show on its face or by attachments thereto that it has been offered for probate, and that the appropriate court has affixed its seal and attached its certification of authenticity that the will is in fact the decedent's last will and testament.

      (c)-(d) [Reserved]

      (e) In the case of a partnership or corporation, the existence of which has been terminated, if a receiver or trustee has been duly appointed by a court of competent jurisdiction in the United States and has not been discharged prior to the date of payment, payment will be made to such receiver or trustee in accordance with the order of the court. In the event a receiver or trustee duly appointed by a court of competent jurisdiction in the United States makes an assignment of the claim or any part thereof with respect to which an award is made, or makes an assignment of such award or any part thereof, payment will be made to the assignee as his interest may appear. In the latter circumstance, certified copies of the court orders showing the authority of the receiver or trustee to make the assignment shall be submitted with the assignment. No particular form of assignment is prescribed, but the original assignment must be submitted to, and will be retained by the Treasury Department.

      (f) In the case of a partnership or corporation, the existence of which has been terminated, if no receiver or trustee has been duly appointed by a court of competent jurisdiction in the United States, or if such a receiver or trustee has been discharged prior to the date of payment without having made an assignment, payment may be made to the person or persons found by the Comptroller General of the United States to be entitled thereto. In this circumstance, the person or persons claiming payment shall submit to the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, Treasury Department, Hyattsville, MD 20782, such documentary evidence as is appropriate to show his or their right to the payment.

      (g) In the case of an assignment of an award or any part thereof which is made in writing and duly acknowledged and filed after such award is certified to the Secretary of the Treasury, payment may in the discretion of the Secretary of the Treasury be made to the assignee as his interest may appear. No particular form of assignment is prescribed, but the original assignment must be submitted to, and will be retained by the Treasury Department.

      § 250.5   Manner of payment.

#### § § 250.5

      Payment will be made by check drawn on the United States Treasury. Checks will be mailed to the payee at the address indicated on the voucher application, unless subsequent to the issue of the voucher application the Treasury Department receives a written request from the payee to deliver the check to him at some other address.

    PART 256—OBTAINING PAYMENTS FROM THE JUDGMENT FUND AND UNDER PRIVATE RELIEF BILLS

### Part 256

**Authority:** Authority: 31 U.S.C. 1304, 3728; 41 U.S.C. 612; 5 U.S.C. 2301 note.

**Source:** Source: 71 FR 60849, Oct. 17, 2006, unless otherwise noted.

      Subpart A—General Information

        § 256.0   What does this part cover?

#### § § 256.0

        This part applies to payments made by the U.S. Department of the Treasury (Treasury) pursuant to the Judgment Fund statute, 31 U.S.C. 1304.

        § 256.1   What is Treasury's role in paying awards and settlements from the Judgment Fund?

#### § § 256.1

        (a) The Judgment Fund is a permanent, indefinite appropriation which is available to pay many judicially and administratively ordered monetary awards against the United States. In addition, amounts owed under compromise agreements negotiated by the U.S. Department of Justice in settlement of claims arising under actual or imminent litigation are normally paid from the Judgment Fund, if a judgment on the merits would be payable from the Judgment Fund. Treasury's Bureau of the Fiscal Service (Fiscal Service) certifies payments from the Judgment Fund when the following four tests have been met:

        (1) Awards or settlements are final;

        (2) Awards or settlements are monetary;

        (3) One of the authorities specified in 31 U.S.C. 1304(a)(3) provides for payment of the award or settlement; and

        (4) Payment may not legally be made from any other source of funds.

        (b) Additionally, Fiscal Service requires that requests for payment identify the statute that forms the basis of the underlying claim. The award or settlement must comply with the statutory and regulatory requirements that authorize the award or settlement. For example, interest is payable on Judgment Fund awards only if there is an express statutory provision, contractual agreement or constitutional waiver of sovereign immunity authorizing the assessment of interest against the United States. Also, a tort under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) is payable from the Judgment Fund only when the award amount exceeds $2,500 (for administrative awards) and is in compliance with the regulatory requirements at 28 CFR part 14.

        § 256.2   Where can I find more information about, and forms for, Judgment Fund payments?

#### § § 256.2

        Detailed information related to Judgment Fund payments, including copies of all forms, can be found in the Treasury Financial Manual (TFM), Volume I, Part 6, Chapter 3100. The TFM is available on the Judgment Fund Web site at  Contact information for the Judgment Fund Branch is also available on the Web site.

      Subpart B—Requesting Payments

        § 256.10   Who may request payment from the Judgment Fund?

#### § § 256.10

        (a)  The Department of Justice must normally submit the request for payment from the Judgment Fund. Agencies that have independent litigating authority may submit a request for payment themselves if the Department of Justice is not responsible for the case.

        (b)  The program agency that is authorized to approve the award must submit the request for payment.

        § 256.11   How do agencies request payments?

#### § § 256.11

        Agencies must submit requests for payments from the Judgment Fund on Fiscal Service's Judgment Fund payment request forms or by using other approved methods as provided for on the Judgment Fund Web site at  Fiscal Service provides forms and detailed information about Judgment Fund payments in the TFM, Volume I, Part 6, Chapter 3100. The TFM is also available on the Judgment Fund Web site. The submitting agency must complete and sign all required Judgment Fund forms and must attach all required supporting documents.

        § 256.12   What supporting documentation must agencies submit to Fiscal Service when requesting a payment from the Judgment Fund?

#### § § 256.12

        (a)  The submitting agency must submit a copy of the judgment or settlement agreement, as applicable, in addition to the request for payment from the Judgment Fund. The request for payment must be on the appropriate Judgment Fund payment request forms.

        (b)  For awards to claimants that are minors, the submitting agency must include in its submission to Fiscal Service documentation establishing that the payee, if different from the claimant, is legally authorized to act on behalf of the claimant. Documentation of court approvals (Federal, State, or foreign) that are legally required for payment must be submitted along with the request for payment from the Judgment Fund. State law typically specifies when money awards to minors require the appointment of a guardian. Agencies must list the appropriate controlling state law citation on the payment request forms.

        (c)  For awards of costs, the submitting agency must include a copy of the “bill of costs” or the Court's order awarding costs. Only those items expressly enumerated under the cost statute, 28 U.S.C. 1920, or other governing statute specific to the award, are payable from the Judgment Fund.

        (d)  For awards where multiple payees are to receive separate payments, the submitting agency must complete separate Judgment Fund Vouchers for Payment for each payee. When there are multiple claimants in an administrative tort matter, each claimant's award must independently exceed the mandatory $2,500 threshold in order for payment to be made from the Judgment Fund. A claimant's threshold can be satisfied by combining amounts awarded for personal and property damage under the FTCA.

        (e)  For awards of back pay where the judgment does not specifically state the principal amounts to be paid and withholdings to be made, the submitting agency must include a spreadsheet indicating precisely which amounts are allocable to net pay, deductions, and interest.

        § 256.13   Are agencies required to supply a taxpayer identification number (TIN) when submitting a request for payment?

#### § § 256.13

        Yes, agencies must include a valid TIN on all requests for payments, unless the situation meets one of the exceptions listed in the Fiscal Service TIN Policy, which may be found on the Fiscal Service Web site at:  For an individual, the TIN is the Social Security Number. For a business, the TIN is the Employer Identification Number issued by IRS. The TIN provided must be for the party entitled to the payment, whether or not that party is the payee. Failure to include a required TIN results in an incomplete request for payment.

        § 256.14   What happens if I submit an incomplete request for payment?

#### § § 256.14

        Fiscal Service may return, without action, any request for payment that is incomplete. If a request for payment is returned for lack of necessary information, the submitting agency may resubmit the request for payment once all the required information is available.

      Subpart C—Debt Collection

        § 256.20   How does an agency indicate that a debt is to be offset from a Judgment Fund payment?

#### § § 256.20

        The submitting agency must identify on the appropriate Judgment Fund form any known debt owed to the United States that Fiscal Service is expected to collect by setoff against the award. Such a debt will be offset pursuant to the provisions of 31 U.S.C. 3728.

        § 256.21   Are Judgment Fund payments offset to collect administrative debts?

#### § § 256.21

        Yes, separate and apart from its role as administrator of the Judgment Fund, Fiscal Service, in its capacity as disbursing official for the executive branch, offsets Judgment Fund payments to collect delinquent, nontax Federal debts through the Treasury Offset Program (TOP). This rule applies only to the setoff of Judgment Fund payments prior to payment certification, pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3728, and not to disbursing official offsets pursuant to other authorities. (See 31 CFR 285.5 for requirements for disbursing official offset of past-due delinquent, nontax debts pursuant to the authority set forth in 31 U.S.C. 3716.)

        § 256.22   How does Fiscal Service set off an award under 31 U.S.C. 3728?

#### § § 256.22

        The setoff statute establishes a two-step process to collect debts that are owed to the United States. If an agency notifies Fiscal Service of a debt for which a court has issued a judgment against a debtor in favor of the United States, or for which the IRS has issued a tax levy pursuant to 26 U.S.C. 6331, then Fiscal Service will automatically set off the debt from the payment. If the debt owed to the United States has not been judicially determined, then Fiscal Service must notify the claimant of the debt and request the debtor's consent to a setoff. If the debtor consents, then Fiscal Service will set off the debt. If the debtor does not consent, then Fiscal Service will withhold from payment an amount equal to the debt. Fiscal Service also may withhold an amount sufficient to pay the cost of litigating the debt to judgment. Fiscal Service then will consult with the underlying agency and the Department of Justice regarding the necessity for a civil action to reduce the debt to judgment. If litigation proceeds and is successful, Fiscal Service will set off the debt. If the suit is unsuccessful, Fiscal Service will pay the withheld amount with interest accruing from the date when payment would have been made.

      Subpart D—Interest and Litigation Costs

        § 256.30   When does the Judgment Fund pay interest?

#### § § 256.30

        Interest is paid when it is ordered in the judgment pursuant to a statutory, contractual or constitutional waiver of sovereign immunity. Such waivers may include interest as set forth under 41 U.S.C. 611 (Contract Disputes Act), 5 U.S.C. 5596 (Back Pay Act), or Title VII, 42 U.S.C. 2000e-16 (Civil Rights Act of 1991). In addition, post-judgment interest is paid on awards eligible for interest under 31 U.S.C. 1304(b) (unsuccessful appeal by the Government).

        § 256.31   How does Fiscal Service compute interest on payments?

#### § § 256.31

        Fiscal Service computes interest according to the terms of the statute that waives sovereign immunity for interest to be awarded against the Federal government. The statute that allows interest must be cited on the appropriate Judgment Fund form.

        § 256.32   What documentation must be submitted to the Judgment Fund Branch to preserve the right to seek interest under 31 U.S.C. 1304(b) in a case where the government has taken an appeal?

#### § § 256.32

        31 U.S.C. 1304(b) specifies that a “transcript of the judgment” must be filed with the Secretary of the Treasury. This means that a copy of the judgment must be filed with the Judgment Fund Branch for interest to accrue on a judgment of a federal district court, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, or the United States Court of Federal Claims. By practice, the successful plaintiff files a copy of the judgment. Whoever submits the judgment should include a cover letter explaining that it is being submitted to preserve interest rights under 31 U.S.C. 1304. A copy of the judgment and cover letter must be sent to the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, Judgment Fund Branch, at the address indicated on the Judgment Fund Web site at

        § 256.33   For what period of time is interest computed under 31 U.S.C. 1304(b)?

#### § § 256.33

        Interest is computed from the date that Fiscal Service receives the copy of the judgment until the date preceding the appellate court's affirmative ruling. If the United States files a Notice of Appeal which it later withdraws, interest is paid on the award through the date before the withdrawal of the Notice of Appeal.

        § 256.34   Does the Judgment Fund pay all litigation costs?

#### § § 256.34

        Fiscal Service certifies for payment only those costs that are enumerated in the cost statute, 28 U.S.C. 1920, or as set forth under a statute that specifically governs payment of the award.

      Subpart E—Reimbursements to the Judgment Fund

        § 256.40   When must an agency reimburse the Judgment Fund?

#### § § 256.40

        Agencies are required to reimburse the Judgment Fund for payments made pursuant to the Contract Disputes Act (CDA), 41 U.S.C. 612, and payments made pursuant to the Notification and Federal Employees Antidiscrimination and Retaliation Act of 2002 (No FEAR), 5 U.S.C. 2301 note. The TFM, available on the Judgment Fund Web site at , contains more information about how Fiscal Service bills agencies and collects such reimbursements.

        § 256.41   When is reimbursement due for CDA and No FEAR payments?

#### § § 256.41

        Reimbursement for a CDA or No FEAR payment should be made promptly upon notification from Fiscal Service of the amount due. If the agency is unable to timely reimburse Fiscal Service, the agency must contact Fiscal Service to establish a reimbursement plan. Under Office of Personnel Management (OPM) regulations, No FEAR reimbursements or payment reimbursement plans must be made within 45 days of the request for reimbursement. See 5 CFR part 724. Agencies that do not meet this requirement will be listed on Fiscal Service's public Web site.

      Subpart F—Additional Provisions

        § 256.50   How does Fiscal Service process back pay awards?

#### § § 256.50

        The submitting agency may request one of two methods to process back pay awards.

        (a) One method has three parts. The first part is a payment of net back pay (and interest if authorized), which is sent to the plaintiff or to the plaintiff's attorney, as directed by the submitting agency. The second part is a payment to the agency of deductions from the net back pay. The third part is a payment of attorney fees, which is sent directly to the attorney.

        (b) Under the second method, Fiscal Service pays the entire back pay award to the agency out of whose actions the claim arose. The agency then issues amounts representing back pay (and interest if authorized) to the plaintiff and retains amounts representing deductions. Fiscal Service pays the attorney fees directly to the attorney.

        § 256.51   Does Fiscal Service report Judgment Fund payments to the IRS as income to the payee on IRS Form 1099?

#### § § 256.51

        No, Fiscal Service does not report Judgment Fund payments as potential taxable income to the IRS. Fiscal Service does not have sufficient information about the payment to determine if a Form 1099 must be issued or to prepare such a form when required. To the extent any Form 1099 needs to be issued, it is the responsibility of the agency submitting the payment request to do so.

        § 256.52   How does Fiscal Service issue a payment?

#### § § 256.52

        Pursuant to 31 CFR part 208, Judgment Fund payments are to be made by electronic funds transfer (EFT). Fiscal Service will issue an electronic payment to the payee's account as specified on the appropriate Judgment Fund form. If a submitting agency determines that a waiver (in accordance with 31 CFR part 208) to the requirement for payment by EFT is appropriate, Fiscal Service will issue a payment by check. The Voucher for Payment must direct payment to the payee designated in the judgment or settlement agreement.

        § 256.53   How does the submitting agency know when payment is made?

#### § § 256.53

        Fiscal Service will e-mail the agency contact when payment is disbursed, if the agency contact has provided an email address on the appropriate Judgment Fund form. Also, Fiscal Service maintains an on-line payment status system that the submitting agency can access to determine the status of a payment. The payment reporting system can be accessed from the Judgment Fund Web site at

        § 256.54   What happens if Fiscal Service denies a request for payment?

#### § § 256.54

        Fiscal Service must deny any request for payment that fails to satisfy the requirements of 31 U.S.C. 1304. The submitting agency may request reconsideration of a payment denial. The submitting agency must provide an explanation of how the request for payment meets the four tests contained in section 256.1 of this part. If applicable, requests for reconsideration must contain a reference to the agency's program authority and include specific funding provisions that pertain to the program activity that resulted in the claim. If, upon reconsideration, Fiscal Service determines that payment from the Judgment Fund is appropriate, and the agency has already made payment to the plaintiff or claimant, Fiscal Service will reimburse the agency from the Judgment Fund.

      Subpart G—Private Relief Bills

        § 256.60   How do I get paid for a Private Relief Bill?

#### § § 256.60

        You may apply for payment by sending a request letter along with supporting documentation, to include a copy of the private relief act and proof of your identity, to the address specified on the Fiscal Service Web site at

#### § § 281.3

      Foreign exchange collected by agencies shall be delivered promptly into the custody of accountable officers for credit to accounts of the Secretary of the Treasury (hereinafter referred to as the Secretary) unless otherwise directed by the Secretary. The term “collections,” for the purpose of these regulations in this part, does not include foreign exchange acquired by the United States by purchase with dollars. The accountable officer shall maintain records, showing the collections, by source, and indicating the miscellaneous receipt accounts or other accounts in the Treasury to be credited with dollar proceeds from sale of the foreign exchange, and such further classifications as may be needed to indicate exchange which can be used only for restricted purposes. Accountable officers shall be advised by the collecting agencies of the source of collections and any restrictions on the use of the foreign exchange in order that the foregoing records may be maintained.

      § 281.4   Guaranty funds.

#### § § 281.4

      The regulations in this part are applicable to all foreign exchange acquired by the United States under guaranty provisions of section 1011 of the United States Information and Educational Exchange Act of 1948, as amended (22 U.S.C. 1442), except that receipts of such foreign exchange shall be deposited in the foreign exchange accounts of the United States Treasury referred to in § 281.5(c).

      § 281.5   Depositaries.

#### § § 281.5

      (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, foreign exchange which is held by accountable officers for account of the Secretary and foreign exchange acquired by accountable officers by purchase or otherwise, which is not immediately disbursed but is held by such officers for their own account or for the account of any agency, shall be maintained only in depositaries designated by the Secretary. Unless otherwise directed by the Secretary, accountable officers are not required to have separate depositary accounts for foreign exchange held for the Secretary's account.

      (b) Accountable officers may carry foreign exchange as cash outside depositaries only pursuant to authority granted in accordance with Treasury Department Circular No. 1030 dated July 24, 1959, as amended.

      (c) Deposits in and withdrawals from foreign exchange accounts maintained with depositaries in the name of the United States Treasury will be made only as directed by the Secretary.

      § 281.6   Withdrawals from Treasury accounts.

#### § § 281.6

      Foreign exchange shall be withdrawn from accounts of the Secretary on the books of accountable officers or from the foreign exchange accounts carried with depositaries in the name of the United States Treasury, only for the purpose of sale for dollars or transfer to agencies for authorized purposes, without reimbursement to the Treasury, as provided by or pursuant to law. Such transfers, as well as transfers between foreign exchange accounts of the Secretary and between foreign exchange accounts in the name of the United States Treasury, shall be made only by direction of the Secretary. An agency requiring foreign exchange from the Treasury Department shall make request of the Secretary, indicating the amount of exchange required, in units of foreign currency, and the name and location of the accountable officer to receive the exchange. To the extent practicable and desirable, standing authorizations will be given for withdrawals from accounts of the Secretary. The following conditions apply to the sale of foreign exchange and to the requisition of foreign exchange without dollar payment:

      (a)  With respect to the sale of foreign exchange held in accounts of the Secretary, the payment in dollars shall be calculated at the rate of exchange that would otherwise be available to the United States for the acquisition of the foreign exchange for its official disbursements unless otherwise determined by the Treasury Department in consultation with the agencies concerned. When the rate that would otherwise be available to the United States is not readily ascertainable, the Treasury Department shall be consulted. The dollar proceeds realized from the sale of exchange shall be credited to the appropriate receipt, appropriation or refund account on the books of the Treasury. The dollar payment for foreign exchange purchased shall not be charged as an appropriation expenditure until the foreign exchange is disbursed.

      (b)  When foreign exchange is to be obtained from the Treasury Department without payment of dollars, the agency concerned shall furnish written certification that the exchange may be used without reimbursement to the Treasury, citing the relevant legal authority. In cases where international agreements or Bureau of the Budget allocations specify the programs for which foreign exchange may be used, the Secretary may transfer exchange to agencies without requiring a certification.

      § 281.7   Limitations.

#### § § 281.7

      The following limitations apply to the purchase and holding of foreign exchange:

      (a) Unless otherwise authorized by the Secretary, no agency or accountable officer shall purchase, or direct the purchase of, foreign exchange from any source outside the Government of the United States, except when exchange for the purpose intended is not available for purchase from within the Government.

      (b) All foreign exchange acquired by agencies by transfer from the Treasury Department, without payment of dollars, for the purpose of making authorized expenditures, shall be placed with accountable officers for account of the agencies concerned.

      (c) Unless otherwise authorized by the Secretary, no accountable officer shall purchase foreign exchange which, together with the balance on hand at the time of purchase, would exceed estimated requirements for a thirty-day period.

      (d) To the maximum extent possible, foreign exchange accounts which are earmarked for specific programs shall be maintained on an unfunded basis. Each agency responsible for administering international agreements pertaining to the use of foreign exchange held in funded accounts shall review the agreement and other considerations relevant to each such account at least annually to determine if the account can be placed on an unfunded basis, and shall initiate appropriate action to accomplish the objective of minimizing the number of funded program accounts and the amounts therein. The resulting determinations and the status of actions undertaken shall be furnished in writing to the Treasury Department within 60 days from the date of this regulation and each time thereafter that there is a change of status of a particular account, or as requested by the Treasury Department. Exchange which becomes eligible for removal from a funded status either as a result of the foregoing determinations, or because of the expiration of the period of availability for restricted use under the terms of international agreements, or for other reasons, shall be released promptly by the program agency for transfer to a nonrestricted Treasury sales account.

      Subpart A—Disbursing Official Offset

        § 285.1   Collection of past-due support by administrative offset.

#### § § 285.1

        (a)  For purposes of this section:

        means withholding funds payable by the United States (including funds payable by the United States on behalf of a State government) to, or held by the United States for, a person to satisfy a debt.

        as used in this section is synonymous with the term past-due support.

        includes an official who has authority to disburse public money pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3321 or another Federal law.

        means the Bureau of the _Fiscal Service_, a bureau of the Department of the Treasury. Fiscal Service is the designee of the Secretary of the Treasury for all matters concerning this section, unless otherwise specified.

        means the Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Child Support Enforcement.

        means the amount of support determined under a court order, or an order of an administrative procedure established under State law, for support and maintenance of a child, or of a child and the parent with whom the child is living, which has not been paid. The term child as used in this definition is not limited to minor children.

        means there has been an assignment of the support rights to the State, or the State making the request for offset is providing services to individuals pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 654(5) (section 454(5) of the Social Security Act), or the State is enforcing support pursuant to a cooperative agreement with or by an Indian tribal government.

        means the several _State_s of the United States. The term State also includes the District of Columbia, American Samoa, Guam, the United States Virgin Islands, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.

        means the _Secretary_ of the Treasury.

        (b)  Fiscal Service may enter into a reciprocal agreement with a State for the collection of past-due support being enforced by the State by administrative offset from certain Federal payments. Upon notification of past-due support either directly from a State which has entered into such an agreement or from HHS, disbursing officials of Fiscal Service or any other disbursing official of the United States shall offset Federal payments which are subject to offset under this section, to collect past-due support. The amount offset, minus the offset fee, shall be forwarded to the State to be distributed in accordance with applicable laws and procedures.

        (c)  Fiscal Service may enter into reciprocal agreements with States for disbursing officials of Fiscal Service and any other Federal disbursing official to offset certain Federal payments to collect past-due support being enforced by the State. The agreement shall contain any requirements which Fiscal Service considers appropriate to facilitate the offset and prevent duplicative efforts and shall require States to prescribe procedures governing the collection of past-due support by Federal administrative offset. For purposes of this section, reciprocal means of mutual benefit. An agreement between Fiscal Service and a State to collect past-due support by offsetting Federal payments will be considered of mutual benefit and it is not required that States conduct administrative offsets to collect debts owed to the Federal Government. States which have entered into an agreement with Fiscal Service pursuant to this section may thereafter request, in the manner prescribed herein, that an offset be performed. Such requests shall be made by the appropriate State disbursing official which, for purposes of this section, means an appropriate official of the State agency which administers or supervises the administration of the State plan under Title IV-D of the Social Security Act.

        (d)  (1) States notifying Fiscal Service of past-due support must do so in the manner and format prescribed by Fiscal Service. States notifying HHS of past-due support must do so in the manner and format prescribed by HHS. HHS shall notify Fiscal Service of all past-due support referred to HHS by States for collection by administrative offset provided that the requirements of paragraphs (d)(3) and (h) of this section have been met.

        (2) When a State has knowledge that past-due support is being enforced by more than one State, the State notifying Fiscal Service or HHS of the past-due support must inform any other State involved in enforcing the past-due support when it refers the debt for offset and when it receives the offset amount.

        (3) The notification of past-due support must be accompanied by a certification that the debt is past-due, legally enforceable, and that the State has complied with all the requirements as set forth in paragraph (h) of this section and with any requirements imposed by State law or procedure. For debts so certified, the Secretary may waive sections 552a (o) and (p) of Title 5, United States Code, where applicable, in accordance with the Secretary's authority under 31 U.S.C. 3716(f).

        (4) Fiscal Service may reject a notification of past-due support which does not comply with the requirements of this section. The State will be notified of the rejection along with the reason for the rejection.

        (e)  Fiscal Service will reject a notification of past-due support where the past-due support owed is less than $25.00. This amount may be adjusted from time to time by Fiscal Service to ensure that the cost of collection does not exceed the debt.

        (f)  Debts properly submitted to Fiscal Service for administrative offset will remain subject to collection by administrative offset until withdrawn by the State provided the debt remains past-due and legally enforceable.

        (g)  The State notifying Fiscal Service or HHS of past-due support shall, in the manner and in the time frames provided by Fiscal Service or HHS, notify Fiscal Service or HHS of deletions or decreases in the amount of a debt referred for collection by administrative offset. The State may notify Fiscal Service or HHS of any increases in the amount of a debt referred for collection by administrative offset provided the State has complied with the requirements of paragraph (h) of this section with regard to those amounts.

        (h)  (1) The State, or Fiscal Service or HHS on behalf of the State, if the State requests and Fiscal Service or HHS agrees, shall send a written notification, at least 30 days in advance of referral of the debt for offset, to the individual owing past-due support, informing the individual that the State intends to refer the debt for collection by administrative offset against Federal payments. The notice must also inform the individual of:

        (i) The nature and amount of the debt; and

        (ii) The right to an administrative review by the State referring the debt or, upon the request of the individual, by the State with the order upon which the referral was based, of the determination of the State with respect to the debt and of the procedures and time frames established by the State for such reviews.

        (2) Prior to referring a debt to Fiscal Service for collection by administrative offset, States must provide individuals with a reasonable opportunity to exercise the rights enumerated in paragraph (h)(1) of this section in accordance with procedures prescribed by the State.

        (i)  Federal payments subject to offset under this section include all Federal payments except:

        (1) Payments due to an individual under

        (i) Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965;

        (ii) The Social Security Act;

        (iii) Part B of the Black Lung Benefits Act;

        (iv) Any law administered by the Railroad Retirement Board;

        (2) Payments which the Secretary determines are exempt from offset in accordance with paragraph (k) of this section;

        (3) Payments from which collection of past-due support by administrative offset is expressly prohibited by law;

        (4) Payments made under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (except that tax refund payments are subject to offset under separate authority); and

        (5) Payments made under the tariff laws of the United States.

        (j)  (1) Unless a lower maximum offset limitation is provided by applicable State law, the maximum part of a Federal salary payment per pay period subject to offset to collect past-due support shall not exceed those amounts set forth at section 1673(b)(2) (A) and (B) of Title 15, United States Code, as follows:

        (i) Fifty (50%) percent of the debtor's aggregate disposable earnings for any pay period, where the debtor asserts by affidavit, or by other acceptable evidence, that he/she is supporting a spouse and/or dependent child, other than the former spouse and/or child for whom support is being collected, except that an additional five (5%) percent will apply if it appears that such earnings are to enforce past-due support for a period which is twelve (12) weeks or more prior to the pay period to which the offset applies. A debtor shall be considered to be supporting a spouse and/or dependent child only if the debtor provides over half of the spouse's and/or dependent child's support.

        (ii) Sixty (60%) percent of the debtor's aggregate disposable earnings for any pay period where the debtor fails to assert by affidavit or establish by other acceptable evidence that he/she is supporting a spouse and/or dependent child, other than a former spouse and/or child for whom support is being collected, except that an additional five (5%) percent will apply if it appears that such earnings are to enforce past-due support for a period which is twelve (12) weeks or more prior to the pay period to which the offset applies.

        (2) The maximum allowable offset amount shall be reduced by the amount of any deductions in pay resulting from a garnishment order for support. Nothing in this rule is intended to alter rules applicable to processing garnishment orders for child support and/or alimony.

        (3) Federal salary payments subject to offset for the collection of past-due support include current basic pay, special pay, incentive pay, retainer pay, overtime, or in the case of an employee not entitled to basic pay, other authorized pay. Aggregate disposable earnings for purposes of determining the maximum amounts which may be offset under paragraph (j)(1) of this section is Federal salary pay remaining after the deduction of:

        (i) Any amount required by law to be withheld;

        (ii) Amounts properly withheld for Federal, State or local income tax purposes;

        (iii) Amounts deducted as health insurance premiums;

        (iv) Amounts deducted as normal retirement contributions, not including amounts deducted for supplementary coverage; and

        (v) Amounts deducted as normal life insurance premiums not including amounts deducted for supplementary coverage.

        (4) At least 30 days in advance of offset, the disbursing official shall send written notice to the debtor of the maximum offset limitations described in paragraph (j)(1) of this section. The notice shall include a request that the debtor submit supporting affidavits or other documentation necessary to determine the applicable offset percentage limitation. The notice shall also inform the debtor of the percentage that will be deducted if he/she fails to submit the requested documentation.

        (5) At the time the past-due support debt is submitted for offset, the State shall advise Fiscal Service or HHS if the maximum amount of a Federal salary payment that may be offset is less than the amount described under this paragraph.

        (k)  The Secretary will exempt from administrative offset under this part payments made under means-tested programs when requested by the head of the Federal agency which administers the program. For purposes of this section, means-tested programs are programs for which eligibility is based on a determination that income and/or assets of the beneficiary are inadequate to provide the beneficiary with an adequate standard of living without program assistance. The Secretary may exempt from administrative offset under this section any other class or type of payment upon the written request of the head of the agency which authorizes the payments. In determining whether or not to grant such exemptions, the Secretary shall give due consideration to whether administrative offset would tend to interfere substantially with or defeat the purposes of the payment agency's program.

        (l)  A fee which Fiscal Service has determined to be sufficient to reimburse Fiscal Service for the full cost of the offset procedure, shall be deducted from each offset amount. Fiscal Service will notify the States, annually and in advance, of the amount of the fee to be charged for each offset.

        (m) —(1)  Disbursing officials of the Department of the Treasury, the Department of Defense, the United States Postal Service, or any other Government corporation, any disbursing official of the United States designated by the Secretary, or any disbursing official of an executive department or agency that disburses Federal payments shall offset payments subject to offset under this section to satisfy, in whole or part, a debt owed by the payee. Disbursing officials shall compare payment certification records with records of debts submitted to Fiscal Service for collection by administrative offset. A match will occur when the taxpayer identifying number and name control of a payment record are the same as the taxpayer identifying number and name control of a debt record. The taxpayer identifying number for an individual is the individual's social security number. When a match occurs and all other requirements for offset have been met, the disbursing official shall offset the payment to satisfy, in whole or part, the debt. Any amounts not offset shall be paid to the payee. The amount that can be offset from a single payment is the lesser of the amount of the debt (including interest, penalties, and administrative costs); the amount of the payment; or the amount of the payment available for offset if a statute or regulation prohibits offset of the entire amount. Debts remain subject to collection by offset until paid in full.

        (2)  Fiscal Service will transmit amounts collected for debts, less fees charged under paragraph (l) of this section, to HHS or to the appropriate State. If Fiscal Service learns that an erroneous offset payment has been made to HHS or any State, Fiscal Service will notify HHS or the appropriate State that an erroneous offset payment has been made. Fiscal Service may deduct the amount of the erroneous offset payment from amounts payable to HHS or the State, as the case may be. Alternatively, upon Fiscal Service' request, the State shall return promptly to the affected payee or Fiscal Service an amount equal to the amount of the erroneous payment (unless the State previously has paid such amounts, or any portion of such amounts, to the affected payee). HHS and States shall notify Fiscal Service any time HHS or a State returns an erroneous offset payment to an affected payee. Fiscal Service and HHS, or the appropriate State, will adjust their debtor records accordingly.

        (n)  (1) A levy pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 shall take precedence over deductions under this section.

        (2) Offsets will be applied first to past-due support being enforced by the State before any other offsets under this part.

        (o)  (1) Disbursing officials of Fiscal Service or any other disbursing official which conducts an offset will notify the payee in writing of the occurrence of the offset to satisfy past-due support. The notice shall inform the payee of the type and amount of the payment that was offset; the identity of the State which requested the offset; and a contact point within the State that will handle concerns regarding the offset. Disbursing officials shall not be liable for failure to provide this notice.

        (2) Disbursing officials of Fiscal Service or any other disbursing official which conducts an offset under this section will share with HHS, upon request by the Secretary of HHS, information contained in payment certification records of persons who are delinquent in child support obligations that would assist in the collection of such debts. When no offset is conducted, disbursing officials of Fiscal Service or any other disbursing official, will provide such information to HHS to the extent such information is available from offset activities conducted by Fiscal Service and other disbursing officials.

        (p)  Neither the disbursing official nor the agency authorizing the payment shall be liable for the amount of the administrative offset on the basis that the underlying obligation, represented by the payment before the administrative offset was taken, was not satisfied. Disbursing officials will notify the agency authorizing the payment that the offset has occurred so that the agency authorizing the payment may direct any inquiries concerning the offset to the appropriate State.

        (q)  Fiscal Service will ensure that an individual's Social Security number will not be visible on the outside of any package it sends by mail. In addition, Fiscal Service generally will redact or partially redact Social Security numbers in documents it sends by mail; however, to administer administrative offset, Fiscal Service (and other disbursing officials) may include Social Security numbers in mailed documents, including, for example:

        (1) In interoffice and interagency communications;

        (2) In notices, including notices to the debtor or payee that an offset has or will occur, when the Social Security number is (or is embedded in) a creditor agency's account number, debt identification number, or debtor identification number;

        (3) In response to a request of a debtor or a debtor's representative for records of Fiscal Service's offset activities; and

        (4) When required by law.

        § 285.2   Offset of tax refund payments to collect past-due, legally enforceable nontax debt.

#### § § 285.2

        (a)  For purposes of this section:

        means a Federal agency owed a claim that seeks to collect that claim through tax refund offset.

        or  refers to an amount of money, funds, or property which has been determined by an agency official to be due the United States from any person, organization, or entity, except another Federal agency. For the purposes of this section, the terms “_claim_” and “debt” are synonymous and interchangeable and includes debt administered by a third party acting as an agent for the Federal Government.

        means a person who owes a debt or claim. The term “person” includes any individual, organization or entity, except another Federal agency.

        means the Bureau of the _Fiscal Service_, a bureau of the Department of the Treasury.

        means the Internal Revenue Service, a bureau of the Department of the Treasury.

        means withholding or reducing a tax refund payment by an amount necessary to satisfy a debt owed by the payee(s) of a tax refund payment.

        means any overpayment of Federal taxes to be refunded to the person making the overpayment after the IRS makes the appropriate credits as provided in 26 U.S.C. 6402(a) and 26 CFR 6402-3(a)(6)(i) for any liabilities for any tax on the part of the person who made the overpayment.

        (b)  (1) A Federal agency (as defined in 26 U.S.C. 6402(g)) that is owed by a person a past-due, legally enforceable nontax debt shall notify Fiscal Service of the amount of such debt for collection by tax refund offset. However, any agency subject to section 9 of the Act of May 18, 1933 (16 U.S.C. 831h) owed such a debt may, but is not required to, notify Fiscal Service of the amount of such debt for collection by tax refund offset.

        (2) Fiscal Service will compare tax refund payment records, as certified by the IRS, with records of debts submitted to Fiscal Service. A match will occur when the taxpayer identifying number (as that term is used in 26 U.S.C. 6109) and name (or derivation of the name, known as a “name control”) of a payment certification record are the same as the taxpayer identifying number and name control of a debtor record. When a match occurs and all other requirements for tax refund offset have been met, Fiscal Service will reduce the amount of any tax refund payment payable to a debtor by the amount of any past-due, legally enforceable debt owed by the debtor. Any amounts not offset will be paid to the payee(s) listed in the payment certification record.

        (3) This section does not apply to any debt or claim arising under the Internal Revenue Code.

        (4)(i) This section applies to Federal Old Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance (OASDI) overpayments provided the requirements of 31 U.S.C. 3720A(f)(1) and (2) are met with respect to such overpayments.

        (ii) For purposes of this section,  means any overpayment of benefits made to an individual under title II of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 401 ).

        (5) A creditor agency is not precluded from using debt collection procedures, such as wage garnishment, to collect debts that have been submitted to Fiscal Service for purposes of offset under this part. Such debt collection procedures may be used separately or in conjunction with offset collection procedures.

        (c)  Prior to submitting debts to Fiscal Service for collection by tax refund offset, Federal agencies shall promulgate temporary or final regulations under 31 U.S.C. 3716 and 31 U.S.C. 3720A, governing the agencies' authority to collect debts by administrative offset, in general, and offset of tax refund payments, in particular.

        (d) —(1)  For purposes of this section, when a Federal agency refers a past-due, legally enforceable debt to Fiscal Service for tax refund offset, the agency will certify to Fiscal Service that:

        (i) The debt is past-due and legally enforceable in the amount submitted to Fiscal Service and that the agency will ensure that collections are properly credited to the debt;

        (ii) The creditor agency has made reasonable efforts to obtain payment of the debt in that the agency has:

        (A) Submitted the debt to Fiscal Service for collection by administrative offset and complied with the provisions of 31 U.S.C. 3716(a) and related regulations, to the extent that collection of the debt by administrative offset is not prohibited by statute;

        (B) Notified, or has made a reasonable attempt to notify, the debtor that the debt is past-due, and unless repaid within 60 days after the date of the notice, will be referred to Fiscal Service for tax refund offset;

        (C) Given the debtor at least 60 days to present evidence that all or part of the debt is not past-due or legally enforceable, considered any evidence presented by the debtor, and determined that the debt is past-due and legally enforceable; and

        (D) Provided the debtor with an opportunity to make a written agreement to repay the amount of the debt;

        (iii) The debt is at least $25; and

        (iv) In the case of an OASDI overpayment—

        (A) The individual is not currently entitled to monthly insurance benefits under title II of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 401 );

        (B) The notice describes conditions under which the Commissioner of Social Security is required to waive recovery of the overpayment, as provided under 42 U.S.C. 404(b); and

        (C) If the debtor files a request for a waiver under 42 U.S.C. 404(b) within the 60-day notice period, the agency has considered the debtor's request.

        (2)  (i) For purposes of paragraph (d)(1)(iii)(B) of this section, a creditor agency has made a reasonable attempt to notify the debtor if the agency uses the current address information contained in the agency's records related to the debt. Agencies may, but are not required to, obtain address information from the IRS pursuant to 26 U.S.C. 6103(m)(2), (4), or (5).

        (ii) For purposes of paragraph (d)(1)(iii)(C) of this section, if the evidence presented by the debtor is considered by an agent of the creditor agency, or other entities or persons acting on the agency's behalf, the debtor must be accorded at least 30 days from the date the agent or other entity or person determines that all or part of the debt is past-due and legally enforceable to request review by an officer or employee of the agency of any unresolved dispute. The agency must then notify the debtor of its decision.

        (3)  A Federal agency will submit past-due, legally enforceable debt information for tax refund offset to Fiscal Service in the time and manner prescribed by Fiscal Service. For each debt, the creditor agency will include the following information:

        (i) The name and taxpayer identifying number (as defined in 26 U.S.C. 6109) of the debtor who is responsible for the debt;

        (ii) The amount of such past-due and legally enforceable debt;

        (iii) The date on which the debt became past-due;

        (iv) The designation of the Federal agency or subagency referring the debt; and

        (v) In the case of an OASDI overpayment, a certification by the Commissioner of Social Security designating whether the amount payable to the agency is to be deposited in either the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund or the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund, but not both.

        (4)  If, after referring a past-due, legally enforceable debt to Fiscal Service as provided in paragraph (d)(3) of this section, a creditor agency determines that an error has been made with respect to the information transmitted to Fiscal Service, or if an agency receives a payment or credits a payment to the account of a debtor referred to Fiscal Service for offset, or if the debt amount is otherwise incorrect, the agency shall promptly notify Fiscal Service and make the appropriate correction of the agency's records. Creditor agencies will provide certification as required under paragraph (d)(1) of this section for any increases to amounts owed.

        (5) Fiscal Service may reject a certification which does not comply with the requirements of paragraph (d)(1) of this section. Upon notification of the rejection and the reason for the rejection, a creditor agency may resubmit the debt with a corrected certification.

        (6)(i) Creditor agencies may submit debts to Fiscal Service for collection by tax refund offset irrespective of the amount of time the debt has been outstanding. Accordingly, all nontax debts, including debts that were delinquent for ten years or longer prior to December 28, 2009 may be collected by tax refund offset.

        (ii) For debts outstanding more than ten years on or before December 28, 2009, creditor agencies must certify to Fiscal Service that the notice of intent to offset described in paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(B) of this section was sent to the debtor after the debt became ten years delinquent. This requirement will apply even in a case where notice was also sent prior to the debt becoming ten years delinquent, but does not apply to any debt that could be collected by offset without regard to any time limitation prior to December 28, 2009.

        (e)  (1)(i) Fiscal Service will notify the payee(s) to whom the tax refund payment is due, in writing of:

        (A) The amount and date of the offset to satisfy a past-due, legally enforceable nontax debt;

        (B) The creditor agency to which this amount has been paid or credited; and

        (C) A contact point within the creditor agency that will handle concerns or questions regarding the offset.

        (ii) The notice in paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section will also advise any non-debtor spouse who may have filed a joint tax return with the debtor of the steps which a non-debtor spouse may take in order to secure his or her proper share of the tax refund. See paragraph (f) of this section.

        (2) Fiscal Service will advise each creditor agency of the names, mailing addresses, and identifying numbers of the debtors from whom amounts of past-due, legally enforceable debt were collected and of the amounts collected from each debtor for that agency. Fiscal Service will not advise the creditor agency of the source of payment from which such amounts were collected. If a payment from which an amount of past-due, legally enforceable debt is to be withheld is payable to two individual payees, Fiscal Service will notify the creditor agency and furnish the name and address of each payee to whom the payment was payable.

        (3) At least weekly, Fiscal Service will notify the IRS of the names and taxpayer identifying numbers of the debtors from whom amounts of past-due, legally enforceable debt were collected and the amounts collected from each debtor.

        (f)  If the person filing a joint return with a debtor owing the past-due, legally enforceable debt takes appropriate action to secure his or her proper share of a tax refund from which an offset was made, the IRS will pay the person his or her share of the refund and request that Fiscal Service deduct that amount from amounts payable to the creditor agency. Fiscal Service and the creditor agency will adjust their debtor records accordingly.

        (g)  Fiscal Service will transmit amounts collected for past-due, legally enforceable debts, less fees charged under paragraph (h) of this section, to the creditor agency's account. If an erroneous payment is made to any agency, Fiscal Service will notify the creditor agency that an erroneous payment has been made. The agency shall pay promptly to Fiscal Service an amount equal to the amount of the erroneous payment (without regard to whether any other amounts payable to such agency have been paid).

        (h)  The creditor agency will reimburse Fiscal Service and the IRS for the full cost of administering the tax refund offset program. Fiscal Service will deduct the fees from amounts collected prior to disposition and transmit a portion of the fees deducted to reimburse the IRS for its share of the cost of administering the tax refund offset program. To the extent allowed by law, creditor agencies may add the offset fees to the debt.

        (i)  Any reduction of a taxpayer's refund made pursuant to 26 U.S.C. 6402(d) shall not be subject to review by any court of the United States or by the Secretary of the Treasury, Fiscal Service or IRS in an administrative proceeding. No action brought against the United States to recover the amount of this reduction shall be considered to be a suit for refund of tax. Any legal, equitable, or administrative action by any person seeking to recover the amount of the reduction of the overpayment must be taken against the Federal creditor agency to which the amount of the reduction was paid. Any action which is otherwise available with respect to recoveries of overpayments of benefits under 42 U.S.C. 404 must be taken against the Commissioner of Social Security.

        (j)  Access to and use of confidential tax information in connection with the tax refund offset program are restricted by 26 U.S.C. 6103. Generally, agencies will not receive confidential tax information from Fiscal Service. To the extent such information is received, agencies are subject to the safeguard, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements of 26 U.S.C. 6103(p)(4) and the regulations thereunder. The agency shall inform its officers and employees who access or use confidential tax information of the restrictions and penalties under the Internal Revenue Code for misuse of confidential tax information.

        (k)  This section applies to tax refund payments payable under 26 U.S.C. 6402 after January 1, 1998.

        § 285.3   Offset of tax refund payments to collect past-due support.

#### § § 285.3

        (a)  For purposes of this section:

        as used in this section is synonymous with the term past-due support unless otherwise indicated.

        as used in this section means a person who owes past-due support.

        means the Bureau of the _Fiscal Service_, a bureau of the Department of the Treasury.

        means the Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Child Support Enforcement.

        means the Internal Revenue Service, a bureau of the Department of the Treasury.

        means the amount of support, determined under a court order, or an order of an administrative process established under State law, for support and maintenance of a child, or of a child and the parent with whom the child is living, which has not been paid, as defined in 42 U.S.C. 664(c).

        means the several _State_s of the United States. The term “State” also includes the District of Columbia, American Samoa, Guam, the United States Virgin Islands, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.

        means withholding or reducing a tax refund payment by an amount necessary to satisfy a debt owed by the payee(s) of a tax refund payment.

        means any overpayment of Federal taxes to be refunded to the person making the overpayment after the IRS makes the appropriate credits as provided in 26 U.S.C. 6402(a) and 26 CFR 6402-3(a)(6)(i) for any liabilities for any Federal tax on the part of the person who made the overpayment.

        (b)  (1) Past-due support will be collected by tax refund offset upon notification to Fiscal Service in accordance with 26 U.S.C. 6402(c), 42 U.S.C. 664 and this section. Collection by offset under 26 U.S.C. 6402(c) is a collection procedure separate from the collection procedures provided by 26 U.S.C. 6305 and 26 CFR 301.6305-1, relating to the assessment and collection of certain child and spousal support liabilities. Tax refund offset may be used separately or in conjunction with the collection procedures provided in 26 U.S.C. 6305, as well as other collection procedures.

        (2) Fiscal Service will compare tax refund payment records, as certified by the IRS, with records of debts submitted to Fiscal Service. A match will occur when the taxpayer identifying number (as that term is used in 26 U.S.C. 6109) and name of a payment certification record are the same as the taxpayer identifying number and name of a delinquent debtor record. When a match occurs and all other requirements for tax refund offset have been met, Fiscal Service will reduce the amount of any tax refund payment payable to a debtor by the amount of any past-due support debt owed by the debtor. Any amounts not offset will be paid to the payee(s) listed in the payment certification record.

        (c) —(1)  Past-due support qualifies for tax refund offset if:

        (i)(A) There has been an assignment of the support obligation to a State and the amount of past-due support is not less than $25.00, or such higher amount as HHS rules may allow, whichever is greater; or

        (B) A State agency is providing support collection services under 42 U.S.C. 654(4) and the amount of the past-due support is not less than $500.00; and

        (ii) A notification of liability for past-due support has been received by Fiscal Service as prescribed by paragraphs (c)(2) or (c)(3) of this section.

        (2)  States notifying HHS of past-due support shall do so in the manner and format prescribed by HHS. The notification of liability shall be accompanied by a certification that the State has complied with the requirements contained in paragraph (c)(4) of this section and with any requirements applicable to the offset of Federal tax refunds to collect past-due support imposed by State law or procedures. HHS shall consolidate and transmit to Fiscal Service the information contained in the notifications of liability for past-due support submitted by the States provided that the State has certified that the requirements of paragraph (c)(4) of this section have been met.

        (3)  States must notify HHS of past-due support in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (c)(2) of this section unless HHS rules authorize notification to Fiscal Service directly. If authorized by HHS rules, States may notify Fiscal Service directly of past-due support. States notifying Fiscal Service directly of past-due support shall do so in the manner and format prescribed by Fiscal Service. The notification of liability shall be accompanied by a certification that the State has complied with the requirements contained in paragraph (c)(4) of this section and with any requirements applicable to the offset of Federal tax refunds to collect past-due support imposed by State law or procedures. Fiscal Service may reject a notification of past-due support which does not comply with the requirements of this section. Upon notification of the rejection and the reason for rejection, the State may resubmit a corrected notification.

        (4)  The State, or HHS if the State requests and HHS agrees, is required to provide a written notification to the debtor, pursuant to the provisions of 42 U.S.C. 664(a)(3) and 45 CFR 303.72(e), informing the debtor that the State intends to refer the debt for collection by tax refund offset. The notice also shall:

        (i) Instruct the debtor of the steps which may be taken to contest the State's determination that past-due support is owed or the amount of the past-due support;

        (ii) Advise any non-debtor who may file a joint tax return with the debtor of the steps which a non-debtor spouse may take in order to secure his or her proper share of the tax refund; and

        (iii) In cases when a debt is being enforced by more than one State, advise the debtor of his or her opportunities to request a review with the State enforcing collection or the State issuing the support order as prescribed by the provisions of 45 CFR 303.72(g).

        (5)  The State shall, in the manner and in the time frames provided by Fiscal Service or HHS, notify Fiscal Service or HHS of any deletion or net decrease in the amount of past-due support referred to Fiscal Service, or HHS as the case may be, for collection by tax refund offset. The State may notify Fiscal Service or HHS of any increases in the amount of the debt referred to Fiscal Service for collection by tax refund offset provided that the State has complied with the requirements of paragraph (c)(4) of this section with regard to those debts.

        (6)  When a State has knowledge that the debt is being enforced by more than one State, the State notifying Fiscal Service, or HHS as the case may be, of the debt shall inform any such other State involved in enforcing the debt when it receives the offset amount.

        (d)  (1) As provided in 26 U.S.C. 6402, a tax refund payment shall be reduced in the following order of priority:

        (i) First, by the amount of any past-due support which is to be offset under 26 U.S.C. 6402(c) and 42 U.S.C. 464;

        (ii) Second, by the amount of any past-due, legally enforceable debt owed to a Federal agency which is to be offset under 26 U.S.C. 6402(d), 31 U.S.C. 3720A and § 285.2 of this part; and

        (iii) Third, by the amount of any past-due, legally enforceable debt owed to States (other than past-due support) which is to be offset under 26 U.S.C. 6402(e) or 26 U.S.C. 6402(f).

        (2) Reduction of the tax refund payment pursuant to 26 U.S.C. 6402(a), (c), (d), and (e) shall occur prior to crediting the overpayment to any future liability for an internal revenue tax. Any amount remaining after tax refund offset under 26 U.S.C. 6402(a), (c), (d), and (e) shall be refunded to the taxpayer, or applied to estimated tax, if elected by the taxpayer pursuant to IRS regulations.

        (e)  (1)(i) Fiscal Service shall notify the debtor in writing of:

        (A) The amount and date of the offset to satisfy past-due support;

        (B) The State to which this amount has been paid or credited; and

        (C) A contact point within the State that will handle concerns or questions regarding the offset.

        (ii) The notice in paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section also will advise any non-debtor who may have filed a joint tax return with the debtor of the steps which a non-debtor spouse may take in order to secure his or her proper share of the tax refund. See paragraph (f) of this section.

        (2) Fiscal Service will advise HHS of the names, mailing addresses, and identifying numbers of the debtors from whom amounts of past-due support were collected, of the amounts collected from each debtor through tax refund offset, the names of any non-debtor spouses who may have filed a joint return with the debtor, and of the State on whose behalf each collection was made. Alternatively, Fiscal Service will provide such information to each State that refers debts directly to Fiscal Service. Fiscal Service will inform HHS and each State that the payment source is a tax refund payment.

        (3) At least weekly, Fiscal Service will notify the IRS of the names and taxpayer identifying numbers of the debtors from whom amounts owed for past-due support were collected from tax refund offsets and the amounts collected from each debtor.

        (4) At such time and in such manner as Fiscal Service and HHS agree, but no less than annually, Fiscal Service will advise HHS of the States which have furnished notices of past-due support, the number of cases in each State with respect to which such notices have been furnished, the amount of past-due support sought to be collected by each State, and the amount of such tax refund offset collections actually made in the case of each State. As Fiscal Service and HHS may agree, Fiscal Service may provide additional offset-related information about States which have furnished notices of past-due support.

        (f)  If the person filing a joint return with a debtor owing the past-due support takes appropriate action to secure his or her proper share of a tax refund from which an offset was made, the IRS will pay the person his or her share of the refund and request that Fiscal Service deduct that amount from amounts payable to HHS or the State, as the case may be. Fiscal Service and HHS, or the appropriate State, will adjust their debtor records accordingly.

        (g)  Fiscal Service will transmit amounts collected for debts, less fees charged under paragraph (i) of this section, to HHS or to the appropriate State. If IRS notifies Fiscal Service that a tax refund payment that was offset was erroneous or otherwise not due to the taxpayer, Fiscal Service will notify HHS or the appropriate State that the tax refund payment was not eligible for offset. Subject to paragraph (h) of this section, Fiscal Service may deduct the amount of the erroneous offset funds from amounts payable to HHS or the State, as the case may be; or, upon Fiscal Service's request, the State shall return promptly to the affected taxpayer or Fiscal Service an amount equal to the amount of the erroneous funds (unless the State previously has forwarded such amounts, or any portion of such amounts, to the affected taxpayer). HHS and States shall notify Fiscal Service any time HHS or a State returns an erroneous offset payment to an affected taxpayer. Fiscal Service and HHS, or the appropriate State, will adjust their debtor records accordingly.

        (h)  If IRS notifies Fiscal Service on or after January 1, 2016, that a tax refund payment that was offset was erroneous or otherwise not due to the taxpayer, Fiscal Service shall not deduct the amount of the erroneous offset funds from amounts due to HHS or the State, or otherwise demand return of the offset funds from the State pursuant to paragraph (g) of this section, if the date of IRS's notification to Fiscal Service in paragraph (g) is more than six months after the date the tax refund was offset ( the tax refund payment date); and the State has already forwarded the funds as required or authorized by 42 U.S.C. 657. This paragraph does not apply to paragraph (f) of this section.

        (i)  The State will pay a fee to Fiscal Service for the full cost of administering the tax refund offset program. The fee (not to exceed $25 per case submitted) will be established annually in such amount as Fiscal Service and HHS agree to be sufficient to reimburse Fiscal Service for the full cost of the offset procedure. Fiscal Service will deduct the fees from amounts collected prior to disposition and transmit a portion of the fees deducted to reimburse the IRS for its share of the cost of administering the tax refund offset program. Fees will be charged only for actual tax refund offsets completed.

        (j)  In accordance with 26 U.S.C. 6402(f), any reduction of a taxpayer's refund made pursuant to 26 U.S.C. 6402(c), (d), or (e) shall not be subject to review by any court of the United States or by the Secretary of the Treasury, Fiscal Service or IRS in an administrative proceeding. No action brought against the United States to recover the amount of this reduction shall be considered to be a suit for refund of tax.

        (k)  Access to and use of confidential tax information in connection with the tax refund offset program is permitted to the extent necessary in establishing appropriate agency records, locating any person with respect to whom a reduction under 26 U.S.C. 6402(c) is sought for purposes of collecting the debt, and in the defense of any litigation or administrative procedure ensuing from a reduction made under section 6402(c).

        (l)  This section applies to tax refund payments payable under 26 U.S.C. 6402 after January 1, 1999.

        (m)  Fiscal Service will ensure that an individual's Social Security number will not be visible on the outside of any package it sends by mail. In addition, Fiscal Service generally will redact or partially redact Social Security numbers in documents it sends by mail; however, to administer the tax refund offset program, Fiscal Service (and other disbursing officials) may include Social Security numbers in mailed documents, including, for example:

        (1) In interoffice and interagency communications;

        (2) In notices, including notices to the debtor or payee that an offset has or will occur, when the Social Security number is (or is embedded in) a creditor agency's account number, debt identification number, or debtor identification number;

        (3) In response to a request of a debtor or a debtor's representative for records of Fiscal Service's offset activities; and

        (4) When required by law.

        § 285.4   Offset of Federal benefit payments to collect past-due, legally enforceable nontax debt.

#### § § 285.4

        (a)  (1) This section sets forth special rules applicable to the offset of Federal benefit payments payable to an individual under the Social Security Act (other than Supplemental Security Income (SSI) payments), part B of the Black Lung Benefits Act, or any law administered by the Railroad Retirement Board (other than payments that such Board determines to be tier 2 benefits) to collect delinquent nontax debt owed to the United States.

        (2) As used in this section, benefit payments “due to” an individual, “payable to” an individual, and/or benefit payments “received by” an individual, refer to those benefit payments expected to be paid to an individual before any amounts are offset to satisfy the payee's delinquent debt owed to the United States. Nothing in these phrases, similar phrases, or this section is intended to imply or confer any new or additional rights or benefits on an individual with respect to his or her entitlement to benefit payments. The Bureau of the Fiscal Service (Fiscal Service), the Social Security Administration, the Railroad Retirement Board, and other payment agencies are not liable for the amount offset from an individual's benefit payment on the basis that the underlying obligation, represented by the payment before the offset was taken, was not satisfied. See 31 U.S.C. 3716(c)(2)(A).

        (b)  As used in this section:

        or  means withholding funds payable by the United States (including funds payable by the United States on behalf of a State government) to, or held by the United States for, a person to satisfy a debt.

        or  means a department, agency, court, court administrative office, or instrumentality in the executive, judicial, or legislative branch of the Federal Government, including government corporations.

        means a Federal benefit payment payable to an individual under the Social Security Act (other than SSI payments), part B of the Black Lung Benefits Act, or any law administered by the Railroad Retirement Board (other than payments that such Board determines to be tier 2 benefits). The amount of the covered benefit payment payable to a debtor for purposes of this section will be the amount after reduction or deduction required under the laws authorizing the program. Reductions to recover benefit overpayments are excluded from the covered benefit payment when calculating amounts available for offset.

        means a Federal agency owed a debt that seeks to collect that debt through administrative offset.

        or  means an amount of money, funds, or property which has been determined by an agency official to be due the United States from any person, organization, or entity except another Federal agency. _Debt_ or _claim_ does not include a debt or claim arising under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 or the tariff laws of the United States.

        means a person who owes a debt. The term “person” includes any individual, organization or entity, except another Federal agency.

        means an official who has authority to disburse public money pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3321 or another law, including an official of the Department of the Treasury, the Department of Defense, the United States Postal Service, or any other government corporation, or any official of the United States designated by the Secretary of the Treasury to disburse public money.

        means the Bureau of the _Fiscal Service_, a bureau of the Department of the Treasury.

        means a covered benefit payment payable to a payee on a recurring basis at monthly intervals that is not expressly limited in duration, at the time the first payment is made, to a period of less than 12 months.

        means a person who is due a payment from a disbursing official. For purposes of this section, a “payee” is a person who is entitled to the benefit of all or part of a payment from a disbursing official.

        means the identifying number described under section 6109 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. 6109). For an individual, the taxpayer identifying number generally is the individual's social security number.

        (c)  Disbursing officials shall offset payments to satisfy, in whole or in part, debts owed by the payee. Disbursing officials shall compare payment records with records of debts submitted to Fiscal Service for collection by administrative offset. A match will occur when the taxpayer identifying number and name of the payee (as defined in paragraph (b) of this section) on a payment record are the same as the taxpayer identifying number and name of the debtor on a debt record. When a match occurs and all other requirements for offset have been met, the disbursing official shall offset the payment to satisfy, in whole or in part, the debt. Any amounts not offset shall be paid to the payee. Covered benefit payments, i.e., payments made to individuals under the Social Security Act (other than Supplemental Security Income (SSI) payments), part B of the Black Lung Benefits Act, or any law administered by the Railroad Retirement Board (RRB) (other than tier 2 benefit payments) are among the types of payments which may be offset to collect debts owed to the United States. Offset of covered benefit payments are subject to the limitations contained in this section. Offsets of covered benefit payments will occur only if the name and taxpayer identifying number of the person who is entitled to the benefit of all or a part of the payment matches the name and taxpayer identifying number of the debtor.

        (d)  Creditor agencies must notify Fiscal Service of all past-due, legally enforceable debt delinquent for more than 120 days for purposes of collection by administrative offset. Creditor agencies may notify Fiscal Service of all debt delinquent for less than 120 days for purposes of collection by administrative offset. Prior to such notification, creditor agencies must certify to Fiscal Service that the debt is past-due, legally enforceable, and that the creditor agency has provided the debtor with notice and an opportunity for a review in accordance with the provisions of 31 U.S.C. 3716(a) and other applicable law.

        (e)  (1) The amount offset from a monthly covered benefit payment shall be the lesser of:

        (i) The amount of the debt, including any interest, penalties and administrative costs;

        (ii) An amount equal to 15% of the monthly covered benefit payment; or

        (iii) The amount, if any, by which the monthly covered benefit payment exceeds $750.

        (2) A debtor shall not receive a refund of any amounts offset if the debtor's monthly covered benefit payments are reduced, suspended, terminated, or otherwise not received for a period of 12 months.

        (3)  (i) A debtor receives monthly Social Security benefits of $850. The amount offset is the lesser of $127.50 (15% of $850) or $100 (the amount by which $850 exceeds $750). In this example, the amount offset is $100 (assuming the debt is $100 or more).

        (ii) A debtor receives monthly Social Security benefits of $1250. The amount offset is the lesser of $187.50 (15% of $1250) or $500 (the amount by which $1250 exceeds $750). In this example, the amount offset is $187.50 (assuming the debt is $187.50 or more).

        (iii) A debtor receives monthly Social Security payments of $650. No amount will be offset because $650 is less than $750.

        (f)  (1) Before offsetting a covered benefit payment, the disbursing official will notify the payee in writing of the date offset will commence. The notice shall inform the payee of the type of payment that will be offset; the identity of the creditor agency which requested the offset; and a contact point within the creditor agency that will handle concerns regarding the offset.

        (2) The disbursing official conducting the offset will notify the payee in writing of the occurrence of the offset to satisfy, in whole or in part, a delinquent debt owed to the United States. The notice shall inform the payee of the type and amount of the payment that was offset; the identity of the creditor agency which requested the offset; and a contact point within the creditor agency that will handle concerns regarding the offset.

        (3) Non-receipt by the debtor of the notices described in paragraphs (f)(1) and (f)(2) of this section shall not impair the legality of the administrative offset.

        (g)  A fee which Fiscal Service has determined to be sufficient to cover the full cost of the offset procedure, shall be deducted from each offset amount. Creditor agencies may add this fee to the debt if not otherwise prohibited by law.

        (h)  The disbursing official conducting the offset will transmit amounts collected for debts, less fees charged under paragraph (g) of this section, to the appropriate creditor agency. If an erroneous offset payment is made to a creditor agency, the disbursing official will notify the creditor agency that an erroneous offset payment has been made. The disbursing official may deduct the amount of the erroneous offset payment from future amounts payable to the creditor agency. Alternatively, upon the disbursing official's request, the creditor agency shall return promptly to the disbursing official or the affected payee an amount equal to the amount of the erroneous payment. The disbursing official and the creditor agency shall adjust the debtor records appropriately.

        § 285.5   Centralized offset of Federal payments to collect nontax debts owed to the United States.

#### § § 285.5

        (a)  (1) This section governs the centralized offset of Federal payments to collect delinquent, nontax debts owed to Federal agencies in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3716, 3720A and 26 U.S.C. 6402 and applicable regulations. The Department of the Treasury's Bureau of the Fiscal Service (Fiscal Service) administers centralized offset through the Treasury Offset Program. Offset occurs when the Federal government withholds part or all of a debtor's Federal payment to satisfy the debtor's delinquent debt owed to the government.

        (2) Special rules apply to the collection of delinquent, nontax debts through the centralized offset of certain types of Federal payments, including tax refunds (31 CFR 285.2), Federal benefit payments (31 CFR 285.4), and Federal salary payments (31 CFR 285.7). While this rule applies to such payments, nothing in this rule is intended to contradict any provision of those more specific sections. To the extent any provision of this rule is inconsistent with a more specific provision of § 285.2, § 285.4 or § 285.7 of this part, the more specific provision shall apply.

        (3) The receipt of collections pursuant to this section does not preclude a Federal agency from pursuing other debt collection remedies in conjunction with centralized offset. Nothing in this section precludes an agency from pursuing all available debt collection remedies simultaneously, provided that collections do not exceed the amount of the debt, including any interest, penalties, and administrative costs.

        (b)  As used in this section:

        or  means a department, agency or subagency, court, court administrative office, or instrumentality in the executive, judicial, or legislative branch of the Federal Government, including government corporations.

        means the offset of Federal payments through the Treasury Offset Program to collect debts which creditor agencies have certified pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3716(c), 3720A(a) and applicable regulations. The term “centralized offset” includes the Treasury Offset Program's processing of offsets of Federal payments disbursed by disbursing officials other than Fiscal Service.

        has the same meaning as found at 31 U.S.C. 3701(e)(1) and means any Federal agency that is owed a claim or debt that seeks to collect that claim or debt through offset of Federal payments.

        or  has the meaning contained in 31 U.S.C. 3701(b) and means any amount of money, funds, or property that has been determined by an appropriate official of the Federal government to be owed to the United States by a person, organization, or entity, except another Federal agency. The terms “debt” and “_claim_” are synonymous and include debt administered by a third party acting as an agent for the Federal Government. For purposes of this section, the term “debt” does not include debts arising under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. 1 ), the tariff laws of the United States, or the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 301 ), except to the extent provided in sections 204(f) and 1631(b)(4) of such Act (42 U.S.C. 404(f) and 1383(b)(4)(A), respectively) and 31 U.S.C. 3716(c).

        means a Federal agency or a unit or subagency within a Federal agency that has been designated by the Secretary to collect debt owed to the United States.

        means a person who owes a debt to the United States.

        or  refers to the status of a debt and means a debt has not been paid by the date specified in the agency's initial written demand for payment, or applicable agreement or instrument (including a post-delinquency payment agreement), unless other payment arrangements satisfactory to the creditor agency have been made. Nothing in this section is intended to define whether a debt is delinquent or _past-due_ for purposes other than offset under this section.

        means information about a past-due, legally enforceable debt submitted by a creditor agency to Fiscal Service for purposes of offset in accordance with the provisions of this section. Information about a past-due, legally enforceable debt includes, but is not limited to, the amount of the debt and the debtor's name, address, and taxpayer identifying number.

        means an official who has authority to disburse public money pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3321 or another law, including an official of the Department of the Treasury, the Department of Defense, the United States Postal Service, or any other government corporation, or any official of the United States designated by the Secretary of the Treasury to disburse public money.

        means the Bureau of the _Fiscal Service_, a bureau of the Department of the Treasury and its disbursing office. Fiscal Service is responsible for administering centralized offset.

        refers to a characteristic of a debt and means there has been a final agency determination that the debt, in the amount stated, is due, and there are no legal bars to collection by offset. Debts that are not legally enforceable for purposes of this section include, but are not limited to, debts subject to the automatic stay in bankruptcy proceedings or debts covered by a statute that prohibits collection of such debt by offset. For example, if a delinquent debt is the subject of a pending administrative review process required by statute or regulation, and if collection action during the review process is prohibited, the debt is not considered legally enforceable for purposes of this section. Nothing in this section is intended to define whether a debt is legally enforceable for purposes other than offset under this section.

        means the taxpayer identifying number and name (or derivative thereof) of the payee on a payment record are the same as the taxpayer identifying number and name of the debtor on a delinquent debt record.

        means withholding funds payable by the United States to, or held by the United States for, a person to satisfy a debt owed by the payee.

        has the same meaning as “delinquent”, as defined above.

        means a person who is due a payment from a disbursing official as certified by the payment agency. For purposes of this section, a “payee” is a person who is entitled to the benefit of all or part of a payment from a disbursing official.

        means any agency that transmits payment requests, in the form of certified payment vouchers or other similar forms, to a disbursing official for disbursement.

        means information contained on a payment request, in the form of a certified payment voucher or other similar form, that has been transmitted to a disbursing official for disbursement in accordance with the provisions of 31 U.S.C. 3325 and 3528 or other applicable law. For purposes of matching, “payment record” may include information extracted from a payment request. Such information could include, but is not limited to, the amount and type of payment and the payee's name, address, and taxpayer identifying number.

        means an individual, corporation, partnership, association, organization, State or local government, or any other type of entity other than a Federal agency.

        means a payment to an individual that is expected to be payable to a payee at regular intervals, at least four times annually. The term “recurring payment” does not include payments made pursuant to a Federal contract, grant or cooperative agreement.

        means a person named as payee on the payment voucher certified by the payment agency who is acting on behalf of a person entitled to receive the benefit of all or part of the payment.

        means the _Secretary_ of the Treasury.

        means the identifying number described under section 6109 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. 6109). For an individual, the taxpayer identifying number is generally the individual's social security number.

        (c)  (1) Creditor agencies shall submit delinquent debts to Fiscal Service for purposes of offset in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section.

        (2) Disbursing officials shall compare payment records with delinquent debt records submitted to Fiscal Service for collection by offset. When a match occurs, and all other requirements for offset have been met, the disbursing official shall offset the payment to satisfy, in whole or part, the payee's debt to the extent allowed by law. The disbursing official shall pay any amounts not offset to the payee. See paragraphs (e), (f), (g), and (h) of this section.

        (d) —(1)  As required by 31 U.S.C. 3716(c)(6), and in accordance with the provisions of this section, a creditor agency shall notify Fiscal Service of all legally enforceable debts over 120 days delinquent that are owed to the creditor agency. By complying with this requirement, creditor agencies will satisfy the requirement of 31 U.S.C. 3720A(a) to notify the Secretary of past due, legally enforceable debt for purposes of tax refund offset. If a debt which is over 120 days delinquent is considered not legally enforceable solely because it is under review as described in paragraph (d)(6)(ii)(C) of this section, the agency must submit the debt to Fiscal Service for collection by offset within 30 days of completing the review.

        (2)  Creditor agencies may notify Fiscal Service of any debt that is less than 120 days delinquent, so long as the requirements of paragraph (d)(3) of this section are met.

        (3)  (i) A debt submitted to Fiscal Service for collection by centralized offset must be:

        (A) Past-due in the amount stated by the creditor agency;

        (B) Legally enforceable;

        (C) More than $25, or such other amount as Fiscal Service may prescribe; and

        (D) Not secured by collateral subject to a pending foreclosure action, unless the creditor agency certifies that offset will not affect the Government's rights to the secured collateral.

        (ii) The creditor agency must certify that the debt is eligible for collection by offset, as required in paragraph (d)(6) of this section.

        (iii) Debts owed by foreign sovereigns may be referred to Treasury Offset Program at the discretion of the creditor agency to the extent allowed by law, but are excluded from mandatory referral under paragraph (d)(1) of this section.

        (iv) In accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3719 and the procedures promulgated thereunder, creditor agencies must report to Treasury the amount of debt over 120 days delinquent eligible for the Treasury Offset Program. The procedures require that such report include the amount of debt over 120 days delinquent that the creditor agency has determined is not eligible for the Treasury Offset Program and the reasons for such determination.

        (v) Creditor agencies may submit nontax debts to Fiscal Service for collection by centralized offset irrespective of the amount of time the debt has been outstanding. Accordingly, all nontax debts, including debts that were outstanding for ten years or longer prior to June 11, 2009 may be collected by centralized offset.

        (4)  Prior to submitting a debt to Fiscal Service for purposes of offset, Federal agencies shall prescribe regulations in accordance with the requirements of 31 U.S.C. 3716(b), 31 CFR 901.3(b)(4), 31 U.S.C. 3720A(a), and 31 CFR 285.2(c). Before submitting debts to Fiscal Service for purposes of offsetting Federal salary payments, creditor agencies must also publish regulations pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 5514, 31 CFR 285.7(d)(2), and 5 CFR 550.1104.

        (5)  For each debt submitted to Fiscal Service for offset, the creditor agency shall provide the following information:

        (i) Name and taxpayer identifying number of the person who owes the debt;

        (ii) Debtor's address last known to the creditor agency;

        (iii) The amount of the debt (including, as applicable, interest, penalties and administrative costs) and the date on which the debt became delinquent;

        (iv) The address and telephone number of the contact point within the creditor agency who will handle questions, concerns or communications regarding the debt;

        (v) Written certification as required in paragraph (d)(6) of this section; and

        (vi) Other information as may be requested by Fiscal Service.

        (6)  At the time the creditor agency notifies Fiscal Service of a debt for purposes of collection by offset, the creditor agency shall provide, in the manner required by Fiscal Service, written certification to Fiscal Service that:

        (i) The debt meets the requirements described in paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section;

        (ii) In compliance with 31 U.S.C. 3716, 3720A, 26 U.S.C. 6402, and applicable regulations, the creditor agency has made a reasonable attempt to provide each debtor with:

        (A) Written notification, at least sixty days prior to submitting the debt and at the debtor's most current address known to the agency, of the nature and the amount of the debt, the intention of the creditor agency to collect the debt through offset, and an explanation of the rights of the debtor;

        (B) An opportunity to inspect and copy the records of the creditor agency with respect to the debt;

        (C) An opportunity for a review within the creditor agency of the determination of indebtedness, including the opportunity to present evidence that all or part of the debt is not past-due or legally enforceable;

        (D) An opportunity to enter into a written repayment agreement with the creditor agency; and

        (E) In the case of Federal employees, an opportunity for a hearing prior to submitting the debt for Federal salary offset. See 5 U.S.C. 5514 and 5 CFR 550.1104. (See 31 CFR 285.7(d), which describes the authority to waive the salary offset certification as a prerequisite to referring the debt for other types of offsets.)

        (iii) For debts outstanding more than ten years on or before June 11, 2009, the notice of intent to offset described in paragraph (d)(6)(ii)(A) of this section was sent to the debtor after the debt was outstanding for more than ten years, and that the debtor was afforded the rights described in paragraphs (d)(6)(ii)(B) through (E). This requirement will apply even in a case where notice was also sent prior to the debt being outstanding for ten years but does not apply to any debt that could be collected by offset without regard to any time limitation prior to June 11, 2009.

        (iv) The creditor agency has complied with all statutes, regulations, and policies applicable to the creditor agency's assessment of interest, penalties and administrative costs (including, as applicable, 31 U.S.C. 3717), and that the creditor agency has provided a written notice to debtors explaining the creditor agency's requirements concerning any such charges assessed against those debtors;

        (v) The individual signing the certification has the delegated authority to execute the certification on behalf of the head of the creditor agency; and

        (vi) Such additional information that Fiscal Service may from time to time require in compliance with law, regulation or policy.

        (7)  After a debt has been submitted to Fiscal Service for purposes of collection by offset, the creditor agency shall provide, at least annually, in the manner and time frames required by Fiscal Service, written certification to Fiscal Service that:

        (i) The debt continues to meet the requirements described in paragraph (d)(3) of this section; and

        (ii) The creditor agency has properly credited all collections to the debt balance (other than collections received through centralized offset).

        (8)  Agencies will provide the certification in a form and manner prescribed by Fiscal Service. Fiscal Service will instruct agencies as to the form such written certifications will take and how certifications can be delivered to Fiscal Service, including, but not limited to, the use of electronic data transmission.

        (9)  A creditor agency that also designates disbursing officials pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3321(c) is not required to certify debts arising out of its operations to Fiscal Service before such agency's disbursing officials offset to collect such claims. This paragraph (d)(9) does not apply to Fiscal Service when it submits debts which it is servicing pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3711(g).

        (10)  (i) When submitting debts for offset, the creditor agency must properly credit all collections, other than collections received from centralized offset.

        (ii) The creditor agency shall update delinquent debt records, in the manner and time frames required by Fiscal Service, to reflect any amounts credited by the creditor agency to the debtor's account after submission of the debt to Fiscal Service (other than credits for amounts collected by centralized offset).

        (iii) The creditor agency may update delinquent debt records to reflect any increases in the amount of the debt submitted to Fiscal Service for collection by offset provided that the creditor agency has complied with the requirements of paragraph (d)(6) of this section with regard to the increased amounts.

        (iv) The creditor agency shall notify Fiscal Service immediately of any change in the status of the legal enforceability of the debt—for example, if the creditor agency receives notice that the debtor has filed for bankruptcy protection.

        (v) The creditor agency shall notify Fiscal Service if it has returned any monies to the debtor/payee.

        (11)  If a creditor agency has transferred a debt to Fiscal Service or a Treasury-designated debt collection center pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3711(g) and 31 CFR 285.12, or if a creditor agency has referred a debt to the Department of Justice for enforced collection, then Fiscal Service, the debt collection center, or the Department of Justice, as the case may be, is responsible for submitting the debt information to Fiscal Service to satisfy the creditor agency's obligations under 31 U.S.C. 3716(c)(6) and this section.

        (12)  Generally, the amount of an offset will be calculated as set forth in paragraph (f)(2) of this section. If the creditor agency certifies to Fiscal Service that the creditor agency has determined the offset amount allowed by law would result in financial hardship to the debtor and that a lesser offset amount (specified either in dollar amount or as a percentage of the payment) is reasonable and appropriate based on the debtor's financial circumstances, then the disbursing official shall offset such lesser amount specified by the creditor agency.

        (13)  Nothing in this section requires any creditor agency to duplicate any notice or opportunity for hearing or review provided to the debtor prior to offset.

        (e) —(1)  Except as set forth in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, all Federal payments are eligible for offset under this section. Eligible Federal payments include, but are not limited to, Federal wage, salary, and retirement payments, vendor and expense reimbursement payments, certain benefit payments, travel advances and reimbursements, grants, fees, refunds, judgments (including those certified for payment pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 1304), tax refunds, and other payments made by Federal agencies.

        (2)  This section does not apply to the following payments:

        (i) Black Lung Part C benefit payments, or Railroad Retirement tier 2 payments;

        (ii) Payments made under the tariff laws of the United States;

        (iii) Veterans Affairs benefit payments to the extent such payments are exempt from offset pursuant to 38 U.S.C. 5301;

        (iv) Payments made under any program administered by the Secretary of Education under title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 for which payments are certified by the Department of Education;

        (v) Payments made under any other Federal law if offset is expressly prohibited by Federal statute;

        (vi) Payments made under any program for which the Secretary has granted an exemption in accordance with the provisions of 31 U.S.C. 3716(c)(3)(B) and paragraph (e)(7) of this section; and

        (vii) Federal loan payments other than travel advances.

        (3)  (i) Specific rules apply with respect to the offset of the following types of payments:

        (A) Social Security benefit payments (excluding Supplemental Security Income payments), Black Lung (part B) payments, and Railroad Retirement (other than tier 2) payments to the extent such payments are subject to offset under 31 U.S.C. 3716(c)(3)(A) (see 31 CFR 285.4);

        (B) Federal salary payments (see 31 CFR 285.7; 5 CFR 550.1101 through 550.1108); and

        (C) Tax refund payments (see 31 CFR 285.2).

        (ii) This section governs the offset of such payments to the extent that this section is not inconsistent with the special rules that apply for a particular type of payment.

        (4)  If a payment is certified to more than one payee (, joint payees), the entire payment (including a tax refund payment) will be subject to offset for a debt of either payee, unless otherwise prohibited by law or regulation. See 31 CFR 285.2(g) regarding offset of joint tax refunds and claims to return offset funds to the non-debtor, joint payee.

        (5)  If a payment is made to a person solely in that person's capacity as a representative payee for another person having the beneficial interest in a payment, the disbursing official shall offset that payment only to collect debts owed by the person having the beneficial interest in the payment. Payment agencies are responsible for identifying representative payees.

        (6)  (i) If a person, including a Federal contractor, assigns the right to receive a Federal payment to a third party (the “assignee”), the assigned payment will be subject to offset to collect a delinquent debt owed by the assignee.

        (ii) An assigned payment will also be subject to offset to collect delinquent debts owed by the assignor unless:

        (A) In accordance with 41 U.S.C. 15(e)-(f), the payment has been properly assigned to a financial institution pursuant to a Federal contract, the contract contains provisions prohibiting the payment from being reduced or offset for debts owed by the contractor, and the debt arose independently of the contract; or

        (B) pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3727, the payment is being made to the assignee as settlement or satisfaction of a claim brought by the assignee against the creditor agency based upon the contract, and the debt of the contractor arises independently of the contract; or

        (C) the debtor has properly assigned the right to such payments and the debt arose after the effective date of the assignment.

        (7) —(i)  The Secretary will exempt from centralized offset payments made under means-tested programs when requested by the head of the agency making such payments. For purposes of this section “means-tested programs” are those which base eligibility on a determination that the income and/or assets of the beneficiary are inadequate to provide the beneficiary with an adequate standard of living without program assistance.

        (ii)  Upon written request from the payment agency, the Secretary may exempt classes of payments which are not means-tested. Payment agencies may request that the Secretary exempt 100% of each payment in a payment class or that the Secretary exempt a specific lesser percentage. The Secretary will consider such requests under standards prescribed by the Secretary and published on the Fiscal Service Web site.

        (iii)  The head of the payment agency must make a request for exemption in writing. The request must comply with the procedures published by Fiscal Service and made available at its Web site.

        (iv)  The Secretary will only exempt classes of payments. Requests for exemption of individual payments will not be considered.

        (8)  (i) Payment agencies shall prepare and submit payment vouchers in the manner prescribed by the disbursing official to ensure that all payments legally eligible for offset will be offset and all payments not eligible will not be offset. Payment agencies shall notify the disbursing agency, in the manner prescribed by Fiscal Service, that a payment is a recurring payment.

        (ii) Payment agencies shall also review the nature of payments the agency certifies and notify Fiscal Service of any legal bars to centralized offset of payments.

        (9)  When an offset occurs, the debtor has received payment in full for the underlying obligation represented by the payment. Pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3716(c)(2)(A), neither the disbursing official nor the payment agency shall be liable for the amount of the offset on the basis that the underlying obligation was not satisfied. For example, if an agency certifies a payment to a Federal contractor for work completed or services provided, and that payment is offset to collect a delinquent debt that the contractor owes to another Federal agency, the contractor has been paid in full for its services. When the creditor agency credits the offset amount to the contractor's delinquent debt, the contractor has received full value for the services performed under the contract.

        (f) —(1)  When a match occurs and all other requirements for offset under 31 U.S.C. 3716(c), 3720A, and applicable regulations have been met, the disbursing official shall offset the payee's Federal payment to satisfy, in whole or part, the debt owed by the debtor. _Offset_s will continue until the debt, including any interest, penalties, and administrative costs, is paid in full or otherwise resolved to the satisfaction of the creditor agency.

        (2)  (i) Except as otherwise provided in 31 CFR 285.4(e) and 285.7(g) (addressing centralized offset of certain Federal benefit payments and salary payments, respectively), the disbursing official shall offset the lesser of:

        (A) The amount of the payment as shown on the payment record; or

        (B) The amount of the debt, including any interest, penalties and administrative costs; or

        (C) In the case of retirement annuity payments certified by the Office of Personnel Management, up to twenty-five percent of the amount of the payment as shown on the payment record.

        (ii) Notwithstanding paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section, if a creditor agency has specified another amount, either in dollars or as a percentage of the payment, pursuant to paragraph (d)(15) of this section, the disbursing official shall offset the amount specified by the creditor agency.

        (3)  (i) A levy pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 shall take precedence over deductions under this section.

        (ii) When a payment may be offset to collect more than one debt, amounts offset will be applied:

        (A) First, to satisfy any past-due support that that the State is collecting under section 464 of the Social Security Act (see 285.1 and 285.3 of this part);

        (B) Second, to satisfy any debts owed to Federal agencies, as described in this § 285.5; and

        (C) Third, to any debts owed to States for debts other than past-due support (see §§ 285.6 and 285.8 of this part).

        (g) —(1)  Before offsetting a recurring payment, the disbursing official, or Fiscal Service on behalf of the disbursing official, will notify the payee in writing when offsets will begin (which may be stated as a number of days or number of payments from the time of the notice) and the anticipated amount of such offset (which may be stated as a percentage of the payment). Such notice shall also provide the information contained in paragraph (g)(3) of this section. Failure to send such notice does not affect the validity of the offset.

        (2)  As described in paragraph (f)(3)(iii) of this section, Fiscal Service may suspend or reduce the application of collections from a recurring payment for one debt when another debt, which is owed by the same debtor and has a higher legal priority, is submitted to Fiscal Service for collection. The disbursing official is not required to send additional warning notices when collections for the lower priority debt resume; however, pursuant to paragraph (g)(3) of this section, each offset will be accompanied by an offset notice, which explains how the offset amounts were applied.

        (3)  When an offset occurs under this section, the disbursing official, or Fiscal Service on behalf of the disbursing official, shall notify the payee in writing that an offset has occurred including:

        (i) A description of the payment and the amount of offset taken;

        (ii) The identity of the creditor agency requesting the offset; and

        (iii) The address and telephone number of the contact point within the creditor agency who will handle concerns regarding the offset.

        (h)  (1) Fiscal Service will notify the creditor agency of all offsets made to collect the creditor agency's debts. Such notification shall include the complete name and taxpayer identifying number of each debtor/payee, the total amounts collected from each debtor/payee's payment, and the amount of any fees charged by Fiscal Service and any other disbursing official conducting offsets. Fiscal Service will not advise the creditor agency of the source of payment from which such amounts were collected.

        (2) When a non-Treasury disbursing official conducts the offset, that disbursing official will transmit to Fiscal Service all of the information necessary for Fiscal Service to send notification under paragraph (h)(1) of this section, including the amount of any fees that the creditor agency is responsible for paying.

        (3) Fiscal Service will make available to the payment agency the information contained in the notification of offset, so that the payment agency may direct any questions concerning the claim to the appropriate contact person in the creditor agency.

        (i)  (1) Fiscal Service will transmit amounts collected for debts, less fees charged pursuant to paragraph (j) of this section, to the appropriate creditor agency or agencies. Alternatively, Fiscal Service may bill the creditor agency for any fees charged pursuant to paragraph (j) of this section.

        (2) If Fiscal Service learns from a paying agency that a payment should not have been made, and thus not offset, Fiscal Service will notify the creditor agency. Fiscal Service may deduct the offset amount from future amounts payable to the creditor agency. Alternatively, upon Fiscal Service's request, the creditor agency shall return promptly to the disbursing official an amount equal to the amount of the offset (without regard to whether any other amounts payable to such disbursing official have been paid).

        (3) Generally, the disbursing official is not responsible for refunding money to debtors. The creditor agency shall notify Fiscal Service any time the creditor agency returns all or any part of an offset payment to an affected payee. See paragraph (d)(10)(v) of this section. Fiscal Service and the creditor agency shall adjust the debtor records appropriately.

        (j)  Fiscal Service may charge a fee sufficient to cover the full cost of implementing the centralized offset program, including the amount of any fees charged by other disbursing officials conducting an offset under this section. Fiscal Service may deduct the fees from amounts collected by offset or may bill the creditor agencies. Fiscal Service will charge fees only for actual offsets collected.

        (k)  As authorized by 31 U.S.C. 3716(f), Fiscal Service, under a delegation of authority from the Secretary, has waived certain requirements of the Computer Matching and Privacy Protection Act of 1988, Pub. L. No. 100-503, as amended, for matches between delinquent debt records and payment records for offset purposes upon written certification by the head of the creditor agency that the requirements of 31 U.S.C. 3716(a) have been met. Specifically, for administrative offset of Federal payments other than tax refunds, Fiscal Service has waived the requirements for a computer matching agreement contained in 5 U.S.C. 552a(o) and for post-match notice and verification contained in 5 U.S.C. 552a(p) so long as the creditor agency provides certification to Fiscal Service in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (d)(6) of this section. Such waiver is not necessary for offset of Federal tax refunds, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(a)(8)(B). The Data Integrity Board of the Department of the Treasury shall review and include in reports under 5 U.S.C. 552a(u)(3)(D) a description of the matching activities conducted for centralized offset under this section. No other Data Integrity Board is required to take any action under 5 U.S.C. 552a(u) concerning these computerized comparisons.

        (l)  Fiscal Service will ensure that an individual's Social Security number will not be visible on the outside of any package it sends by mail. In addition, Fiscal Service generally will redact or partially redact Social Security numbers in documents it sends by mail; however, to administer the Treasury Offset Program, Fiscal Service (and other disbursing officials) may include Social Security numbers in mailed documents, including, for example:

        (1) In interoffice and interagency communications;

        (2) In notices, including notices to the debtor or payee that an offset has or will occur, when the Social Security number is (or is embedded in) a creditor agency's account number, debt identification number, or debtor identification number;

        (3) In response to a request of a debtor or a debtor's representative for records of Fiscal Service's offset activities; and

        (4) When required by law.

        § 285.6   Administrative offset under reciprocal agreements with states.

#### § § 285.6

        (a)  (1) This section sets forth the rules that apply to the administrative offset of Federal nontax payments to collect delinquent debts owed to States. As set forth in 31 U.S.C. 3716(h), States may participate in administrative offset so long as they meet certain requirements, including entering into reciprocal agreements with the Secretary of the Treasury. Such reciprocal agreements may contain any requirements that the Secretary considers appropriate to facilitate offset. Participation in offset under this section is voluntary for both Fiscal Service and the States. This section prescribes the minimum requirements for such reciprocal agreements, including provisions applicable to the offset of State payments, pursuant to State law, to collect delinquent Federal debts. Such offsets are defined in this section as “State payment offsets.”

        (2) This section does not apply to the offset of Federal salary payments, Federal tax refunds (see 31 CFR 285.8), or the collection of past-due support debts (see 31 CFR 285.1 and 285.3).

        (b)  (1) Unless otherwise defined in paragraph § 285.5(b) of this subpart.

        (2) For purposes of this section:

        has the meaning set forth in 31 U.S.C. 3701(a) and means withholding funds payable by the United States to, or held by the United States for, a person to satisfy a _debt_ owed by the payee. The term  in this definition means a State debt.

        means a person who owes a debt to the United States or a State.

        means any amount of money, funds or property that has been determined by an appropriate official of the Federal government to be owed to the United States by a person, organization, or entity, except another Federal agency. The term includes debt administered by a third party acting as an agent for the Federal Government. For purposes of this section, the term “_Federal debt_” does not include debts arising under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. 1 ), the tariff laws of the United States, or the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 301 ), except to the extent provided in sections 204(f) and 1631(b)(4) of such Act (42 U.S.C. 404(f) and 1383(b)(4)(A), respectively) and 31 U.S.C. 3716(c).

        means withholding funds payable to a person to satisfy a debt owed by the payee.

        means a State that has entered into a reciprocal agreement under this section.

        means a written agreement between Fiscal Service and a State, entered into pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3716(h), which provides for administrative offset and State payment offset.

        has the meaning set forth in 31 U.S.C. 3701(b)(2) and includes the several states of the United _State_s, the District of Columbia, American Samoa, Guam, the United States Virgin Islands, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.

        means any amount of money, funds or property that has been determined by an appropriate State official to be owed to that State by a person, organization, or entity, except the United States, a foreign sovereign, or another State (including local governments within a State). For purposes of this rule, the term includes debt administered by a third party acting as an agent for the State.

        means withholding funds payable by a State to, or held by a State for, a person to satisfy a debt owed by the payee to the United States.

        (c)  Fiscal Service and other disbursing officials of the Federal Government will conduct administrative offset to collect past-due State debts certified to Fiscal Service, and participating States will conduct State payment offset to collect delinquent Federal debts in accordance with the terms of reciprocal agreements entered into between the States and Fiscal Service, acting on behalf of the Secretary. Upon notification of a delinquent State debt from a participating State to Fiscal Service, disbursing officials of the United States shall offset the Federal payments specified in the reciprocal agreement to collect the State debt. The amount offset, minus an offset fee, shall be forwarded to the State to be distributed in accordance with applicable laws and procedures. Upon notification of a delinquent Federal debt from Fiscal Service to a participating State, authorized officials of the participating State shall conduct State payment offset as specified in the applicable reciprocal agreement to collect the Federal debt.

        (d)  (1) Fiscal Service may enter into reciprocal agreements with States for administrative offset and State payment offset. The agreements shall contain any requirements which Fiscal Service considers appropriate to facilitate the offset and prevent duplicative efforts, and shall require States to prescribe procedures governing the collection of delinquent State debts which are substantially similar to requirements imposed on Federal agencies pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3716(b). States may prescribe such procedures through legislation or regulations, as deemed appropriate by State officials. States which have entered into a reciprocal agreement with Fiscal Service pursuant to this section may thereafter request, in the manner prescribed in the reciprocal agreement, that administrative offsets be performed. Such requests shall be made by the appropriate State disbursing official, which, for purposes of this section, means an appropriate official of the State agency that is responsible for collecting the State debt. Reciprocal agreements must be signed by a State official authorized to enter into such agreements.

        (2) Once Fiscal Service has entered into a reciprocal agreement with a State pursuant to this section, Fiscal Service may request that the State perform State payment offsets to collect delinquent Federal debts in accordance with the terms of the reciprocal agreement.

        (3) A duly executed reciprocal agreement is required before a State may request an administrative offset pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3716(h).

        (e) —(1)  A State debt submitted to Fiscal Service for collection by administrative offset must meet the debt eligibility requirements of 31 CFR 285.5(d)(3)(i).

        (2)  At the time a participating State notifies Fiscal Service of a State debt for purposes of collection by administrative offset under this section, the State shall comply with the certification requirements set forth in paragraph 31 CFR 285.5(d)(6) with the following two exceptions:

        (i) Paragraph (d)(6)(ii)(E)—Federal salary offset; and

        (ii) Paragraph (d)(6)(iii)—Federal requirements for the assessment of interest and penalties to Federal debts. Additionally, with respect to paragraph (d)(6)(ii) of § 285.5, States shall only be required to certify that they have complied with the requirements of 31 U.S.C. 3716 (not 31 U.S.C. 3720A or 26 U.S.C. 6402) and this section 285.6. States shall also certify that they have complied with any requirements imposed by State law or procedure that may be applicable to administrative offset.

        (f)  A State shall be deemed to have complied with the requirements of paragraph (e)(2) of this section with respect to any State debt that the State certified to Treasury for collection pursuant to § 285.8 of this part.

        (g)  (1) The Federal payments that will be offset to collect a participating State's debts shall be set forth in the reciprocal agreement. Federal payments that are excluded from administrative offset under this section include:

        (i) Any payments described in 31 CFR 285.5(e)(2) “Payments excluded from offset”;

        (ii) Payments due to an individual under the Social Security Act;

        (iii) Payments due an individual pursuant to part B of the Black Lung Benefits Act;

        (iv) Payments due an individual pursuant to any law administered by the Railroad Retirement Board;

        (v) Federal tax refunds; and

        (vi) Federal salary payments.

        (h)  (1) Disbursing officials shall conduct administrative offset under this section in the same manner as set forth in 31 CFR 285.5(f) through (i).

        (2) When a payee owes more than one delinquent State debt which has been referred to Fiscal Service for collection, amounts will be applied to delinquent State debts under this section after any amounts offset pursuant to any other section of this subpart A and any amounts levied pursuant 26 U.S.C. 6331.

        (i)  Neither the Federal disbursing official nor the agency authorizing the Federal payment shall be liable to a debtor for the amount of the administrative offset on the basis that the underlying obligation, represented by the payment before the administrative offset was taken, was not satisfied.

        (j)  (1) A State may set forth in the reciprocal agreement the requirements for Fiscal Service to follow when submitting a Federal debt for collection by State payment offset. Such agreements shall set forth all requirements contained in State law for the State payment offset. Such requirements, however, may not exceed the requirements for collecting Federal debts by administrative offset as set forth in § 285.5(d) of this subpart.

        (2) Fiscal Service shall certify to a participating State that each debt Fiscal Service submits for State payment offset has been certified by the Federal creditor agency to be delinquent, valid, and legally enforceable in the amount stated, and that the Federal creditor agency owed the debt has complied with the requirements of 31 U.S.C. 3716(a) prior to submitting the debt for offset.

        (k)  (1) An official of a participating State shall conduct State payment offset pursuant to the laws and regulations of the participating State; provided that:

        (i) If a payment is owed jointly to more than one payee, the entire payment shall be offset for a debt of either payee, unless otherwise prohibited by law or regulation; and

        (ii) If a payment is made to a person solely in that person's capacity as a representative payee for another person having the beneficial interest in the payment, the disbursing official shall offset that payment only to collect debts owed by the person having the beneficial interest in the payment.

        (2) Any prohibitions on offsetting a joint payment described in paragraph (k)(1)(i) of this section shall be set forth in the reciprocal agreement.

        (3) An official of the participating State shall notify the payee of the State payment offset. The reciprocal agreement may contain detailed guidance and procedures regarding sending such notice, but shall, at a minimum require that the notice inform the payee of:

        (i) The type and amount of the payment that was offset;

        (ii) The identity of the Federal agency that requested the offset; and

        (iii) A contact point within the Federal agency that will handle concerns regarding the offset.

        (l)  A debt properly submitted to Fiscal Service or the State for administrative offset or State payment offset shall remain subject to collection until withdrawn by the entity that submitted the debt for collection, provided the debt remains past-due and legally enforceable for purposes of administrative offset or State payment offset, as applicable. A debt which has been reduced to a judgment shall remain legally enforceable for purposes of administrative offset and State payment offset for as long as the judgment remains enforceable against the debtor.

        (m)  Fiscal Service shall deduct a fee from each administrative offset and State payment offset amount before transferring the balance of the offset funds to the State or Federal agency owed the debt. Pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3716(c)(4), the fee will be in an amount that Fiscal Service has determined to be sufficient to reimburse Fiscal Service for the full cost of the offset procedure. Fiscal Service will notify the States and creditor agencies, annually and in advance, of the amount of the fee Fiscal Service will charge for each offset.

        (n)  Fiscal Service will ensure that an individual's Social Security number will not be visible on the outside of any package it sends by mail. In addition, Fiscal Service generally will redact or partially redact Social Security numbers in documents it sends by mail; however, to administer administrative offset, Fiscal Service (and other disbursing officials) may include Social Security numbers in mailed documents, including, for example:

        (1) In interoffice and interagency communications;

        (2) In notices, including notices to the debtor or payee that an offset has or will occur, when the Social Security number is (or is embedded in) a creditor agency's account number, debt identification number, or debtor identification number;

        (3) In response to a request of a debtor or a debtor's representative for records of Fiscal Service's offset activities; and

        (4) When required by law.

        § 285.7   Salary offset.

#### § § 285.7

        (a)  (1) This section establishes Fiscal Service's procedures for the centralized offset of Federal salary payments to collect delinquent nontax debts owed to the United States. This process is known as centralized salary offset. Rules issued by the Office of Personnel Management contain the requirements Federal agencies must follow prior to conducting centralized or non-centralized salary offset and the procedures for requesting offsets directly from a paying agency, rather than through TOP. See 5 CFR 550.1101 through 550.1108.

        (2) This section implements the requirement under 5 U.S.C. 5514(a)(1) that all Federal agencies, using a process known as centralized salary offset computer matching, identify Federal employees who owe delinquent nontax debt to the United States. Centralized salary offset computer matching is the computerized comparison of delinquent debt records with records of Federal employees. The purpose of centralized salary offset computer matching is to identify those debtors whose Federal salaries should be offset to collect delinquent debts owed to the Federal Government.

        (3) This section specifies the delinquent debt records and Federal employee records that must be included in the salary offset matching process. For purposes of this section, delinquent debt records consist of the debt information submitted to the Bureau of the Fiscal Service for purposes of administrative offset as required under 31 U.S.C. 3716(c)(6). Agencies that submit their debt to Fiscal Service for purposes of administrative offset are not required to submit duplicate information for purposes of centralized salary offset computer matching under 5 U.S.C. 5514 and this section.

        (4) This section establishes an interagency consortium to implement centralized salary offset computer matching on a government-wide basis as required under 5 U.S.C. 5514(a)(1).

        (5) The receipt of collections from salary offsets does not preclude a creditor agency from pursuing other debt collection remedies, including the offset of other Federal payments to satisfy delinquent nontax debt owed to the United States. A creditor agency should pursue, when deemed appropriate by such agency, such debt collection remedies separately or in conjunction with salary offset.

        (6) This section does not govern the centralized offset of final salary payments or lump-sum payments made to employees who have left an agency's employ. The centralized offset of such payments is governed by § 285.5 of this part.

        (b)  For purposes of this section:

        means withholding funds payable by the United States to, or held by the United States for, a person to satisfy a debt owed by the payee.

        means a department, agency or subagency, court, court administrative office, or instrumentality in the executive, judicial, or legislative branch of the Federal government, including government corporations.

        means the computerized comparison of Federal employee records with delinquent debt records to identify Federal employees who owe such debts.

        means any agency that is owed a debt.

        means any amount of money, funds, or property that has been determined by an appropriate official of the Federal government to be owed to the United States by a person, including debt administered by a third party acting as an agent for the Federal Government. For purposes of this section, the term “debt” does not include debts arising under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C.).

        means information about a past-due, legally enforceable debt, submitted by a creditor agency to Fiscal Service for purposes of administrative offset (including salary offset) in accordance with the provisions of 31 U.S.C. 3716 and applicable regulations.

        means the Bureau of the _Fiscal Service_, a bureau of the Department of the Treasury.

        means the agency that employs the Federal employee who owes the debt and authorizes the payment of his or her current pay. A paying agency also includes an agency that performs payroll services on behalf of the employing agency.

        means administrative offset to collect a debt owed by a Federal employee from the current pay account of the employee.

        means the _Secretary_ of the Treasury or his or her delegate.

        means the identifying number described under section 6109 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. 6109). For an individual, the taxpayer identifying number is the individual's social security number.

        (c)  As required by the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 5514(a)(1), by issuance of this section, the Secretary establishes an interagency consortium to implement centralized salary offset computer matching. The consortium initially includes all agencies that disburse Federal salary payments, including but not limited to, Fiscal Service, the Department of Defense, the United States Postal Service, government corporations, and agencies with Treasury-designated disbursing officials. The membership of the consortium may be changed at the discretion of the Secretary, and the Secretary will be responsible for the ongoing coordination of the activities of the consortium.

        (d)  (1) As required under 5 U.S.C. 5514(a)(1), creditor agencies shall participate at least annually in centralized salary offset computer matching. By notifying Fiscal Service of all past-due, legally enforceable debts delinquent for more than 120 days for purposes of 31 U.S.C. 3716(c)(6), creditor agencies shall have met the requirement set forth in 5 U.S.C. 5514(a)(1). Additionally, creditor agencies may notify Fiscal Service of past-due, legally enforceable debts delinquent for less than 120 days for purposes of centralized offset.

        (2) Prior to submitting debts to Fiscal Service for purposes of administrative offset (including salary offset) and centralized salary offset computer matching, Federal agencies shall prescribe regulations in accordance with the requirements of 31 U.S.C. 3716 (administrative offset) and 5 U.S.C. 5514 (salary offset).

        (3) Prior to submitting a debt to Fiscal Service for purposes of collection by administrative offset, including salary offset, creditor agencies shall provide written certification to Fiscal Service that:

        (i) The debt is past-due and legally enforceable in the amount submitted to Fiscal Service and that the creditor agency will ensure that collections (other than collections through offset) are properly credited to the debt;

        (ii) The creditor agency has complied with the provisions of 31 U.S.C. 3716 (administrative offset) and related regulations including, but not limited to, the provisions requiring that the creditor agency provide the debtor with applicable notices and opportunities for a review of the debt; and

        (iii) The creditor agency has complied with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 5514 (salary offset) and related regulations including, but not limited to, the provisions requiring that the creditor agency provide the debtor with applicable notices and opportunities for a hearing.

        (4) The creditor agency is not required to submit the certification set forth in paragraph (d)(3)(iii) of this section prior to submitting a debt to Fiscal Service. However, if the creditor agency does not provide such certification initially, the creditor agency shall provide the Federal employee with the notices and opportunity for a hearing, as required by 5 U.S.C. 5514 and applicable regulations, and shall make the necessary certification before the disbursing official offsets a salary payment pursuant to this section. A creditor agency may submit a debt without the requirement set forth in paragraph (d)(3)(iii) of this section, only if the creditor agency intends to complete the certification after complying with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 5514 and applicable regulations.

        (5) The creditor agency shall notify Fiscal Service immediately of any payments credited by the creditor agency to the debtor's account, other than credits for amounts collected by offset, after submission of the debt to Fiscal Service. The creditor agency also shall notify Fiscal Service immediately of any change in the status of the legal enforceability of the debt, for example, if the creditor agency receives notice that the debtor has filed for bankruptcy protection.

        (6) Creditor agencies may submit nontax debts to Fiscal Service for collection by centralized salary offset irrespective of the amount of time the debt has been outstanding. Accordingly, all nontax debts, including debts that were outstanding for ten years or longer prior to June 11, 2009, may be collected by centralized salary offset.

        (7) For debts that were outstanding more than ten years on or before June 11, 2009, creditor agencies must certify to Fiscal Service that the notice described in paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section was sent to the debtor after the debt was outstanding for ten years. This requirement will apply even in a case where notice was also sent prior to the debt being outstanding for ten years but does not apply to any debt that could be collected by offset without regard to any time limitation prior to June 11, 2009.

        (e)  (1) Delinquent debt records will be compared with Federal employee records maintained by members of the consortium or paying agencies. The records will be compared to identify Federal employees who owe delinquent debts for purposes of collecting the debt by administrative offset. A match will occur when the taxpayer identifying number and name of a Federal employee are the same as the taxpayer identifying number and name of a debtor.

        (2) As authorized by the provisions of 31 U.S.C. 3716(f), Fiscal Service, under a delegation of authority from the Secretary, has waived certain requirements of the Computer Matching and Privacy Protection Act of 1988, 5 U.S.C. 552a, as amended, for administrative offset, including salary offset, upon written certification by the head of the creditor agency that the requirements of 31 U.S.C. 3716(a) have been met. Specifically, Fiscal Service has waived the requirements for a computer matching agreement contained in 5 U.S.C. 552a(o) and for post-match notice and verification contained in 5 U.S.C. 552a(p). The creditor agency will provide certification in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (d)(3)(iii) of this section.

        (f)  When a match occurs and all other requirements for offset have been met, as required by the provisions of 31 U.S.C. 3716(c) the disbursing official shall offset the Federal employee's salary payment to satisfy, in whole or part, the debt owed by the employee. Alternatively, the paying agency, on behalf of the disbursing official, may deduct the amount of the offset from an employee's disposable pay before the employee's salary payment is certified to a disbursing official for disbursement. The salary paying agency shall use such records as it deems necessary to accurately calculate disposable pay in accordance with 5 CFR 550.1103.

        (g)  (1) The amount offset from a salary payment under this section shall be the lesser of:

        (i) The amount of the debt, including any interest, penalties and administrative costs; or

        (ii) An amount up to 15% of the debtor's disposable pay.

        (2) Alternatively, the amount offset may be an amount agreed upon, in writing, by the debtor and the creditor agency.

        (3) Offsets will continue until the debt, including any interest, penalties, and costs, is paid in full or otherwise resolved to the satisfaction of the creditor agency.

        (h)  (1) A levy pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 shall take precedence over other deductions under this section.

        (2) When a salary payment may be reduced to collect more than one debt, amounts offset under this section will be applied to a debt only after amounts have been applied to satisfy past-due support debts being collected by the State pursuant to Section 464 of the Social Security Act.

        (i)  (1) Before offsetting a salary payment, the disbursing official, or the paying agency on behalf of the disbursing official, shall notify the Federal employee in writing of the date deductions from salary will commence and of the amount of such deductions.

        (2)(i) When an offset occurs under this section, the disbursing official, or the paying agency on behalf of the disbursing official, shall notify the Federal employee in writing that an offset has occurred including:

        (A) A description of the payment and the amount of offset taken;

        (B) The identity of the creditor agency requesting the offset; and,

        (C) A contact point within the creditor agency that will handle concerns regarding the offset.

        (ii) The information described in paragraphs (i)(2)(i)(B) and (i)(2)(i)(C) of this section does not need to be provided to the Federal employee when the offset occurs if such information was included in a prior notice from the disbursing official or paying agency.

        (3) The disbursing official will advise each creditor agency of the names, mailing addresses, and taxpayer identifying numbers of the debtors from whom amounts of past-due, legally enforceable debt were collected and of the amounts collected from each debtor for that agency. The disbursing official will not advise the creditor agency of the source of payment from which such amounts were collected.

        (j)  Agencies that perform centralized salary offset computer matching services may charge a fee sufficient to cover the full cost for such services. In addition, Fiscal Service, or a paying agency acting on behalf of Fiscal Service, may charge a fee sufficient to cover the full cost of implementing the administrative offset program. Fiscal Service may deduct the fees from amounts collected by offset or may bill the creditor agencies. Fees charged for offset shall be based on actual administrative offsets completed.

        (k)  The disbursing official conducting the offset will transmit amounts collected for debts, less fees charged under paragraph (j) of this section, to the appropriate creditor agency. If an erroneous offset payment is made to a creditor agency, the disbursing official will notify the creditor agency that an erroneous offset payment has been made. The disbursing official may deduct the amount of the erroneous offset payment from future amounts payable to the creditor agency. Alternatively, upon the disbursing official's request, the creditor agency shall return promptly to the disbursing official or the affected payee an amount equal to the amount of the erroneous payment (without regard to whether any other amounts payable to such agency have been paid). The disbursing official and the creditor agency shall adjust the debtor records appropriately.

        § 285.8   Offset of tax refund payments to collect certain debts owed to States.

#### § § 285.8

        (a)  For purposes of this section:

        means past-due, legally enforceable State income tax obligation or unemployment compensation debt unless otherwise indicated.

        means a person who owes a debt.

        means the Bureau of the _Fiscal Service_, a bureau of the Department of the Treasury.

        means the Internal Revenue Service, a bureau of the Department of the Treasury.

        means a debt which resulted from:

        (1) A judgment rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction which has determined an amount of State income tax to be due,

        (2) A determination after an administrative hearing which has determined an amount of state income tax to be due and which is no longer subject to judicial review, or

        (3) A State income tax assessment (including self-assessments) which has become final in accordance with State law but not collected and which has not been delinquent for more than 10 years.

        means the several _State_s of the United States. The term “State” also includes the District of Columbia, American Samoa, Guam, the United States Virgin Islands, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.

        means _State income tax obligation_s as determined under State law. For purposes of this section, State income tax obligation includes any local income tax administered by the chief tax administration agency of the State.

        means withholding or reducing a tax refund overpayment by an amount necessary to satisfy a debt owed by the payee(s).

        means any overpayment of Federal taxes to be refunded to the person making the overpayment after the IRS makes the appropriate credits as provided in 26 U.S.C. 6402(a) and 26 CFR 6402-3(a)(6)(i) for any liabilities for any Federal tax on the part of the person who made the overpayment.

        has the same meaning as the term “covered unemployment debt” as defined in 26 U.S.C. 6402(f)(4), and means—

        (1) A past-due debt for erroneous payment of unemployment compensation due to fraud or the person's failure to report earnings which has become final under the law of a State certified by the Secretary of Labor pursuant to 26 U.S.C. 3304 and which remains uncollected;

        (2) Contributions due to the unemployment fund of a State for which the State has determined the person to be liable and which remain uncollected; and

        (3) Any penalties and interest assessed on such debt.

        (b)  (1) Fiscal Service will offset tax refunds to collect debt under this section in accordance with 26 U.S.C. 6402(e) and (f) and this section.

        (2) Fiscal Service will compare tax refund payment records, as certified by the IRS, with records of debts submitted to Fiscal Service. A match will occur when the taxpayer identifying number (as that term is used in 26 U.S.C. 6109) and name on a payment certification record are the same as the taxpayer identifying number and name (or derivative of the name) on a delinquent debt record. When a match occurs and all other requirements for tax refund offset have been met, Fiscal Service will reduce the amount of any tax refund payment payable to a debtor by the amount of any past-due, legally enforceable State income tax obligation or unemployment compensation debt owed by the debtor. Any amounts not offset will be paid to the payee(s) listed in the payment certification record.

        (3) Fiscal Service will only offset a tax refund payment for a State income tax obligation if the address shown on the Federal tax return for the taxable year of the overpayment is an address within the State seeking the offset.

        (c) —(1)  States shall notify Fiscal Service of debts in the manner and format prescribed by Fiscal Service. The notification of liability must be accompanied by a certification that the debt is past due and legally enforceable and that the State has complied with the requirements contained in paragraph (c)(3) of this section and with all Federal or State requirements applicable to the collection of debts under this section. With respect to State income tax obligations only, the certification must specifically state that none of the debts submitted for collection by offset are debts owed by an individual who has claimed immunity from State taxation by reason of being an enrolled member of an Indian tribe who lives on a reservation and derives all of his or her income from that reservation unless such claim has been adjudicated de novo on its merits in accordance with paragraph (c)(3). Fiscal Service may reject a notification that does not comply with the requirements of this section. Upon notification of the rejection and the reason for rejection, the State may resubmit a corrected notification.

        (2) Minimum amount of past-due, legally enforceable State income tax obligations that may be submitted. Fiscal Service only will accept notification of past-due, legally enforceable State income tax obligations of $25 or more or such higher amounts as determined by Fiscal Service. States will be notified annually of any changes in the minimum debt amount.

        (3)(i)  The State is required to provide a written notification to the debtor informing the debtor that the State intends to refer the debt for collection by tax refund offset. The notice must give the debtor at least 60 days to present evidence, in accordance with procedures established by the State, that all or part of the debt is not past due or not legally enforceable, or, in the case of a covered unemployment compensation debt, the debt is not due to fraud or the debtor's failure to report earnings. In the case of a State income tax obligation, the notice must be sent certified mail, return receipt requested.

        (ii)  The State must, in accordance with procedures established by the State, consider any evidence presented by a debtor in response to the notice described in paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section and determine whether an amount of such debt is past due and legally enforceable and, in the case of a covered unemployment compensation debt, the debt is due to fraud or the debtor's failure to report earnings. With respect to State income tax obligations only, where the debtor claims that he or she is immune from State taxation by reason of being an enrolled member of an Indian tribe who lives on a reservation and derives all of his or her income from that reservation, State procedures shall include de novo review on the merits, unless such claims have been previously adjudicated by a court of competent jurisdiction. States shall, upon request from the Secretary of the Treasury, make such procedures available to the Secretary of the Treasury for review.

        (iii)  Prior to submitting a debt to Fiscal Service for collection by tax refund offset the State must make reasonable efforts to collect the debt. Reasonable efforts include making written demand on the debtor for payment and complying with any other prerequisites to offset established by the State.

        (4)  The State shall, in the manner and in the time frames provided by Fiscal Service, notify Fiscal Service of any deletion or decrease in the amount of past-due, legally enforceable State income tax obligation or unemployment compensation debt referred to Fiscal Service for collection by tax refund offset. The State may notify Fiscal Service of any increases in the amount of the debt referred to Fiscal Service for collection by tax refund offset provided that the State has complied with the requirements of paragraph (c)(3) of this section with regard to those debts.

        (d)  (1) As provided in 26 U.S.C. 6402, a tax refund payment shall be reduced first by the amount of any past-due support being enforced under section 464 of the Social Security Act which is to be offset under 26 U.S.C. 6402(c); second by the amount of any past-due, legally enforceable debt owed to a Federal agency which is to be offset under 26 U.S.C. 6402(d); and third by any past-due, legally enforceable debt owed to a State (other than past-due support) which is to be offset under 26 U.S.C. 6402(e) or 26 U.S.C. 6402(f).

        (2) Reduction of the tax refund payment pursuant to 26 U.S.C. 6402(a), (c), (d), (e) and (f) shall occur prior to crediting the overpayment to any future liability for an internal revenue tax. Any amount remaining after tax refund offset under 26 U.S.C. 6402(a), (c), (d), (e) and (f) shall be refunded to the taxpayer, or applied to estimated tax, if elected by the taxpayer pursuant to IRS regulations.

        (3) If Fiscal Service receives notice from a State of more than one debt subject to this section that is owed by a debtor to the State, any overpayment by the debtor shall be applied against such debts in the order in which such debts accrued.

        (e)  (1) When an offset occurs, Fiscal Service shall notify the debtor in writing of:

        (i) The amount and date of the offset and that the purpose of the offset was to satisfy a past-due, legally enforceable State income tax obligation or unemployment compensation debt;

        (ii) The State to which this amount has been paid or credited; and

        (iii) A contact point within the State that will handle concerns or questions regarding the offset.

        (2) The notice in paragraph (e)(1) of this section also will advise any non-debtor spouse who may have filed a joint return with the debtor of the steps which the non-debtor spouse may take in order to secure his or her proper share of the tax refund. See paragraph (f) of this section.

        (3) Fiscal Service will advise States of the names, mailing addresses, and taxpayer identifying numbers of the debtors from whom amounts of State income tax obligations or unemployment compensation debts were collected, and of the amounts collected from each debtor through tax refund offset.

        (4) At least weekly, Fiscal Service will notify the IRS of the names and taxpayer identifying numbers of the debtors from whom amounts owed for past-due, legally enforceable State income tax obligations or unemployment compensation debts were collected from tax refund offsets and the amounts collected from each debtor.

        (f)  If the person filing a joint return with a debtor owing the past-due, legally enforceable State income tax obligation or unemployment compensation debt takes appropriate action to secure his or her proper share of a tax refund from which an offset was made, the IRS will pay the person his or her share of the refund and request that Fiscal Service deduct that amount from future amounts payable to the State or that Fiscal Service otherwise obtain the funds back from the State. Fiscal Service, or the appropriate State, will adjust their debtor records accordingly.

        (g)  Fiscal Service will transmit amounts collected for debts, less fees charged under paragraph (h) of this section, to the appropriate State. If Fiscal Service learns that an erroneous offset payment is made to any State, Fiscal Service will notify the appropriate State that an erroneous offset payment has been made. Fiscal Service may deduct the amount of the erroneous offset payment from future amounts payable to the State. Alternatively, upon Fiscal Service' request, the State shall return promptly to the affected taxpayer or Fiscal Service an amount equal to the amount of the erroneous payment (unless the State previously has paid such amounts, or any portion of such amounts, to the affected taxpayer). States shall notify Fiscal Service any time a State returns an erroneous offset payment to an affected taxpayer. Fiscal Service, or the appropriate State, will adjust their debtor records accordingly.

        (h)  The State will pay a fee to Fiscal Service to cover the full cost of offsets taken. The fee will be established annually in such amount as Fiscal Service determines to be sufficient to reimburse Fiscal Service for the full cost of the offset procedure. Fiscal Service will deduct the fees from amounts collected prior to disposition and transmit a portion of the fees deducted to reimburse the IRS for its share of the cost of administering the tax refund offset program for purposes of collecting past-due, legally enforceable State income tax obligations or unemployment compensation debts reported to Fiscal Service by the States. Fees will be charged only for actual tax refund offsets completed.

        (i)  In accordance with 26 U.S.C. 6402(g), any reduction of a taxpayer's refund made pursuant to 26 U.S.C. 6402(e) or (f) shall not be subject to review by any court of the United States or by the Secretary of the Treasury, Fiscal Service or IRS in an administrative proceeding. No action brought against the United States to recover the amount of this reduction shall be considered to be a suit for refund of tax. This subsection does not preclude any legal, equitable, or administrative action against the State to which the amount of such reduction was paid.

        (j)  Access to and use of confidential tax information in connection with the tax refund offset program is permitted to the extent necessary in establishing appropriate agency records, locating any person with respect to whom a reduction under 26 U.S.C. 6402(e) or (f) is sought for purposes of collecting the debt, and in the defense of any litigation or administrative procedure ensuing from a reduction made under section 6402(e) or (f).

        (k)  Fiscal Service will ensure that an individual's Social Security number will not be visible on the outside of any package it sends by mail. In addition, Fiscal Service generally will redact or partially redact Social Security numbers in documents it sends by mail; however, to administer the tax refund offset program, Fiscal Service (and other disbursing officials) may include Social Security numbers in mailed documents, including, for example:

        (1) In interoffice and interagency communications;

        (2) In notices, including notices to the debtor or payee that an offset has or will occur, when the Social Security number is (or is embedded in) a creditor agency's account number, debt identification number, or debtor identification number;

        (3) In response to a request of a debtor or a debtor's representative for records of Fiscal Service's offset activities; and

        (4) When required by law.

      Subpart B—Authorities Other Than Offset

        § 285.11   Administrative wage garnishment.

#### § § 285.11

        (a)  This section provides procedures for Federal agencies to collect money from a debtor's disposable pay by means of administrative wage garnishment to satisfy delinquent nontax debt owed to the United States.

        (b)  (1) This section applies to any Federal agency that administers a program that gives rise to a delinquent nontax debt owed to the United States and to any agency that pursues recovery of such debt.

        (2) This section shall apply notwithstanding any provision of State law.

        (3) Nothing in this section precludes the compromise of a debt or the suspension or termination of collection action in accordance with applicable law. See, for example, the Federal Claims Collection Standards (FCCS), 31 CFR parts 900-904.

        (4) The receipt of payments pursuant to this section does not preclude a Federal agency from pursuing other debt collection remedies, including the offset of Federal payments to satisfy delinquent nontax debt owed to the United States. A Federal agency may pursue such debt collection remedies separately or in conjunction with administrative wage garnishment.

        (5) This section does not apply to the collection of delinquent nontax debt owed to the United States from the wages of Federal employees from their Federal employment. Federal pay is subject to the Federal salary offset procedures set forth in 5 U.S.C. 5514 and other applicable laws.

        (6) Nothing in this section requires agencies to duplicate notices or administrative proceedings required by contract or other laws or regulations.

        (c)  As used in this section the following definitions shall apply:

        means a department, agency, court, court administrative office, or instrumentality in the executive, judicial, or legislative branch of the Federal Government, including government corporations. For purposes of this section, agency means either the agency that administers the program that gave rise to the debt or the agency that pursues recovery of the debt.

        means Monday through Friday. For purposes of computation, the last day of the period will be included unless it is a Federal legal holiday.

        means calendar day. For purposes of computation, the last day of the period will be included unless it is a Saturday, a Sunday, or a Federal legal holiday.

        or  means any amount of money, funds or property that has been determined by an appropriate official of the Federal Government to be owed to the United States by an individual, including debt administered by a third party as an agent for the Federal Government.

        means an individual who owes a delinquent nontax debt to the United States.

        means any nontax debt that has not been paid by the date specified in the agency's initial written demand for payment, or applicable agreement, unless other satisfactory payment arrangements have been made. For purposes of this section, the terms “debt” and “claim” are synonymous and refer to delinquent nontax debt.

        means that part of the debtor's compensation (including, but not limited to, salary, bonuses, commissions, and vacation pay) from an employer remaining after the deduction of health insurance premiums and any amounts required by law to be withheld. For purposes of this section, “amounts required by law to be withheld” include amounts for deductions such as social security taxes and withholding taxes, but do not include any amount withheld pursuant to a court order.

        means a person or entity that employs the services of others and that pays their wages or salaries. The term employer includes, but is not limited to, State and local Governments, but does not include an agency of the Federal Government.

        means information retained by the agency indicating the nature of the document to which it pertains, the date of mailing of the document, and to whom the document is being sent. _Evidence of service_ may be retained electronically so long as the manner of retention is sufficient for evidentiary purposes.

        means the process of withholding amounts from an employee's disposable pay and the paying of those amounts to a creditor in satisfaction of a withholding order.

        means any order for withholding or garnishment of pay issued by an agency, or judicial or administrative body. For purposes of this section, the terms “wage garnishment order” and “garnishment order” have the same meaning as “withholding order.”

        (d)  Whenever an agency determines that a delinquent debt is owed by an individual, the agency may initiate proceedings administratively to garnish the wages of the delinquent debtor.

        (e)  (1) At least 30 days before the initiation of garnishment proceedings, the agency shall mail, by first class mail, to the debtor's last known address a written notice informing the debtor of:

        (i) The nature and amount of the debt;

        (ii) The intention of the agency to initiate proceedings to collect the debt through deductions from pay until the debt and all accumulated interest, penalties and administrative costs are paid in full; and

        (iii) An explanation of the debtor's rights, including those set forth in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, and the time frame within which the debtor may exercise his or her rights.

        (2) The debtor shall be afforded the opportunity:

        (i) To inspect and copy agency records related to the debt;

        (ii) To enter into a written repayment agreement with the agency under terms agreeable to the agency; and

        (iii) For a hearing in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section concerning the existence or the amount of the debt or the terms of the proposed repayment schedule under the garnishment order. However, the debtor is not entitled to a hearing concerning the terms of the proposed repayment schedule if these terms have been established by written agreement under paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section.

        (3) The agency will retain evidence of service indicating the date of mailing of the notice.

        (f) —(1)  Agencies shall prescribe regulations for the conduct of administrative wage garnishment hearings consistent with this section or shall adopt this section without change by reference.

        (2)  The agency shall provide a hearing, which at the agency's option may be oral or written, if the debtor submits a written request for a hearing concerning the existence or amount of the debt or the terms of the repayment schedule (for repayment schedules established other than by written agreement under paragraph (e)(2)(ii)) of this section.

        (3)  (i) For purposes of this section, whenever an agency is required to afford a debtor a hearing, the agency shall provide the debtor with a reasonable opportunity for an oral hearing when the agency determines that the issues in dispute cannot be resolved by review of the documentary evidence, for example, when the validity of the claim turns on the issue of credibility or veracity.

        (ii) If the agency determines that an oral hearing is appropriate, the time and location of the hearing shall be established by the agency. An oral hearing may, at the debtor's option, be conducted either in-person or by telephone conference. All travel expenses incurred by the debtor in connection with an in-person hearing will be borne by the debtor. All telephonic charges incurred during the hearing will be the responsibility of the agency.

        (iii) In those cases when an oral hearing is not required by this section, an agency shall nevertheless accord the debtor a “paper hearing,” that is, an agency will decide the issues in dispute based upon a review of the written record. The agency will establish a reasonable deadline for the submission of evidence.

        (4)  Subject to paragraph (f)(13) of this section, if the debtor's written request is received by the agency on or before the 15th business day following the mailing of the notice described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, the agency shall not issue a withholding order under paragraph (g) of this section until the debtor has been provided the requested hearing and a decision in accordance with paragraphs (f)(10) and (f)(11) of this section has been rendered.

        (5)  If the debtor's written request is received by the agency after the 15th business day following the mailing of the notice described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, the agency shall provide a hearing to the debtor. However, the agency will not delay issuance of a withholding order unless the agency determines that the delay in filing the request was caused by factors over which the debtor had no control, or the agency receives information that the agency believes justifies a delay or cancellation of the withholding order.

        (6)  A hearing official may be any qualified individual, as determined by the head of the agency, including an administrative law judge.

        (7)  After the debtor requests a hearing, the hearing official shall notify the debtor of:

        (i) The date and time of a telephonic hearing;

        (ii) The date, time, and location of an in-person oral hearing; or

        (iii) The deadline for the submission of evidence for a written hearing.

        (8)  (i) The agency will have the burden of going forward to prove the existence or amount of the debt.

        (ii) Thereafter, if the debtor disputes the existence or amount of the debt, the debtor must present by a preponderance of the evidence that no debt exists or that the amount of the debt is incorrect. In addition, the debtor may present evidence that the terms of the repayment schedule are unlawful, would cause a financial hardship to the debtor, or that collection of the debt may not be pursued due to operation of law.

        (9)  The hearing official must maintain a summary record of any hearing provided under this section. A hearing is not required to be a formal evidentiary-type hearing, however, witnesses who testify in oral hearings will do so under oath or affirmation.

        (10)  The hearing official shall issue a written opinion stating his or her decision, as soon as practicable, but not later than sixty (60) days after the date on which the request for such hearing was received by the agency. If an agency is unable to provide the debtor with a hearing and render a decision within 60 days after the receipt of the request for such hearing:

        (i) The agency may not issue a withholding order until the hearing is held and a decision rendered; or

        (ii) If the agency had previously issued a withholding order to the debtor's employer, the agency must suspend the withholding order beginning on the 61st day after the receipt of the hearing request and continuing until a hearing is held and a decision is rendered.

        (11)  The written decision shall include:

        (i) A summary of the facts presented;

        (ii) The hearing official's findings, analysis and conclusions; and

        (iii) The terms of any repayment schedules, if applicable.

        (12)  The hearing official's decision will be the final agency action for the purposes of judicial review under the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 701 ).

        (13)  In the absence of good cause shown, a debtor who fails to appear at a hearing scheduled pursuant to paragraph (f)(4) of this section will be deemed as not having timely filed a request for a hearing.

        (g)  (1) Unless the agency receives information that the agency believes justifies a delay or cancellation of the withholding order, the agency should send, by first class mail, a withholding order to the debtor's employer:

        (i) Within 30 days after the debtor fails to make a timely request for a hearing (, within 15 business days after the mailing of the notice described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section), or,

        (ii) If a timely request for a hearing is made by the debtor, within 30 days after a final decision is made by the agency to proceed with garnishment, or,

        (iii) As soon as reasonably possible thereafter.

        (2) The withholding order sent to the employer under paragraph (g)(1) of this section shall be in a form prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury. The withholding order shall contain the signature of, or the image of the signature of, the head of the agency or his/her delegatee. The order shall contain only the information necessary for the employer to comply with the withholding order. Such information includes the debtor's name, address, and social security number, as well as instructions for withholding and information as to where payments should be sent.

        (3) The agency will retain evidence of service indicating the date of mailing of the order.

        (h)  Along with the withholding order, the agency shall send to the employer a certification in a form prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury. The employer shall complete and return the certification to the agency within the time frame prescribed in the instructions to the form. The certification will address matters such as information about the debtor's employment status and disposable pay available for withholding.

        (i)  (1) After receipt of the garnishment order issued under this section, the employer shall deduct from all disposable pay paid to the applicable debtor during each pay period the amount of garnishment described in paragraph (i)(2) of this section.

        (2)(i) Subject to the provisions of paragraphs (i)(3) and (i)(4) of this section, the amount of garnishment shall be the lesser of:

        (A) The amount indicated on the garnishment order up to 15% of the debtor's disposable pay; or

        (B) The amount set forth in 15 U.S.C. 1673(a)(2) (Restriction on Garnishment). The amount set forth at 15 U.S.C. 1673(a)(2) is the amount by which a debtor's disposable pay exceeds an amount equivalent to thirty times the minimum wage. See 29 CFR 870.10.

        (3) When a debtor's pay is subject to withholding orders with priority the following shall apply:

        (i) Unless otherwise provided by Federal law, withholding orders issued under this section shall be paid in the amounts set forth under paragraph (i)(2) of this section and shall have priority over other withholding orders which are served later in time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, withholding orders for family support shall have priority over withholding orders issued under this section.

        (ii) If amounts are being withheld from a debtor's pay pursuant to a withholding order served on an employer before a withholding order issued pursuant to this section, or if a withholding order for family support is served on an employer at any time, the amounts withheld pursuant to the withholding order issued under this section shall be the lesser of:

        (A) The amount calculated under paragraph (i)(2) of this section, or

        (B) An amount equal to 25% of the debtor's disposable pay less the amount(s) withheld under the withholding order(s) with priority.

        (iii) If a debtor owes more than one debt to an _agency_, the agency may issue multiple withholding orders provided that the total amount garnished from the debtor's pay for such orders does not exceed the amount set forth in paragraph (i)(2) of this section. For purposes of this paragraph (i)(3)(iii), the term  refers to the agency that is owed the debt.

        (4) An amount greater than that set forth in paragraphs (i)(2) and (i)(3) of this section may be withheld upon the written consent of debtor.

        (5) The employer shall promptly pay to the agency all amounts withheld in accordance with the withholding order issued pursuant to this section.

        (6) An employer shall not be required to vary its normal pay and disbursement cycles in order to comply with the withholding order.

        (7) Any assignment or allotment by an employee of his earnings shall be void to the extent it interferes with or prohibits execution of the withholding order issued under this section, except for any assignment or allotment made pursuant to a family support judgment or order.

        (8) The employer shall withhold the appropriate amount from the debtor's wages for each pay period until the employer receives notification from the agency to discontinue wage withholding. The garnishment order shall indicate a reasonable period of time within which the employer is required to commence wage withholding.

        (j)  The agency may not garnish the wages of a debtor who it knows has been involuntarily separated from employment until the debtor has been reemployed continuously for at least 12 months. The debtor has the burden of informing the agency of the circumstances surrounding an involuntary separation from employment.

        (k)  (1) A debtor whose wages are subject to a wage withholding order under this section, may, at any time, request a review by the agency of the amount garnished, based on materially changed circumstances such as disability, divorce, or catastrophic illness which result in financial hardship.

        (2) A debtor requesting a review under paragraph (k)(1) of this section shall submit the basis for claiming that the current amount of garnishment results in a financial hardship to the debtor, along with supporting documentation. Agencies shall consider any information submitted in accordance with procedures and standards established by the agency.

        (3) If a financial hardship is found, the agency shall downwardly adjust, by an amount and for a period of time agreeable to the agency, the amount garnished to reflect the debtor's financial condition. The agency will notify the employer of any adjustments to the amounts to be withheld.

        (l)  (1) Once the agency has fully recovered the amounts owed by the debtor, including interest, penalties, and administrative costs consistent with the FCCS, the agency shall send the debtor's employer notification to discontinue wage withholding.

        (2) At least annually, an agency shall review its debtors' accounts to ensure that garnishment has been terminated for accounts that have been paid in full.

        (m)  An employer may not discharge, refuse to employ, or take disciplinary action against the debtor due to the issuance of a withholding order under this section.

        (n)  (1) If a hearing official, at a hearing held pursuant to paragraph (f)(3) of this section, determines that a debt is not legally due and owing to the United States, the agency shall promptly refund any amount collected by means of administrative wage garnishment.

        (2) Unless required by Federal law or contract, refunds under this section shall not bear interest.

        (o)  The agency may sue any employer for any amount that the employer fails to withhold from wages owed and payable to an employee in accordance with paragraphs (g) and (i) of this section. However, a suit may not be filed before the termination of the collection action involving a particular debtor, unless earlier filing is necessary to avoid expiration of any applicable statute of limitations period. For purposes of this section, “termination of the collection action” occurs when the agency has terminated collection action in accordance with the FCCS or other applicable standards. In any event, termination of the collection action will have been deemed to occur if the agency has not received any payments to satisfy the debt from the particular debtor whose wages were subject to garnishment, in whole or in part, for a period of one (1) year.

        § 285.12   Transfer of debts to Treasury for collection.

#### § § 285.12

        (a)  For purposes of this section:

        means the program through which Fiscal Service provides servicing, pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3711(g), for Federal nontax debt from the point at which a creditor agency establishes a debt until the debt is paid, otherwise resolved, or referred to the Cross-Servicing program for further action.

        means any Federal agency that is owed a debt.

        means the program through which Fiscal Service provides delinquent nontax debt collection services pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3711(g).

        refers to the number of days that a debt has been in a delinquent status. For administrative debts (e.g., debts arising from fines, penalties, and overpayments), the first day of delinquency generally is the date of the creditor agency's initial written demand for payment. For debts that arise from the extension of credit through direct loans, loan guarantees, or insurance, the date of delinquency generally is the due date specified in the applicable agreement or instrument.

        means any amount of money, funds or property that has been determined by an appropriate official of the Federal government to be owed to the United States by a person. As used in this section, the term “debt” does not include debts arising under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.

        means a Federal agency or a unit or subagency within a Federal agency that has been designated by the Secretary to collect debt owed to the United States. Fiscal Service is a debt collection center.

        means a person who owes a debt.

        refers to the status of a debt and means a debt has not been paid by the date specified in the creditor agency's initial written demand for payment, or other applicable agreement or instrument, unless other payment arrangements satisfactory to the creditor agency have been made.

        means a department, agency, court, court administrative office, or instrumentality in the executive, judicial, or legislative branch of the Federal Government, including government corporations.

        means the Bureau of the _Fiscal Service_, a bureau of the Department of the Treasury.

        refers to a characteristic of a debt and means there has been a final agency determination that the debt, in the amount stated, is due, and there are no legal bars to collection. A debt would not be legally enforceable, for example, if the debt is:

        (1) The subject of a pending administrative review required by a statute or regulation that prohibits collection action during the review process; or

        (2) Governed by a statute that precludes collection.

        means an individual, corporation, partnership, association, organization, State or local government, or any other type of entity other than the United States or a Federal agency.

        means the _Secretary_ of the Treasury.

        (b)  Fiscal Service and other debt collection centers may take debt collection action on behalf of one or more Federal agencies or a unit or subagency thereof. Fiscal Service provides these services through its Cross-Servicing program and its Centralized Receivables Service.

        (c)  (1) A debt is considered eligible for transfer to the Cross-Servicing program only if it is past due and is legally enforceable.

        (2) Except as set forth in paragraphs (c)(3) and (d) of this section, a creditor agency must transfer any eligible debt that is over $25 (or such other amount as Fiscal Service may determine) to the Cross-Servicing program by no later than 120 days delinquent if the creditor agency relies on the Cross-Servicing program to submit the transferred debts for centralized offset on the creditor agency's behalf or, otherwise, by no more than 180 days delinquent.

        (3) If a final agency determination resulting from an administrative appeal or review process is not made until after the time specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the creditor agency must transfer such debt to the Cross-Servicing program within 30 days after the date of the final decision.

        (4) For accounting and reporting purposes, the debt remains on the books and records of the Federal agency, which transferred the debt.

        (5) On behalf of the creditor agency, Fiscal Service will take appropriate action to collect or compromise the transferred debt, or to suspend or terminate collection action thereon. Appropriate action to collect a debt may include referral to another debt collection center, a private collection contractor, or the Department of Justice for litigation. The creditor agency must advise Fiscal Service, in writing, of any specific statutory or regulatory requirements pertaining to its debt and will agree, in writing, to a collection strategy, which includes parameters for entering into compromise and repayments agreements with debtors.

        (d)  (1) A creditor agency is not required to transfer a debt to Fiscal Service pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this section only during such period of time that the debt:

        (i) Is in litigation or foreclosure as described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section;

        (ii) Is scheduled for sale as described in paragraph (d)(3) of this section;

        (iii) Is at a private collection contractor if the debt has been referred to a private collection contractor for a period of time determined by the Secretary;

        (iv) Is at a debt collection center if the debt has been referred to a Treasury-designated debt collection center in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section;

        (v) Is being collected by internal offset as described in paragraph (d)(4) of this section;

        (vi) Is being serviced and/or collected in accordance with applicable statutes and/or regulations by third parties, such as private lenders or guaranty agencies; or

        (vii) Is covered by an exemption granted by the Secretary as described in paragraph (d)(5) of this section.

        (2)(i) A debt is in litigation if:

        (A) The debt has been referred to the Attorney General for litigation by the creditor agency; or

        (B) The debt is the subject of proceedings pending in a court of competent jurisdiction, including bankruptcy proceedings, whether initiated by the creditor agency, the debtor, or any other party.

        (ii) A debt is in foreclosure if:

        (A)() Collateral securing the debt is the subject of judicial foreclosure proceedings in a court of competent jurisdiction; or

        () Notice has been issued that collateral securing the debt will be foreclosed upon, liquidated, sold, or otherwise transferred pursuant to applicable law in a nonjudicial proceeding; and

        (B) The creditor agency anticipates that proceeds will be available from the liquidation of the collateral for application to the debt.

        (3) A debt is scheduled for sale if:

        (i) The debt will be disposed of under an asset sales program within one (1) year after becoming eligible for sale; or

        (ii) The debt will be disposed of under an asset sales program and a schedule established by the creditor agency and approved by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.

        (4) A debt is being collected by internal offset if a creditor agency expects the debt to be collected in full within three (3) years from the date of delinquency through the withholding of funds payable to the debtor by the creditor agency, or if the creditor agency has issued notice to the debtor of the creditor agency's intent to offset such funds.

        (5) The Secretary may exempt classes of debt from mandatory referral. (i) Upon the written request of the head of a Federal agency, or as the Secretary may determine on his/her own initiative, the Secretary may exempt any class of debts from the application of the requirement described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. In determining whether to exempt a class of debts, the Secretary will determine whether exemption is in the best interests of the Government after considering the following factors:

        (A) Whether an exemption is the best means to protect the government's financial interest, taking into consideration the number, dollar amount, age and collection rates of the debts for which exemption is requested;

        (B) Whether the nature of the program under which the delinquencies have arisen is such that the transfer of such debts would interfere with program goals; and

        (C) Whether an exemption would be consistent with the purposes of the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996 (DCIA), Pub. L. 104-134, 110 Stat. 1321-358 (April 26, 1996).

        (ii) Requests for exemptions must clearly identify the class of debts for which an exemption is sought and must explain how application of the factors listed above to that class of debts warrants an exemption.

        (iii) Requests for exemption must be made by the head of the agency requesting the exemption, the Chief Financial Officer of the agency, or the Deputy Chief Financial Officer of the agency. For purposes of this section, the head of an agency does not include the head of a subordinate organization within a department or agency.

        (e) [Reserved]

        (f)  A creditor agency may transfer debt that has not been transferred to Fiscal Service, such as debt less than 180 days delinquent, to a Treasury-designated debt collection center, with the consent of, and in accordance with procedures established by Fiscal Service. Debt collection centers will take action upon a debt in accordance with the statutory or regulatory requirements and other authorities that apply to the debt or to the particular action being taken. Debt collection centers may, on behalf of the creditor agency and subject to the terms under which the debt collection center has been designated as such by the Secretary, take any action to collect, compromise, suspend or terminate collection action on debts, in accordance with terms and conditions agreed upon in writing by the creditor agency and the debt collection center or Fiscal Service. Debt collection centers may charge fees for the debt collection services in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (j) of this section.

        (g)  As described in paragraph (c) of this section, under the DCIA, agencies are required to transfer all debts over 180 days delinquent to Fiscal Service for purposes of debt collection ( cross-servicing). Agencies are also required, under the DCIA, to notify the Secretary of all debts over 120 days delinquent for purposes of administrative offset. Administrative offset is one type of collection tool used by Fiscal Service and Treasury-designated debt collection centers to collect debts transferred under this section. Thus, by transferring debt to Fiscal Service or to a Treasury-designated debt collection center under this section, Federal agencies will satisfy the requirement to notify the Secretary of debts for purposes of administrative offset and duplicate referrals are not required. Agencies relying on Fiscal Service to submit debts for administrative offset on the agency's behalf must transfer the debts to Fiscal Service no later than 120 days after the debts become delinquent in order to satisfy the 120-day notice requirement for purposes of administrative offset. A debt which is not transferred to Fiscal Service for purposes of debt collection, however, such as a debt which falls within one of the exempt categories listed in paragraph (d) of this section, nevertheless may be subject to the DCIA requirement of notification to the Secretary for purposes of administrative offset.

        (h)  A creditor agency may refer any debt that is less than 180 days delinquent to Fiscal Service or, with the consent of Fiscal Service, to a Treasury-designated debt collection center for debt collection services.

        (i)  Before a debt may be transferred to Fiscal Service or another debt collection center, the head of the creditor agency or his or her delegate must certify, in writing, that the debts being transferred are valid, legally enforceable, and that there are no legal bars to collection. Creditor agencies must also certify that they have complied with all prerequisites to a particular collection action under the laws, regulations or policies applicable to the debt unless the creditor agency has requested, and Fiscal Service has agreed, to do so on the creditor agency's behalf. The creditor agency shall notify Fiscal Service immediately of any change in the status of the legal enforceability of the debt, for example, if the creditor agency receives notice that the debtor has filed for bankruptcy protection.

        (j)  Fiscal Service and other debt collection centers may charge Federal agencies fees sufficient to cover the full cost of providing debt collection services authorized by this section. Fiscal Service and other debt collection centers may calculate fees in any manner designed to cover up to the full cost of providing these services, including based on a percentage of collections received on account of a debt while it was being serviced under this section or a flat fee based on actions taken under this section by Fiscal Service or another debt collection center with regard to a debt or group of debts. Such fees may be determined based on overall program costs and need not be based on costs related to the collection of a specific debt. Fiscal Service and debt collection centers are authorized to retain fees from amounts collected and may deposit and use such fees in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3711(g). Fees charged by Fiscal Service and other debt collection centers may be added to the debt as an administrative cost if authorized under 31 U.S.C. 3717(e).

        (k)  When conducting activities for or related to its Centralized Receivables Service or Cross-Servicing program, Fiscal Service will ensure that an individual's Social Security number will not be visible on the outside of any package it sends by physical mail or in the subject line of an email. In addition, Fiscal Service generally will redact or partially redact Social Security numbers in documents it sends by mail; however, to administer these programs, Fiscal Service may include Social Security numbers in mailed documents, including, for example:

        (1) In interoffice and interagency communications;

        (2) In communications with private collection contractor and agents that assist Fiscal Service in its debt collection activities;

        (3) In notices and letters, including demand letters and notices to employers regarding wage garnishment, when the Social Security number is (or is embedded in) a creditor agency's account number, debt identification number, or debtor identification number;

        (4) In notices to employers regarding wage garnishment;

        (5) In response to a request of a debtor or a debtor's representative for records of Fiscal Service's collection activities; and

        (6) When required by law.

> [63 FR 16356, Apr. 2, 1998, as amended at 64 FR 22908, Apr. 28, 1999; 81 FR 1319, Jan. 12, 2016; 87 FR 50249, Aug. 16, 2022]

        § 285.13   Barring delinquent debtors from obtaining Federal loans or loan insurance or guarantees.

#### § § 285.13

        (a)  For purposes of this section:

        means a department, agency, court, court administrative office, or instrumentality in the executive, judicial, or legislative branch of the Federal Government, including government corporations.

        means any Federal agency that is owed a debt.

        means any amount of money, funds or property that has been determined by an appropriate official of the Federal Government to be owed to the United States or an agency thereof by a person, including debt administered by a third party as an agent for the Federal Government.

        or  means any Federal loan (other than a disaster loan), loan insurance, or loan guarantee.

        means the Bureau of the _Fiscal Service_, a bureau of the Department of the Treasury.

        means any debt other than a debt under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. 1 ).

        means an individual, corporation, partnership, association, organization, State or local government, or any other type of entity other than a Federal agency.

        means the _Secretary_ of the Treasury.

        (b)  (1) This section prescribes standards for determining whether an outstanding nontax debt owed to the Federal Government is in delinquent status and whether such delinquency is resolved for the purpose of denying Federal financial assistance to a debtor. In addition, this section prescribes the circumstances under which the Secretary may exempt a class of debts from affecting a debtor's loan eligibility. This section also outlines the factors an agency should consider when determining whether waiver of the general rule in paragraph (c) of this section is appropriate.

        (2) Additional guidance concerning debt collection and debt management is provided in “Managing Federal Receivables” and other Fiscal Service publications.

        (3) Nothing in this section requires an agency to grant Federal financial assistance if denial otherwise is authorized by statute, regulation, or agency policies and procedures. For example, if an agency requires borrowers to have a satisfactory credit history, the agency may deny financial assistance even if a delinquent debt has been resolved.

        (4) This section does not confer any new rights or benefits on persons seeking Federal financial assistance.

        (5) This section applies to any person owing delinquent nontax debt and to any agency that administers a program that grants Federal financial assistance.

        (c)  (1) As required by the provisions of 31 U.S.C. 3720B, a person owing an outstanding nontax debt that is in delinquent status shall not be eligible for Federal financial assistance. This eligibility requirement applies to all persons seeking Federal financial assistance and owing an outstanding nontax debt in delinquent status, including, but not limited to, guarantors. This eligibility requirement applies to all Federal financial assistance even if creditworthiness or credit history is not otherwise a factor for eligibility purposes, e.g., student loans. A person may be eligible for Federal financial assistance only after the delinquency is resolved in accordance with this section. An agency may waive this eligibility requirement in accordance with paragraph (g) of this section.

        (2) An agency from which a person seeks Federal financial assistance may determine, under standards issued by the agency, that a person is ineligible for Federal financial assistance under this section if:

        (i) The person is controlled by a person owing an outstanding nontax debt that is in delinquent status (e.g., a corporation is controlled by an officer, director, or shareholder who owes a debt); or

        (ii) The person controls a person owing an outstanding nontax debt that is in delinquent status (e.g., a corporation controls a wholly-owned or partially-owned subsidiary which owes a debt).

        (3) A creditor agency may obtain information concerning whether or not a person seeking Federal financial assistance owes a delinquent debt from, among other sources, credit reports, information contained on credit applications, and the Department of Housing and Urban Development's Credit Alert Interactive Voice Response System (CAIVRS). For information about participating in the CAIVRS program, agencies should contact the Director of Information Resources Management, Policy and Management Division, Office of Information Technology, Department of Housing and Urban Development, 451 7th Street, S.W., Washington, DC 20410.

        (d)  (1) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, a debt is in “delinquent status” for purposes of this section if the debt has not been paid within 90 days of the payment due date. The payment due date is the date specified in the creditor agency's initial written demand for payment or applicable agreement or instrument (including a post-delinquency repayment agreement).

        (2) For purposes of this section, a debt is not in delinquent status if:

        (i) The person seeking Federal financial assistance has been released by the creditor agency from any obligation to pay the debt, or there has been an adjudication or determination that such person does not owe or does not have to pay the debt;

        (ii) The debtor is the subject of, or has been discharged in, a bankruptcy proceeding, and if applicable, the person seeking Federal financial assistance is current on any court authorized repayment plan; or

        (iii) The existence of the debt or the agency's determination that the debt is delinquent is being challenged under an ongoing administrative appeal or contested judicial proceeding and the appeal was filed by the debtor in a timely manner. Unless otherwise prohibited, an agency may defer making a determination as to whether or not to extend credit until the appeal process is completed.

        (3) Unless the provisions of paragraph (d)(2) apply, a debt is in delinquent status even if the creditor agency has suspended or terminated collection activity with respect to such debt. For example, a delinquent nontax debt that has been written off the books of the creditor agency or reported to the Internal Revenue Service as discharged (, canceled) is in delinquent status for purposes of this section.

        (4) Nothing in this section defines the terms “delinquent” or “delinquent status” for any purposes other than those described in this section.

        (e)  (1) For purposes of this section, a person's delinquent debt is resolved only if the person:

        (i) Pays or otherwise satisfies the delinquent debt in full;

        (ii) Pays the delinquent debt in part if the creditor agency accepts such part payment as a compromise in lieu of payment in full;

        (iii) Cures the delinquency under terms acceptable to the creditor agency in that the person pays any overdue payments, plus all interest, penalties, late charges, and administrative charges assessed by the creditor agency as a result of the delinquency; or

        (iv) Enters into a written repayment agreement with the creditor agency to pay the debt, in whole or in part, under terms and conditions acceptable to the creditor agency.

        (2) Unless the provisions of paragraph (e)(1) of this section apply, a delinquent debt is not resolved even if the creditor agency has suspended or terminated collection activity with respect to such debt. For example, a delinquent nontax debt that has been written off the books of the creditor agency or reported to the Internal Revenue Service as discharged (, canceled) would not be “resolved.” If the provisions of paragraph (e)(1) of this section do apply, a delinquent debt is considered resolved. For example, if a portion of a debt has been written off after the person has paid the debt in part where the creditor agency accepts such part payment as a compromise in lieu of payment in full, the entire debt would be deemed “resolved” for purposes of this section in accordance with paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section.

        (f)  (1) Upon the written request and recommendation of the head of the creditor agency to which a class of debts is owed, the Secretary may exempt any class of debts from affecting a debtor's eligibility for Federal financial assistance based on the provisions of 31 U.S.C. 3720B and this section.

        (2) The creditor agency recommending an exemption for a class of debts will provide the Secretary with information about:

        (i) The nature of the program under which the delinquencies have arisen;

        (ii) The number, dollar amount, and age of the debts in the program for which exemption is recommended;

        (iii) The reasons why an exemption is justified, including why the granting of financial assistance to persons owing the type of debt for which exemption is requested would not be contrary to the Government's goal to reduce losses by requiring proper screening of potential borrowers; and,

        (iv) Other information the Secretary deems necessary to consider the exemption request.

        (3) The Secretary may exempt a class of debts if exemption is in the best interests of the Federal Government.

        (g)  (1) The head of an agency from which a person seeks to obtain Federal financial assistance may waive the eligibility requirement described in paragraph (c) of this section. Waivers shall be granted only on a person by person basis. The head of the agency may delegate the waiver authority only to the Chief Financial Officer of the agency. The Chief Financial Officer may redelegate the authority only to the Deputy Chief Financial Officer of the agency.

        (2) The authorized agency official should balance the following factors when deciding whether to grant a waiver under paragraph (g)(1) of this section:

        (i) Whether the denial of the financial assistance to the person would tend to interfere substantially with or defeat the purposes of the financial assistance program or otherwise would not be in the best interests of the Federal Government; and

        (ii) Whether the agency's granting of the financial assistance to the person is contrary to the Government's goal to reduce losses from debt management activities by requiring proper screening of potential borrowers.

        (3) When balancing the factors described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the authorized agency official should consider:

        (i) The age, amount, and cause(s) of the delinquency and the likelihood that the person will resolve the delinquent debt; and

        (ii) The amount of total debt, delinquent or otherwise, owed by the person and the person's credit history with respect to repayment of debt.

        (4) Each agency shall retain a centralized record of the number and type of waivers granted under this section.

        (h)  Nothing contained in this section precludes a person who has been denied Federal financial assistance from obtaining such assistance after that person's delinquent debt has been resolved in accordance with paragraph (e)(1) of this section.

        The registration used must express the actual ownership of a security and may not include any restriction on the authority of the owner to dispose of it in any manner, except as otherwise specifically provided in these regulations.

The registration of all bonds owned by the same person, organization, or fiduciary should be uniform with respect to the name of the owner and, in the case of a fiduciary, the description of the fiduciary capacity. Individual owners should be designated by the names by which they are ordinarily known or under which they do business, preferably including at least one full given name. The name of an individual may be preceded by any applicable title, as, for example, Mrs., Miss, Ms., Dr., or Rev., or followed by a designation such as M.D., D.D., Sr., or Jr. Any other similar suffix should be included when ordinarily used or when necessary to distinguish the owner from a member of his family. A married woman's own given name, not that of her husband, must be used, for example, Mrs. Mary A. Jones, not Mrs. Frank B. Jones. The address should include, where appropriate, the number and street, route, or any other local feature and the Zip Code.

        (a)  In the names of natural persons who are not under any legal disability, in their own right, substantially as follows:

        (1)  In the name of one individual. Examples:

        (2)  Securities will not be registered in the name of one person payable on death to another, or in any form which purports to authorize transfer by less than all the persons named in the registration (or all the survivors).   Securities will not be registered in the forms John A. Doe and Mrs. Mary C. Doe, _or either of them_ or William C. Doe or Henry J. Doe, or either of them and securities so assigned will be treated as though the words  do not appear in the assignments. The taxpayer identifying number of any of the joint owners may be shown on securities registered in joint ownership form.

        (i)  In the names of two or more individuals with right of survivorship. Examples:

        (ii)  In the names of two or more individuals in such manner as to preclude the right of survivorship. Examples:

        (b) —(1)  A security may be registered in the name of a natural guardian of a minor for whose estate no legal guardian or similar representative has legally qualified. Example:

        (2)  A security may be purchased as a gift to a minor under a gifts to minors statute in effect in the State in which either the donor or the minor resides. The security should be registered as provided in the statute, with an identifying reference to the statute if the registration does not clearly identify it. Examples:

        (3)  Registration in the form  is permitted only on reissue after a voluntary guardian has qualified for the purpose of collecting interest. (See §§ 306.37(c)(2) and 306.57(c)(2)). Otherwise, registration in the name of an incompetent not under legal guardianship is not authorized.

        (c)  A security may be registered in the names of legally qualified executors, administrators, guardians, conservators, or similar representatives or fiduciaries of a single estate. The names and capacities of all the representatives or fiduciaries, as shown in their letters of appointment, must be included in the registration and must be followed by an adequate identifying reference to the estate. Examples:

        (d)  A security may be registered in the name of a life tenant followed by an adequate identifying reference to the will. Example:

        (e)  A security may be registered in the name and title of the trustee or trustees of a single duly constituted private trust, followed by an adequate identifying reference to the authority governing the trust. Examples:

        (1) If there are several trustees designated as a board or authorized to act as a unit, their names should be omitted and the words  substituted for the word  Example:

        (2) If the trustees do not constitute a board or otherwise act as a unit, and are either too numerous to be designated in the inscription by names and title, or serve for limited terms, some or all of the names may be omitted. Examples:

        (f)  A security may be registered in the name of any private corporation, unincorporated association, or partnership, including a nominee, which for purposes of these regulations is treated as the owner. The full legal name of the organization, as set forth in its charter, articles of incorporation, constitution, partnership agreement, or other authority from which its powers are derived, must be included in the registration and may be followed, if desired, by a reference to a particular account or fund, other than a trust fund, in accordance with the rules and examples given below:

        (1)  The name of a business, fraternal, religious, or other private _corporation_ must be followed by descriptive words indicating the corporate status unless the term  or the abbreviation  is part of the name or the name is that of a corporation or association organized under Federal law, such as a national bank or Federal savings and loan association. Examples:

        (2)  The name of a lodge, club, labor union, veterans' organization, religious society, or similar self-governing organization which is not incorporated (whether or not it is chartered by or affiliated with a parent organization which is incorporated) must be followed by the words  Examples:

Specific instructions for issuance and delivery of the new securities, signed by the owner or his authorized representative, must accompany the securities presented. (Form PD 3905 or PD 1827, as appropriate, may be used.) Denominational exchanges may be made at any time. Securities presented for transfer must be received by the Bureau not less than 1 full month before the date on which the securities mature or become redeemable pursuant to a call for redemption before maturity. Any security so presented which is received too late to comply with this provision will be accepted for payment only.

        (b)  The transfer books are closed for one full month preceding interest payment dates and call or maturity dates. If the date set for closing of the transfer books falls on Saturday, Sunday, or a legal holiday, the books will be closed as of the close of business on the last business day preceding that date. The books are reopened on the first business day following the date on which interest falls due. Registered securities which have not matured or been called, submitted for transfer, reissue, and coupon securities which have not matured or been called, submitted for exchange for registered securities, which are received during the period the books for that loan are closed, will be processed on or after the date such books are reopened. If registered securities are received for transfer, or coupon securities are received for exchange for registered securities, during the time the books are closed for payment of final interest at maturity or call, unless otherwise provided in the offering circular or notice of call, the following action will be taken:

        (1) Payment of final interest will be made to the registered owner of record on the date the books were closed.

      Subpart D—Redemption or Payment

        § 306.25   Presentation and surrender.

#### § § 306.25

        (a)  Securities, whether in registered or bearer form, are payable in regular course of business at maturity unless called for redemption before maturity in accordance with their terms, in which case they will be payable in regular course of business on the date of call. The Secretary of the Treasury may provide for the exchange of maturing or called securities, or in advance of call or maturity, may afford owners the opportunity of exchanging a security for another security pursuant to a prerefunding or an advance refunding offer. Registered and bearer securities should be presented and surrendered for redemption to the Bureau. No assignments or evidence in support of assignments will be required by or on behalf of the registered owner or assignee for redemption for his or its account, or for redemption-exchange, or exchange pursuant to a prerefunding or an advance refunding offer, if the new securities are to be registered in exactly the same names and forms as appear in the registrations or assignments of the securities surrendered. To the extent appropriate, these rules also apply to securities registered in the title of public officers who are official custodians of public funds.

        (b)  If a bearer security or a registered security assigned in blank, or to bearer, or so assigned as to become in effect payable to bearer, is presented and surrendered for redemption after it has become overdue, the Secretary of the Treasury will ordinarily require satisfactory proof of ownership. (Form PD 1071 may be used.) A security shall be considered to be overdue after the lapse of the following periods of time from its face maturity:

        (1) One month for securities issued for a term of 1 year or less.

#### § § 306.27

        All interest coupons due and payable on or before the date of maturity or date fixed in the call for redemption before maturity should be detached from coupon securities presented for redemption and should be collected separately in regular course.

If any such coupons are missing, the full face amount thereof will be deducted from the payment to be made upon redemption or the prerefunding or advance refunding adjustment unless satisfactory evidence of their destruction is submitted. Any amounts so deducted will be held in the Department to provide for adjustments or refunds in the event it should be determined that the missing coupons were subsequently presented or their destruction is later satisfactorily established. In the absence of other instructions, payment or bearer securities will be made by check drawn to the order of the person presenting and surrendering the securities and mailed to him at his address, as given in the advice accompanying the securities. (Form PD 3905 may be used.) Under appropriate circumstances, payment to a financial institution for detached past due coupons may be made by crediting the amount of the proceeds to the account maintained by the financial institution at the Federal Reserve bank of its district.

      Subpart E—Interest

        § 306.35   Computation of interest.

#### § § 306.35

        The interest on Treasury securities accrues and is payable on a semiannual basis unless otherwise provided in the circular offering them for sale or exchange. If the period of accrual is an exact 6 months, the interest accrual is an exact one-half year's interest without regard to the number of days in the period. If the period of accrual is less than an exact 6 months, the accrued interest is computed by determining the daily rate of accrual on the basis of the exact number of days in the full interest period and multiplying the daily rate by the exact number of days in the fractional period for which interest has actually accrued. A full interest period does not include the day as of which securities were issued or the day on which the last preceding interest became due, but does include the day on which the next succeeding interest payment is due. A fractional part of an interest period does not include the day as of which the securities were issued or the day on which the last preceding interest payment became due, but does include the day as of which the transaction terminating the accrual of interest is effected. The 29th of February in a leap year is included whenever it falls within either a full interest period or a fractional part thereof.

        § 306.36   Termination of interest.

#### § § 306.36

        Securities will cease to bear interest on the date of their maturity unless they have been called for redemption before maturity in accordance with their terms, or are presented and surrendered for redemption-exchange or exchange pursuant to an advance refunding or prerefunding offer, in which case they will cease to bear interest on the date of call, or the exchange date, as the case may be.

        § 306.37   Interest on registered securities.

#### § § 306.37

        (a)  The interest on registered securities is payable by checks drawn on the United States Treasury to the order of the registered owners, except as otherwise provided herein. Interest checks are prepared by the Department in advance of the interest payment data and are ordinarily mailed in time to reach the addresses on that date. Interest on a registered security which has not matured or been called and which is presented for any transaction during the period the books for that loan are closed will be paid by check drawn to the order of the registered owner of record. Upon receipt of notice of the death or incompetency of an individual named as registered owner, a change in the name or in the status of a partnership, corporation, or unincorporated association, the removal, resignation, succession, or death of a fiduciary or trustee, delivery of interest checks will be withheld pending receipt and approval of evidence showing who is entitled to receive the interest checks. If the inscriptions on securities do not clearly identify the owners, delivery of interest checks will be withheld pending reissue of the securities in the correct registration. The final installment of interest, unless otherwise provided in the offering circular or notice of call, will be paid by check drawn to the order of the registered owner of record and mailed in advance of the interest payment date in time to reach the addressee on or about that date. Interest on securities presented for prerefunding or advance refunding will be adjusted as provided in the prerefunding or advance refunding offer.

        (b)  To assure timely delivery of interest checks, owners should promptly notify the Bureau of any change of address. (Form PD 345 may be used.) The notification must be signed by the registered owner or a joint owner or an authorized representative, and should show the owner's taxpayer identifying number, the old and new addresses, the serial number and denomination of each security, the titles of the securities (for example: 4  percent Treasury Bonds of 1987-92, dated August 15, 1962), and the registration of each security. Notifications by attorneys in fact, trustees, or by the legal representatives of the estates of deceased, incompetent, or minor owners should be supported by proof of their authority, unless, in the case of trustees or legal representatives, they are named in the registration.

        (c) —(1)  Interest checks may be collected in accordance with the regulations governing the endorsement and payment of Government warrants and checks, which are contained in the current revision of Department Circular No. 21 (part 240 of this chapter).

        (2)  Interest checks drawn to the order of a person who has become incompetent and for whose estate no legal guardian or similar representative has been appointed should be returned to the Bureau with a full explanation of the circumstances. For collection of interest, the Department will recognize the relative responsible for the incompetent's care and support or some other person as voluntary guardian for the incompetent. (Application may be made on Form PD 1461.)

        (d)  If an interest check is not received within a reasonable period after an interest payment date, or if a check is lost, stolen, or destroyed after receipt, notification should be sent to the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, Division of Customer Service, Parkersburg, WV 26102. Notification should include the name and address of the owner, his taxpayer identifying number, and the serial number, denomination, and title of the security upon which the interest was payable. If the check is subsequently received or recovered, the Bureau should be notified.

        § 306.38   Interest on bearer securities.

#### § § 306.38

        Unless the offering circular and notice of call provide otherwise, interest on coupon securities is payable in regular course of business upon presentation and surrender of the interest coupons as they mature. Such coupons are payable at participating Federal Reserve banks or by the Bureau.   Interest on Treasury bills, and any other bearer securities which may be sold and issued on a discount basis and which are payable at par at maturity, is represented by the difference between the purchase price and the par value, and no coupons are attached.

        § 306.40   Execution of assignments.

#### § § 306.40

        The assignment of a registered security should be executed by the owner, or his or her authorized representative, in the presence of an individual authorized to certify assignments. All assignments must be made on the backs of the securities, unless otherwise authorized by the Bureau. An assignment by mark (X) must be witnessed not only by a certifying individual, but also by at least one other person, who should add an endorsement substantially as follows: “Witness to signature by mark,” followed by the witness' signature and address.

#### § § 306.41

        Registered securities may be assigned in blank, to bearer, to a specified transferee, or to the Secretary of the Treasury for redemption or for exchange for other securities offered at maturity, upon call or pursuant to an advance refunding or prerefunding offer. Assignments to “The Secretary of the Treasury,” “The Secretary of the Treasury for transfer,” or “The Secretary of the Treasury for exchange” will not be accepted unless supplemented by specific instructions by or in behalf of the owner.

        § 306.42   Alterations and erasures.

#### § § 306.42

        If an alteration or erasure has been made in an assignment, the assignor should appear before an authorized certifying officer and execute a new assignment to the same assignee. If the new assignment is to other than the assignee whose name has been altered or erased, a disclaimer from the first-named assignee should be obtained. Otherwise, an affidavit of explanation by the person responsible for the alteration or erasure should be submitted for consideration.

        § 306.43   Voidance of assignments.

#### § § 306.43

        An assignment of a security to or for the account of another person, not completed by delivery, may be voided by a disclaimer of interest from that person. This disclaimer should be executed in the presence of an officer authorized to certify assignments of securities. Unless otherwise authorized by the Bureau, the disclaimer must be written, typed, or stamped on the back of the security in substantially the following form:

        § 306.44   Discrepancies in names.

#### § § 306.44

        The Department will ordinarily require an explanation of discrepancies in the names which appear in inscriptions, assignments, supporting evidence or in the signatures to any assignments. (Form PD 385 may be used for this purpose.) However, where the variations in the name of the registered owner, as inscribed on securities of the same or different issues, are such that both may properly represent the same person, for example, “J. T. Smith” and “John T. Smith,” no proof of identity will be required if the assignments are signed exactly as the securities are inscribed and are duly certified by the same certifying officer.

        § 306.45   Certifying individuals.

#### § § 306.45

        (a)  The following individuals may certify assignments of, or forms with respect to, securities:

        (1) Officers and employees of depository institutions, corporate central credit unions, and institutions that are members of Treasury-recognized signature guarantee programs who have been authorized:

        (i) Generally to bind their respective institutions by their acts;

        (ii) Unqualifiedly to guarantee signatures to assignments of securities; or

        (iii) To certify assignments of securities.

        (2) Officers and authorized employees of Federal Reserve Banks and branches.

        (3) Officers of Federal Land Banks, Federal Intermediate Credit Banks and Banks for Cooperatives, and Federal Home Loan Banks.

        (4) Commissioned officers and warrant officers of the Armed Forces of the United States but only with respect to signatures executed by Armed Forces personnel, civilian field employees, and members of their families.

        (5) U.S. Attorneys, Collectors of Customs, and Regional Commissioners, District Directors, and Service Center Directors, Internal Revenue Service.

        (6) Judges and Clerks of U.S. Courts.

        (7) Such other persons as the Commissioner of the Fiscal Service or his designee may authorize.

        (b)  The following individuals are authorized to certify assignments of, or forms with respect to, securities executed in a foreign country:

        (1) United States diplomatic or consular officials.

        (2) Managers and officers of foreign branches of depository institutions and institutions that are members of Treasury-recognized signature guarantee programs.

        (3) Notaries public and other officers authorized to administer oaths, provided their official position and authority are certified by a United States diplomatic or consular official under seal of the office.

        (c) —(1)  Except as specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, a certifying individual shall require that the security or related form be signed in the certifying individual's presence after he or she has established the identity of the person seeking the certification. An employee who is not an officer should insert the words “Authorized signature” in the space provided for the title. A certifying individual and the organization for which he or she is acting are jointly and severally liable for any loss the United States may incur as a result of the individual's negligence in making the certification.

        (2)  The assignment or related form need not be executed in the presence of a certifying individual if he or she unqualifiedly guarantees the signature, in which case the certifying individual shall, after the signature, add the following endorsement: “Signature guaranteed, First National Bank of Smithville, Smithville, NH, by A.B. Doe, President”, and add the date. In guaranteeing a signature, the certifying individual and the organization for which he or she is acting warrant to the Department that the signature is genuine and that the signer had the legal capacity to execute the assignment or related form.

        (3)  A security or related form need not be actually signed by the owner in any case where a certifying individual associated with a depository institution has placed an endorsement on the security or the form reading substantially as follows: “Absence of signature by owner and validity of transaction guaranteed, Second State Bank of Jonesville, Jonesville, NC, by B.R. Butler, Vice President”. The endorsement should be dated, and the seal of the institution should be added. This form of endorsement is an unconditional guarantee to the Department that the institution is acting for the owner under proper authorization.

        (d)  The authority of a certifying individual to act is evidenced by affixing to the certification the following:

        (1)  The institution's seal or signature guarantee stamp; if the institution is an authorized paying agent for U.S. Savings Bonds, a legible imprint of the paying agent's stamp; or, if the institution is a member of the Securities Transfer Agents Medallion Program (STAMP), a legible imprint of the STAMP signature guarantee stamp.

        (2)  A legible imprint of the program's signature guarantee stamp, e.g., the STAMP, SEMP, or MSP stamp for members of the Securities Transfer Agents Medallion Program, the Stock Exchanges Medallion Program, or the New York Stock Exchange Incorporated Medallion Signature Program, respectively.

        (3)  Whatever is prescribed in procedures established by the Department.

        (4)  The entity's seal.

        (5)  The official seal or stamp of the office. If the certifying individual has no seal or stamp, then the official's position must be certified by some other authorized individual, under seal or stamp, or otherwise proved to the satisfaction of the Department.

        (6)  A statement which sets out the officer's rank and the fact that the person executing the assignment or form is one whose signature the officer is authorized to certify under the regulations in this part.

        (7)  The seal of the court.

        (8)  The official seal or stamp of the office. If the certifying individual has no seal or stamp, then the certifying individual's position and signature must be certified by some other authorized individual under official seal or stamp, or otherwise proved to the satisfaction of the Department.

        (e)  Neither the transferor, the transferee, nor any person having an interest in a security involved in the transaction may act as a certifying individual. However, an authorized officer or employee of a depository institution or of an institution that is a member of a Treasury-recognized signature guarantee program may act as a certifying individual on a security or related form for transfer of a security to the institution, or any security or related form executed by another individual on behalf of the institution.

      Subpart G—Assignments by or in Behalf of Individuals

        § 306.55   Signatures, minor errors and change of name.

#### § § 306.55

        The owner's signature to an assignment should be in the form in which the security is inscribed or assigned, unless such inscription or assignment is incorrect or the name has since been changed. In case of a change of name, the signature to the assignment should show both names and the manner in which the change was made, for example, “John Young, changed by order of court from Hans Jung.” Evidence of the change will be required. However, no evidence is required to support an assignment if the change resulted from marriage and the signature, which must be duly certified by an authorized officer, is written to show that fact, for example, “Mrs. Mary J. Brown, changed by marriage from Miss Mary Jones.”

        § 306.56   Assignment of securities registered in the names of or assigned to two or more persons.

#### § § 306.56

        (a)  Securities registered in the names of or assigned to two or more persons may be transferred during the lives of all the joint owners only upon assignments by all or on their behalf by authorized representatives. Upon proof of the death of one, the Department will accept an assignment by or in behalf of the survivor or survivors, unless the form of registration or assignment includes words which precludes the right of survivorship.   In the latter case, in addition to assignment by or in behalf of the survivor or survivors, an assignment in behalf of the decedent's estate will be required.

        (b)  No assignments are required for exchange of securities registered in the names of or assigned to two or more persons if the securities to be received in the exchange are to be registered in the same names and form. If securities in a different form are to be issued, all persons named must assign, except that in case of death paragraph (a) of this section shall apply.

        (c) —(1)  Securities registered in the names of or assigned to two or more persons in the alternative, for example, “John B. Smith or Mrs. Mary J. Smith” or “John B. Smith or Mrs. Mary J. Smith or the survivor,” may be assigned by one of them at maturity or upon call, for redemption or redemption-exchange, for his own account or otherwise, whether or not the other joint owner or owners are deceased.

        (2)  Securities registered in the names of or assigned to two or more persons jointly, for example, “John B. Smith and Mrs. Mary J. Smith,” or “John B. Smith and Mrs. Mary J. Smith as tenants in common,” or “John B. Smith and Mary J. Smith as partners in community,” may be assigned by one of them during the lives of all only for redemption at maturity or upon call, and then only for redemption for the account of all. No assignments are required for redemption-exchange for securities to be registered in the same names and forms as appear in the registration or assignment of the securities surrendered. Upon proof of the death of a joint owner, the survivor or survivors may assign securities so registered or assigned for redemption or redemption-exchange for any account, except that, if words which preclude the right of survivorship   appear in the registration or assignment, assignment in behalf of the decedent's estate also will be required.

#### § § 306.57

        (a)  Securities registered in the name of a minor for whose estate no legal guardian or similar representative has qualified may be assigned by the natural guardian upon qualification. (Form PD 2481 may be used for this purpose.)

        (b)  Securities registered in the name of a natural guardian of a minor may be assigned by the natural guardian for any authorized transaction except one for the apparent benefit of the natural guardian. If the natural guardian in whose name the securities are registered is deceased or is no longer qualified to act as natural guardian, the securities may be assigned by the person then acting as natural guardian. The assignment by the new natural guardian should be supported by proof of the death or disqualification of the former natural guardian and by evidence of his own status as natural guardian. (Form PD 2481 may be used for this purpose.) No assignment by a natural guardian will be accepted after receipt of notice of the minor's attainment of majority, removal of his disability of minority, disqualification of the natural guardian to act as such, qualification of a legal guardian or similar representative, or the death of the minor.

        (c)  Registered securities belonging to an incompetent for whose estate no legal guardian or similar representative is legally qualified may be assigned by the relative responsible for his care and support or some other person as voluntary guardian:

        (1) For redemption, if the proceeds of the securities are needed to pay expenses already incurred, or to be incurred during any 90-day period, for the care and support of the incompetent or his legal dependents.

        (2) For redemption-exchange, if the securities are matured or have been called, or pursuant to an advance refunding or prerefunding offer, for reinvestment in other securities to be registered in the form “A, an incompetent (123-45-6789) under voluntary guardianship.”

        (d)  Securities registered in the name and title of the legal guardian or similar representative of the estate of a minor or incompetent may be assigned by the representative for any authorized transaction without proof of his qualification. Assignments by a representative of any other securities belonging to a minor or incompetent must be supported by properly certified evidence of qualification. The evidence must be dated not more than 1 year before the date of the assignments and must contain a statement showing the appointment is in full force unless (1) it shows the appointment was made not more than 1 year before the date of the assignment, or (2) the representative or a corepresentative is a corporation. An assignment by the representative will not be accepted after receipt of notice of termination of the guardianship, except for transfer to the former ward.

        § 306.65   Decedent's estate.

#### § § 306.65

        (a)  (1) A legal representative of a deceased owner's estate may request payment of matured securities to the estate, or may assign securities to or for the benefit of the persons entitled.

        (2) Appropriate proof of appointment for the legal representative of the estate is required. Letters of appointment must be dated not more than one year prior to the date of submission of the letters of appointment.

        (b)  If the estate has been settled previously through judicial proceedings, the persons entitled may request payment of matured securities, or may request assignment of unmatured securities. A certified copy of the court-approved final accounting for the estate, the court's decree of distribution, or other appropriate evidence is required.

        (c)  If there is no formal or regular administration and no representative of the estate is to be appointed, the person appointed to receive or distribute the assets of a decedent's estate without regular administration under summary or small estates procedures under applicable local law may request payment of matured securities, or may request assignment of the securities. Appropriate evidence is required.

        (d)  If the total redemption value of the Treasury securities and undelivered payments, if any, held directly on our records that are the property of the decedent's estate is greater than $100,000, administration of the decedent's estate will be required. The redemption value of savings bonds and the principal amount of marketable securities will be used to determine the value of securities, and will be determined as of the date of death. Administration may also be required at the discretion of the Department for any case.

        (e) —(1)  A voluntary representative is a person qualified according to paragraph (e)(3) of this section, to request payment of a decedent's matured securities or to make an assignment of a decedent's unmatured securities. The voluntary representative procedures are for the convenience of the Department; entitlement to the decedent's securities and held payments, if any, is determined by the law of the jurisdiction in which the decedent was domiciled at the date of death. Voluntary representative procedures may be used only if:

        (i) There has been no administration, no administration is contemplated, and no summary or small estate procedures under applicable local law have been used;

        (ii) The total redemption value of the Treasury securities and held payments, if any, held directly on our records that are the property of the decedent's estate is $100,000 or less as of the date of death; and

        (iii) There is a person eligible to serve as the voluntary representative according to paragraph (e)(3) of this section.

        (2)  A voluntary representative may:

        (i) Request payment of the decedent's matured securities on behalf of the persons entitled by the law of the jurisdiction in which the decedent was domiciled at the date of death;

        (ii) Assign the decedent's securities to the persons entitled by the law of the jurisdiction in which the decedent was domiciled at the date of death.

        (3)  An individual eighteen years of age or older may act as a voluntary representative according to the following order of precedence: a surviving spouse; if there is no surviving spouse, then a child of the decedent; if there are none of the above, then a descendant of a deceased child of the decedent; if there are none of the above, then a parent of the decedent; if there are none of the above, then a brother or sister of the decedent; if there are none of the above, then a descendant of a deceased brother or sister of the decedent; if there are none of the above, then a next of kin of the decedent, as determined by the law of the jurisdiction in which the decedent was domiciled at the date of death. As used in this order of precedence, child means a natural or adopted child of the decedent.

        (4)  By serving, the voluntary representative warrants that the distribution of payments or securities is to or on behalf of the persons entitled by the law of the jurisdiction in which the decedent was domiciled at the date of death. The United States is not liable to any person for the improper distribution of payments or securities. Upon payment or assignment of the securities at the request of the voluntary representative, the United States is released to the same extent as if it had paid or delivered to a representative of the estate appointed pursuant to the law of the jurisdiction in which the decedent was domiciled at the date of death. The voluntary representative shall indemnify and hold harmless the United States and all creditors and persons entitled to the estate of the decedent. The amount of the indemnification is limited to an amount no greater than the value received by the voluntary representative.

        (f)  If there has been no administration, no administration is contemplated, no summary or small estate procedures under applicable local law have been used, and there is no person eligible to serve as a voluntary representative pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section, then a creditor may make a claim for the amount of the debt, providing the debt has not been barred by applicable local law. The claim may only be satisfied by the proceeds of matured securities.

(Form PD 2495 may be used.) If the person assigning is designated in the resolution by title only, his incumbency must be duly certified by another member of the body. (Form PD 2446 may be used.) If the fiduciaries of any trust estate are empowered to act as a unit, although not designated as a board, committee or other body, securities registered in their names or assigned to them as such, or in their titles without their names, may be assigned by anyone authorized by the group to act in its behalf. Such assignments may be supported by a sworn copy of a resolution adopted by the group in accordance with the terms of the trust instrument, and proof of their authority to act as a unit may be required. As an alternative, assignments by all the fiduciaries, supported by proof of their incumbency, if not named on the securities, will be accepted.

        § 306.77   Corepresentatives and fiduciaries.

#### § § 306.77

        If there are two or more executors, administrators, guardians or similar representatives, or trustees of an estate, all must unite in the assignment of any securities belonging to the estate. However, when a statute, a decree of court, or the instrument under which the representatives or fiduciaries are acting provides otherwise, assignments in accordance with their authority will be accepted. If the securities have matured or been called and are submitted for redemption for the account of all, or for redemption-exchange or pursuant to an advance refunding or prerefunding offer, and the securities offered in exchange are to be registered in the names of all, no assignment is required.

        § 306.78   Nontransferable securities.

      Subpart J—Assignments in Behalf of Private or Public Organizations

        § 306.85   Private corporations and unincorporated associations (including nominees).

#### § § 306.85

        Securities registered in the name of, or assigned to, an unincorporated association, or a private corporation in its own right or in a representative or fiduciary capacity, or as nominee, may be assigned in its behalf for any authorized transaction by any duly authorized officer or officers. Evidence, in the form of a resolution of the governing body, authorizing the assigning officer to assign, or to sell, or to otherwise dispose of the securities will ordinarily be required. Resolutions may relate to any or all registered securities owned by the organization or held by it in a representative or fiduciary capacity. (Form PD 1010, or any substantially similar form, may be used when the authority relates to specific securities; Form PD 1011, or any substantially similar form, may be used for securities generally.) If the officer derives his authority from a charter, constitution or bylaws, a copy, or a pertinent extract therefrom, properly certified, will be required in lieu of a resolution. If the resolution or other supporting document shows the title of an authorized officer, without his name, it must be supplemented by a certificate of incumbency. (Form PD 1014 may be used.)

        § 306.86   Change of name and succession of private organizations.

#### § § 306.86

        If a private corporation or unincorporated association changes its name or is lawfully succeeded by another corporation or unincorporated association, its securities may be assigned in behalf of the organization in its new name or that of its successor by an authorized officer in accordance with § 306.85. The assignment must be supported by evidence of the change of name or successorship.

        § 306.87   Partnerships (including nominee partnerships).

#### § § 306.87

        An assignment of a security registered in the name of or assigned to a partnership must be executed by a general partner. Upon dissolution of a partnership, assignment by all living partners and by the persons entitled to assign in behalf of any deceased partner's estate will be required unless the laws of the jurisdiction authorize a general partner to bind the partnership by any act appropriate for winding up partnership affairs. In those cases where assignments by or in behalf of all partners are required this fact must be shown in the assignment; otherwise, an affidavit by a former general partner must be furnished identifying all the persons who had been partners immediately prior to dissolution. Upon voluntary dissolution, for any jurisdiction where a general partner may not act in winding up partnership affairs, an assignment by a liquidating partner, as such, must be supported by a duly executed agreement among the partners appointing the liquidating partner.

        § 306.88   Political entities and public corporations.

#### § § 306.88

        Securities registered in the name of, or assigned to, a State, county, city, town, village, school district or other political entity, public body or corporation, may be assigned by a duly authorized officer, supported by evidence of his authority.

        § 306.89   Public officers.

#### § § 306.89

        Securities registered in the name of, or assigned to, a public officer designated by title may be assigned by such officer, supported by evidence of incumbency. Assignments for the officer's own apparent individual benefit will not be recognized.

        § 306.90   Nontransferable securities.

#### § § 306.90

        The provisions of this subpart apply to Treasury Bonds, Investment Series B-1975-80.

      Subpart K—Attorneys in Fact

        § 306.95   Attorneys in fact.

#### § § 306.95

        (a)  Assignments by an attorney in fact will be recognized if supported by an adequate power of attorney. Every power must be executed in the presence of an authorized certifying officer under the conditions set out in § 306.45 for certification of assignments. Powers need not be submitted to support redemption-exchanges or exchanges pursuant to advance refunding or prefunding offers where the securities to be issued are to be registered in the same names and forms as appear in the inscriptions or assignments of the securities surrendered. In all other cases, the original power, or a photocopy showing the grantor's autograph signature, properly certified, must be submitted, together with the security assigned on the owner's behalf by the attorney in fact. An assignment by a substitute attorney in fact must be supported by an authorizing power of attorney and power of substitution. An assignment by an attorney in fact or a substitute attorney in fact for the apparent benefit of either will not be accepted unless expressly authorized. (Form PD 1001 or 1003, as appropriate, may be used to appoint an attorney in fact. An attorney in fact may use Form PD 1006 or 1008 to appoint a substitute. However, any form sufficient in substance may be used.) If there are two or more joint attorneys in fact or substitutes, all must unite in an assignment, unless the power authorizes less than all to act. A power of attorney or of substitution not coupled with an interest will be recognized until the Bureau receives proof of revocation or proof of the grantor's death or incompetency.

        (b)  Assignments by an attorney in fact or substitute attorney in fact for a legal representative or fiduciary, in addition to the power of attorney and of substitution, must be supported by evidence, if any, as required by §§ 306.57(d), 306.66(b), 306.75, and 306.76. Powers must specifically designate the securities to be assigned.

        (c)  Assignments by an attorney in fact or a substitute attorney in fact in behalf of a corporation or unincorporated association, in addition to the power of attorney and power of substitution, must be supported by one of the following documents certified under seal of the organization, or, if it has no seal, sworn to by an officer who has access to the records:

        (1) A copy of the resolution of the governing body authorizing an officer to appoint an attorney in fact, with power of substitution, if pertinent, to assign, or to sell, or to otherwise dispose of, the securities, or

        (2) A copy of the charter, constitution, or bylaws, or a pertinent extract therefrom, showing the authority of an officer to appoint an attorney in fact, or

        (3) A copy of the resolution of the governing body directly appointing an attorney in fact.

        (d)  A general power of attorney in behalf of a public corporation will be recognized only if it is authorized by statute.

        § 306.96   Nontransferable securities.

#### § § 306.100

        The Department will recognize valid judicial proceedings affecting the ownership of or interest in transferable securities, upon presentation of the securities together with evidence of the proceedings. In the case of securities registered in the names of two or more persons, the extent of their respective interests in the securities must be determined by the court in proceedings to which they are parties or must otherwise be validly established.

        § 306.101   Evidence required.

#### § § 306.101

        Copies of a final judgment, decree, or order of court and of any necessary supplementary proceedings must be submitted. Assignments by a trustee in bankruptcy or a receiver of an insolvent's estate must be supported by evidence of his qualification. Assignments by a receiver in equity or a similar court officer must be supported by a copy of an order authorizing him to assign, or to sell, or to otherwise dispose of, the securities. Where the documents are dated more than 6 months prior to presentation of the securities, there must also be submitted a certificate dated within 6 months of presentation of the securities, showing the judgment, decree, or order, or evidence of qualification, is in full force. Any such evidence must be certified under court seal.

        § 306.102   Nontransferable securities.

#### § § 306.102

        The provisions of this subpart shall apply to Treasury Bonds, Investment Series B-1975-80, except that prior to maturity any reference to assignments shall be deemed to refer to assignments of the bonds for exchange for the current series of 1  percent 5-year EA or EO Treasury notes.

      Subpart M—Requests for Suspension of Transactions

        § 306.105   Requests for suspension of transactions in registered securities.

#### § § 306.105

        (a)  If prior to the time a registered security bearing an apparently valid assignment has been functioned, a claim is received from the owner or his authorized representative showing that:

        (1) The security was lost, stolen, or destroyed and that it was unassigned, or not so assigned as to have become in effect payable to bearer, or

        (2) The assignment was affected by fraud, the transaction for which the security was received will be suspended.

        (b)  If, after a registered security has been transferred, exchanged, or redeemed in reliance on an apparently valid assignment, an owner notifies the Bureau that the assignment was affected by fraud or that the security had been lost or stolen, the Department will undertake only to furnish available information.

        (c)  A claim that an assignment of a registered security is a forgery will be investigated. If it is established that the assignment was in fact forged and that the owner did not authorize or ratify it, or receive any benefit therefrom, the Department will recognize his ownership and grant appropriate relief.

        § 306.106   Requests for suspension of transactions in bearer securities.

#### § § 306.106

        (a)  Neither the Department nor any of its agents will accept notice of any claim or of pending judicial proceedings by any person for the purpose of suspending transactions in bearer securities, or registered securities so assigned as to become in effect payable to bearer which are not overdue as defined in § 306.25.   However, if the securities are received and retired, the department will undertake to notify persons who appear to be entitled to any available information concerning the source from which the securities were received.

        (b)  Reports that bearer securities, or registered securities so assigned as to become in effect payable to bearer, were lost, stolen, or possibly destroyed after they became overdue as defined in § 306.25 will be accepted by the Bureau for the purpose of suspending redemption of the securities if the claimant establishes his interest. If the securities are presented, their redemption will be suspended and the presenter and the claimant will each be given an opportunity to establish ownership.

      Subpart N—Relief for Loss, Theft, Destruction, Mutilation, or Defacement of Securities

        § 306.110   Statutory authority and requirements.

#### § § 306.110

        Relief is authorized, under certain conditions, for the loss, theft, destruction, mutilation or defacement of U.S. securities, whether before, at, or after maturity. A bond of indemnity, in such form and with such surety, sureties or security as may be required to protect the interests of the United States, is required as a condition of relief on account of any bearer security or any registered security assigned in blank or so assigned as to become in effect payable to bearer, and is ordinarily required in the case of unassigned registered securities.

        § 306.111   Procedure for applying for relief.

#### § § 306.111

        Prompt report of the loss, theft, destruction, mutilation or defacement of a security should be made to the Bureau. The report should include:

        (a) The name and present address of the owner and his address at the time the security was issued, and, if the report is made by some other person, the capacity in which he represents the owner.

        (b) The identity of the security by title of loan, issue date, interest rate, serial number and denomination, and in the case of a registered security, the exact form of inscription and a full description of any assignment, endorsement or other writing.

        (c) A full statement of the circumstances.

        § 306.112   Type of relief granted.

#### § § 306.112

        (a)  After a claim on account of the loss, theft, destruction, mutilation, or defacement of a security which has not matured or been called has been satisfactorily established and the conditions for granting relief have been met, a security of like description will be issued to replace the original security.

        (b)  Payment will be made on account of the loss, theft, destruction, mutilation, or defacement of a called or matured security after the claim has been satisfactorily established and the conditions for granting relief have been met.

        (c)  Where relief has been authorized on account of a destroyed, mutilated or defaced coupon security which has not matured or been called, the replacement security will have attached all unmatured interest coupons if it is established to the satisfaction of the Secretary of the Treasury that the coupons were attached to the original security at the time of its destruction, mutilation or defacement. In every other case only those unmatured interest coupons for which the Department has received payment will be attached. The price of the coupons will be their value as determined by the Department at the time relief is authorized using interest rate factors based on then current market yields on Treasury securities of comparable maturities.

        § 306.113   Cases not requiring bonds of indemnity.

#### § § 306.113

        A bond of indemnity will not be required as a condition of relief for the loss, theft, destruction, mutilation, or defacement of registered securities in any of the following classes of cases unless the Secretary of the Treasury deems it essential in the public interest:

        (a) If the loss, theft, destruction, mutilation, or defacement, as the case may be, occurred while the security was in the custody or control of the United States, or a duly authorized agent thereof (not including the Postal Service when acting solely in its capacity as public carrier of the mails), or while in the course of shipment effected under regulations issued pursuant to the Government Losses in Shipment Act (parts 260, 261, and 262 of this chapter).

        (b) If substantially the entire security is presented and surrendered and the Security of the Treasury is satisfied as to the identity of the security and that any missing portions are not sufficient to form the basis of a valid claim against the United States.

        (c) If the security is one which by the provisions of law or by the terms of its issue is nontransferable or is transferable only by operation of law.

        (d) If the owner or holder is the United States, a Federal Reserve bank, a Federal Government corporation, a State, the District of Columbia, a territory or possession of the United States, a municipal corporation, or, if applicable, a political subdivision of any of the foregoing, or a foreign government.

#### § § 309.1

      The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized by the Second Liberty Bond Act, as amended, to issue Treasury bills of the United States on an interest-bearing basis, on a discount basis, or on a combination interest-bearing and discount basis, at such price or prices and with interest computed in such manner and payable at such time or times as he may prescribe; and to fix the form, terms, and conditions thereof, and to offer them for sale on a competitive or other basis, under such regulations and upon such terms and conditions as he may prescribe. Pursuant to said authorization, the Secretary of the Treasury may, from time to time, by public notice, offer Treasury bills for sale, and invite tenders therefor, through the Federal Reserve Banks and branches and through the Department of the Treasury, Bureau of the Fiscal Service. The Treasury bills so offered, and the tenders made, will be subject to the terms and conditions and to the general rules and regulations herein set forth, except as they may be modified in the public notices issued by the Secretary of the Treasury in connection with particular offerings.

      § 309.2   Description of Treasury bills (General).

#### § § 309.2

      Treasury bills are bearer obligations of the United States promising to pay a specified amount on a specified date. They will be payable at maturity upon presentation to the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, Washington, DC 20226, or to any Federal Reserve Bank or branch. Treasury bills are issued only by Federal Reserve Banks and branches and the Bureau of the Fiscal Service pursuant to tenders accepted by the Secretary of the Treasury, and shall not be valid unless the issue date and the maturity date are entered thereon. Treasury bills bearing the same issue date and the same maturity date shall constitute a series.

      § 309.3   Denominations and exchange.

#### § § 309.3

      Treasury bills will be issued in denominations (maturity value) of $10,000, $15,000, $50,000, $100,000, $500,000, and $1,000,000. Exchanges from higher to lower and lower to higher denominations of the same series (bearing the same issue and maturity dates) will be permitted at Federal Reserve Banks and branches and at the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, Washington, DC 20226. Insofar as applicable, the general regulations of the Treasury Department governing transactions in bonds and notes will govern transactions in Treasury bills.

      § 309.4   Taxation.

#### § § 309.4

      The income derived from Treasury bills, whether interest or gain from the sale or other disposition of the bills, shall not have any exemption, as such, and loss from the sale or other disposition of Treasury bills shall not have any special treatment, as such, under the Internal Revenue Code, or laws amendatory or supplementary thereto. The bills shall be subject to estate, inheritance, gift or other excise taxes, whether Federal or State, but shall be exempt from all taxation now or hereafter imposed on the principal or interest thereof by any State, or any of the possessions of the United States, or by any local taxing authority. For purposes of taxation the amount of discount at which Treasury bills are originally sold by the United States shall be considered to be interest.

      § 309.5   Acceptance of Treasury bills for various purposes.

#### § § 309.5

      (a)  Treasury bills will be acceptable at maturity value to secure deposits of public monies.

      (b)  The Secretary of the Treasury, in his discretion, when inviting tenders for Treasury bills, may provide that Treasury bills of any series will be acceptable at maturity value, whether at or before maturity, under such rules and regulations as he shall prescribe or approve, in payment of income taxes payable under the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. Treasury bills which by the terms of their issue are acceptable in payment of income taxes may be surrendered to any Federal Reserve Bank or Branch, acting as fiscal agent of the United States, or to the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, Washington, DC 20226, 15 days or less before the date on which the taxes become due.

      (1) In the case of payments of corporation income taxes (including payments of estimates) for taxable years ending on or after December 31, 1967, the bills shall be accompanied by a preinscribed Form 503, Federal Tax Deposit, Corporation Income Taxes, on which the face amount of the bills being surrendered should be entered in the space provided for the amount of the tax deposit. The office receiving the bills and Form 503 will acknowledge receipt of the bills to the owner corporation and effect the tax deposit on the date on which the taxes become due. Accordingly, in these cases, it will no longer be necessary to submit receipts for Treasury bills to the Internal Revenue Service with the corporation's declaration or tax return.

      (2) In the case of payments of all other income taxes the office receiving the bills will issue receipts (in duplicate) to the owners. The original of the receipt shall be submitted, by the owner, in lieu of the bills, together with the tax return, to the District Director, Internal Revenue Service.

      (c)  Notes securied by Treasury bills are eligible for discount or rediscount at Federal Reserve Banks as provided under the provisions of section 13 of the Federal Reserve Act, as are notes securied by bonds and notes of the United States.

      (d)  Treasury bills will be acceptable at maturity, but not before, in payment of interest or of principal on account of obligations of foreign governments held by the United States.

Each tender must be for a minimum amount of $10,000. Tenders over $10,000 must be in multiples of $5,000 (maturity value). In the case of competitive tenders the price or prices offered by the bidder for the amount or amounts (at maturity value) applied for must be stated, and must be expressed on the basis of 100, with not more than three decimals, e.g., 99.925.

        (10)  A bond may be registered in the name of a public corporation or a public body, or in the title of a public officer, acting as trustee under express authority of law, followed by an appropriate reference to the statute creating the trust. Examples:

        (d) —(1)  A bond may be registered in the name of any private organization in its own right. The full legal name of the organization as set forth in its charter, articles of incorporation, constitution, partnership agreement, or other authority from which its powers are derived, must be included in the registration and may be followed by a parenthetical reference to a particular account other than a trust account.

        (2)  A bond may be registered in the name of a business, fraternal, religious, non-profit, or other private corporation. The words “a corporation” must be included in the registration unless the fact of incorporation is shown in the name. Examples:

        (f)  A bond may be registered in the name of a State, county, city, town, village, school district, or other political entity, public body, or corporation established by law (including a board, commission, administration, authority, or agency) which is the owner or official custodian of public funds, other than trust funds, or in the full legal title of the public officer having custody of the funds. Examples:

        (g)  A person who desires to have a bond become the property of the United States upon his or her death may designate the United States Treasury as coowner or beneficiary. Examples:

Payment of a bond registered in coownership form pursuant to a judgment or a levy against only one coowner is limited to the extent of that coowner's interest in the bond. That interest must be established by an agreement between the coowners or by a judgment, decree, or order of a court in a proceeding to which both coowners are parties.

        (b)  The Department of the Treasury will pay, at current redemption value, a savings bond to a trustee in bankruptcy, a receiver of an insolvent's estate, a receiver in equity, or a similar court officer under the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section.

        § 315.22   Payment or reissue pursuant to judgment.

#### § § 315.22

        (a)  The Department of the Treasury will recognize a divorce decree that ratifies or confirms a property settlement agreement disposing of bonds or that otherwise settles the interests of the parties in a bond. Reissue of a savings bond may be made to eliminate the name of one spouse as owner, coowner, or beneficiary, or to substitute the name of one spouse for that of the other spouse as owner, coowner, or beneficiary pursuant to the decree. However, if the bond is registered in the name of one spouse with another person as coowner, there must be submitted either:

        (1) A request for reissue by the other person or

        (2) A certified copy of a judgment, decree, or court order entered in proceedings to which the other person and the spouse named on the bond are parties, determining the extent of the interest of that spouse in the bond.

        (b)  A savings bond belonging solely to one individual will be paid or reissued at the request of the person found by a court to be entitled by reason of a gift causa mortis from the sole owner.

        (c)  When payment or reissue under this section is to be made, the rights of the parties will be those existing under the regulations current at the time of the entry of the final judgment, decree, or court order.

        § 315.23   Evidence.

#### § § 315.23

        (a)  To establish the validity of judicial proceedings, certified copies of the final judgment, decree, or court order, and of any necessary supplementary proceedings, must be submitted. If the judgment, decree, or court order was rendered more than six months prior to the presentation of the bond, there must also be submitted a certificate from the clerk of the court, under court seal, dated within six months of the presentation of the bond, showing that the judgment, decree, or court order is in full force.

        (b)  A request for payment by a trustee in bankruptcy or a receiver of an insolvent's estate must be supported by appropriate evidence of appointment and qualification. The evidence must be certified by the clerk of the court, under court seal, as being in full force on a date that is not more than six months prior to the presentation of the bond.

        (c)  A request for payment by the receiver in equity or a similar court officer, other than a receiver of an insolvent's estate, must be supported by a copy of an order that authorizes the presentation of the bond for redemption, certified by the clerk of the court, under court seal, as being in full force on a date that is not more than six months prior to the presentation of the bond.

      Subpart F—Relief for Loss, Theft, Destruction, Mutilation, Defacement, or Nonreceipt of Bonds

        § 315.25   General.

#### § § 315.25

        Relief, by the issue of a substitute bond or by payment, is authorized for the loss, theft, destruction, mutilation, or defacement of a bond after receipt by the owner or his or her representative. As a condition for granting relief, the Commissioner of the Fiscal Service, as designee of the Secretary of the Treasury, may require a bond of indemnity, in the form, and with the surety, or security, he considers necessary to protect the interests of the United States. In all cases the savings bond must be identified by serial number and the applicant must submit satisfactory evidence of the loss, theft, or destruction, or a satisfactory explanation of the mutilation or defacement.

        § 315.26   Application for relief—after receipt of bond.

#### § § 315.26

        (a)  If the serial number of the lost, stolen, or destroyed bond is known, the claimant should execute an application for relief on the appropriate form and submit it to the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, Parkersburg, WV 26101.

        (b)  If the bond serial number is not known, the claimant must provide sufficient information to enable the Bureau of the Fiscal Service to identify the bond by serial number. See § 315.29(c). The Bureau will furnish the proper application form and instructions.

        (c)  A defaced bond and all available fragments of a mutilated bond should be submitted to the Bureau.

        (d)  The application must be made by the person or persons (including both coowners, if living) authorized under these regulations to request payment of the bonds. In addition—

        (1) If the bond is in beneficiary form and the owner and beneficiary are both living, both will ordinarily be required to join in the application.

        (2) If a minor named on a bond as owner, coowner, or beneficiary is not of sufficient competency and understanding to request payment, both parents will ordinarily be required to join in the application.

        (e) If the application is approved, relief will be granted by the issuance of a bond bearing the same issue date as the bond for which the claim was filed or by the issuance of a check in payment.

        § 315.27   Application for relief—nonreceipt of bond.

#### § § 315.27

        If a bond issued on any transaction is not received, the issuing agent must be notified as promptly as possible and given all information available about the nonreceipt. An appropriate form and instructions will be provided. If the application is approved, relief will be granted by the issuance of a bond bearing the same issue date as the bond that was not received.

        § 315.28   Recovery or receipt of bond before or after relief is granted.

#### § § 315.28

        (a)  If a bond reported lost, stolen, destroyed, or not received, is recovered or received before relief is granted, the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, Parkersburg, WV 26101, must be notified promptly.

        (b)  A bond for which relief has been granted is the property of the United States and, if recovered, must be promptly submitted to the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, Parkersburg, WV 26101, for cancellation.

        § 315.29   Adjudication of claims.

#### § § 315.29

        (a)  The Bureau of the Fiscal Service will adjudicate claims for lost, stolen or destroyed bonds on the basis of records created and regularly maintained in the ordinary course of business.

        (b)  A bond for which no claim has been filed within ten years of the recorded date of redemption will be presumed to have been properly paid. If a claim is subsequently filed, a photographic copy of the bond will not be available to support the disallowance. This provision will be effective 60 days after the effective date of the Eleventh Revision of Department of the Treasury Circular No. 530 (31 CFR part 315).

        (c)  No claim filed six years or more after the final maturity of a savings bond will be entertained, unless the claimant supplies the serial number of the bond.

      Subpart G—Interest

        § 315.30   Series E bonds and savings notes.

#### § § 315.30

        Series E bonds and savings notes are discount securities. The accrued interest is added to the issue price at stated intervals and is payable only at redemption as part of the redemption value. All Series E bonds and savings notes have been extended and continue to earn interest until their final maturity dates, unless redeemed earlier. Information regarding extended maturity periods, investment yields and redemption values is found in Department of the Treasury Circular No. 653, current revision (31 CFR part 316) for Series E bonds, and in Department of the Treasury Circular, Fiscal Service Series No. 3-67, current revision (31 CFR part 342) for savings notes.

        § 315.31   Series H bonds.

#### § § 315.31

        (a)  Series H bonds are current income bonds issued at par (face amount). Interest on a Series H bond is paid semiannually beginning six months from the issue date. Interest ceases at final maturity, or if the bond is redeemed prior to final maturity, as of the end of the interest period last preceding the date of redemption. For example, if a bond on which interest is payable on January 1 and July 1 is redeemed on September 1, interest ceases as of the preceding July 1, and no interest will be paid for the period from July 1 to September 1. However, if the redemption date falls on an interest payment date, interest ceases on that date. Information regarding authorized extended maturity periods and investment yields is found in Department Circular No. 905, current revision (31 CFR part 332).

        (b)  Series H bond interest accounts are maintained by the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, Parkersburg, WV. Interest is paid on each payment date by check drawn to the order of the owner or both coowners or, upon request, by the Automated Clearing House (ACH) method to the owner or coowner's account at a financial institution. Checks will be mailed to the delivery address provided to the Bureau.

        (c) —(1)  To ensure appropriate action, notices affecting the delivery of interest payments on Series H bonds must be received by the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, Parkersburg, WV, 26102-1328, at least one month prior to the interest payment date. Each notice must include the owner or coowner's name and the taxpayer identifying number appearing on the account under which records of the bonds are maintained.

        (2) —(i)  Upon receipt of notice of the death of the owner of a bond, payment of interest will be suspended until satisfactory evidence is submitted as to who is authorized to receive and collect interest payments on behalf of the estate of the decedent, in accordance with the provisions of subpart L.

        (ii)  Upon receipt of notice of the death of the ooowner to whom interest payments have been directed, payment of interest will be suspended until delivery instructions are received from the other coowner, if living. If both coowners are deceased, payment of interest will be suspended until satisfactory evidence is submitted as to who is authorized to receive and collect interest payments on behalf of the estate of the last deceased coowner, in accordance with the provisions of subpart L.

        (iii)  Interest on a bond registered in beneficiary form is paid to the owner during his or her lifetime. Upon receiving notice of the owner's death, the Bureau of the Fiscal Service will suspend payment of interest until the bond is presented for payment or reissue by the beneficiary, if surviving, or some other proper party. Interest so withheld will be paid to the person entitled to the bond.

        (d)  Interest on Series H bonds is paid in accordance with the provisions of § 315.60 to the representative appointed for the estate of an owner who is a minor, incompetent, absentee, et al. If the registration of the bonds does not include reference to the owner's status, the bonds should be submitted for reissue to a designated Federal Reserve Bank so that interest payments may be properly delivered. They must be accompanied by proof of appointment as required by § 315.60.

        (e)  If an adult owner of a Series H bond is incompetent to receive and collect interest payments, and no legal guardian or similar representative has been appointed to act for him or her, the relative, or other person, responsible for the owner's care and support may apply to the Bureau of the Fiscal Service for recognition as voluntary guardian for the purpose of receiving and collecting the payments.

        (f)  Physical reissue of a Series H bond may be made without regard to interest payment dates. The Series H accounts maintained by the Bureau of the Fiscal Service will be closed in the first week of the month preceding each interest payment date, and payments will be made pursuant to the information contained in the accounts as of the date they are closed.

        (g)  Interest checks must be endorsed in accordance with the regulations governing the payment of fiscal agency checks contained in 31 CFR part 355.

        (h) —(1)  Payments on all Series H bonds assigned to the same account maintained by the Bureau will be made to the same deposit account at a financial institution.

        (2)  Where the Series H bonds are registered in the name of individual(s) as sole owner, or as owner and beneficiary, and the deposit account at the financial institution is held in the name of individual(s) in their own right, the owner's name must appear on the deposit account. Where the bonds are registered in the names of two individuals as coowners and the deposit account is held in the name of individual(s) in their own right, the registration of the bonds and the title of the account must contain at least one name that is common to both. The deposit account to which the interest payments are directed should preferably be established in a form identical to the registration of the bonds to ensure that rights of ownership and survivorship can be more easily identified and preserved. Neither the United States nor any Federal Reserve Bank shall be liable for any loss sustained because the interest(s) of the holder(s) of a deposit account to which payments are directed are not the same as the owner(s) of the bonds.

        (3)  Where the deposit account to which interest payments are to be directed is held in the name of the financial institution itself, acting as sole trustee or as co-trustee, or is in the name of a commercially-managed investment fund, the owner or coowner should inquire whether the financial institution is able to receive ACH payments; if not, the owner or coowner should make alternative arrangements.

        (4)  If after submission of deposit account information, it is determined that ACH payments cannot be accepted by the designated financial institution, pending receipt of new deposit account information, payment will be made by check drawn to the registered owner or both coowners and mailed to the address of record.

        (5)  An ACH arrangement shall remain in effect until it is terminated by a request from the owner or coowner submitted to the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, Parkersburg, WV 26102-1328.

        (6)  Series H interest payments made by the ACH method are governed by the regulations at 31 CFR part 370.

        (7)  The Bureau of the Fiscal Service, Parkersburg, WV 26102 should be notified if:

        (i) An interest check is not received or is lost after receipt or

        (ii) An ACH payment is not credited to the designated account and the financial institution has no record of receiving it. The notice should include the owner or coowner's name and taxpayer identifying number and the interest payment date.

#### § § 315.35

        (a)  Payment of a savings bond will be made to the person or persons entitled under the provisions of these regulations, except that checks in payment will not be delivered to addresses in areas with respect to which the Department of the Treasury restricts or regulates the delivery of checks drawn against funds of the United States. See Department of the Treasury Circular No. 655, current revision (31 CFR part 211). Payment will be made without regard to any notice of adverse claims to a bond and no notification of stoppage or caveat against payment of a bond will be made.

        (b)  A bond of Series A, B, C, D, F, or J will be paid at face value.

        (c)  A Series E bond will be paid at any time after two months from issue date at the appropriate redemption value shown in Department of the Treasury Circular No. 653 (31 CFR part 316), current revision. A savings note will be paid at anytime at the appropriate redemption value shown in Department of the Treasury Circular, Fiscal Service Series No. 3-67, current revision (31 CFR part 342).

        (d)  A bond of Series G or K will be paid at face value plus the final semiannual interest due. For Series G bonds, the final interest paid with principal is $1.25 per $100; for Series K bonds, the final interest is $6.90 per $500.

        (e)  A Series H bond will be redeemed at face value at any time after six (6) months from issue date. In any case where Series H bonds are surrendered to a designated Federal Reserve Bank or Branch or the Department of the Treasury for redemption in the month prior to an interest payment date, redemption will not be deferred but will be made in regular course, unless the presenter specifically requests that the transaction be delayed until that date. A request to defer redemption made more than one month preceding the interest payment date will not be accepted.

        § 315.37   Payment during lives of both coowners.

#### § § 315.37

        A savings bond registered in coownership form will be paid to either coowner upon surrender with an appropriate request, and, upon payment (as determined in § 315.43), the other coowner will cease to have any interest in the bond. If both coowners request payment and payment is to be made by check, the check will be drawn in the form, “John A. Jones and Mary C. Jones”.

        § 315.38   Payment during lifetime of owner of beneficiary bond.

#### § § 315.38

        A savings bond registered in beneficiary form will be paid to the registered owner during his or her lifetime upon surrender with an appropriate request. Upon payment (as determined in § 315.43), the beneficiary will cease to have any interest in the bond.

        § 315.39   Surrender for payment.

#### § § 315.39

        (a)  An individual who is the owner or coowner of a bond of Series A, B, C, D, or E may present the bond to an authorized paying agent for redemption. The presenter must be prepared to establish his or her identity in accordance with Treasury instructions and identification guidelines. The owner or coowner must sign the request for payment on the bond or, if authorized, on a separate detached request, and add his or her address. In addition, in the case of a Series E bond or savings note, the presenter must record his or her social security number on the face of the security, provided it does not already appear in the inscription. Paying agents are authorized to refuse payment in any case where the presenter's number is not provided. If the request for payment has been signed, or signed and certified, before presentation of the bond, the paying agent must be satisfied that the person presenting the bond for payment is the owner or coowner and may require the person to sign the request for payment again. If the bond is in order for payment, the paying agent will make immediate payment at the current redemption value without charge to the presenter. Paying agents are not authorized to process any case involving partial redemption or any case in which supporting evidence is required.

        (b)  In the case of a bond to which the procedure in paragraph (a) of this section does not apply, or if otherwise preferred, the owner or coowner, or other person entitled to payment, should appear before an officer authorized to certify requests for payment, establish his or her identity, sign the request for payment, and provide information as to the address to which the check in payment is to be mailed. In addition, in the case of a Series E bond or savings note, the presenter must record his or her social security number on the face of the security, provided it does not already appear in the inscription. The bond must be forwarded to a designated Federal Reserve Bank or Branch or the Bureau of the Fiscal Service. Usually, payment will be expedited by submission to a designated Federal Reserve Bank or Branch. In all cases, the cost and risk of presentation of a bond will be borne by the owner. Payment will be made by check drawn to the order of the registered owner or other person entitled and will be mailed to the address requested.

        (c)  Requests executed more than six months before the date of receipt of a bond for payment will not be accepted. Neither will a bond be accepted if payment is requested as of a date more than three months in the future.

        (c)  If the name of the owner, coowner, or other person entitled to payment, as it appears in the registration or in evidence on file in the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, has been changed in any legal manner, the signature to the request for payment must show both names and the manner in which the change was made; for example, “Mary T. Jones Smith (Mary T. J. Smith or Mary T. Smith) changed by marriage from Mary T. Jones,” or “John R. Young, changed by order of court from Hans R. Jung.” See § 315.50.

        (d)  A request for payment, reinvestment, or exchange executed by an attorney-in-fact will be recognized if it is accompanied by a copy of the power of attorney that meets the following requirements:

        (1) The power of attorney must bear the grantor's signature, properly certified or notarized, in accordance with applicable State law;

        (2) The power of attorney must grant, by its terms, authority for the attorney-in-fact to sell or redeem the grantor's securities, sell his or her personal property, or, otherwise contain similar authority; and

        (a)  The representative of an estate of an owner who is a minor, an aged person, incompetent, absentee, et al., may receive upon request—

        (1) If the registration shows the name and capacity of the representative;

        (2) If the registration shows the capacity but not the name of the representative and the request is accompanied by appropriate evidence; or

        (3) If the registration includes neither the name of the representative nor his or her capacity but the request is accompanied by appropriate evidence.

        (b)  Appropriate evidence for paragraphs (a) (2) and (3) of this section includes a certified copy of the letters of appointment or, if the representative is not appointed by a court, other proof of qualification. Except in thee case of corporate fiduciaries, the evidence must show that the appointment is in full force and be dated not more than one year prior to the presentation of the bond for payment. The request for payment appearing on the back of a bond must be signed by the representative as such, for example, “John S. Jones, guardian (committee) of the estate of Henry W. Smith, a minor (an incompetent).”

        § 315.61   Payment after death.

#### § § 315.62

        If the owner of a savings bond is a minor and the form of registration does not indicate that there is a representative of the minor's estate, payment will be made to the minor upon his or her request, provided the minor is of sufficient competency to sign the request for payment and to understand the nature of the transaction. In general, the fact that the request for payment has been signed by a minor and certified will be accepted as sufficient proof of competency and understanding.

        § 315.63   Payment to a parent or other person on behalf of a minor.

#### § § 315.63

        If the owner of a savings bond is a minor and the form of registration does not indicate that there is a representative of his or her estate, and if the minor is not of sufficient competency to sign the request for payment and to understand the nature of the transaction, payment will be made to either parent with whom the minor resides or to whom legal custody has been granted. If the minor does not reside with either parent, payment will be made to the person who furnishes the chief support for the minor. The request must appear on the back of the bond in one of the following forms:

        (a)

        (b)

        § 315.64   Payment, reinvestment, or exchange—voluntary guardian of an incapacitated person.

#### § § 315.64

        (a)  When an adult owner of bonds is incapable of requesting payment as a result of incapacity and there is no other person legally qualified to do so, the relative, or other person, responsible for the owner's care and support may submit an application for recognition as voluntary guardian for the purpose of redeeming the owner's bonds, if the total redemption value of all of the owner's bonds does not exceed $20,000. The redemption value of the bonds shall be determined as of the date the bonds are received, accompanied by an appropriate request for payment. If the total redemption value exceeds $20,000, a legal representative must be appointed, as set forth in § 315.60.

        (b)  If the bonds have finally matured and it is desired to redeem them and reinvest the proceeds in other savings bonds, the new bonds must be registered in the name of the incapacitated person, followed by words showing that he or she is under voluntary guardianship; for example, “John Jones 123-45-6789, under voluntary guardianship”. A living coowner or beneficiary named on the matured bonds must be designated on the new bonds, unless such person furnishes a certified statement consenting to omission of his or her name. If an amount insufficient to purchase an additional bond of any authorized denomination of either series remains after the reinvestment, the voluntary guardian may furnish additional funds sufficient to purchase another bond of either series of the lowest available denomination. If additional funds are not furnished, the remaining amount will be paid to the voluntary guardian for the use and benefit of the incapacitated person.

        (c)  The provisions for reinvestment of the proceeds of matured bonds are equally applicable to any authorized exchange of bonds of one series for those of another.

      Subpart L—Deceased Owner, Coowner or Beneficiary

        § 315.70   General rules governing entitlement.

#### § § 315.70

        The following rules govern ownership or entitlement where one or both of the persons named on a bond have died without the bond having been surrendered for payment or reissue:

        (a)  If the owner of a bond registered in single ownership form has died, the bond becomes the property of that decedent's estate, and payment or reissue will be made as provided in this subpart.

        (b) —(1)  If one of the coowners named on a bond has died, the surviving coowner will be recognized as its sole and absolute owner, and payment or reissue will be made as though the bond were registered in the name of the survivor alone. Any request for reissue by the surviving coowner must be supported by proof of death of the other coowner.

        (2)  If both coowners named on a bond have died, the bond becomes the property of the estate of the coowner who died last, and payment or reissue will be made as if the bond were registered in the name of the last deceased coowner alone. Proof of death of both coowners will be required to establish the order of death.

        (3)  If both coowners die under conditions where it cannot be established, either by presumption of law or otherwise, which coowner died first, the bond becomes the property of both equally, and payment or reissue will be made accordingly.

        (c) —(1)  If the owner of a bond registered in beneficiary form has died and is survived by the beneficiary, upon proof of death of the owner, the beneficiary will be recognized as the sole and absolute owner of the bond. Payment or reissue will be made as though the bond were registered in the survivor's name alone. A request for payment or reissue by the beneficiary must be supported by proof of death of the owner.

        (2)  If the beneficiary's death occurs before, or simultaneous with, that of the registered owner, payment or reissue will be made as though the bond were registered in the owner's name alone. Proof of death of the owner and beneficiary is required to establish the order of death.

        (d)  If the person who becomes entitled to a bond because of the death of an owner is an alien who is a resident of an area with respect to which the Department of the Treasury restricts or regulates the delivery of checks drawn against funds of the United States or its agencies or instrumentalities, delivery of the redemption check will not be made so long as the restriction applies. See Department of the Treasury Circular No. 655, current revision (31 CFR part 211).

        § 315.71   Decedent's estate.

#### § § 315.71

        (a)  (1) A legal representative of a deceased owner's estate may request payment of savings bonds to the estate, or may distribute the savings bonds to the persons entitled.

        (2) Appropriate proof of appointment for the legal representative of the estate is required. Letters of appointment must be dated not more than one year prior to the date of submission of the letters of appointment.

        (b)  If the estate has been settled previously through judicial proceedings, the persons entitled may request payment or reissue of the savings bonds. A certified copy of the court-approved final accounting for the estate, the court's decree of distribution, or other appropriate evidence is required.

        (c)  If there is no formal or regular administration and no representative of the estate is to be appointed, the person appointed to receive or distribute the assets of a decedent's estate without regular administration under summary or small estates procedures under applicable local law may request payment or reissue of savings bonds. Appropriate evidence is required.

        (d)  If the total redemption value of the Treasury securities and undelivered payments, if any, held directly on our records that are the property of the decedent's estate is greater than $100,000, administration of the decedent's estate will be required. The redemption value of savings bonds and the principal amount of marketable securities will be used to determine the value of securities, and will be determined as of the date of death. Administration may also be required at the discretion of the Department for any case.

        (e) —(1)  A voluntary representative is a person qualified according to paragraph (e)(3) of this section, to redeem or to distribute a decedent's savings bonds. The voluntary representative procedures are for the convenience of the Department; entitlement to the decedent's savings bonds and held payments, if any, is determined by the law of the jurisdiction in which the decedent was domiciled at the date of death. Voluntary representative procedures may be used only if:

        (i) There has been no administration, no administration is contemplated, and no summary or small estate procedures under applicable local law have been used;

        (ii) The total redemption value of the Treasury securities and held payments, if any, held directly on our records that are the property of the decedent's estate is $100,000 or less as of the date of death; and

        (iii) There is a person eligible to serve as the voluntary representative according to paragraph (e)(3) of this section.

        (2)  A voluntary representative may:

        (i) Redeem the decedent's savings bonds on behalf of the persons entitled by the law of the jurisdiction in which the decedent was domiciled at the date of death;

        (ii) Distribute the decedent's savings bonds to the persons entitled by the law of the jurisdiction in which the decedent was domiciled at the date of death.

        (3)  An individual eighteen years of age or older may act as a voluntary representative according to the following order of precedence: A surviving spouse; if there is no surviving spouse, then a child of the decedent; if there are none of the above, then a descendant of a deceased child of the decedent; if there are none of the above, then a parent of the decedent; if there are none of the above, then a brother or sister of the decedent; if there are none of the above, then a descendant of a deceased brother or sister of the decedent; if there are none of the above, then a next of kin of the decedent, as determined by the law of the jurisdiction in which the decedent was domiciled at the date of death. As used in this order of precedence, child means a natural or adopted child of the decedent.

        (4)  By serving, the voluntary representative warrants that the distribution of payments or savings bonds is to the persons entitled by the law of the jurisdiction in which the decedent was domiciled at the date of death. The United States is not liable to any person for the improper distribution of payments or savings bonds. Upon payment or distribution of the savings bonds at the request of the voluntary representative, the United States is released to the same extent as if it had paid or delivered to a representative of the estate appointed pursuant to the law of the jurisdiction in which the decedent was domiciled at the date of death. The voluntary representative shall indemnify and hold harmless the United States and all creditors and persons entitled to the estate of the decedent. The amount of the indemnification is limited to an amount no greater than the value received by the voluntary representative.

        (f)  If there has been no administration, no administration is contemplated, no summary or small estate procedures under applicable local law have been used, and there is no person eligible to serve as a voluntary representative pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section, then a creditor may make a claim for payment for the amount of the debt, providing the debt has not been barred by applicable local law.

The request for reissue should be executed by the institution and any cofiduciary.

        (3)  If the fiduciary in whose name the bond is registered has been replaced by another fiduciary, satisfactory evidence of successorship must be furnished.

        (b)  At or after final maturity, a request for payment signed by any one or more of the fiduciaries will be accepted. Payment will be made by check drawn as the bond is registered.

        § 315.76   Payment or reissue after termination of the fiduciary estate.

#### § § 315.76

        A bond registered in the name or title of a fiduciary may be paid or reissued to the person who has become entitled by reason of the termination of a fiduciary estate.

Requests for payment or reissue by other than the fiduciary must be accompanied by evidence to show that the person has become entitled in accordance with applicable State law or otherwise. When two or more persons have become entitled, the request for payment or reissue must be signed by each of them.

        § 315.77   Exchanges by fiduciaries.

#### § § 315.77

        Fiduciaries are authorized to request an exchange of bonds of one series for those of another, pursuant to any applicable Department of the Treasury offering. A living coowner or beneficiary named on the bonds submitted in exchange may be retained in the same capacity on the new bonds.

#### § § 315.82

        § 315.88   Payment to a State claiming title to abandoned bonds.

#### § § 315.88

        (a)  The Department of the Treasury may, in its discretion, recognize an escheat judgment that purports to vest a State with title to a definitive savings bond that has reached the final extended maturity date and is in the State's possession, when the State presents evidence satisfactory to Treasury that the bond has been abandoned by all persons entitled to payment under Treasury regulations. A State claiming title to a definitive savings bond as the heir to a deceased owner must comply with the requirements of subpart L, and not this section. Treasury will not recognize an escheat judgment that purports to vest a State with title to a bond that has not reached its final extended maturity date. Treasury also will not recognize an escheat judgment that purports to vest a State with title to a bond that the State does not possess, or a judgment that purports to grant the State custody of a bond, but not title.

        (b)  At a minimum, a State requesting payment under this section must demonstrate to Treasury's satisfaction that it made reasonable efforts to provide actual and constructive notice of the escheat proceeding to all persons listed on the face of the bond and all persons who may have an interest in the bond, and that those persons had an opportunity to be heard before the escheat judgment was entered.

        (c)  Payment to a State claiming title under this section fulfills the United States' obligations to the same extent as if payment had been made to the registered owner.

### Part 316

**Authority:** Authority: 31 U.S.C. 3105 and 5 U.S.C. 301.

**Source:** Source: 57 FR 14276, Apr. 17, 1992, unless otherwise noted.

      § 316.1   Offering of bonds.

#### § § 316.1

      The Secretary of the Treasury offered for sale to the people of the United States, United States Savings Bonds of Series E, hereinafter generally referred to as “Series E bonds” or “bonds”.

      This offer was terminated as of December 31, 1979, except that, as to bonds purchased under payroll savings plans and employee plans, the offer was terminated as of June 30, 1980.

      § 316.2   Description of bonds.

#### § § 316.2

      (a)  Definitive (paper) Series E bonds bear a facsimile of the signature of the Secretary of the Treasury and of the Seal of the Department of the Treasury. They were issued only in registered form and are nontransferable.

      (b)  Series E bonds were issued on a discount basis. The denominations and issue prices were:

      (c)  At the time of issue, the issuing agent:

      (1) Inscribed on the face of each bond the name, social security number and address of the owner, and the name of the beneficiary, if any, or the name, social security number and address of the first-named coowner and the name of the other coowner (the inscription of the social security number was required for bonds issued on or after January 1, 1974);

      (2) Entered the issue date in the upper right-hand portion of the bond; and

      (3) Imprinted the agent's validation indicia in the lower right-hand portion to show the date the bond was actually inscribed. A bond was valid only if an authorized issuing agent received payment therefor and duly inscribed, dated and imprinted validation indicia on the bond.

      (d)  A Series E bond was dated as of the first day of the month in which payment of the purchase price was received by an agent authorized to issue the bonds. This date is the issue date. The bonds mature as shown in § 316.8. The bond may not be called for redemption by the Secretary of the Treasury prior to maturity or the end of any extended maturity period (see paragraph (a) of § 316.8). The bond may be redeemed at the owner's option at any time at fixed redemption values.

      (e)  The investment yield (interest) on Series E bonds is defined in paragraphs (c) and (d) of § 316.8. Beginning in the third month from its issue date, a bond increased in redemption value on the first day of each month, up to and including the thirtieth month from issue date, so as to provide for such period an investment yield of no less than 4 percent per annum, compounded semiannually. Thereafter, its redemption value increases at the beginning of each successive half-year period. The interest is paid as part of the redemption value.

      § 316.3   Governing regulations.

#### § § 316.3

      (a) The regulations in 31 CFR part 315 apply to definitive Series E bonds that have not been converted to book-entry bonds.

      (b) The regulations in 31 CFR part 363 apply to definitive Series E bonds that have been converted to book-entry bonds through New Treasury Direct.

> [70 FR 14941, Mar. 23, 2005]

      § 316.4   Registration.

#### § § 316.4

      Series E bonds were permitted to be registered as set forth in subpart B of 31 CFR part 315, also published as Department of the Treasury Circular No. 530, current revision.

      § 316.5   Limitation on holdings.

#### § § 316.5

      (a)  The amount of Series E bonds, originally issued during any one calendar year, that could be held by any one person, computed in accordance with the governing regulations, ranged from $5,000 (face amount) to $20,000 (face amount), depending upon the issue date.

      (b)  A special limitation for employee savings plans was provided, which was $2,000 (face amount) multiplied by the highest number of participants in any employee savings plan, as defined in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, at any time during the year in which the bonds were issued. The plan had to be established, as set forth below.

      (1)  (i) The employee savings plan must have been established by the employer for the exclusive and irrevocable benefit of employees or their beneficiaries, afforded employees the means of making regular savings from their wages through payroll deduction, and provided for employer contributions to be added to such savings.

      (ii) The entire assets thereof must have been credited to the individual accounts of participating employees and the assets so credited could be distributed only to the employees or their beneficiaries, except as otherwise provided herein.

      (iii) Series E bonds were to be purchased only with assets credited to the accounts of participating employees and only if the amount taken from any account at any time for that purpose was equal to the purchase price of a bond or bonds in an authorized denomination or denominations, and shares therein were credited to the accounts of the individuals from whom the purchase price thereof was derived, in amounts corresponding with such shares. For example, if $37.50 credited to the account of John Jones was commingled with funds credited to the accounts of other employees to make a total of $7,500, with which a Series E bond in the denomination of $10,000 (face amount) was purchased in December 1978 and registered in the name and title of the trustee, the plan must have provided, in effect, that John Jones' account would be credited to show that he was the owner of a Series E bond in the denomination of $50 (face amount) bearing the issue date of December 1, 1978.

      (iv) Each participating employee has an irrevocable right at any time to demand and receive from the trustee all assets credited to his or her account or the value thereof, if he or she so prefers, without regard to any condition other than the loss or suspension of the privilege of participating further in the plan. However, a plan was not deemed to be inconsistent herewith if it limited or modified the exercise of any such right by providing that the employer's contribution did not vest absolutely until the employee had made contributions under the plan in each of not more than 60 calendar months succeeding the month for which the employer's contribution was made.

      (v) Upon the death of an employee, his or her beneficiary has the absolute and unconditional right to demand and receive from the trustee all assets credited to the account of the employee, or the value thereof, if he or she so prefers.

      (vi) When settlement is made with an employee, or his or her beneficiary, with respect to any bond registered in the name and title of the trustee in which the employee has a share (see paragraphs (b)(1) (ii) and (iii) of this section), the bond must be submitted for redemption or reissue to the extent of such share. If an employee or his or her beneficiary is to receive distribution in kind, bonds bearing the same issue dates as those credited to the employee's account will be reissued in the name of the distributee to the extent to which he or she is entitled, in any authorized form of registration, upon the request and certification of the trustee, in accordance with the governing reguations.

      (2)  (i) The term  includes any regulations issued under the plan with regard to Series E bonds. A trustee desiring to purchase bonds in excess of the general limitation in any calendar year should have submitted to the Federal Reserve Bank of the district a copy of the plan, any such regulations, and the trust agreement, all certified to be true copies, in order to establish eligibility.

      (ii) The term  means all funds, including the employee contributions and employer contributions and _assets_ purchased therewith, as well as accretions thereto, such as dividends on stock, the increment in value on bonds and all other income; but, notwithstanding any other provision of this paragraph, the right to demand and receive all assets credited to the account of an employee shall not be construed to require the distribution of assets in kind when it would not be possible or practicable to make such distribution; for example, Series E bonds may not be reissued in unauthorized denominations, and fractional shares of stock are not readily distributable in kind.

      (iii) The term  means the person or persons, if any, designated by the employee in accordance with the terms of the plan to receive the benefits of the trust upon his or her death, or the estate of the employee, and the term  means the employee, or his or her _beneficiary_.

      § 316.6   Purchase of bonds.

#### § § 316.6

      Series E bonds were purchased, as follows:

      (a) —(1)  At such incorporated banks, trust companies, and other agencies as had been duly qualified as issuing agents.

      (2)  At such incorporated bank, trust company, or other agency, duly qualified as an issuing agent, provided the agent was trustee of an approved employee savings plan eligible for the special limitation in paragraph (b) of § 316.5 and prior approval to issue the bonds was obtained from the Federal Reserve Bank of the agent's district.

      (3)  At Federal Reserve Banks and Branches and at the Department of the Treasury, Washington, DC 20226.

      (b)  By mail upon application to any Federal Reserve Bank or Branch or to the Department of the Treasury, accompanied by a remittance to cover the issue price. Any form of exchange, including personal checks, was accepted, subject to collection. Checks or other forms of exchange were to be drawn to the order of the Federal Reserve Bank or the United States Treasury, as the case may be. Checks payable by endorsement were not acceptable. Any depositary qualified pursuant to the provisions of 31 CFR part 203, also published as Department of the Treasury Circular No. 92, current revision, was permitted to make payment by credit for bonds applied for on behalf of its customers up to any amount for which it was qualified in excess of existing deposits, when so notified by the Federal Reserve Bank of its district.

      (c)  The sale of United States Savings Stamps was terminated effective June 30, 1970. However, outstanding stamps affixed in fully or partially completed albums could be used to purchase Series E bonds at banks or other financial institutions authorized to issue such bonds. Stamps may be redeemed at banks and other financial institutions, through designated Federal Reserve Banks and the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, Parkersburg, West Virginia.

      § 316.7   Delivery of bonds.

#### § § 316.7

      Issuing agents were authorized to deliver Series E bonds either over-the-counter in person, or by mail at the risk and expense of the United States, to the address given by the purchaser, but only within the United States, its territories and possessions, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. No mail deliveries elsewhere were made. If purchased by citizens of the United States temporarily residing abroad, the bonds were delivered to such address in the United States as the purchaser directed.

      § 316.8   Extended terms and yields for outstanding bonds.

#### § § 316.8

      (a)  The terms  and  when used herein, refer to periods of 10 years or less after the original maturity dates during which owners may retain their bonds and continue to earn interest. No special action is required to take advantage of any extensions heretofore or herein granted. Series E bonds cease to accrue interest upon reaching final maturity.

      (b) —(1)  Series E bonds with issue dates of May 1, 1941, through April 1, 1952, reached or will reach final maturity 40 years after their respective issue dates, as shown below.

      (2)  Bonds with issue dates of May 1, 1952, through November 1, 1965, will receive an additional extension of maturity ranging from 4 months to 2 years and 3 months, as shown below, so that these bonds will reach final maturity 40 years after their respective issue dates.

      (3)  Bonds with issue dates of December 1, 1965, through June 1, 1980, will receive an additional extension of maturity ranging from 3 years to 5 years, as shown below, so that these bonds will reach final maturity 30 years after their respective issue dates.

      (c) —(1)  Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the guaranteed minimum investment yields for outstanding Series E bonds are as follows:

      (i) For Series E bonds that were in original or extended maturity periods prior to November 1, 1982, the guaranteed minimum investment yield was 8.5 percent per annum, compounded semiannually, effective for the period from the first semiannual interest accrual date on or after May 1, 1981, through the end of such periods, unless the bonds reached final maturity before November 1, 1981.   For bonds that entered extensions, see paragraphs (c)(1)(ii) through (c)(1)(iv) of this section.

      (ii) For Series E bonds that entered extended maturity periods during the period of November 1, 1982, through October 1, 1986, the guaranteed minimum yield was or is 7.5 percent per annum, compounded semiannually, for such periods, including bonds that entered into an extended maturity period, as shown below:

      (iii) For Series E bonds that entered into extended maturity periods during the period of November 1, 1986, through February 1, 1993, the guaranteed minimum yield was or is 6 percent per annum, compounded semiannually, for such periods, including bonds that entered into an extended maturity period, as shown below:

      (iv) For Series E bonds entering extended maturity periods on or after March 1, 1993, the guaranteed minimum yield is 4 percent per annum, compounded semiannually, or the guaranteed minimum investment yield in effect at the beginning of the period, including bonds that enter extended maturity periods, as shown below:

      (2)  If a bond bearing an issue date of January 1, 1951, or thereafter, was held for the 11-year period from the first semianual interest accrual period that began on or after January 1, 1980, its guaranteed minimum investment yield for such period was increased by one-half of one percent per annum, compounded semiannually.

      (d)  In order to be eligible for the market-based variable investment yield, Series E savings bonds had to be held at least five years beginning with the first semiannual interest accrual date occurring on or after November 1, 1982. The market-based variable investment yield shall be determined by the Secretary of the Treasury as follows:

      (1) For each 6-month period, starting with the period beginning May 1, 1982, the average market yield on outstanding marketable Treasury securities with a remaining term to maturity of approximately 5 years during such period is determined. Such determination by the Secretary of the Treasury or his or her delegate shall be final and conclusive.

      (2) For bonds which entered an extended maturity period prior to May 1, 1989, the market-based variable investment yield from the first semiannual interest accrual date occurring on or after November 1, 1982 to each semiannual interest accrual date occurring on or after November 1, 1987, will be 85 percent, rounded to the nearest one-fourth of one percent, of the arithmetic average of the market yield averages, as determined in accordance with paragraph (d)(1) of this section, for the appropriate number of 6-month periods involved, starting with the period beginning May 1, 1982.

      (3) For bonds which entered an extended maturity period on or after May 1, 1989, the market-based variable investment yield from the first semiannual interest accrual date occurring on or after November 1, 1982 to each semiannual interest accrual date occurring on or after November 1, 1989, will be 85 pecent, rounded to the nearest one-hundredth of one percent, of the arithmetic average of the market yield averages, as determined in accordance with paragraph (d)(1) of this section, for the appropriate number of 6-month periods involved, starting with the period beginning May 1, 1982.

      (e)  The redemption value of a bond on a given interest accrual date during any extended maturity period will be the higher of the value produced by using the applicable guaranteed minimum investment yield or the value produced by using the appropriate market-based variable investment yield. The calculation of these values is described below:

      (1)  A bond has a guaranteed minimum investment yield for each of its extended maturity periods. The applicable guaranteed minimum investment yields for the current extended maturity period and any subsequent periods are specified in paragraph (c) of this section. In order to determine the value of a bond during an extended maturity period, the value of the bond either at the end of the next preceding maturity period or when the guaranteed minimum investment yield last increased,   whichever occurs later, is determined using the applicable guaranteed minimum investment yield. This value is then used as the base upon which interest accrues during the extended maturity period at the guaranteed minimum investment yield in effect for savings bonds at the beginning of that period. The resulting semiannual values are then compared with the corresponding values determined by using the applicable market-based variable investment yields.

      (2)  The market-based variable investment yield from the first semiannual interest accrual date occuring on or after November 1, 1982 to each semiannual interest accrual date occurring on or after November 1, 1987, is determined as specified in paragraph (d) of this section. The value of a bond on its first seimannual interest accrual date occurring on or after November 1, 1982 is used as the base upon which interest accrues during an extended maturity period at the applicable market-based variable investment yield. If redeemed, the bond will receive the higher of the two values produced by using the applicable guaranteed minimum investment yield and the applicable market-based variable investment yield.

      (f)  The market-based variable investment yields for bonds redeemed during each 6-month period, beginning on May 1 and November 1 of each year, are made available prior to each of those dates by the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, Parkersburg, West Virginia 26106-1328, accompanied by tables of the redemption values of bonds for the following 6 months, based on either the applicable market-based variable investment yields or guaranteed minimum investment yields.

      § 316.9   Taxation.

#### § § 316.9

      (a)  For the purpose of determining taxes and tax exemptions, the increment in value represented by the difference between the price paid for Series E bonds and the redemption value received therefor constitutes interest. Such interest is subject to all taxes imposed under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The bonds are subject to estate, inheritance, gift, or other excise taxes, whether Federal or State, but are exempt from all other taxation now or hereafter imposed on the principal or interest thereof by any State, or any of the possessions of the United States, or by any local taxing authority.

      (b)  An owner of Series E bonds who is a cash-basis taxpayer may use either of the following two methods of reporting the increase in the redemption value of the bonds for Federal income tax purposes:

      (1) Defer reporting the increase to the year of final maturity, actual redemption, or other disposition, whichever is earlier; or

      (2) Elect to report the increases each year as they accrue, in which case the election applies to all Series E bonds then owned and those subsequently acquired, as well as to any other similar obligations purchased on a discount basis. If the method in paragraph (b)(1) of this section is used, the taxpayer may change to the method in paragraph (b)(2) of this section without obtaining permission from the Internal Revenue Service. However, once the election to use the method in paragraph (b)(2) of this section is made, the taxpayer may not change the method of reporting without permission from the Internal Revenue Service. For further information on Federal income taxes, the Service Center Director, or District Director, Internal Revenue Service, of the taxpayer's district may be contacted.

      § 316.10   Payment or redemption.

#### § § 316.10

      (a)  A Series E bond may be redeemed in accordance with its terms at the appropriate redemption value shown in the applicable table described in paragraph (f) of § 316.8. The redemption values of bonds in the denomination of $100,000 are not shown in the tables. However, the redemption value of a bond in that denomination will be equal to ten times the redemption value of a $10,000 bond of the same issue date. A bond in a denomination higher that $25 (face amount) may be redeemed in part but only in the amount of an authorized denomination or multiple thereof.

      (b)  Owners of Series E bonds may obtain payment upon presentation and surrender of the bonds to a Federal Reserve Bank or Branch referred to in § 316.12 or to the Department of the Treasury with the request for payment on the bonds duly executed and certified in accordance with the governing regulations.

      (c)  (1) A financial institution qualified as a paying agent under the provisions of 31 CFR part 321, also published as Department of the Treasury Circular, Fiscal Service Series No. 750, as revised, will pay the current redemption value of a Series E bond presented for payment by an individual whose name is inscribed on the bond as owner or coowner, provided:

      (i) The bond is in order for payment; and

      (ii) The presenter establishes his or her identity to the satisfaction of the agent, in accordance with Treasury instructions and identification guidelines, and signs and completes the requests for payment.

      (2) A paying agent may (but is not required to) pay a Series E bond, at current redemption value, upon the request of a legal representative designated in the bond's registration by name and capacity, a court-appointed legal representative of the last-deceased registrant's estate, or a beneficiary, if he or she survives the owner, provided:

      (i) The bond is in order for payment; and

      (ii) The presenter establishes his or her identity to the satisfaction of the agent, in accordance with Treasury instructions, indentification guidelines, and otherwise complies with evidentiary requirements.

        (b)  If the name of the presenter has been changed by marriage from that shown on the security, and the agent knows or establishes that the presenter and the person whose name appears on the security are one and the same individual, the agent may pay the security in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section. The signature to the request for payment should show both names, e.g., “Mary J. Smith, changed by marriage from Mary T. Jones.”

        (c)  Payment of a security bearing the name of a minor child, who is not of sufficient competency and understanding to sign the request for payment and comprehend the nature of the act, may be made to either parent with whom the minor resides or to whom custody has been granted, provided the form of registration does not indicate that a guardian or similar representative of the estate of the minor has been appointed or is otherwise legally qualified. Payment under this subsection may not be made to any person other than a parent. The parent requesting payment must sign the request for payment in the form, e.g., “John A.

The full title of the legal representative should be shown adjacent to each signature and, in the case of a corporate legal representative, the full corporate name, as well as the title, i.e., vice president, trust officer, etc., should be shown. Examples:

        (f)  An agent may redeem a security bearing the names of deceased persons in the registration, if the legal representative of the estate of the last deceased registrant:

        (b)  The agent shall determine that the presenter of the security is entitled to request payment, as provided in § 321.7 of this part. Unless the presenter is a person whose identity is well-known to the agent or is an established customer, he or she should be asked to furnish satisfactory identification in accordance with the Treasury instructions and guidelines. At the time of payment, the agent should make a notation on the back of the security, or in its own records, specifying precisely what was relied on to establish the presenter's identity.

        (c)  The agent shall determine that the presenter of the security as beneficiary is entitled to request payment, as provided in § 321.7(d).

Evidence of the representative's appointment must be either a court certificate or a copy of the letters of appointment, certified to be true and correct under seal of the court or clerk of court. If the original appointment was made more than one year prior to the presentation of the securities it must also bear the court clerk's statement that the appointment is in full force and effect. This statement must be under seal of the court or clerk of court and dated within six months of the presentation. Such evidence of appointment must pertain to the estate of the last deceased registrant designated on the securities.

        (e)  (1) The agent shall require:

        (i) That the request for payment on the back of each security be signed by the presenter in the presence of one of its officers or authorized employees; and

        (2) If the agent is qualified under 31 CFR part 330 (Circular No. 888, current revision) and elects to use the special endorsement procedure, the request for payment need not be signed. If the request has already been signed when the security is presented, it should be signed again.

        (f)  An agent is not required to complete the certification to the requests for payment on securities it redeems. When an agent transmits redeemed securities for settlement, as indicated in § 321.14 of this part, such agent shall be understood by such submission to have represented and certified that the identity of the presenter, and his or her entitlement to request payment, have been established in accordance with this part and the appendix hereto.

        § 323.1   Purpose of regulations.

#### § § 323.1

        The regulations of this subpart are issued to implement 5 U.S.C. 552(a)-(2) and (3). The requirements of 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(1) are met through the publication in the  of the statement of the organization, functions and procedures available of the Fiscal Service, including the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, and revisions thereof, and through the publication therein of substantive and procedural regulations of the Bureau. A synopsis of the statements of Bureau organization, functions and procedures available will be published annually by the Office of the *Federal Register* in the U.S. Government Organization Manual.

        § 323.2   Rules governing availability of information.

#### § § 323.2

        (a)  The records of the Bureau of the Fiscal Service required by 5 U.S.C. 552 to be made available to the public shall be made available in accordance with the regulations on the Disclosure of Records of the Office of the Secretary issued under 5 U.S.C. 552 and published as part I of title 31 of the Code of Federal Regulations, 32 FR 9562, July 1, 1967, except as specifically provided in this part.

        (b)  Records relating to the purchase, ownership of, and transactions in Treasury securities or other securities handled by the Bureau of the Fiscal Service for government agencies or wholly or partially Government-owned corporations will ordinarily be disclosed only to the owners of such securities, their executors, administrators or other legal representatives or to their survivors or to investigative and certain other agencies of the Federal and State governments, to trustees in bankruptcy, receivers of insolvents' estates or where a proper order has been entered requesting disclosure of information to Federal and State courts. These records are confidential because they relate to private financial affairs of the owners under this part. In addition, the information falls within the category of “personnel and medical files and similar files the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy” under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(6). FOIA Exemption (b)(6) protects the privacy of living persons who own securities as well as the close survivors of deceased owners. Privacy interests, in the sense of the right to control, use, or disclose information about oneself, cease at death. However, the exemption protects the deceased person's family-related privacy interests that survive death where disclosure would cause embarrassment, pain, grief, or disrupt the peace of mind, of the surviving family. The Bureau of the Fiscal Service will determine, under FOIA exemption (b)(6), whether disclosure of the records is in the public interest by balancing the surviving family members' privacy interest against the public's right to know the information.

      § 328.6   Requirements for endorsement.

#### § § 328.6

      (a)  The endorsement must be imprinted in the lefthand portion of the face of each security with the first line thereof parallel to the left edge of the security and in such manner as to be clearly legible and in such position that it will not obscure the serial number, series designation, or other identifying data, and cover the smallest possible portion of the text on the face of the security. The dimensions of the endorsement should be approximately 4 inches in width and 1  inches in height, and must be imprinted by stamp or plate of such character as will render the endorsement substantially ineradicable. The name of the Federal Reserve bank of the district must appear on the plate or stamp used for the imprinting of the endorsement, and presentation to the appropriate branch of the Federal Reserve bank named will be considered as presentation to the bank. When securities are to be presented to the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, the words “United States Treasury” should be used in lieu of the words “Federal Reserve Bank of _______, Fiscal Agent of the United States.” No subsequent endorsement will be recognized. If the form of endorsement on a security is different than that prescribed in § 328.5, the provisions of §§ 328.7 and 328.8 shall not apply to the security.

      (b)  Unmatured coupons attached to restrictively endorsed securities should be canceled by imprinting the prescribed endorsement in such manner that a substantial portion of the endorsement will appear on each such coupon. If any such coupons are missing, deduction of their face amount will be made in cases of redemption, and in cases of exchange, remittance equal to the face amount of the missing coupons must accompany the securities. All matured coupons, including coupons which will mature on or before the date of redemption or exchange (except as otherwise specifically provided in an announcement of an exchange offering), should be detached from securities upon which restrictive endorsements are to be imprinted.

      § 328.7   Shipment of securities.

#### § § 328.7

      Securities bearing restrictive endorsements may be shipped, at the risk and expense of the shipper, by registered mail, messenger, armored car service, or express to the Federal Reserve bank of the district in which the presenting bank, the Service Center Director, or the District Director, Internal Revenue Service, is located, or to the appropriate branch of such Federal Reserve bank, shipments to the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, Washington, DC, should be made by messenger or armored car.

      § 328.8   Loss, theft, or destruction of securities bearing restrictive endorsements.

#### § § 328.8

      (a)  Relief will be provided on account of securities bearing restrictive endorsements proved to have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the owner's application, in the same manner as registered securities which have not been assigned. (See subpart N of the current revision of Department Circular No. 300, the general regulations governing United States securities.) Except for bearer securities submitted for redemption at par in payment of Federal estate taxes, a bank will be considered the owner of securities handled on behalf of customers unless it otherwise requests. The application for relief (Form PD 2211) and instructions will be furnished by the Federal Reserve banks.

      (b)  Where securities bearing restrictive endorsements shipped by a bank have been lost, stolen, or destroyed, a bond of indemnity with surety satisfactory to the Secretary of the Treasury will be required from the owner. If such bond is executed by a bank or other corporation, the execution must be authorized by general or special resolution of the board of directors, or other body exercising similar functions under its bylaws. Ordinarily, no surety will be required on a bond executed by a presenting bank. The Secretary of the Treasury reserves the right, however, to require a surety in any case in which he considers such action necessary for the protection of the United States.

      § 328.9   Miscellaneous.

#### § § 330.2

      (a)  Any financial institution qualified as a paying agent of savings bonds and notes under the provisions of Department of the Treasury Circular No. 750, current revision, may establish its eligibility to employ the special endorsement procedure by executing and submitting the appropriate application-agreement form to the designated Federal Reserve Bank. In executing the form, the agent certifies that, by duly executed resolution of its governing board or committee, it has been authorized to apply for the privilege of paying and processing securities in accordance with the provisions and conditions of this part (Circular No. 888, including all supplements, amendments, and revisions, and any related instructions). If the application is approved, the designated Federal Reserve Bank will issue a certificate of qualification.

      (b)  Paying agents qualified under previous revisions of this part are authorized to continue to act without requalification.

Requests for stamps to be furnished or approved by a TRS Site must be made in writing by an officer of the paying agent. Stamps procured by an agent may not exceed a space bounded by 1  inches vertically and 3 inches horizontally. They must follow exactly the wording prescribed. They may also include space for the transaction date and the initials or signature of the officer or employee authorized to approve the transaction.

      (c)  In the case of securities registered in coownership or beneficiary form, the agent shall indicate which person, whose name is inscribed thereon, requested payment or exchange by encircling in black or other dark-colored ink the name of that person (or both coowners, if the request is joint) in the inscription on the face of the securities.

      (d)  Under no circumstances shall the special endorsement procedure be used to give effect to a transfer, hypothecation or pledge of a security, or to permit payment to any person other than the owner, coowner, or, where appropriate, beneficiary. Violation of these provisions will be cause for withdrawal of an agent's authority to process securities under the special endorsement procedure, and may involve additional penalties if the circumstances warrant such action.

#### § § 330.4

      By the act of paying or submitting to any Federal Reserve Processing Site, any TRS Site, or any Treasury office authorized to redeem securities, a security on which it has affixed the special endorsement, a paying agent shall be deemed to have:

#### § § 330.5

      (a)  The Treasury does not prescribe the form or type of instructions an agent must obtain from each owner, co-owner or beneficiary in order to use the special endorsement procedure. In the case of eligible Series E and EE savings bonds and savings notes presented for a redemption-exchange, the owner, coowner or beneficiary authorized to request the exchange (as specified in Circular No. 750, § 321.8(b)), must sign the exchange subscription even though the eligible Series E and EE savings bonds and savings notes are specially endorsed.

      (b)  Securities registered in coownership or beneficiary form should be accepted for special endorsement only for immediate payment or exchange. Acceptance of bonds and notes for processing at some future date should be avoided as authority to utilize such endorsement generally expires upon the death of the owner or coowner on whose behalf securities were to be paid. Requests for payment of securities present by the surviving beneficiary must be supported by a certificate of death for the owner named thereon, as required by Circular No. 750, part 321 and the appendix to that part.

      (c)  Agents should maintain such records as may be necessary to establish the receipt of, and compliance with, instructions supporting the special endorsement. If the agent elects to make notations on the backs of the securities to serve as a record, the Bureau of the Fiscal Service will undertake to produce, on request, photocopies of such securities at any time up to ten years after the redemption date. However, the Bureau does not not assume responsibility for the adequacy of such notations, for the legibility of any photocopy, or for failure to produce a photocopy from its records.

        § 337.1   Applicability of Treasury regulations.

#### § § 337.1

        The general regulations governing United States securities, part 306 of this chapter, apply, as the regulations for similar transactions and operations in certificated debentures. To the extent that the provisions in this part differ from the provisions in part 306, the provisions in this part shall prevail.

        § 337.2   Transportation charges and risks.

#### § § 337.2

        Debentures presented for redemption at call or maturity, or for authorized prior purchase, or for conversion to book-entry form, must be delivered at the expense and risk of the holder. Debentures bearing restricted assignments may be forwarded by registered mail, but for the owner's protection debentures bearing unrestricted assignments should be forwarded by insured registered mail.

> [66 FR 56432, Nov. 8, 2001]

        § 337.3   Termination of transfers and denominational exchange transactions.

#### § § 337.3

        Debentures, which by their terms are subject to call, may be called for redemption, in whole or in part, at par and accrued interest, on any interest date on three months' notice. No transfers or denominational exchanges in certificated debentures covered by a given call will be made on the books of the Department of the Treasury on or after the announcement of such call. However, this does not affect the right of a holder of such debenture to sell and assign it on or after the announcement of the call date.

        § 337.4   Presentation and surrender.

#### § § 337.4

        (a)  To facilitate the redemption of called or maturing debentures, they may be presented and surrendered in the manner prescribed in this section in advance of the call or maturity date, as the case may be. Early presentation by holders will insure prompt payment of principal and interest when due. The debentures must first be assigned by the registered payee or his assignee, or by his duly constituted representative, if required, in the form and manner indicated in § 337.5, and must then be submitted to the Bureau of the Fiscal Service at the address given in § 337.14, accompanied by appropriate written advice. A transmittal advice for this purpose will accompany the notice of call.

        (b)  Debentures, the purchase of which has been authorized prior to call or maturity, may be assigned as instructed in paragraph (a) of this section and immediately submitted in accordance with procedures prescribed by HUD for this purpose.

        § 337.5   Assignments.

#### § § 337.5

        (a) If the registered payee, or an assignee holding a certificated debenture under proper assignment from the registered payee, desires that payment be made to such payee or assignee, the debenture need not be assigned. If the owner desires for any reason that payment be made to another, without intermediate assignment, the debentures should be assigned to “The Federal Housing Commissioner for redemption (or, purchase) for the account of ____,” inserting the name and address of the person to whom payment is to be made. Proof of the authority of the individual assigning on behalf of an owner will be required in accordance with part 306 of this chapter.

        (b) An assignment in blank or other assignment having similar effect will be recognized, but in that event the debenture would be, in effect, payable to bearer, and payment will be made in accordance with the instructions received from the person surrendering the debenture for redemption or purchase. For the owner's protection, such assignments should be avoided unless the owner is willing to lose the protection afforded by registration.

        (c) Debentures submitted for conversion to book-entry form should be assigned to “The Federal Housing Commissioner for conversion to book-entry debentures for the account of ____.” The registration on the book-entry account and/or the account number in which the debentures should be deposited should be indicated.

        (d) All assignments must be made on the debentures themselves unless otherwise authorized by the Department of Treasury.

        § 337.6   Conversions to book-entry.

#### § § 337.6

        Upon implementation of the book-entry debenture system, to be announced in advance by separate public notice, all new debentures will be issued only in book-entry form, and may not thereafter be converted to certificated form.

        Certificated debentures may, upon the owner's request in accordance with § 337.5(c), be converted to book-entry. If such action is taken, the owner shall be deemed to have irrevocably waived the right to hold such debenture in certificated form.

        § 337.7   Servicing transactions.

#### § § 337.7

        Upon implementation of the book-entry debenture system, to be announced in advance by separate public notice, any transfer or denominational exchange of certificated debentures generally will be made in book-entry form. If certificated debentures are desired, the owner should so request in writing, before the book-entry debentures are issued.

        § 337.8   Payment of mortgage insurance premiums.

#### § § 337.8

        When certificated debentures are tendered for purchase prior to maturity in order that the proceeds thereof be applied to pay for mortgage insurance premiums, any difference between the amount of the debentures purchased and the amount of the mortgage insurance premium will generally be issued to the owner in the form of a book-entry debenture in the exact amount of such difference, provided it is one dollar ($1.00) or more. However, if the owner so requests, such difference will be settled with certificated debenture(s), together with a cash adjustment, if any. Such request should be made in writing, before the book-entry debenture in the amount of the difference is issued.

        § 337.9   Payment of final interest.

#### § § 337.9

        Final interest on any debenture, whether purchased prior to or redeemed on or after the call or the maturity date, will be paid with the principal. In all cases the payment of principal and final interest will be mailed or directed to the payment address given in the form of advice accompanying the debenture surrendered.

        § 337.10   Payments.

#### § § 337.10

        Payments on certificated debentures will be made by fiscal agency check in accordance with part 355 of this chapter, or, upon request, by direct deposit (electronic funds transfer) in accordance with part 370 of this chapter. Information as to the deposit account at the financial institution designated to receive a direct deposit payment shall be provided on the appropriate form(s) designated by the Department.

      Subpart B—Book-Entry Debentures

        § 337.11   Original issue and conversions.

#### § § 337.11

        Upon implementation of the book-entry debenture system, to be announced in advance by separate public notice, all new debentures will be issued only in book-entry form in the exact amount payable to the owner. Once issued in book-entry form, a debenture may not be converted to certificated form.

        § 337.12   Applicability of TREASURY DIRECT regulations.

#### § § 337.12

        The regulations governing the TREASURY DIRECT Book-Entry Securities System (TREASURY DIRECT) (part 357 of this chapter) apply to govern transactions in FHA book-entry debentures, with the following exceptions:

        (a)  (See § 357.20 of this chapter.) An account in the book-entry debenture system may be established by the Department of the Treasury upon receipt of the request that a new debenture be issued or that a certificated debenture be converted to book-entry form. The statement of account shall contain information regarding the account as of the date of such statement. It will include a unique account number, but will not include price information.

        (b)  (See § 357.22 of this chapter.) A book-entry debenture may be transferred only between accounts established in the FHA book-entry debenture system.

        (c)  Debentures, which by their terms are subject to call, may be called for redemption, in whole or in part, at par and accrued interest, on any interest date on three months' notice. For purposes of a transaction request affecting ownership and/or payment instructions with respect to a debenture announced for call, a proper request must be received not less than twenty (20) calendar days preceding the next payment date. If the twentieth day preceding a payment date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or a Federal holiday, the last day set for the receipt of a transaction request will be the last business day preceding that date. If a transaction request is received less than twenty (20) calendar days preceding a payment date, the Department may, in its discretion, act on such request if sufficient time remains for processing. If a transaction request is received too late for completion of the requested transaction, principal and final interest on the called debentures will be paid to the owner of record and sent to the payment address of record.

        (d)  (See § 357.26 of this chapter.) Direct deposit (electronic funds transfer) payments with respect to debentures, e.g., principal, interest and cash adjustments, will be made without prenotification messages.

        § 337.13   Payment of mortgage insurance premiums.

#### § § 337.13

        When book-entry debentures are being purchased prior to maturity to pay for mortgage insurance premiums, the difference between the amount of the debentures purchased and the mortgage insurance premiums shall be issued to the owner in the form of a book-entry debenture in the exact amount of such difference, provided it is one dollar ($1.00) or more.

      (a)  mean outstanding U.S. Savings Bonds of Series E and U.S. Savings Notes (freedom shares).

      (b)  means an owner of securities, except a commercial bank in its own right (as distinguished from a representative or fiduciary capacity) and a nonresident alien who is a resident of an area with respect to which the Treasury Department restricts or regulates delivery of checks drawn against funds of the United States or any agency or instrumentality thereof. The term includes a registered owner, whether or not a natural person, either coowner (but only the  if Series H bonds are requested in a form of registration different from that on the securities submitted), a surviving beneficiary, or any other person who would be entitled to reissue under the regulation governing U.S. Savings Bonds,   such as, but not limited to, any person entitled to succeed to the estate of a deceased owner.

      (e)  means a coowner who purchased the securities submitted for exchange with his own funds or received them as a gift, legacy or inheritance or as a result of judicial proceedings and had them reissued in coownership form, provided he has received no contribution in money or money's worth from the other coowner for designating him on the securities.

      § 339.2   Denominations.

#### § § 339.2

      Series H bonds, available for use hereunder, are in denominations of $500, $1,000, $5,000 and $10,000.

      § 339.3   Exchanges with privilege of deferring reporting of interest for Federal income tax purposes.

#### § § 339.3

      (a)  Pursuant to the provisions of section 1037(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, the Secretary of the Treasury hereby grants to owners who have not been reporting the interest on their securities on an accrual basis for Federal income tax purposes the privilege of exchanging such securities for Series H bonds and of continuing to defer reporting of the interest on the securities exchanged (except interest referred to in paragraph (b)(5) of this section) for Federal income tax purposes to the taxable year in which the Series H bonds received in exchange are disposed of, are redeemed, or have reached final maturity, whichever is earlier.

      (b)  (1) Exchange subscription Form PD 3253, completed and executed in accordance with the instructions thereon, the securities, any cash difference (see paragraph (b)(3) of this section), and any supporting evidence which may be required under the governing regulations   may be presented or forwarded to any authorized agency.

      (2) A Series H bond issued upon exchange will be registered in the name of the owner of the securities submitted in any authorized form of registration. However, the  must be named as owner or coowner.

      (3) The total current redemption value of the securities submitted for exchange in any one transaction must amount to $500 or more. If the total current redemption value is in an even multiple of $500, Series H bonds must be requested in that exact amount. If the total current redemption value exceeds $500, but is not in an even multiple of $500, the owner has the option of furnishing cash necessary to obtain Series H bonds of the next higher $500 multiple, or of receiving payment of the difference between the total current redemption value and the next lower multiple of $500. For example, under the rules prescribed in this circular, if the securities submitted for exchange in one transaction total $4,253.33 current redemption value, the owner may elect to:

      (i) Receive $4,000 in Series H bonds and the amount of the difference, $253.33, or

      (ii) Pay the difference, $246.67, necessary to obtain $4,500 in Series H bonds.

      (4) Any amount paid to the owner as a cash adjustment (as in paragraph (3)(i) of this section) must be treated as income for Federal income tax purposes for the year in which it is received up to an amount not in excess of the total interest on the securities exchanged.

      (5) Each Series H bond issued under this section will be stamped “EX” or “EXCH” to show that it was issued upon exchange. Each bond also will bear a legend showing how much of its issue price represents interest on the securities exchanged. This interest must be treated as income for Federal income tax purposes for the year in which the Series H bond is redeemed, is disposed of, or finally matures, whichever is earlier.

      (6) The Series H bonds will be dated as of the first day of the month in which the securities, the exchange subscription, any necessary cash difference and supporting evidence, if any, are accepted for exchange by an authorized agency.

      § 339.4   Exchanges without tax deferral.

#### § § 339.4

      Exchanges by owners who:

      (a) Report the interest on all of their securities annually for Federal income tax purposes, or

      (b) Who elect to report all such interest in the year of the exchange, or

      (c) Who are tax-exempt under the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 and the regulations issued thereunder,

      § 339.5   Governing regulations.

#### § § 339.5

      All Series H bonds issued under this circular are subject to the regulations, now or hereafter prescribed, contained in Department Circular No. 530, current revision (part 315 of this chapter).

      § 339.6   Fiscal agents.

#### § § 339.6

      Federal Reserve Banks and Branches, as fiscal agents of the United States, are authorized to perform such services as may be requested of them in connection with exchanges under these regulations.

      § 339.7   Preservation of rights.

#### § § 339.7

      The provisions of Treasury Department Circulars Nos. 530, 653, and 905, as currently revised, are hereby modified and amended to the extent that they are not in accordance with this circular. However, nothing contained herein shall limit or restrict rights which owners of Series H bonds received in earlier exchanges have heretofore acquired.

      § 339.8   Reservation as to terms of offer.

#### § § 339.8

      The Secretary of the Treasury reserves the right to reject any exchange subscription for Series H bonds, in whole or in part, and to refuse to issue or permit to be issued hereunder any such bonds in any case or any class or classes of cases if he deems such action to be in the public interest, and his action in any such respect shall be final.

      The foregoing revision and amendment is made for the purpose of granting to owners of savings notes the same privilege afforded owners of Series E savings bonds for exchanging their securities for Series H bonds with or without tax deferral. As good cause exists for making this change, which involves public property and contracts relating to the fiscal and monetary affairs of the United States, I find that notice and public procedures are unnecessary. This action is effected under the provisions of sections 18, 20, and 22 of the Second Liberty Bond Act, as amended (40 Stat. 1309, 48 Stat. 343, 49 Stat. 21, 73 Stat. 621, all as amended; 31 U.S.C. 753, 754b, 757c), and 5 U.S.C. 301.

> [28 FR 405, Jan. 16, 1963, as amended at 47 FR 18596, Apr. 30, 1982]

      § 341.1   Description of bonds.

#### § § 341.1

      (a)  United States Retirement Plan Bonds, hereinafter sometimes referred to as Retirement Plan Bonds, will be issued at par. The investment yields (interest) are as follows:

      (1) Bonds with issue dates of January 1, 1963, through May 1, 1966—3.75 percent per annum, compounded semiannually (see Table of Redemption Values in the appendix).

      (2) Bonds with issue dates of June 1, 1966, through December 1, 1969—4.15 percent per annum, compounded semiannually (see Table A in the appendix).

      (6) Bonds with issue dates of November 1, 1980, through September 1, 1981—8 percent per annum, compounded semiannually (see Table E).

      (7) Bonds with issue dates of October 1, 1981, or thereafter—9 percent per annum, compounded semiannually (see Table F).

      (b)  The maturity date of any bond issued under this circular shall be indeterminate, but unless sooner redeemed in accordance with the regulations in this part, its investment yield will cease on the interest accrual date coinciding with, or, where no such coincidence occurs, the interest accrual date next preceding, the first day of the sixtieth (60th) month following the date of death of the person in whose name it is registered.

      (c)  Retirement Plan Bonds will be available only in registered form and in denominations of $50, $100, $500, and $1,000. At the time of issue, the issuing agent will enter in the upper right-hand portion of the bond the issue date (which shall be the first day of the month and year in which payment of the purchase price is received by an authorized issuing agent), and will imprint the agent's validating stamp in the lower right-hand portion. The issue date, as distinguished from the date in the agent's validating stamp, will determine the date from which interest will begin to accrue on the bond. A Retirement Plan Bond shall be valid only if an authorized issuing agent receives payment therefor, duly inscribes, dates, stamps, and delivers it.

      § 341.2   Registration.

#### § § 341.2

      (a)  The registration of Retirement Plan Bonds is limited to the names of natural persons in their own right, whether adults or minors, in either single ownership or beneficiary form. A bond registered in beneficiary form will be inscribed substantially as follows (for example): “John A. Doe payable on death to (or P.O.D.) Richard B. Roe,” No more than one beneficiary may be designated on a bond.

      (b)  The inscription on the face of each bond will show the name, address, and date of birth of the registered owner, as well as information as to whether he is a self-employed individual or an employee, and the amount he contributed (if any) out of his own funds toward the purchase price of the bond. In the case of any self-employed individual (who is treated as an employee for the purpose of sections 405 and 401 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954), this amount would be that portion of the purchase price he contributed (if any) as an employee and which he will not take into account in determining the amount deductible for Federal income tax purposes. The name of the beneficiary, if one is to be designated, will also be shown in the inscription.

Customers of commercial banks and trust companies may be able to arrange for the purchase of the bonds through such institutions, but only the Federal Reserve Banks and Branches and the Bureau of the Fiscal Service are authorized to act as official agencies, and the date of receipt of the application and payment by an official agency will govern the dating of the bonds issued.

      (b)  Applications for the purchase of Retirement Plan Bonds should be made on Form PD 3550, accompanied by a remittance to cover the purchase price. Personal checks will be accepted, subject to collection. Checks or other forms of exchange, should be drawn to the Federal Reserve Bank or United States Treasury, as the case may be. Checks payable by endorsement are not acceptable.

      (c)  Delivery of bonds will be made in person, or by mail at the risk and expense of the United States, at the address given by the purchaser, but only within the United States, its territories and possessions, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and the Canal Zone.

      § 341.4   Proof of purchase.

#### § § 341.4

      At the time a Retirement Plan Bond is issued, the issuing agent will furnish therewith to the purchaser, and in cases where the purchaser is different from the person in whose name the bond is inscribed, to the registered owner as well, proof of the purchase on Form PD 3550. The form will show the names and addresses of the purchaser and of the registered owner, the latter's date of birth, social security account number and his classification (, self-employed individual or employee) the number of bonds issued, a description thereof by issue date, serial numbers, denominations, and registration, together with information as to the amount of his contributions (if any) toward the purchase price of the bonds.

#### § § 341.6

      United States Retirement Plan Bonds are not transferable, and may not be sold, discounted or pledged as collateral for a loan or as security for the performance of an obligation, or for any other purpose.

      § 341.7   Judicial proceedings.

#### § § 341.7

      No judicial determinations will be recognized which would give effect to an attempted voluntary transfer inter vivos of a Retirement Plan Bond. Otherwise, a claim against a registered owner will be recognized when established by valid judicial proceedings, but in no case will payment be made to the purchaser at a sale under a levy or to the officer authorized to levy upon the property of the owner under appropriate process to satisfy a money judgement unless or until the bond has become eligible for redemption pursuant to the regulations in this part. Neither the Treasury Department nor any of its agencies will accept notices of adverse claims or of pending judicial proceedings or undertake to protect the interests of litigants who do not have possession of the bond.

      § 341.8   Payment or redemption during lifetime of owner.

#### § § 341.8

      (a)  A Retirement Plan Bond will be redeemable at its current redemption value upon the request of the registered owner (or a person recognized as entitled to act on his behalf), provided he is 59  years of age or older. The owner's age will be determined from the date of birth shown on the face of the bond, provided, however, that the Secretary of the Treasury reserves the right in any case or class of cases to require proof, in the form of a duly certified copy of his birth certificate, that the owner has attained the age of 59  years. If such evidence is unavailable, one of the following documents may be furnished in lieu thereof:

      (1) Church records of birth or baptism.

      (2) Hospital birth record or certificate.

      (3) Physician's or midwife's birth record.

      (4) Certification of Bible or other family record.

      (5) Military, naturalization or immigration records.

      (6) Other evidence of probative value. Similar documentary evidence will also be required to support any claim made by an owner that the date of birth shown on his bond is incorrect.

      (b)  A Retirement Plan Bond will be paid at its then current redemption value upon a registered owner's request (or by a person recognized as entitled to act on his behalf) prior to his attainment of age 59  years upon submission of a physician's statement or any similar evidence showing that the owner has become disabled to such an extent that he is unable to engage in any substantial, gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or to be of long-continued and indefinite duration. The following are examples of impairments which would ordinarily be considered as preventing substantial, gainful activity:

      (1) Loss of use of two limbs.

      (2) Certain progressive diseases which have resulted in the physical loss or atrophy of a limb, such as diabetes, multiple sclerosis, or Buerger's disease.

      (3) Diseases of the heart, lungs, or blood vessels which have resulted in major loss of heart or lung reserve as evidenced by X-ray, electrocardiogram, or other objective findings, so that despite medical treatment breathlessness, pain, or fatigue is produced on slight exertion, such as walking several blocks, using public transportation, or doing small chores.

      (4) Cancer which is inoperable and progressive.

      (5) Damage to the brain or brain abnormality which has resulted in severe loss of judgment, intellect, orientation, or memory.

      (6) Mental diseases (e.g., psychosis or severe psychoneurosis) requiring continued institutionalization or constant supervision of the individual.

      (7) Loss or diminution of vision to the extent that the affected individual has a central visual acuity of no better than 20/200 in the better eye after best correction, or has a limitation in the fields of vision such that the widest diameter of the visual fields subtends an angle no greater than 20 degrees.

      (8) Permanent and total loss of speech.

      (9) Total deafness uncorrectible by a hearing aid.

      (c) —(1)  When redemption of any Retirement Plan Bond is desired by the registered owner under paragraph (a) of this section, it should be presented with the request for payment on the back of the bond signed and duly certified, to a Federal Reserve Bank or Branch or to the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, Securities Transactions Branch, Washington, DC 20226, or Bureau of the Fiscal Service, Division of Transactions and Rulings, Parkersburg, WV 26101. If payment is requested under paragraph (b) of this section, the letter described therein should accompany the bond.

      (2)  When redemption of any Retirement Plan Bond is desired by the legal guardian, committee conservator, or similar representative of the owner's estate under paragraph (a) of this section, it should be presented, with the request signed as described below, to a Federal Reserve Bank or Branch or to the Bureau of the Fiscal Service. If payment is requested under paragraph (b) of this section, the letter described therein should accompany the bond.   The request for payment, in either case, should be signed by the representative in his fiduciary capacity before an authorized certifying officer, and must be supported by a certificate or a certified copy of the letters of the appointment from the court making the appointment, under seal, or other proof of qualification if the appointment was not made by a court. Except in the case of corporate fiduciaries, such evidence should state that the appointment is in full force and should be dated not more than one year prior to the presentation of the bond for payment.

      (d)  A Retirement Plan Bond in a denomination greater than $50 (face value) which is otherwise eligible for redemption may be redeemed in part, at current redemption value, upon the request of the registered owner (or a person recognized as entitled to act on his behalf), but only in amounts corresponding to authorized denominations. In any case in which partial redemption is desired, before the request for payment is signed, the phrase “to the extent of $__ (face value) and reissue of the remainder” should be appended to the request. Upon partial redemption of the bond, the remainder will be reissued as of the original issue date. No partial redemption of a bond will be made after the death of the owner in whose name it is registered.

      § 341.9   Payment or redemption after death of owner.

#### § § 341.9

      (a)  If the registered owner of a Retirement Plan Bond dies before it has been presented and surrendered for payment, and there is no beneficiary shown thereon, or if the designated beneficiary predeceased the owner, the bond shall be paid in the following order of precedence:

      (1) To the duly appointed executor or administrator of the estate of the owner, who should sign the request for payment on the back of the bond in his representative capacity before an authorized certifying officer, such request to be supported by a court certificate or a certified copy of his letters of appointment, under seal of the court, which should show that the appointment is in full force and effect, and be dated within six months of its presentation;

      (2) If no legal representative of the deceased registered owner's estate has been or will be appointed, to the widow or widower of the owner;

      (3) If none of the above, to the child or children of the owner and the descendants of deceased children by representation;

      (4) If none of the above, to the parents of the owner, or the survivor of them;

      (5) In none of the above, to other next-of-kin of the owner, as determined by the laws of the domicile of such owner at the time of his death. In any case coming under the provisions of this paragraph, a duly certified copy of the registered owner's death certificate will ordinarily be required. Proof of death of the beneficiary, if any, will be required where he predeceased the owner. Payment of bonds under paragraph (a)(1) of this section will be made by a Federal Reserve Bank or Branch or by the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, Securities Transactions Branch, Washington, DC 20226, or Bureau of the Fiscal Service, Division of Transactions and Rulings, Parkersburg, WV 26101. Payment of bonds under paragraphs (a)(2) to (5) of this section will be made upon receipt of applications on Form PD 3565, together with the bonds and supporting evidence, by the Bureau of the Fiscal Service.

      (b)  If the registered owner of a Retirement Plan Bond dies before it has been presented and surrendered for payment, and the beneficiary shown thereon survived the owner, the bond shall be paid in the following order of precedence:

      (1) To the designated beneficiary upon his presentation and surrender of the bond with the request for payment signed and duly certified, such payment to be made to the exclusion of any other person who may have been named beneficiary by the registered owner in a bond purchase plan, or under a pension or profit-sharing plan;

      (2) If the designated beneficiary survived the registered owner but failed to present the bond for payment during his own lifetime, payment will be made in the order of precedence specified in paragraphs (a) (1) to (5) of this section to the legal representative, surviving spouse, children, parents, or next-of-kin of such beneficiary, and in the manner provided therein.

      (c)  The orders of precedence set forth in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, except in case where redemption is made for the account of a registered owner, are for the Department's convenience in discharging its obligation on a Retirement Plan Bond. The discharge of the obligation in accordance therewith shall be final so far as the Department is concerned, but those provisions do not otherwise purport to determine ownership of the redemption proceeds of a bond.

    PART 342—OFFERING OF UNITED STATES SAVINGS NOTES

### Part 342

**Authority:** Authority: 31 U.S.C. 3103, 5 U.S.C. 301.

**Source:** Source: 57 FR 14282, Apr. 17, 1992, unless otherwise noted.

      § 342.0   Offering of notes.

#### § § 342.0

      The Secretary of the Treasury offered for sale to the people of the United States, United States Savings Notes (also known as “Freedom Shares”, and generally referred to herein as “savings notes” or “notes”). The notes could be purchased only in combination with Series E savings bonds of the same or greater denomination. This offering was effective from May 1, 1967 until the close of business October 31, 1970 when the sale of savings notes was terminated by the Secretary of the Treasury.

      § 342.1   Definition of words and terms used in this part.

#### § § 342.1

      (a)  refers to a voluntary program maintained by an employer whereby its participating officers and employees authorize regular withholdings from their salaries or wages for the purchase of savings bonds.

      (b)  refers to a 3-month period of a year, as follows: January-February-March, April-May-June, July-August-September, or October-November-December.

      § 342.2   Description of notes.

#### § § 342.2

      (a)  Savings notes were issued only in registered form and are nontransferable.

      (b)  A savings note was dated as of the first day of the month in which payment of the purchase price was received by an issuing agent. A note had an original maturity period of 4 years and 6 months and has been granted two 10-year extensions of maturity and an additional extension of 5 years and 6 months with interest; it will reach final maturity 30 years from its issue date. A note cannot be called by the Secretary of the Treasury prior to maturity and was not redeemable during the first year from issue date. Thereafter, a note may be redeemed at the option and request of the owner.

      (c)  Savings notes were issued on a discount basis. The denominations and purchase prices were as follows:

      (d)  At the time of issue, the authorized issuing agent:

      (1) Inscribed on the face of each note the name and address of the owner and the name of the beneficiary, if any, or the names of the coowner;

      (2) Entered the issue date in the right-hand portion of the note in the space provided for that purpose; and

      (3) Imprinted thereunder, by use of the agent's validation indicia for the issue of Series E savings bonds, the date the note was actually inscribed. A note is valid only if an authorized issuing agent received payment therefor and duly inscribed, dated, imprinted validation indicia on the note and delivered it.

      § 342.3   Extended terms and yields for outstanding notes.

#### § § 342.3

      (a)  The terms  and  refer to the 10-year intervals after the original maturity dates during which owners may retain their savings notes and continue to earn interest thereon. The term  refers to the final interval of 5 years and 6 months during which owners may retain notes and continue to earn interest until final maturity, which occurs 30 years after issue date. No special action is required of owners to take advantage of any extension heretofore or herein granted. The following table describes the previous and final maturities of savings notes:

      (b) —(1)  Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the guaranteed minimum investment yields for outstanding savings notes are as follows:

      (i) For savings notes in extended maturity periods prior to November 1, 1982, the guaranteed minimum investment yield was 8.5 percent per annum, compounded semiannually, effective for the period from the first semiannual interest accrual date on or after May 1, 1981, through their next extended maturity dates on or after November 1, 1982.

      (ii) For savings notes that entered extended maturity periods during the period of November 1, 1982, through October 1, 1986, the guaranteed minimum investment yield was 7.5 percent per annum, compounded semiannually, for such periods, including notes that entered into an extended maturity period, as shown below:

      (iii) For savings notes that entered into extended maturity periods during the period of November 1, 1986, through February 1, 1993, the guaranteed minimum investment yield is 6 percent per annum, compounded semiannually, for such periods, including notes that entered into an extended maturity period, as shown below:

      (iv) For savings notes that entered or enter extended maturity periods on or after March 1, 1993, the guaranteed minimum investment yield is 4 percent per annum, compounded semiannually, for such periods, or the investment yield in effect at the beginning of such periods, including notes that enter into an extended maturity period, as shown below:

      (2)  If a savings note was held for the 11-year period beginning with the first semiannual interest accrual date that occurred on or after January 1, 1980, its guaranteed minimum investment yield for such period was increased by one-half of one percent per annum, compounded semiannually.

      (c)  In order to be eligible for the market-based variable investment yield, notes had to be held at least five years beginning with the first semiannual interest accrual date occurring on or after November 1, 1982. The market-based variable investment yield shall be determined by the Secretary of the Treasury as follows:

      (1) For each 6-month period, starting with the period beginning May 1, 1982, the average market yield on outstanding marketable Treasury securities with a remaining term to maturity of approximately 5 years during such period as determined. Such determination by the Secretary of the Treasury or his or her delegate shall be final and conclusive.

      (2) For notes which entered an extended maturity period prior to May 1, 1989, the market-based variable investment yield from the first semiannual interest accrual date occurring on or after November 1, 1982 to each semiannual interest accrual date occuring on or after November 1, 1987, will be 85 percent, rounded to the nearest one-fourth of one percent, of the arithmetic average of the market yield averages, as determined in accordance with paragraph (c)(1) of this section, for the appropriate number of 6-month periods involved, starting with the period beginning May 1, 1982.

      (3) For notes which entered an extended maturity period on or after May 1, 1989, the market-based variable investment yield from the first semiannual interest accrual date occurring on or after November 1, 1982 to each semiannual interest accrual date occurring on or after November 1, 1989, will be 85 percent, rounded to the nearest one-hundredth of one percent, of the arithmetic average of the market yield averages, as determined in accordance with paragraph (c)(1) of this section for the appropriate number of 6-month periods involved, starting with the period beginning May 1, 1982.

      (d)  The redemption value of a note on a given interest accrual date during any extended maturity period will be the higher of the value produced by using the applicable guaranteed minimum investment yield or the value produced by using the appropriate market-based variable investment yield. The calculation of these values is described below:

      (1)  A note has a guaranteed minimum investment yield for each of its extended maturity periods. The applicable guaranteed minimum investment yield for the current extended maturity period and any subsequent periods are specified in paragraph (b) of this section. In order to determine the value of a note during an extended maturity period, the value of the note either at the end of the next preceding maturity period or when the guaranteed minimum investment yield last increased,   whichever occurs later, is determined using the applicable guaranteed minimum investment yield. This value is then used as the base upon which interest accrues during the extended maturity period at the guaranteed minimum investment yield in effect for savings bonds at the beginning of that period. The resulting semiannual values are then compared with the corresponding values determined by using the applicable market-based variable investment yields.

      (2)  The market-based variable investment yield from the first semiannual interest accrual date occurring on or after November 1, 1982 to each semiannual interest accrual date occurring on or after November 1, 1987, is determined as specified in paragraph (c) of this section. The value of a note on its first semiannual interest accrual date occurring on or after November 1, 1982 is used as the base upon which interest accrues during an extended maturity period at the applicable market-based variable investment yield. If redeemed, the note will receive the higher of the two values produced by using the applicable guaranteed minimum investment yield and the applicable market-based variable investment yield.

      (e)  The market-based variable investment yields for notes redeemed during each 6-month period, beginning on May 1 and November 1 of each year, are made available prior to each of those dates by the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, Parkersburg, West Virginia 26106-1328, accompanied by tables of the redemption values of notes for the following 6 months, based on either the applicable market-based variable investment yields or guaranteed minimum investment yields.

      § 342.6   Taxation.

#### § § 342.6

      (a)  For the purpose of determining taxes and tax exemptions, the increment in value represented by the difference between the purchase price and the redemption value received for a savings note is considered interest. The interest is subject to all taxes imposed under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The notes are subject to estate, inheritance, gift, or other excise taxes, whether Federal or State, but are exempt from all other taxation now or hereafter imposed on the principal or interest thereof by any State, or any of the possessions of the United States, or by any local taxing authority.

      (1) Defer reporting of the increase to the year of final maturity, actual redemption, or other disposition, whichever is earlier; or

      (2) Elect to report the increase for the year in which it accrues, in which case the election applies to all savings notes then owned and those subsequently acquired, as well as to any other similar obligations purchased on a discount basis.

      § 342.7   Payment or redemption.

#### § § 342.7

      (a)  A savings note is redeemable any time one year or more after the issue date upon its presentation and surrender, with a duly executed request for payment, to any Federal Reserve Bank or Branch referred to in § 342.9, the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, or to any financial institution designated as a paying agent of savings bonds.

      (b)  Payment of a savings note to the purchaser at a sale under a levy, or to the officer authorized to levy upon the property of the owner under appropriate process to satisfy a money judgment, could not be made until one year after the issue date of the note.

        (b)  Payment will be made by the Automated Clearing House (ACH) method for the owner's account at a financial institution designated by the owner. To the extent applicable, provisions of § 357.26, Payments, and provisions of 31 CFR part 370, shall govern ACH payments made under this offering. The Department of the Treasury may employ alternate payment procedures in lieu of ACH in any case or class of cases where operational considerations require such action.

        (c)  Bonds will be redeemed automatically upon maturity. Payment will be made in accordance with the ACH payment instructions on file. Redemptions prior to maturity will be made upon receipt of a redemption request. Notice of redemption prior to maturity must be submitted in writing on company letterhead to the Division of Special Investments, or faxed to (304) 480-7786 or to (304) 480-6818. The notice must be received by the Division of Special Investments not less than three business days prior to the requested redemption date. It must contain the owner's name and Tax Identification Number, the requested redemption date, any changed payment routing instructions, the case number(s) to be redeemed, including original issue date(s), and the amount to be redeemed.

        (d)  To obtain redemption, a bond with the assignment for redemption properly completed and executed must be presented to the Division of Special Investments. Payment routing instructions must also be included with the bond at redemption. Upon partial redemption of a registered bond, the remaining balance will be reissued in book-entry form with the original issue and maturity date.

        § 343.4   Reissue.

#### § § 343.4

        (a)  Reissue of a tax and loss bond may be made only under the conditions specified in this paragraph. A request for reissue must be made by an officer of the beneficial owner who is authorized to assign the bond for redemption. The request must be submitted to the Division of Special Investments. A bond will only be reissued in book-entry form and will bear the same issue date and maturity as the original bond.

        (b)  The reissue of a bond may be made to correct an error in the original issue upon an appropriate request, supported by satisfactory proof of the error.

        (c)  An owner whose name is changed in any legal manner after the issue of the bond should submit the bond with a request for reissue, substituting the new name for the name inscribed on the bond. The signature on the request for reissue should show the new name, the legal reason which caused the change to be made and the former name. It must be supported by satisfactory proof of the change of name.

        (d)  A bond registered in the name of a company which has been succeeded by another company as the result of a merger, consolidation, incorporation, reincorporation, conversion, reorganization, or which has been lawfully succeeded in any manner whereby the business or activities of the original organization are continued without substantial change, will be paid to or reissued in the name of the successor upon an appropriate request on its behalf, supported by satisfactory evidence of successorship.

        (e)  Although not required, any owner of tax and loss bonds held in registered form after the effective date of this regulation, may submit those bonds to the Division of Special Investments, for conversion to book-entry form.

        § 343.5   Taxation.

#### § § 343.5

        Tax and loss bonds will be exempt from all taxation now or hereafter imposed on the principal by any state or any possession of the United States or of any local taxing authority.

        § 344.1   What special terms do I need to know to understand this part?

#### § § 344.1

        As appropriate, the definitions of terms used in this part are those found in the relevant portions of the Internal Revenue Code and the Income Tax Regulations.

        refers to

        means any day other than a Saturday or Sunday that the Federal Reserve Bank of New York is open for business.

        means the use of any provision(s) in the SLGS program to exploit movements in interest rates, including, but not limited to, those designed to provide marginal flexibility to issuers in structuring their SLGS investments.

        means the prevailing market rate, as determined by Treasury, for a Treasury security with the specified period to maturity. In the case where SLGS rates are needed for maturities currently not issued by Treasury, at our discretion, suitable proxies for Treasury securities and/or a rate setting methodology, as determined by the Secretary, may be used to derive a current Treasury borrowing rate. At any time that the Secretary establishes such proxies or a rate-setting method or determines that the methodology should be revised, we will make an announcement.

        means calendar day(s).

        means:

        (1) Any amounts that are gross proceeds of an issue of tax-advantaged bonds or are reasonably expected to become gross proceeds of such an issue of tax-advantaged bonds;

        (2) Any amounts that formerly were gross proceeds of a tax-advantaged bond issue, but no longer are treated as gross proceeds of such issue as a result of the operation of the universal cap on the maximum amount treated as gross proceeds under 26 CFR 1.148-6(b)(2);

        (3) Amounts held or to be held together with gross proceeds of one or more tax-advantaged bond issues in a refunding escrow, defeasance escrow, parity debt service reserve fund, or commingled fund (as defined in 26 CFR 1.148-1(b));

        (4) Proceeds of a bond issue that is not an issue of tax-advantaged bonds but that refunds, or is refunded by, an issue of tax-advantaged bonds; or

        (5) Any other amounts that are subject to yield limitations under the rules applicable to tax-advantaged bonds under the Internal Revenue Code (see title 26 of the U.S. Code and 26 CFR chapter I).

        under this part, means the issuer's expected use of the invested funds, including but not limited to, financing a construction project, repaying a prior issue of bonds, or funding a debt service reserve. Such use must be consistent with the purposes of the Income Tax Regulations in 26 CFR part 1 under section 148 of the Internal Revenue Code. Generating gain on the proceeds of a bond issue through the use of a cost-free option in purchasing and redeeming SLGS is not a permitted governmental purpose.

        refers to the government body or other entity that issues tax-advantaged bonds, or to a conduit borrower.

        with reference to the types of securities that issuers are permitted to purchase with an eligible source of funds, means any security other than a SLGS security. Examples of marketable securities include Treasury securities (other than SLGS securities) and Federal agency securities.

        means the current Treasury borrowing rate, less one basis point, as released daily by Treasury in a _SLGS rate_ table. If the current Treasury borrowing rate, together with the one basis point adjustment, results in a negative rate, such corresponding SLGS rate will be set at zero.

        means a compilation of SLGS rates available for a given day.

        means tax-advantaged bond as defined in 26 CFR 1.150-1(b).

        refers to the Secretary and the Secretary's delegates at the Department of the Treasury (Treasury), Bureau of the Fiscal Service (Fiscal Service). The term also extends to any fiscal or financial agent acting on behalf of the United States when designated to act by the Secretary or the Secretary's delegates.

        on an investment means “yield” as computed under 26 CFR 1.148-5.

        or  refers to a SLGS program user or a potential SLGS program user.

> [70 FR 37911, June 30, 2005, as amended at 77 FR 33635, June 7, 2012; 89 FR 15447, Mar. 4, 2024]

        § 344.2   What general provisions apply to SLGS securities?

#### § § 344.2

        (a)  SLGS securities are subject to:

        (1) The electronic transactions and funds transfers provisions for United States securities, part 370 of this subchapter, “Electronic Transactions and Funds Transfers Related to U.S. Securities'; and

        (2) The appendix to subpart E to part 306 of this subchapter, for rules regarding computation of interest.

        (b)  SLGS securities are issued in book-entry form on the books of Fiscal Service.

        (c)  The Secretary may designate selected Federal Reserve Banks and Branches, as fiscal agents of the United States, to perform services relating to SLGS securities.

        (d)  No. SLGS securities issued as any one type,  Time Deposit or Demand Deposit, cannot be transferred for other securities of that type or any other type. Transfer of securities by sale, exchange, assignment, pledge, or otherwise is not permitted.

        (e) —(1)  When a commercial bank or other agent submits a subscription, or performs any other transaction, on behalf of the issuer, it must certify that it is acting under the issuer's specific authorization. Ordinarily, evidence of such authority is not required.

        (2) —

        (i)  Upon submitting a subscription, or performing any other transaction for a SLGS security, a subscriber must certify that:

        (A)  If the issuer is purchasing a SLGS security with any amount received from the sale or redemption (at the option of the holder) before maturity of any marketable security, the yield on such SLGS security does not exceed the yield at which such marketable security was sold or redeemed; and

        (B)  If the issuer is purchasing a SLGS security with any amount received from the redemption before maturity of a Time Deposit security (other than a zero interest Time Deposit security), the yield on the SLGS security being purchased does not exceed the yield that was used to determine the amount of redemption proceeds for such redeemed Time Deposit security.

        (ii)  Upon submission of a request for redemption before maturity of a Time Deposit security (other than a zero interest Time Deposit security) subscribed for on or after August 15, 2005, the subscriber must certify that no amount received from the redemption will be invested at a yield that exceeds the yield that is used to determine the amount of redemption proceeds for such redeemed Time Deposit security.

        (3)  For each subscription to purchase a Time Deposit SLGS security, the subscriber must certify that the term of the SLGS security subscribed for is no longer than is reasonably necessary to accomplish the issuer's governmental purpose for its purchase of the SLGS security.

        (4)  For each subscription to purchase a SLGS security, the subscriber must certify that if, at any point while SLGS securities are outstanding, the issuer becomes ineligible to purchase SLGS securities or the funds used to purchase SLGS securities are no longer an eligible source of funds, the issuer or agent thereof must, as soon as practicable, notify Treasury of such ineligibility. Such notification will be deemed to be a request for redemption of those outstanding Demand Deposit securities that are affected by the ineligibility.

        (f) —(1)  (i) To use the SLGS program to create a cost-free option (while the examples in paragraph (f)(2) of this section may specifically use marketable securities for illustration, creating a cost-free option via any means is prohibited);

        (ii) To purchase a SLGS security with any amount received from the sale or redemption (at the option of the holder) before maturity of any marketable security, if the yield on such SLGS security exceeds the yield at which such marketable security is sold or redeemed;

        (iii) To invest any amount received from the redemption before maturity of a Time Deposit security (other than a Zero Percent Time Deposit security) at a yield that exceeds the yield that is used to determine the amount of redemption proceeds for such Time Deposit security; or

        (iv) To purchase a SLGS security with a maturity that is longer than is reasonably necessary to accomplish the issuer's governmental purpose for its purchase of the SLGS security or to purchase a SLGS security with an intention to redeem such SLGS security earlier than is reasonably necessary to accomplish the issuer's governmental purpose for its purchase of the SLGS security.

        (2) —(i)  In order to fund an escrow for an advance refunding, the issuer simultaneously enters into a purchase contract for marketable securities and subscribes for SLGS securities, such that either purchase is sufficient to pay the cash flows on the outstanding bonds to be refunded, but together, the purchases are greatly in excess of the amount necessary to pay the cash flows. The issuer plans that, if interest rates decline during the period between the date of starting a SLGS subscription and the requested date of issuance of SLGS securities, the issuer will enter into an offsetting agreement to sell the marketable securities and use the bond proceeds to purchase SLGS securities to fund the escrow. If, however, interest rates do not decline in that period, the issuer plans to use the bond proceeds to purchase the marketable securities to fund the escrow and cancel the SLGS securities subscription. This practice violates the prohibition on cancellation under § 344.5(c) or § 344.8(c), and no exception or waiver would be granted under this part because the ability to cancel in these circumstances would result in the SLGS program being used to create a cost-free option. In addition, this practice is prohibited under paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section.

        (ii)  The existing escrow for an advance refunding contains marketable securities which produce a negative arbitrage. In order to reduce or eliminate this negative arbitrage, the issuer subscribes for SLGS securities at a yield higher than the yield on the existing escrow, but less than the permitted yield. At the same time, the issuer agrees to sell the marketable securities in the existing escrow to a third party and use the proceeds to purchase SLGS securities if interest rates decline between the date of subscribing for SLGS securities and the requested date of issuance of SLGS securities. The marketable securities would be sold at a yield which is less than the yield on the SLGS securities purchased. The issuer and the third party further agree that if interest rates increase during this period, the issuer will cancel the SLGS securities subscription. This practice violates the prohibition on cancellation under § 344.5(c) or § 344.8(c), and no exception or waiver would be granted under this part because the ability to cancel in these circumstances would result in the SLGS program being used to create a cost-free option. In addition, this practice is prohibited under paragraphs (f)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section.

        (iii)  The facts are the same as in paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section, except that in this case, the agreement entered into by the issuer with a third party to sell the marketable securities in order to obtain funds to purchase SLGS securities is not conditioned upon changes in interest rates on Treasury securities. This practice violates the yield gain prohibition in paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of this section and is prohibited.

        (iv)  The issuer holds a portfolio of marketable securities in an account that produces negative arbitrage. To reduce or eliminate this negative arbitrage, the issuer subscribes for SLGS securities for purchase in 45 days. At the same time, the issuer sells an option to purchase the portfolio of marketable securities. If interest rates increase, the holder of the option will not exercise its option and the issuer will cancel the SLGS securities subscription. On the other hand, if interest rates decline, the option holder will exercise the option and the issuer will use the proceeds to purchase SLGS securities. This practice violates the prohibition on cancellation under § 344.5(c) or § 344.8(c), and no exception or waiver would be granted under this part because the ability to cancel in these circumstances would result in the SLGS program being used to create a cost-free option. In addition, this practice is prohibited under paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section.

        (v)  On February 6, 2006, an issuer purchases a Time Deposit security using an eligible source of funds from a debt service reserve fund. The Time Deposit security has a principal amount of $7 million, an interest rate of 3.63 percent, and a maturity date of February 6, 2009. On March 1, 2007, the issuer submits a request to redeem the Time Deposit security on March 15, 2007. The yield used to determine the amount of redemption proceeds is 3.21 percent. On March 5, 2007, the issuer subscribes for the purchase, on March 15, 2007, of a second Time Deposit security. The issuer pays for the second Time Deposit security on March 15, 2007, with the redemption proceeds of the first Time Deposit security. The second Time Deposit security has an interest rate of 2.77 percent and a maturity date of April 16, 2007. On April 9, 2007, the issuer enters into a contract to purchase, on April 16, 2007, a ten-year, marketable Treasury security using the principal and interest to be received at the maturity of the second Time Deposit security. The marketable Treasury security has a yield of 4.02 percent. This transaction satisfies the yield limitation in paragraph (f)(1)(iii) of this section because:

        (A) The yield on the second Time Deposit security does not exceed the yield that is used to determine the amount of redemption proceeds for the first Time Deposit security; and

        (B) The second Time Deposit security is not redeemed before maturity and therefore the re-investment of the principal and interest received on the second Time Deposit security is not subject to the yield limitation in paragraph (f)(1)(iii) of this section. This transaction constitutes a permissible use of the SLGS program.

        (vi)  The facts are the same as in paragraph (f)(2)(v) of this section, except that the issuer subscribes for the second Time Deposit security on March 1, 2007, and enters into the contract to purchase the marketable Treasury security on March 1, 2007. This transaction, if permitted, would enable the issuer to redeem the first Time Deposit security at a yield that is held constant for 12 hours based on the “current Treasury borrowing rate” for March 1, 2007, and to re-invest the redemption proceeds based on a market yield that may fluctuate during that 12-hour period. The use of the SLGS program in this manner would create a cost-free option. Accordingly, this transaction is impermissible under paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section.

        (vii)  An issuer may purchase SLGS securities to facilitate compliance with arbitrage yield restrictions for investments of various types of proceeds of tax-advantaged bonds, including investments in refunding escrow funds, bond debt service reserve funds, or project construction funds, respectively. The determination of whether a maturity for a SLGS security is longer than is reasonably necessary depends on the issuer's governmental purpose for the issuance. Thus, the maturities of SLGS securities invested in a refunding escrow fund are reasonably necessary if they are no longer than those necessary to accomplish the defeasance of the underlying refunded bonds until the applicable redemption date or retirement date of the refunded bonds. Maturities of SLGS securities invested in a project construction fund are reasonably necessary if they are no longer than the reasonably expected construction period for the financed project, and early redemptions of such securities are reasonably necessary if they are reasonably related to construction draws for the financed project. Maturities of SLGS securities invested in a debt service reserve fund are reasonably necessary if they are no longer than the earlier of the permitted term of investments in that reserve fund under the bond documents or the term of the secured bonds. Early redemptions of SLGS securities with reasonably necessary maturities are permissible for the above bona fide business reasons, including changes in market interest rates. By contrast, the purchase of SLGS securities with maturities that are longer than the reasonably necessary maturities described above and associated early redemptions of those SLGS securities to obtain the funds within periods that would correspond to an issuer's bona fide governmental purpose for a SLGS investment constitute impermissible practices under paragraph (f)(1)(iv) of this section. Thus, for example, if an issuer purchases SLGS securities to fund a refunding escrow to be used to defease and call refunded bonds at the first call date in five years, the issuer's purchase of SLGS securities with maturities beyond that five-year period and corresponding early redemptions of those SLGS securities within that five-year period constitute an impermissible use of the SLGS program.

        (g)  You must submit full payment for each subscription to Fiscal Service no later than 4 p.m., Eastern time, on the issue date. Submit payments by the Fedwire funds transfer system with credit directed to the Treasury's General Account. Fiscal Service's American Bankers Association (ABA) Routing Number can be found on Fiscal Service's website under the SLGS frequently asked questions (FAQs).

        (h)  An untimely change to a subscription can only be made in accordance with § 344.2(n) of this part. The penalty imposed for failure to make settlement on a subscription that you submit will be to render you ineligible to subscribe for SLGS securities for six months beginning on the date the subscription is withdrawn, or the proposed issue date, whichever occurs first.

        (1)  If you are the issuer, the penalty is imposed on you unless you provide the Taxpayer Identification Number of the conduit borrower that is the actual party failing to make settlement of a subscription. If you provide the Taxpayer Identification Number for the conduit borrower, the six-month penalty will be imposed on the conduit borrower.

        (2)  If you settle after the proposed issue date and we determine that settlement is acceptable on an exception basis, we will waive, under § 344.2(n), the six-month penalty under paragraph (h) of this section. You shall be charged a late payment assessment. The late payment assessment equals the amount of interest that would have accrued on the SLGS securities from the proposed issue date to the date of settlement plus an administrative fee of $100 per subscription, or such other amount as we may publish in the  We will not issue SLGS securities until we receive the late payment assessment, which is due on demand.

        (i)  Upon the maturity of a security, we will pay the owner the principal amount and interest due. A security scheduled for maturity on a non-business day will be redeemed on the next business day.

        (j)  We will make payment by the Automated Clearing House (ACH) method for the owner's account at a financial institution as designated by the owner. We may use substitute payment procedures, instead of ACH, if we consider it to be necessary. Any such action is final.

        (k)  Fiscal Service's contact information is posted on Fiscal Service's Web site.

        (l)  We reserve the right to change or suspend the terms and conditions of the offering (including provisions relating to subscriptions for, and issuance of, SLGS securities; interest payments; early redemptions; and rollovers) at any time the Secretary determines that the issuance of obligations sufficient to conduct the orderly financing operations of the United States cannot be made without exceeding the statutory debt limit, or that a disaster situation exists. We will announce such changes by any means that the Secretary deems appropriate.

        (m)  We may decide, in our sole discretion, to take any of the following actions. Such actions are final. Specifically, Treasury reserves the right:

        (1) To reject any SLGSafe Application for Internet Access;

        (2) To reject any electronic message or other message or request, including requests for subscription and redemption, that is inappropriately completed or untimely submitted;

        (3) To refuse to issue any SLGS securities in any case or class of cases;

        (4) To revoke the issuance of any SLGS securities and to declare the subscriber or the issuer ineligible thereafter to subscribe for securities under the offering if the Secretary deems that such action is in the public interest and any security is issued on the basis of an improper certification or other misrepresentation (other than as the result of an inadvertent error) or there is an impermissible transaction under § 344.2(f); or

        (5) To review any transaction for compliance with this part, including requiring a subscriber or the issuer to provide additional information, and to determine an appropriate remedy under the circumstances.

        (n)  We reserve the right, at our discretion, to waive or modify any provision of these regulations in any case or class of cases. We may do so if such action is not inconsistent with law and will not subject the United States to substantial expense or liability.

        (o)  No. Treasury cannot call a SLGS security for redemption before maturity.

      Subpart B—Time Deposit Securities

**Source:** Source: 70 FR 37911, June 30, 2005, unless otherwise noted.

        § 344.4   What are Time Deposit securities?

#### § § 344.4

        Time Deposit securities are issued as certificates of indebtedness, notes, or bonds.

        (a)  The issuer must fix the maturity periods for Time Deposit securities, which are issued as follows:

        (1)  For certificates of indebtedness that do not bear interest, the issuer can fix a maturity period of not less than fifteen days and not more than one year.

        (2)  For certificates of indebtedness that bear interest, the issuer can fix a maturity period of not less than thirty days and not more than one year.

        (3)  For notes, the issuer can fix a maturity period of not less than one year and one day, and not more than ten years.

        (4)  For bonds, the issuer can fix a maturity period of not less than ten years and one day, and not more than forty years.

        (b)  For each security, the issuer shall designate an interest rate that does not exceed the maximum interest rate shown in the daily SLGS rate table as defined in § 344.1.

        (1)  We release the SLGS rate table to the public by 10 a.m. Eastern time each business day or as soon as practicable thereafter. If the SLGS rate table is not available by 11 a.m. Eastern time on any given business day, the SLGS rate table for the preceding business day applies.

        (2)  The applicable daily SLGS rate table for a SLGSafe subscription is the one in effect on the business day that you start the subscription process. This table is shown on Fiscal Service's Application server.

        (3)  The SLGS rate table can be obtained at Fiscal Service's Web site.

        (c)  Interest on a certificate of indebtedness is computed on an annual basis and is paid at maturity with the principal. Interest on a note or bond is paid semi-annually. The issuer specifies the first interest payment date, which must be at least thirty days and less than or equal to one year from the date of issue. The final interest payment date must coincide with the maturity date of the security. Interest for other than a full interest period is computed on the basis of a 365-day or 366-day year (for certificates of indebtedness) and on the basis of the exact number of days in the half-year (for notes and bonds). See the appendix to subpart E to part 306 of this subchapter for rules regarding computation of interest.

#### § § 344.5

        (a)  The subscriber must set the issue date for the securities in the subscription. The issue date must be a business day. The issue date cannot be more than 60 days after the date we receive the subscription. If the subscription is for $10 million or less, we must receive a subscription at least 5 days before the issue date. If the subscription is for over $10 million, we must receive the subscription at least 7 days before the issue date.

        If SLGS securities totaling $10 million or less will be issued on May 16th, we must receive the subscription no later than May 11th. If SLGS securities totaling more than $10 million will be issued on May 16th, we must receive the subscription no later than May 9th. In all cases, if SLGS securities will be issued on May 16th, we will not accept the subscription before March 17th.

        (c)  You cannot cancel a subscription unless you establish, to the satisfaction of Treasury, that the cancellation is required for reasons unrelated to the use of the SLGS program to create a cost-free option.

        (d)  You can change a subscription on or before 3 p.m. Eastern time, on the issue date. Changes to a subscription are acceptable with the following exceptions:

        (1) You cannot change the issue date; provided, however, you may change the issue date up to 7 days after the original issue date if you establish to the satisfaction of Treasury that such change is required as a result of circumstances that were unforeseen at the time of the subscription and are beyond the issuer's control (for example, a natural disaster);

        (2) You cannot change the principal amount originally specified for any security in the subscription by more than ten percent;

        (3) You cannot change an interest rate to exceed the maximum interest rate in the SLGS rate table that was in effect for a security of comparable maturity on the business day that you began the subscription process; and

        (4) You cannot change the maturity date originally specified for any security in the subscription by more than 30 days for certificates of indebtedness, 6 months for notes, and 1 year for bonds.

        (7) Not deviate from the original subscribed for maturity date specified for any security in the subscription by more than 30 days for certificates of indebtedness, 6 months for notes, and 1 year for bonds;

        (8) Include the information required under paragraph (b) of this section, if not already provided; and

        § 344.6   How do I redeem a Time Deposit security before maturity?

#### § § 344.6

        (a)  (1) Zero percent certificates of indebtedness of 16 to 29 days. A zero percent certificate of indebtedness of 16 to 29 days can be redeemed, at the owner's option, no earlier than 15 days after the issue date.

        (2)  A certificate of indebtedness of 30 days or more can be redeemed, at the owner's option, no earlier than 25 days after the issue date.

        (3)  A note or bond can be redeemed, at the owner's option, no earlier than 30 days after the issue date. Any request for redemption received within 14 days of the issue date will be rejected.

        (b)  You may request partial redemptions in any whole dollar amount; however, a security balance of less than $1,000 must be redeemed in total.

        (c)  Yes. An official authorized to redeem the securities before maturity must submit an electronic request in SLGSafe. The request must show the Taxpayer Identification Number of the issuer, the security number, and the dollar amount of the securities to be redeemed. Upon submission of a request for redemption before maturity of a security subscribed for on or after August 15, 2005, the request must include a yield certification under § 344.2(e)(2)(ii). Fiscal Service must receive the request no less than 14 days and no more than 60 days before the requested redemption date. You cannot submit a request for early redemption for a security which has not yet been issued and you cannot cancel a request once it has been submitted.

        (d)  For securities subscribed for on or after October 28, 1996, the amount of the redemption proceeds is calculated as follows:

        (1)  If a security is redeemed before maturity on a date other than a scheduled interest payment date, Treasury pays interest for the fractional interest period since the last interest payment date.

        (2)  The remaining interest and principal payments are discounted by the current Treasury borrowing rate for the remaining term to maturity of the security redeemed. This may result in a premium or discount to the issuer depending on whether the current Treasury borrowing rate is unchanged, lower, or higher than the stated interest rate of the early-redeemed SLGS securities. There is no market charge for the redemption of zero interest Time Deposit securities subscribed for on or after October 28, 1996. Redemption proceeds in the case of a zero-interest security are a return of the principal invested. The formulas for calculating the redemption value under this paragraph, including examples of the determination of premiums and discounts, are set forth in appendix B of this part.

        (e)  For securities subscribed for from September 1, 1989, through October 27, 1996, the amount of the redemption proceeds is calculated as follows:

        (1)  If a security is redeemed before maturity on a date other than a scheduled interest payment date, Treasury pays interest for the fractional interest period since the last interest payment date.

        (2)  An amount shall be deducted from the redemption proceeds if the current Treasury borrowing rate for the remaining period to original maturity exceeds the rate of interest originally fixed for such security. The amount shall be the present value of the future increased borrowing cost to the Treasury. The annual increased borrowing cost for each interest period is determined by multiplying the principal by the difference between the two rates. For notes and bonds, the increased borrowing cost for each remaining interest period to original maturity is determined by dividing the annual cost by two. Present value is determined by using the current Treasury borrowing rate as the discount factor. When you request a redemption date that is less than thirty days before the original maturity date, we will apply the rate of a one month security as listed on the SLGS rate table issued on the day you make a redemption request. The market charge under this paragraph can be computed by using the formulas in appendix A of this part.

        (f)  For securities subscribed for from December 28, 1976, through August 31, 1989, the amount of the redemption proceeds is calculated as follows:

        (1)  Interest for the entire period the security was outstanding shall be recalculated if the original interest rate of the security is higher than the interest rate that would have been set at the time of the initial subscription had the term of the security been for the shorter period. If this results in an overpayment of interest, we will deduct from the redemption proceeds the aggregate amount of such overpayments, plus interest, compounded semi-annually thereon, from the date of each overpayment to the date of redemption. The rate used in calculating the interest on the overpayment will be one-eighth of one percent above the maximum rate that would have applied to the initial subscription had the term of the security been for the shorter period. If a bond is redeemed before maturity on a date other than a scheduled interest payment date, no interest is paid for the fractional interest period since the last interest payment date.

        (2)  An amount shall be deducted from the redemption proceeds in all cases where the current Treasury borrowing rate for the remaining period to original maturity of the security prematurely redeemed exceeds the rate of interest originally fixed for such security. You can compute the market charge under this paragraph by using the formulas in appendix A of this part.

      Subpart C—Demand Deposit Securities

**Source:** Source: 70 FR 37911, June 30, 2005, unless otherwise noted.

        § 344.7   What are Demand Deposit securities?

#### § § 344.7

        Demand Deposit securities are one-day certificates of indebtedness that are automatically rolled over each day until you request redemption.

        (a)  Each security shall bear a rate of interest based on an adjustment of the average yield for 13-week Treasury bills at the most recent auction. A new annualized effective Demand Deposit rate and daily factor for the Demand Deposit rate are effective on the first business day following the regular auction of 13-week Treasury bills and are shown in the SLGS rate table. Interest is accrued and added to the principal daily. Interest is computed on the balance of the principal, plus interest accrued through the preceding day.

        (1)  (i) First, you calculate the annualized effective Demand Deposit rate in decimals, designated “I” in Equation 1, as follows:

        (ii) Then, you calculate the daily factor for the Demand Deposit rate as follows:

        (2)  Information on the estimated average marginal tax rate and Treasury administrative costs for administering Demand Deposit securities, both to be determined by Treasury from time to time, will be published in the

        (b)  At any time the Secretary determines that issuance of obligations sufficient to conduct the orderly financing operations of the United States cannot be made without exceeding the statutory debt limit, we may invest any unredeemed Demand Deposit securities in special 90-day certificates of indebtedness.

        (1) Funds left invested in Demand Deposit securities remain subject to the normal terms and conditions for such securities as set forth in this part.

        (2) Funds invested in 90-day certificates of indebtedness earn simple interest equal to the daily factor in effect at the time Demand Deposit security issuance is suspended, multiplied by the number of days outstanding. Ninety-day certificates of indebtedness are subject to the same request for redemption notification requirements as those for Demand Deposit securities and will be redeemed at par value plus accrued interest. If a 90-day certificate of indebtedness reaches maturity during a debt limit contingency, we will automatically roll it into a new 90-day certificate of indebtedness, along with accrued interest, that earns simple interest equal to the daily factor in effect at the time that the new 90-day certificate of indebtedness is issued, multiplied by the number of days outstanding. When regular Treasury borrowing operations resume, the 90-day certificates of indebtedness, along with accrued interest, will be reinvested in Demand Deposit securities.

        § 344.8   What other provisions apply to subscriptions for Demand Deposit securities?

#### § § 344.8

        (a)  The subscriber must set the issue date in the subscription. You cannot change the issue date to require issuance earlier or later than the issue date originally specified; provided, however, you may change the issue date up to 7 days after the original issue date if you establish to the satisfaction of Treasury that such change is required as a result of circumstances that were unforeseen at the time of the subscription and are beyond the issuer's control (for example, a natural disaster). The issue date must be a business day. The issue date cannot be more than 60 days after the date we receive the subscription. If the subscription is for $10 million or less, we must receive the subscription at least 5 days before the issue date. If the subscription is for more than $10 million, we must receive the subscription at least 7 days before the issue date.

        (b)  A subscriber starts the subscription process by entering into SLGSafe the following information:

        (1) The issue date;

        (2) The total principal amount;

        (3) The issuer's name and Taxpayer Identification Number;

        (4) A description of the tax-advantaged bond issue; and

        (5) The certifications required by § 344.2(e)(1), if the subscription is submitted by an agent of the issuer.

        (c)  You cannot cancel a subscription unless you establish, to the satisfaction of Treasury, that the cancellation is required for reasons unrelated to the use of the SLGS program to create a cost-free option.

        (d)  You can change a subscription on or before 3 p.m., Eastern time, on the issue date. You may change the aggregate principal amount specified in the subscription by no more than ten percent, above or below the amount originally specified in the subscription.

        (e)  The completed subscription must:

        (1) Be dated and submitted electronically by an official authorized to make the purchase;

        (2) Describe the bond issue.

        § 344.9   How do I redeem a Demand Deposit security?

#### § § 344.9

        (a)  Demand Deposit securities can be redeemed at the owner's option, if we receive a request for redemption not less than:

        (1) One business day before the requested redemption date for total redemptions by an owner of $10 million or less;

        (2) Three business days before the requested redemption date for total redemptions by an owner of more than $10 million but less than $500 million; and

        (3) Five business days before the requested redemption date for total redemptions by an owner of $500 million or more.

        (b)  You may request partial redemptions in any amount. If your account balance is less than $1,000, it must be redeemed in total.

        (c)  Yes. An official authorized to redeem the securities must submit an electronic request through SLGSafe. The request must show the Taxpayer Identification Number of the issuer, the security number, and the dollar amount of the securities to be redeemed.

      § 346.6   Nontransferability.

#### § § 346.6

      United States Individual Retirement Bonds are not transferable, and may not be sold, discounted or pledged as collateral for a loan or as security for the performance of an obligation, or for any other purpose.

      § 346.7   Judicial proceedings.

#### § § 346.7

      No judicial determination will be recognized which would give effect to an attempted voluntary transfer inter vivos of an Individual Retirement Bond. Otherwise, a claim against a registered owner will be recognized when established by valid judicial proceedings, but in no case will payment be made to the purchaser at a sale under a levy or to the officer authorized to levy upon the property of the owner under appropriate process to satisfy a money judgment unless or until the bond has become eligible for authorized redemption pursuant to these regulations. Neither the Department of the Treasury nor any of its agencies will accept notices of adverse claims or of pending judicial proceedings or undertake to protect the interests of litigants who do not have possession of the bond.

      § 346.8   Payment or redemption during lifetime of owner.

#### § § 346.8

      (a)  An Individual Retirement Bond is redeemable at any time during the first twelve (12) months of its issue date. No interest will be paid on any bond so redeemed.

      (b) —(1)  Unless redeemed within twelve months of its issue, or except as provided under paragraphs (b)(2) and (c)(2) of this section, if an Individual Retirement Bond is cashed by its owner before he attains age 59 , he must include on his Federal income tax return for the year of redemption the value of the bond. In addition, there is an additional income tax equal to 10 percent of the value of the bond imposed by section 409(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954.

      (2)  An Individual Retirement Bond will be paid at its then current redemption value upon a registered owner's request (or by a person recognized as entitled to act on his behalf) prior to his attainment of age 59  years upon submission of a physician's statement or any similar evidence showing that the owner has become disabled to such an extent that he is unable to engage in any substantial, gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or to be of long-continued and indefinite duration. The following are examples of impairments which would ordinarily be considered as preventing substantial, gainful activity:

      (i) Loss of use of two limbs.

      (ii) Certain progressive diseases which have resulted in the physical loss or atrophy of a limb, such as diabetes, multiple sclerosis, or Buerger's disease.

      (iii) Disease of the heart, lungs, or blood vessels which have resulted in major loss of heart or lung reserve as evidenced by X-ray, electrocardiogram, or other objective findings, so that despite medical treatment breathlessness, pain, or fatigue is produced on slight exertion, such as walking several blocks, using public transportation, or doing small chores.

      (iv) Cancer which is inoperable and progressive.

      (v) Damage to the brain or brain abnormality which has resulted in severe loss of judgment, intellect, orientation, or memory.

      (vi) Mental diseases (e.g., psychosis or severe psychoneurosis) requiring continued institutionalization or constant supervision of the individual.

      (vii) Loss or diminution of vision to the extent that the effected individual has a central visual acuity of not better than 20/200 in the better eye after best correction, or has a limitation in the fields of vision such that the widest diameter of the visual fields subtends an angle no greater than 20 degrees.

      (viii) Permanent and total loss of speech.

      (ix) Total deafness uncorrectible by a hearing aid.

      (c) —(1)  An Individual Retirement Bond will be redeemable at its current redemption value upon the request of the registered owner (or a person recognized as entitled to act on his behalf), provided he is 59  years of age or older. The owner's age will be determined from the date of birth shown on the face of the bond, provided, however, that the Secretary of the Treasury reserves the right in any case or class of cases to require proof, in the form of a duly certified copy of his birth certificate, that the owner has attained the age of 59  years. If such evidence is unavailable, one of the following documents may be furnished in lieu thereof:

      (i) Church records of birth or baptism

      (ii) Hospital birth record or certificate

      (iii) Physician's or midwife's birth record

      (iv) Certification of Bible or other family records

      (v) Military, naturalization or immigration records

      (vi) Other evidence of probative value.

      (2)  Under section 409(b)(3)(c) of the Internal Revenue Code, if an Individual Retirement Plan Bond is cashed at any time before the end of the taxable year in which the owner attains age 70 , and the entire redemption proceeds are transferred to an individual retirement account, an individual annuity, an employees' trust, or annuity plan, as described in sections 408(a), 408(b), 401(a) and 403(a), respectively, of the Internal Revenue Code, on or before the 60th day after receipt of such proceeds, they shall be excluded from gross income and the transfer shall be treated as a rollover contribution described in section 408(d)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code.

      (d) —(1)  When redemption of any Individual Retirement Bond is desired by the registered owner, it should be presented, with the request for payment on the back of the bond signed and duly certified, to a Federal Reserve Bank or Branch or to the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, Securities Transactions Branch, Washington, DC 20226. If payment is requested on account of disability, the letter described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section should accompany the bond.

      (2)  When redemption of any Individual Retirement Bond is desired by the legal guardian, committee, conservator, or similar representative of the owner's estate, it should be presented, with the request signed as described below, to a Federal Reserve Bank or Branch or to the Department of the Treasury. If payment is requested on account of disability, the letter described in paragraph (b) (2) of this section should accompany the bond.   The request for payment, in either case, should be signed by the representative in his fiduciary capacity before an authorized certifying officer, and must be supported by a certificate or a certified copy of the letters of appointment from the court making the appointment, under seal, or other proof of qualification if the appointment was not made by a court. Except in the case of corporate fiduciaries, such evidence should state that the appointment is in full force and should be dated not more than one year prior to the presentation of the bond for payment.

      (e)  An Individual Retirement Bond in a denomination greater than $50 (face value), which is otherwise eligible for redemption, may be redeemed in part, at current redemption value, upon the request of the registered owner (or a person recognized as entitled to act on his behalf), but only in amounts corresponding to authorized denominations. In any case in which partial redemption is desired, before the request for payment is signed, the phrase “to the extent of $__ (face value) and reissue of the remainder” should be appended to the request. Upon partial redemption of the bond, the remainder will be reissued as of the original issue date. No partial redemption of a bond will be made after the death of the owner in whose name it is registered.

      § 346.9   Payment or redemption after death of owner.

#### § § 346.9

      (a)  If the registered owner of an Individual Retirement Bond dies before it has been presented and surrendered for payment, and there is no beneficiary shown thereon, or if the designated beneficiary predeceased the owner, the bond shall be paid in the following order of precedence:

      (1) To the duly appointed executor or administrator of the estate of the owner, who should sign the request for payment on the back of the bond in his representative capacity before an authorized certifying officer, such request to be supported by a court certificate or a certified copy of his letters of appointment, under seal of the court, which should show that the appointment is in full force and effect, and be dated within six months of its presentation;

      (2) If no legal representative of the deceased registered owner's estate has been or will be appointed, to the widow or widower of the owner;

      (3) If none of the above, to the child or children of the owner and the descendants of deceased children by representation;

      (4) If none of the above, to the parents of the owner, or the survivor of them;

      (5) If none of the above, to other next-of-kin of the owner, as determined by the laws of the domicile of such owner at the time of his death.

      (b)  If the registered owner of an Individual Retirement Bond dies before it has been presented and surrendered for payment, and the beneficiary shown thereon survived the owner, the bond shall be paid in the following order of precedence:

      (1) To the designated beneficiary upon his presentation and surrender of the bond with the request for payment signed and duly certified;

      (2) If the designated beneficiary survived the registered owner but failed to present the bond for payment during his own lifetime, payment will be made in the order of precedence specified in paragraphs (a) (1) through (5) of this section to the legal representative, surviving spouse, children, parents, or next-of-kin of such beneficiary, and in the manner provided therein.

      (c)  The orders of precedence set forth in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, except in cases where redemption is made for the account of a registered owner, are for the Department's convenience in discharging its obligation on an Individual Retirement Bond. The discharge of the obligation in accordance therewith shall be final so far as the Department is concerned, but those provisions do not otherwise purport to determine ownership of the redemption proceeds of a bond.

      (a)  An Individual Retirement Bond will be reissued to add a beneficiary in the case of a single ownership bond, or to eliminate or substitute a beneficiary in the case of a bond registered in beneficiary form upon the owner's request on Form PD 3564. No consent will be required to support any reissue transaction from a beneficiary whose name is to be removed from the registration of an Individual Retirement Bond. If the registered owner dies after the bond has been presented and surrendered for reissue, upon receipt of notice thereof by the agency to which the request for reissue was submitted, such request shall be treated as ineffective, provided the notice of death is received by the Federal Reserve Bank or the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, Division of Transactions and Rulings, Parkersburg, WV 26101, to which the request was sent, in sufficient time to withhold delivery, by mail or otherwise, of the reissued bond.

      (b)  Reissue of an Individual Retirement Bond will be made where an error in issue has occurred, as well as in cases where the owner's name has been changed by marriage, divorce, annulment, order of court, or in any other legal manner upon an appropriate request.

      § 346.12   Lost, stolen, or destroyed bonds.

#### § § 346.12

      If an Individual Retirement Bond is lost, stolen, or destroyed, relief will be granted upon identification of the bond and proof of its loss, theft, or destruction. A description of the bond by denomination, serial number, issue date and registration should be furnished at the time the report of loss, theft, or destruction is made. Such reports should be sent to the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, Division of Transactions and Rulings, Parkersburg, WV 26101.

      (c)  In any case or any class of cases arising under this circular, the Secretary of the Treasury may require such additional evidence as may in his judgment be necessary, and may require a bond of indemnity, with or without surety, where he may consider such bond necessary for the protection of the United States.

        Fiscal Service is authorized to establish minimum amounts for initial and additional contributions to a retirement savings bond under this subpart.

        § 347.34   Payment (redemption).

#### § § 347.34

        The issuance and redemption of a retirement savings bond is conditioned on an Auto-IRA custodian certifying compliance with these regulations and with any additional program instructions identified by Fiscal Service that pertain to that bond.

        (a)  Payment of retirement savings bonds will be made to an Auto-IRA custodian upon the custodian's submission of a request for redemption to Fiscal Service. The custodian shall request the redemption of all retirement savings bonds at their respective maturity. The custodian shall request the full or partial redemption of a bond held on behalf of a participant upon the request of the participant or other authorized person entitled to amounts in the IRA. Retirement savings bond redemptions will be rounded to the nearest one cent.

        (b)  Final interest on any called bonds will be paid with the principal (amount contributed minus withdrawals taken) at redemption and rounded to the nearest one cent.

        § 347.35   Computation of interest.

#### § § 347.35

        Retirement savings bonds under this subpart earn interest at the same annual percentage rate as securities issued to the Government Securities Investment Fund (G Fund) in the Thrift Savings Plan for federal employees. The Secretary calculates the G Fund interest rate pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 8438(e)(2). The retirement savings bond interest rate compounds daily at 1/360 of the annual percentage rate. Retirement savings bonds will cease to accrue interest on the date of their maturity or call.

#### § § 347.36

        The maturity date for retirement savings bonds is indeterminate and may be different for each bond issued, but shall not exceed the sum of an original maturity period of 20 years and an extended maturity period of 10 years. A retirement savings bond purchased by the Auto-IRA custodian on behalf of a participant will mature at the earlier of 30 years from the date the bond is first issued to the custodian on behalf of the participant or when its value reaches $15,000.

        § 347.37   Reservation of rights.

        (b) To refuse to issue retirement savings bonds to an Auto-IRA custodian in any particular case or class of cases;

        (c) To suspend or cease offering retirement savings bonds to an Auto-IRA custodian;

        (d) To call for redemption of any outstanding retirement savings bond; or

        (e) To determine any appropriate remedy under this subpart.

        General Provisions

          § 351.5   What is the maturity period of a Series EE savings bond?

#### § § 351.5

          Series EE savings bonds have a total maturity period of 30 years from the issue date, consisting of an original maturity period and one or two periods of extended maturity, which vary depending on the issue date of the bond.

          § 351.10   What do I need to know about market yields, or market bid yields, to understand redemption value calculations in this subpart?

#### § § 351.10

          We use market yields, or market bid yields, derived from Treasury bills, notes, and bonds, to create a yield curve based on the most actively traded Treasury securities. This curve relates the yield on a security to its time to maturity. Yields at particular points on the curve are referred to as “constant maturity yields” and are determined by the Treasury from this daily yield curve. Six-month and 5-year Treasury securities rates are derived from these yield curves.

          § 351.11   What do I need to know about the short-term savings bond rate, to understand redemption value calculations in this subpart?

#### § § 351.11

          We determine this rate by compiling 6-month Treasury securities rates as of the close of business for each day of the previous three months and calculating the monthly average for each month, rounding each monthly average to the nearest one-hundredth of one percent. We then determine the short-term savings bond rate by taking 85 percent of the three-month average and rounding the result to the nearest one-hundredth of one percent. For bonds entitled to interest accruals at the short-term savings bond rate, that rate applies to the bond's first full semiannual interest accrual period following each announcement of the rate.

          § 351.12   What do I need to know about the long-term savings bond rate, to understand redemption value calculations in this subpart?

#### § § 351.12

          We determine this rate by compiling 5-year Treasury securities rates as of the close of business for each day of the previous six months and calculating the monthly average for each month, rounding each monthly average to the nearest one-hundredth of one percent. We then determine the long-term savings bond rate by taking 85 percent of the 6-month average and rounding the result to the nearest one-hundredth of one percent. For bonds entitled to interest accruals at the long-term savings bond rate, that rate applies to the bond's first full semiannual interest accrual period following each announcement of the rate.

          § 351.13   What do I need to know about the savings bond rate to understand redemption value calculations in this subpart?

#### § § 351.13

          We determine the savings bond rate by compiling 5-year Treasury securities yields as of the close of business for each day of the previous six months and calculating the monthly average to the nearest one-hundredth of one percent. We then determine the savings bonds rate by taking 90 percent of the 6-month average and rounding the result to the nearest one-hundredth of one percent.

          § 351.14   When are rate announcements that apply to Series EE savings bonds announced?

#### § § 351.14

          (a) The Secretary will furnish rates that apply to Series EE savings bonds in announcements published each May 1 and November 1.

          (b) If the regularly scheduled date for the announcement is a day when we are not open for business, then the Secretary will make the announcement on the next business day. However, the effective date of the rate remains the first day of the month of the announcement.

          (c) The Secretary may announce rates at any other time.

          § 351.15   Is the determination of the Secretary on rates and values final?

#### § § 351.15

          The Secretary's determination of rates of return and savings bond redemption values is final and conclusive.

          § 351.16   What do I need to know about the base denomination for redemption value calculations?

#### § § 351.16

          We base all calculations of interest on a unit with a principal amount of $12.50. We use this unit value to determine the value of bonds in higher denominations. The effect of rounding off the value of the $12.50 unit increases at higher denominations. This can work to your slight advantage or disadvantage, depending on whether the value is rounded up or down.

          §§ 351.17-351.18   [Reserved]

#### § §§ 351.17-351.18

        Series EE Savings Bonds with Issue Dates Prior to May 1, 1995

          § 351.19   What are maturity periods of Series EE savings bonds with issue dates prior to May 1, 1995?

#### § § 351.19

          Bonds with issue dates from January 1, 1980, through May 1, 1995 have an original maturity period and two extended maturity periods, as shown by the following table:

          § 351.20   What is the investment yield (interest) during the original maturity period of Series EE savings bonds with issue dates from January 1, 1980, through April 1, 1995?

#### § § 351.20

          The redemption value of a bond on a given interest accrual date during original maturity will be the higher of the value produced using the applicable guaranteed minimum investment yield or the value produced using the appropriate market-based variable investment yield.

          (a) —(1)  You may obtain the guaranteed minimum investment yields on bonds bearing issue dates prior to November 1, 1982, by downloading from our website at  contacting us by email at  or by writing us at the following address: Bureau of the Fiscal Service, Parkersburg, West Virginia 26106-1328.

          (2) —(i)  You may download the guaranteed minimum investment yields prior to 5 years from issue date at our website at  by contacting us by email at  or writing to the following address: Bureau of the Fiscal Service, Parkersburg, West Virginia 26106-1328.

          (ii)  The guaranteed minimum investment yield of a bond from its issue date to each semiannual interest accrual date occurring on or after 5 years from issue up to original maturity will be as follows, compounded semiannually:

          (b)  If a bond is held for a period of 5 years after its first semiannual interest accrual period, occurring on or after November 1, 1982, or its issue date, whichever is later, its market-based variable investment yield for such period, and to each successive semiannual interest accrual date up to its original maturity, will be determined as follows:

          (1) For each 6-month period, starting with the period beginning on May 1, 1982, we will determine the average market yield on outstanding marketable Treasury securities with a remaining term to maturity of approximately 5 years during such period.

          (2) For bonds bearing an issue date prior to May 1, 1989, the market-based variable investment yield from its first semiannual interest accrual date occurring on or after November 1, 1982, or its issue date, whichever is later, to its first semiannual interest accrual date 5 years thereafter will be 85 percent, rounded to the nearest one-fourth of 1 percent, of the arithmetic average of the market yield averages for the ten 6-month periods starting with the 6-month period that most recently ended before such issue date, whichever is later.

          (3) For bonds bearing issue dates of May 1, 1989, through April 1, 1995, the market-based variable investment yield from the issue date to the semiannual interest accrual date 5 years thereafter will be 85 percent, rounded to the nearest one-hundredth of 1 percent, of the arithmetic average of the market yield averages for the ten 6-month periods starting with the 6-month period that most recently ended before such issue date.

          (4) In determining the market-based variable investment yield for a bond from its first semiannual interest accrual date occurring on or after November 1, 1982, or its issue date, whichever is later, to each successive semiannual interest accrual date occurring after 5 years from issue up to original maturity, the average market yield for each additional 6-month period will be included in the computation.

          § 351.21   How are redemption values determined during any extended maturity period of Series EE savings bonds with issue dates prior to May 1, 1995?

#### § § 351.21

          The redemption value of a bond on a given interest accrual date during an extended maturity period or periods will be the higher of the values produced using either the applicable guaranteed minimum investment yield or the appropriate market-based variable investment yield. The calculation of these yields and the resulting redemption values are described below:

          (a)  A bond may be subject to one guaranteed minimum investment yield during its original maturity period and to another such yield during each of its extended maturity periods.

          (1)  Bonds that entered an extended maturity period from May 1, 1989, through February 1, 1993, had a guaranteed minimum investment yield of 6 percent per annum, compounded semiannually, during that extended maturity period.

          (2)  Bonds that entered or enter an extended maturity period on or after March 1, 1993, have a guaranteed minimum investment yield of 4 percent per annum, compounded semiannually, during that extended maturity period, or the guaranteed minimum investment yield in effect at the beginning of that period.

          (3)  In order to determine values for a bond during its first extended maturity period, we determine the value of the bond at the end of its original maturity period using the guaranteed minimum investment yield applicable to that period. This value is then used as the base upon which interest accrues during the first extended maturity period at the applicable guaranteed minimum investment yield for that period. We use the value thus attained at first extended maturity as the base upon which interest accrues during the second extended maturity period at the applicable guaranteed minimum investment yield for that period. We then compare the resulting semiannual values with the corresponding values determined using only the applicable market-based variable investment yields.

          (b)  For a bond beginning an extended maturity period, the market-based variable investment yield from its first semiannual interest accrual date occurring on or after November 1, 1982, or its issue date, whichever is later, to each semiannual interest accrual date occurring on or after November 1, 1989, will be 85 percent, rounded to the nearest one-hundredth of one percent, of the arithmetic average of the market yield averages for the appropriate number of 6-month periods involved, beginning with the period from May 1, 1982, or the 6-month period that most recently ended before the issue date, whichever period occurs later. We use the value of a bond on its first semiannual interest accrual date occurring on or after November 1, 1982, or its issue date, whichever is later, as the base upon which interest accrues during the extended maturity period at the applicable market-based variable investment yield. As described above, the bond will receive the higher of the two values: One value produced using the applicable market-based variable investment yield; and, the other value produced using the guaranteed minimum investment yield.

          (b)  For bonds with issue dates from November 1, 1980, through October 1, 1986, the redemption value increases on the first day of each month from the third through the eighteenth month after issue, and thereafter on the first day of each successive 6-month period.

          (c)  For bonds with issue dates from November 1, 1986, through February 1, 1993, the redemption values increase on the first day of each month from the third through the thirtieth month after issue, and thereafter on the first day of each successive 6-month period.

          (d)  For bonds with issue dates of March 1, 1993, through April 1, 1995, the redemption values increase on the first day of each month from the third through the sixtieth month after issue, and thereafter either on the first day of each month or on the first day of each successive 6-month period, whichever accrual schedule ensures that the actual yield from issue date to redemption date is in no case less than 4 percent per annum, compounded semiannually.

        Series EE Savings Bonds With Issue Dates From May 1, 1995, Through April 1, 1997

          § 351.24   What are the maturity periods of bonds with issue dates from May 1, 1995, through April 1, 1997?

#### § § 351.24

          (a)  Bonds reach original maturity at 17 years after issue date.

          (b)  Series EE savings bonds have an extended maturity period of 13 years, and reach final maturity at 30 years after the issue date. Bonds cease to earn interest at final maturity.

          § 351.25   What were the interest rates and redemption values for bonds with issue dates from May 1, 1995, through April 1, 1997, during semiannual rate periods in the first 5 years after issue date?

#### § § 351.25

          (a)  The interest rate for a Series EE bond bearing an issue date of May 1, 1995, through April 1, 1997, for semiannual earning periods during the first 5 years from issue date, was the short-term savings bond rate (see § 351.11 for a description of the short-term savings bond rate.)

          (b)  Redemption values for semiannual accrual dates occurring on or before 5 years from issue date are calculated in accordance with § 351.28.

          § 351.26   What are the interest rates and redemption values for bonds with issue dates from May 1, 1995 through April 1, 1997, during semiannual rate periods that begin 5 years or more after issue date?

#### § § 351.26

          (a)  The interest rate for a Series EE bond bearing an issue date of May 1, 1995, through April 1, 1997, for semiannual earning periods beginning 5 years from issue date through original maturity, is the long-term savings bond rate as defined in § 351.12.

          (b)  We calculate redemption values for semiannual accrual dates occurring after 5 years from issue date, through original maturity, in accordance with § 351.28, except that the redemption value at the date of original maturity shall not be less than the denomination (face amount or face value).

          § 351.27   What are the interest rates and redemption values for bonds with issue dates from May 1, 1995, through April 1, 1997, during an extended maturity period?

#### § § 351.27

          During an extended maturity period the bond will be subject to the terms and conditions in effect when it is issued, and will continue to earn interest as described in paragraph § 351.26, unless the terms and conditions applicable to an extended maturity period are expressly amended prior to the beginning of such period.

          § 351.28   How are redemption values calculated for bonds with issue dates from May 1, 1995, through April 1, 1997?

#### § § 351.28

          We determine the redemption value of a bond on the accrual date immediately following each semiannual earning period as follows:

          (a) We convert the applicable long-term or short-term savings bond rate for the semiannual earning period to decimal form by dividing by 100, and adjust it to a semiannual rate by dividing by 2.

          (b) Using redemption values for the base denomination, as defined in § 351.16, we then multiply this rate by the redemption value of the bond at the beginning of the semiannual earning period.

          (c) We add the resulting interest amount, rounded to the nearest cent, to the redemption value of the bond at the beginning of the earning period to produce the redemption value at the next semiannual accrual date. The redemption value of a bond remains constant between accrual dates.

          § 351.30   What are interest rates and monthly accruals for Series EE bonds with issue dates of May 1, 1997, through April 1, 2005, during the original maturity period?

#### § § 351.30

          Savings bond rates (defined in § 351.13) apply to earnings during the first semiannual rate period beginning on or after the effective date of the rate. Interest is credited on the first day of each month and compounded semiannually. Interest accrues beginning with the fourth month from the issue date. For example, a bond issued in January has interest first credited on May 1, which represents one month of interest because of the 3-month interest penalty. The following table shows, for any given month of issue with rates announced each May and November, the months making up the semiannual rate period during which interest is earned at the announced rate (disregarding the penalty for bonds redeemed prior to 5 years after the issue date) and the months in which the bonds increase in value. This rate is an annual rate compounded semiannually.

          § 351.31   What is the interest penalty for Series EE bonds with issue dates of May 1, 1997, through April 1, 2005, that are redeemed less than 5 years after the issue date?

#### § § 351.31

          If you redeem a Series EE savings bond with an issue date of May 1, 1997, through April 1, 2005, less than five years following the issue date, we reduce the overall earning period from the issue date by three months. For example, if you redeem a bond issued January 1, 1998, 9 months later on October 1, 1998, we will determine the redemption value by applying the redemption value calculation formula described in § 351.32 and the savings bonds rate for that bond at 6 months after the issue date on July 1, 1998. The redemption value of a bond subject to the 3-month interest penalty shall not be reduced below the issue price. This penalty does not apply to bonds redeemed 5 years or more after the issue date.

          § 351.32   How are redemption values calculated for Series EE bonds with issue dates of May 1, 1997, through April 1, 2005?

#### § § 351.32

          (a)  We determine the redemption value of a bond for the accrual date (the first day of each month beginning with the fourth month from the issue date) in accordance with this section and the following formula:

          (b) —(1)  At original maturity, the redemption value of a definitive bond shall not be less than the face amount/denomination of the bond.

          (2)  At original maturity, the redemption value of a book-entry bond shall not be less than double the purchase price of the bond.

          § 351.33   What are interest rates and redemption values for Series EE bonds issued May 1, 1997, through April 1, 2005, during an extended maturity period?

#### § § 351.33

          During an extended maturity period the bond will be subject to the terms and conditions in effect when it is issued and will continue to earn interest as described in § 351.30, unless the terms and conditions applicable to an extended maturity period are expressly amended prior to the beginning of such period.

        Series EE Savings Bonds With Issue Dates of May 1, 2005, or Thereafter

          § 351.34   What are the maturity periods of Series EE bonds with issue dates of May 1, 2005, or thereafter?

          (b)  Bonds reach final maturity at 30 years after the issue date. Bonds cease to earn interest at final maturity.

          § 351.35   What do I need to know about interest rates, penalties, and redemption values for Series EE bonds with issue dates of May 1, 2005, or thereafter?

#### § § 351.35

          (a)  Fixed rate or fixed rate of interest means the rate of interest for a Series EE savings bond with an issue date of May 1, 2005, or thereafter, established by the Secretary or the Secretary's designee.

          (b)  (1) The Secretary or the Secretary's designee determines the fixed rate of interest, which is established for the life of the bond, including the extended maturity period, unless, prior to the beginning of such maturity period, the Secretary either announces a different fixed rate applicable to the extended maturity period, or we expressly amend the terms and conditions applicable to the extended maturity period.

          (2) The Secretary's determination of rates of interest and savings bond redemption values is final and conclusive.

          (c)  (1) The Secretary or the Secretary's designee will furnish a fixed rate of interest in announcements published each May 1 and November 1. The effective date of the rates will be the first day of the month of the announcement.

          (2) If the regularly scheduled date for the announcement is a day when the Treasury is not open for business, then the Secretary will make the announcement on the next business day; however, the effective date of the rates remains the first day of the month of the announcement.

          (3) The Secretary may announce rates at any other time.

          (4) The most recently announced fixed rate applies only to bonds purchased during the six months following the announcement, or for any other period of time announced by the Secretary.

          (d)  Interest accrues on the first day of each month; that is, we add the interest earned on a bond during any given month to its value at the beginning of the following month. The accrued interest compounds semiannually.

          (e)  If you redeem a bond with an issue date of May 1, 2005, or thereafter, less than five years following the issue date, we reduce the overall earning period from the issue date by three months. However, the redemption value of a bond subject to the 3-month interest penalty shall not be reduced below the issue price. This penalty does not apply to bonds redeemed 5 years or more after the issue date.

          (f) —(1)  At original maturity, the redemption value of a definitive bond shall not be less than the face amount/denomination of the bond.

          (2)  At original maturity, the redemption value of a book-entry bond shall not be less than double the purchase price of the bond.

      § 352.2   Description of bonds.

#### § § 352.2

      (a)  Series HH bonds were issued only in registered form and are nontransferable. The bonds are distinguishable by the portraits, color, border design, tax-deferral legend, and text material.

      (d)  A Series HH bond may be redeemed after six months from its issue date. The Secretary of the Treasury may not call Series HH bonds for redemption prior to maturity. In any case where Series HH bonds are surrendered to an authorized paying agent for redemption in the month prior to an interest payment date, redemption will not be deferred but will be made in regular course, unless the presenter specifically requests that the transaction be delayed until that date. A request to defer redemption made more than one month preceding the interest payment date will not be accepted.

      (e)  (1) During original maturity. Interest payments on Series HH bonds will produce the investment yields specified below during their original maturity period:

      (i)  The investment yield applicable to Series HH bonds issued on or after January 1, 2003, will be furnished in rate announcements by the Secretary or the Secretary's designee. The rate announced will apply to bonds issued during the period covered by the announcement.

      (iii)  The investment yield applicable to Series HH bonds that entered into an extended maturity period from January 1, 1990, through February 1, 1993, is 6 percent per annum, paid semiannually.

      (f)  The interest on a Series HH bond is paid semiannually beginning six months from the issue date. Interest ceases at final maturity or, if the bond is redeemed before final maturity, as of the end of the interest period preceding the date of redemption. If the redemption date falls on an interest payment date, interest ceases on that date.

      (1)  Interest on Series HH bonds issued on or after October 1, 1989, will be paid by the automated clearing house (ACH) method to the registered owner or coowner's account at a financial institution, unless the Bureau of the Fiscal Service determines that extraordinary circumstances warrant payment by check or other means.

      § 352.6   [Reserved]

#### § § 352.6

      § 352.7   Issues on exchange.

#### § § 352.7

      (a)  Prior to the close of business on August 31, 2004, owners were permitted to exchange United States Savings Bonds of Series E and EE and United States Savings Notes (Freedom Shares) at their current redemption values for Series HH bonds. Series E bonds and savings notes remained eligible for exchange for a period of one year from the month in which they reached final maturity. Series EE bonds issued on January 1, 2003, or earlier, became eligible for exchange six months after their issue dates. Series EE bonds issued on February 1, 2003, or thereafter, became eligible for exchange 12 months after their issue dates.

      (b)  Series HH bonds were issued on exchange by an authorized issuing agent upon receipt of a properly executed exchange application with eligible securities, and additional cash, if any, and any supporting evidence that was required under the regulations. If eligible securities were submitted directly to a Federal Reserve Bank referred to in § 351.13, each was required to bear a properly signed and certified request for payment. Checks in payment of additional cash needed to complete a transaction (see paragraph (d) of this section) were required to be drawn to the order of the Federal Reserve Bank.

      (c)  Department of the Treasury Circular No. 750, current revision (31 CFR part 321), authorizes financial institutions qualified as paying agents for savings bonds and notes to redeem eligible securities presented for exchange and to forward an exchange application and full payment to a Federal Reserve Bank referred to in § 351.13 for the issue of Series HH bonds. The securities redeemed on exchange by such an institution were required to be securities that it is authorized to redeem for cash.

      (d)  The total current redemption value of the eligible securities submitted for exchange in any one transaction was required to be $500 or more. If the current redemption value was an even multiple of $500, Series HH bonds were required to be issued in that exact amount. If the current redemption value exceeded, but was not an even multiple of $500, the owner had the option either:

      (1) To add the cash necessary to bring the amount of the application to the next higher multiple of $500, or

      (2) To receive a payment to reduce the amount of the application to the next lower multiple of $500.

      (e)  A Series HH bond issued on exchange was permitted to be registered in any form authorized in subpart B of Circular No. 3-80, subject to the following restrictions:

      (1) If the securities submitted for exchange were in single ownership form, the owner was required to be named as owner or first-named coowner on the Series HH bonds. A coowner or beneficiary was permitted to be named.

      (2) If the securities submitted for exchange were in coownership form, and one coowner was the “principal coowner”, that person was required to be named as owner or first-named coowner on the Series HH bonds. A coowner or beneficiary was also permitted to be named. The “principal coowner” was the coowner who purchased the securities presented for exchange with his or her own funds, or received them as a gift, inheritance or legacy, or as a result of judicial proceedings, and had them reissued in coownership form, provided he or she had received no contribution in money or money's worth for designating the other coowner on the securities.

      (3) If the securities presented for exchange were in coownership form, and both coowners shared in their purchase or received them jointly as a gift, inheritance, or legacy or as a result of judicial proceedings, both persons were required to be named as coowners on the Series HH bonds.

      (4) If the securities presented for exchange were in beneficiary form, the owner was required to be named on the Series HH bonds as owner or first-named coowner. If the owner was deceased, a surviving beneficiary was required to be named as owner or first-named coowner. In either case, a coowner or beneficiary was permitted to be named.

      (f)  Series HH bonds issued on exchange were dated as of the first day of the month in which the eligible securities presented for exchange were redeemed by an authorized paying agent, as evidenced in the payment stamp on the securities and the exchange application.

      (g)  (1) Continuation of tax deferral. Pursuant to the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended, an owner who had not been reporting the interest on his or her Series E or EE bonds and savings notes on an accrual basis for Federal income tax purposes, and who exchanged those securities for Series HH bonds, was permitted to continue to defer reporting the interest on the securities exchanged until the taxable year in which the Series HH bonds received in the exchange reach final maturity, are redeemed, or are otherwise disposed of, whichever is earlier. A reissue transaction that affects any of the persons required to be named on the Series HH bonds, as set forth in paragraph (e) of this section, may result in termination of the tax deferral privilege.

      (2)  Each bond issued in a tax-deferred exchange bore a legend showing how much of its issue price represented interest on the securities exchanged. This interest must be treated as income for Federal income tax purposes and reported in accordance with paragraph (g)(1) of this section.

      (3)  To the extent that it represented interest earned on the securities presented for exchange, an amount paid to an owner in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section was reportable as income for Federal income tax purposes for the year in which it was paid. Pursuant to 26 CFR 1.6049.4, a paying agent was required to report interest income of $10 or more included in any amount paid in an exchange transaction to the payee and to the Internal Revenue Service on Form 1099-INT or an approved substitute. A separate report was permitted to be made for each exchange transaction in which interest in the amount of $10 or more was paid, or all interest paid in both cash redemption and exchange transactions was permitted to be aggregated and reported annually should the total amount be $10 or more.

      (h)  The rules prescribed for exchanges under paragraphs (a) through (f) of this section also applied to exchanges by owners who report the interest earned on their bonds of Series E and EE and savings notes annually for Federal income tax purposes, or elect to report all such interest that was not previously reported for the taxable year of the exchange. Series HH bonds issued in a nontax-deferred exchange were required to show a “0” in the tax-deferral legend.

      § 352.8   Reinvestment of matured Series H bonds.

#### § § 352.8

      (a)  Prior to the close of business on August 31, 2004, the proceeds of matured Series H and HH bonds, whether purchased for cash or issued in exchange for other securities, were permitted to be reinvested in Series HH bonds. Tax deferral granted to interest earned on securities exchanged for Series H bonds was not permitted to be continued when the Series H bonds reached final maturity and their proceeds were reinvested in Series HH bonds. The amount appearing in the legend on a matured Series H bond on which tax deferral was granted must be reported for Federal income tax purposes for the year of such final maturity.

      (b)  The reinvestment transaction were subject to the rules governing exchanges, as set forth in § 352.7 of this Circular, and the Series HH bonds issued on reinvestment were identical in all respects with those issued in a non-tax-deferred exchange.

No mail deliveries elsewhere were made. Bonds acquired by a citizen of the United States residing abroad were delivered only to such address in the United States as the applicant directs.

        (d)  (1) Minors may purchase with their wages, earnings, or other funds belonging to them and under their control bonds registered in their names alone or with a coowner or beneficiary.

        (2) Bonds purchased by another person with funds belonging to a minor not under legal guardianship or similar fiduciary estate must be registered, without a coowner or beneficiary, in the name of the minor or a natural guardian on behalf of a minor.

        (3) Bonds purchased with funds of another may be registered to name the minor as owner, coowner, or beneficiary. If the minor is under legal guardianship or similar fiduciary estate, the registration must include an appropriate reference to it.

        § 353.7   Authorized forms of registration.

#### § § 353.7

        Subject to any limitations or restrictions contained in these regulations on the right of any person to be named as owner, coowner, or beneficiary, bonds should be registered as indicated below. A savings bond registered in a form not substantially in agreement with one of the forms authorized by this subpart is not considered validly issued.

        (a)  A bond may be registered in the names of individuals in their own right, but only in one of the forms authorized by this paragraph.

        (1)  A bond may be registered in the name of one individual. Example:

        (2)  A bond may be registered in the names of two individuals in the alternative as coowners. The form of registration “A and B” is not authorized. Examples:

        (3)  A bond may be registered in the name of one individual payable on death to another. “Payable on death to” may be abbreviated to “P.O.D.” Examples:

        (b) —(1)  A bond may be registered in the name of any person or persons or any organization acting as fiduciary of a single fiduciary estate, but not where the fiduciary will hold the bond merely or principally as security for the performance of a duty, obligation, or service. Registration should conform to a form authorized by this paragraph. A coowner or beneficiary may be named only in accordance with the applicable provisions of § 353.6 (c) and (d). A common trust fund established and maintained by a financial institution authorized to act as a fiduciary will be considered a single fiduciary estate within the meaning of these regulations.

        (2)  A bond may be registered in the name and title or capacity of the legally appointed or authorized representative of the estate of a minor, incompetent, aged or infirm person, absentee, et al., or in the name of that individual followed by an appropriate reference to the estate. Examples:

        (3)  A bond may be registered in the name of either parent (natural and adoptive) of a minor, as natural guardian. The registration of a bond in this form is considered as establishing a fiduciary relationship. A coowner or beneficiary may be named but only if the funds used to purchase the bonds do not belong to the minor. Examples:

        (4)  A bond may be registered in the name of the representative appointed by a court to act for an estate of a decedent, or in the name of an executor authorized to administer a trust under the terms of a will although not named trustee. The name and capacity of all the representatives as shown in the letters of appointment must be included in the registration and be followed by an adequate indentifying reference to the estate. Examples:

        (5)  A bond may be registered in the name and title of the trustee of a trust estate, or in the name of a life tenant, followed by an adequate identifying reference to the authority governing the trust or life tenancy. Examples:

        (i) If the trust instrument designates by title only an officer of a board or an organization as trustee, only the title of the officer should be used. Example:

        (ii) The names of all trustees, in the form used in the trust instrument, must be included in the registration, except as follows:

        (A) If there are several trustees designated as a board or they are required to act as a unit, their names may be omitted and the words “Board of Trustees” substituted for the word “trustee”. Example:

        (B) If the trustees do not constitute a board or are not required to act as a unit, and are too numerous to be designated in the registration by names and title, some or all the names may be omitted. Examples:

        (6)  A bond may be registered in the name and title, or title alone, of the trustee of an eligible employee thrift, savings, vacation or similar plan, as defined in § 353.13(a). If the instrument creating the trust provides that the trustees shall serve for a limited term, their names may be omitted. Examples:

        (7)  A bond may be registered in the title of the trustees, or a board of trustees, holding funds in trust for a lodge, church, or society, or similar organization, whether or not incorporated. Examples:

        (8)  A bond may be registered in the name of a bank, trust company, or other financial institution, or an individual, as agent under an agreement with a religious, educational, charitable or non-profit organization, whether or not incorporated, if the agent holds funds for the sole purpose of investing them and paying the income to the organization. The name and designation of the agent must be followed by an adequate reference to the agreement. Examples:

        (9)  A bond may be registered in the title of the principal or other officer of a public, private, or parochial school holding funds in trust for a student body fund or for a class, group, or activity. If the amount purchased for any one fund does not exceed $2,500 (face amount), no reference need be made to a trust instrument. Examples:

        (10)  A bond may be registered in the name of a public corporation or a public body, or in the title of a public officer, acting as trustee under express authority of law, followed by an appropriate reference to the statute creating the trust. Examples:

        (c) —(1)  A bond may be registered in the name of any private organization in its own right. The full legal name of the organization as set forth in its charter, articles of incorporation, constitution, partnership agreement, or other authority from which its powers are derived, must be included in the registration and may be followed by a parenthetical reference to a particular account other than a trust account.

        (2)  A bond may be registered in the name of a business, fraternal, religious, non-profit, or other private corporation. The words “a corporation” must be included in he registration unless the fact of incorporation is shown in the name. Examples:

        (3)  A bond may be registered in the name of a club, lodge, society, or a similar self-governing association which is unincorporated. The words “an unincorporated association” must be included in the registration. This form of registration must not be used for a trust fund, board of trustees, a partnership, or a sole proprietorship. If the association is chartered by or affiliated with a parent organization, the name or designation of the subordinate or local organization must be given first, followed by the name of the parent organization. The name of the parent organization may be placed in parentheses and, if well known, may be abbreviated. Examples:

        (4)  A bond may be registered in the name of a partnership. The words “a partnership” must be included in the registration. Examples:

        (5)  A bond may be registered in the name of an individual who is doing business as a sole proprietor. A reference may be made to the trade name under which the business is conducted. Example:

        (d)  A bond may be registered in the name of a church, hospital, home, school, or similar institution conducted by a private organization or by private trustees, regardless of the manner in which it is organized or governed or title to its property is held. Descriptive words, such as “a corporation” or “an unincorporated association”, must not be included in the registration. Examples:

        (e)  A bond may be registered in the name of a State, county, city, town, village, school district, or other political entity, public body, or corporation established by law (including a board, commission, administration, authority, or agency) which is the owner or official custodian of public funds, other than trust funds, or in the full legal title of the public officer having custody of the funds. Examples:

        (f)  A person who desires to have a bond become the property of the United States upon his or her death may designate the United States Treasury as coowner or beneficiary. Examples:

#### § § 353.10

        The amount of savings bonds of Series EE and HH which may be purchased and held, in the name of any one person in any one calendar year, is computed according to the provisions of § 353.11 and is limited as follows:

        (a) —(1)  $5,000 (principal amount).

        (2)  $200,000 (face amount) for bonds received in a calendar year as gifts by an organization which at the time of purchase was an exempt organization under the terms of 26 CFR 1.501(c)(3)-1.

> [44 FR 76441, Dec. 26, 1979, as amended at 68 FR 24805, May 8, 2003; 72 FR 67853, Dec. 3, 2007]

        § 353.11   Computation of amount.

#### § § 353.11

        (a)  The purchases of bonds in the name of any person in an individual capacity are computed separately from purchases in a fiduciary capacity. A pension or retirement fund, or an investment, insurance, annuity, or similar fund or trust is regarded as an entity, regardless of the number of beneficiaries or the manner in which their shares or interests are established, determined, or segregated.

        (b)  In computing the purchases for each person, the following outstanding bonds are included:

        (1) All bonds registered in the name of that person alone;

        (2) All bonds registered in the name of the representative of the estate of that person; and

        (3) All bonds registered in the name of that person as first-named coowner.

        (c)  In computing the purchases for each person, the following are excluded:

        (1) Bonds on which that person is named beneficiary;

        (ii) As an heir or a legatee of the deceased owner;

        (iii) By virtue of the termination of a trust or the happening of a similar event;

        (3) Bonds issued in an authorized exchange or reinvestment; and

        (4) Bonds that are purchased and redeemed within the same calendar year.

        § 353.12   Disposition of excess.

#### § § 353.12

        If any person at any time has savings bonds issued during any one calendar year in excess of the prescribed amount, the Bureau of the Fiscal Service reserves the right to take any action that it deems necessary to adjust the excess. Instructions for adjustment of the excess can be obtained by email at  or by writing to Bureau of the Fiscal Service, Parkersburg, WV 26106-1328.

        § 353.13   Employee plans—Conditions of eligibility.

#### § § 353.13

        (a)  Employee thrift, savings, vacation and similar plans are contributory plans established by the employer for the exclusive and irrevocable benefit of its employees or their beneficiaries. Each plan must afford employees the means of making regular savings from their wages through payroll deductions and provide for employer contributions to be added to these savings.

        (b)  (1) The term  means all the employees' contributions and _assets_ purchased with them and the employer's contributions and assets purchased with them, as well as accretions, such as dividends on stock, the increment in value on bonds and all other income; but, notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the right to demand and receive  credited to the account of an employee shall not be construed to require the distribution of assets in kind when it would not be possible or practicable to make such a distribution; for example, Series EE bonds may not be reissued in unauthorized denominations.

        (2) The word  means: (i) The person or persons, if any, designated by the employee in accordance with the terms of the plan to receive the benefits of the plan upon the employee's death or (ii) the estate of the employee.

        (c)  An employee plan must conform to the following rules in order to be eligible for the special limitation provided in § 353.10.

        (1)  All assets of a plan must be credited to the individual accounts of participating employees and may be distributed only to them or their beneficiaries, except as provided in paragraph (c)(3) of this section.

        (2)  Bonds may be purchased only with assets credited to the accounts of participating employees and only if the amount taken from any account at any time for that purpose is equal to the purchase price of a bond or bonds in an authorized denomination or denominations, and shares in the bonds are credited to the accounts of the individuals from which the purchase price was derived, in amounts corresponding with their shares. For example, if $50 credited to the account of John Jones is commingled with funds credited to the accounts of other employees to make a total of $5,000 with which a Series EE bond in the denomination of $10,000 (face amount) is purchased in December 1980 and registered in the name and title of the trustee, the plan must provide, in effect, that John Jones' account be credited to show that he is the owner of a Series EE bond in the denomination of $100 (face amount) bearing an issue date of December 1, 1980.

        (3)  Each participating employee has an irrevocable right to request and receive from the trustee all assets credited to the employee's account (or their value, if the employee prefers) without regard to any conditions other than the loss or suspension of the privilege of participating further in the plan. A plan may limit or modify such right in any manner required for qualification of the plan under section 401 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended (26 U.S.C. section 401).

        (4)  Upon the death of an employee, his or her beneficiary shall have the absolute and unconditional right to demand and receive from the trustee all assets credited to the account of the employee or their value, if he or she so prefers.

        (5)  When settlement is made with an employee or his or her beneficiary with respect to any bond registered in the name and title of the plan trustee in which the employee has a share, the bond must be paid or reissued to the extent of the share. If an employee or the beneficiary is to receive distribution in kind, bonds bearing the same issue dates as those credited to the employee's account will be reissued in the name of the employee or the employee's beneficiary to the extent entitled, in authorized denominations, in any authorized form of registration, upon the request and certification of the trustee.

        (d)  A trustee of an employee plan who desires to purchase bonds under the special limitation should submit to the designated Federal Reserve Bank or Branch a copy of:

        (1) The plan, (2) any instructions issued under the plan that concern Series EE bonds, and (3) the trust agreement, in order to establish the plan's eligibility.

        (e)  Savings bonds may be purchased under certain vacation plans. Questions concerning the eligibility of these plans to purchase bonds in excess of the general limitation should be addressed to the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, Parkersburg, WV 26101.

      Subpart E—Judicial Proceedings

        § 353.20   General.

#### § § 353.20

        (a) The Department of the Treasury will not recognize a judicial determination that gives effect to an attempted voluntary transfer inter vivos of a bond, or a judicial determination that impairs the rights of survivorship conferred by these regulations upon a coowner or beneficiary. All provisions of this subpart are subject to these restrictions.

        (b) The Department of the Treasury will recognize a claim against an owner of a savings bond and conflicting claims of ownership of, or interest in, a bond between coowners or between the registered owner and the beneficiary, if established by valid, judicial proceedings specifically listed in this subpart. Escheat proceedings will not be recognized under this subpart. Section 353.23 specifies evidence required to establish the validity of judicial proceedings. Treasury may require any other evidence to establish the validity of judicial proceedings, such as evidence that the proceeding provided due process, complied with this part, and complied with relevant state law.

        (c) The Department of the Treasury and the agencies that issue, reissue, or redeem savings bonds will not accept a notice of an adverse claim or notice of pending judicial proceedings, nor undertake to protect the interests of a litigant not in possession of a savings bond.

        § 353.21   Payment to judgment creditors.

#### § § 353.21

        (a)  The Department of the Treasury will pay (but not reissue) a savings bond to the purchaser at a sale under a levy or to the officer authorized under appropriate process to levy upon property of the registered owner or coowner to satisfy a money judgment. Payment will be made only to the extent necessary to satisfy the money judgment. The amount paid is limited to the redemption value 60 days after the termination of the judicial proceedings. Except in a case of a levy by the Internal Revenue Service, payment of a bond registered in coownership form pursuant to a judgment or a levy against only one coowner is limited to the extent of that coowner's interest in the bond. That interest must be established by an agreement between the coowners by judgment, decree, or order of a court in a proceeding to which both coowners are parties. Payment of a bond registered in coownership form pursuant to levy by the Internal Revenue Service will be made if the levy is against either coowner on the bond.

        (b)  The Department of the Treasury will pay, at current redemption value, a savings bond to a trustee in bankruptcy, a receiver of an insolvent's estate, a receiver in equity, or a similar court officer under the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section.

        § 353.22   Payment or reissue pursuant to judgment.

#### § § 353.22

        (a)  The Department of the Treasury will recognize a divorce decree that ratifies or confirms a property settlement agreement disposing of bonds or that otherwise settles the interests of the parties in a bond. Reissue of a savings bond may be made to eliminate the name of one spouse as owner, coowner, or beneficiary or to substitute the name of one spouse for that of the other spouse as owner, coowner, or beneficiary pursuant to the decree. However, if the bond is registered in the name of one spouse with another person as coowner, there must be submitted either:

        (1) A request for reissue by the other person or (2) a certified copy of a judgment, decree, or court order entered in proceedings to which the other person and the spouse named on the bond are parties, determining the extent of the interest of that spouse in the bond. Reissue will be permitted only to the extent of that spouse's interest. The evidence required under § 353.23 must be submitted in every case. When the divorce decree does not set out the terms of the property settlement agreement, a certified copy of the agreement must be submitted. Payment, rather than reissue, will be made if requested.

        (b)  A savings bond belonging solely to one individual will be paid or reissued at the request of the person found by a court to be entitled by reason of a gift causa mortis from the sole owner.

        (c)  When payment or reissue under this section is to be made, the rights of the parties will be those existing under the regulations current at the time of the entry of the final judgment, decree, or court order.

        § 353.23   Evidence.

#### § § 353.23

        (a)  To establish the validity of judicial proceedings, certified copies of the final judgment, decree, or court order, and of any necessary supplementary proceedings, must be submitted. If the judgment, decree, or court order was rendered more than six months prior to the presentation of the bond, there must also be submitted a certification from the clerk of the court, under court seal, dated within six months of the presentation of the bond, showing that the judgment, decree, or court order is in full force.

        (b)  A request for payment by a trustee in bankruptcy or a receiver of an insolvent's estate must be supported by appropriate evidence of appointment and qualification. The evidence must be certified by the clerk of the court, under court seal, as being in full force on a date that is not more than six months prior to the presentation of the bond.

        (c)  A request for payment by a receiver in equity or a similar court officer, other than a receiver of an insolvent's estate, must be supported by a copy of an order that authorizes the presentation of the bond for redemption, certified by the clerk of the court, under court seal, as being in full force on a date that is not more than six months prior to the presentation of the bond.

        § 353.24   Payment pursuant to judicial or administrative forfeiture.

#### § § 353.24

        (a)  As used in this part:

        (1)  means the individual designated to receive referrals from the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, as provided for in this section, by the Federal investigative agency, United States Attorney's Office, or forfeiting agency specified in Fiscal Service Form 1522.

        (2)  means the federal law enforcement agency responsible for the forfeiture.

        (3) —(i)  means the process by which property may be forfeited by a Federal agency rather than through judicial proceedings.

        (ii)  means either a civil or a criminal proceeding in a United States District Court that may result in a final judgment and order of forfeiture.

        (4)  means the written notification of the forfeiture provided by the forfeiting agency to the Bureau of the Fiscal Service on a _Fiscal Service Form 1522_ Special Form of Request for Payment of United States Savings and Retirement Securities Where Use of a Detached Request Is Authorized. Fiscal Service Form 1522 must specify: the contact point; the issue date of each bond; the serial number for each bond; the date of forfeiture; the forfeiture fund to which payment is to be made; and be signed by an individual authorized by the forfeiting agency. The forfeited bonds and the completed Fiscal Service Form 1522 are to be mailed to the Department of the Treasury, Bureau of the Fiscal Service, Parkersburg, WV 26106-1328.

        (b)  (1) Upon receipt and review of the Fiscal Service Form 1522, as described in (a)(4) above, the Bureau of the Fiscal Service will make payment to the forfeiture fund specified on the form.

        (2) The Bureau of the Fiscal Service will record the forfeiture, the forfeiture fund into which the proceeds were paid, the contact point, and any related information.

        (3) The Bureau of the Fiscal Service will rely exclusively upon the information provided by the Federal agency in the Fiscal Service Form 1522 and will not make any independent evaluation of the validity of the forfeiture order, the request for payment, or the authority of the individual signing the request for payment.

        (4) The amount paid is limited to the redemption value of the savings bonds as of the date of forfeiture specified in the Fiscal Service Form 1522.

        (c)  (1) Upon payment made pursuant to (b), all inquiries from the previous owner, including requests for payment, reissue, or applications for relief, related to forfeited savings bonds will be referred by the Bureau of the Fiscal Service to the contact point named in the Fiscal Service Form 1522.

        (2) The Bureau of the Fiscal Service will notify the submitter of the inquiry of the referral to the contact point.

        (3) The Bureau of the Fiscal Service will not investigate the inquiry and will defer to the forfeiting agency's determination of the appropriate course of action, including settlement where appropriate. Any settlement will be paid from the forfeiture fund into which the proceeds were deposited.

#### § § 353.25

        Relief, by the issue of a substitute bond or by payment, is authorized for the loss, theft, destruction, mutilation, or defacement of a bond after receipt by the owner or his or her representative. As a condition for granting relief, the Commissioner of the Fiscal Service, as designee of the Secretary of the Treasury, may require a bond of indemnity, in the form, and with the surety, or security, he considers necessary to protect the interests of the United States. In all cases the savings bond must be identified by serial number and the applicant must submit satisfactory evidence of the loss, theft, or destruction, or a satisfactory explanation of the mutilation or defacement.

        § 353.26   Application for relief—After receipt of bond.

#### § § 353.26

        (a) If the serial numbers of the lost, stolen, or destroyed bonds are known, the claimant should execute an application for relief on the appropriate form and submit it to the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, Parkersburg, WV 26101.

        (2) If a minor named on a bond as owner, coowner, or beneficiary is not of sufficient competency and understanding to request payment, both parents will ordinarily be required to join in the application.

        (e) If the application is approved on or before February 14, 2014, relief will be granted either by the issuance of a bond bearing the same issue date as the bond for which the claim was filed or by payment. If the application is approved after February 14, 2014, relief for Series HH bonds will be granted either by the issuance of a bond bearing the same issue date as the bond for which the claim was filed or by payment, and relief for Series EE bonds will be granted either by the issuance of a book-entry bond bearing the same issue date as the bond for which the claim was filed or by payment.

      Subpart G—Interest

        § 353.30   Series EE bonds.

#### § § 353.30

        Definitive Series EE bonds were issued at a discount. The accrued interest is added to the issue price at stated intervals and is payable only at redemption as part of the redemption value. Information regarding interest rates and redemption values is found in Department of the Treasury Circular, Fiscal Service Series No. 1-80 (31 CFR part 351).

> [44 FR 76441, Dec. 26, 1979, as amended at 76 FR 66856, Oct. 28, 2011]

        § 353.31   Series HH bonds.

#### § § 353.31

        (a)  Series HH bonds are current income bonds issued at par (face amount). Interest on a Series HH bond is paid semiannually beginning six months from the issue date. Interest ceases at final maturity, or, if the bond is redeemed prior to final maturity, as of the end of the interest period last preceding the date of redemption. For example, if a bond on which interest is payable on January 1 and July 1 is redeemed on September 1, interest ceases as of the preceding July 1, and no interest will be paid for the period from July 1 to September 1. However, if the redemption date falls on an interest payment date, interest ceases on that date. Information regarding interest rates is found in Department of the Treasury Circular, Fiscal Service Series No. 2-80, current revision (31 CFR part 352).

        (b)  Series HH bond interest accounts are maintained by the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, Parkersburg, WV. Interest on bonds issued on or after October 1, 1989 will be paid on each interest due date by the Automated Clearing House (ACH) method to the owner or coowner's account at a financial institution, unless the Bureau determines that extraordinary circumstances warrant payment by check or other means. Interest on bonds issued prior to October 1, 1989, is payable by check drawn to the order of the owner or both coowners or, upon request, by the ACH method to the owner or coowner's account at a financial institution. Checks will be mailed to the delivery address provided to the Bureau. Deposit account information for ACH payments shall be provided on the form designated by the Bureau. Series H interest payments made by the ACH method are governed by the regulations at 31 CFR part 370.

        (c)  Notices affecting the delivery of interest payments. To ensure appropriate action, notices affecting the delivery of interest payments on Series HH bonds must be received by the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, Parkersburg, WV 26102-1328, at least one month prior to the interest payment date. Each notice must include the owner or coowner's name and the taxpayer identifying number appearing on the account under which records of the bonds are maintained.

        (d)  Physical reissue of a Series HH bond may be made without regard to interest payment dates. The Series HH interest accounts maintained by the Bureau of the Fiscal Service will be closed in the first week of the month preceding each interest payment date, and payments will be made pursuant to the information contained in the accounts as of the date they are closed.

        (e)  Interest checks must be endorsed in accordance with the regulations governing the payment of fiscal agency checks, as contained in 31 CFR part 355.

        (f) —(1)  Payments on all Series HH bonds assigned to the same account maintained by the Bureau must be made to the same deposit account at a financial institution.

        (2)  Where the Series HH bonds are registered in the name of individual(s) as sole owner, or as owner and beneficiary, and the deposit account at the financial institution is held in the name of individual(s) in their own right, the owner's name must appear on the deposit account. Where the bonds are registered in the names of two individuals as coowners and the deposit account is held in the name of individual(s) in their own right, the registration of the bonds and the title of the account must contain at least one name that is common to both. The deposit account to which the interest payments are directed should preferably be established in a form identical to the registration of the bonds to ensure that rights of ownership and survivorship can be more easily identified and preserved. Neither the United States nor any Federal Reserve Bank shall be liable for any loss sustained because the interest of the holder(s) of a deposit account to which payments are made are not the same as the owner(s) of the bonds.

        (3)  Where the deposit account to which interest payments are to be directed is held in the name of the financial institution itself acting as sole trustee, or as co-trustee, or is the name of a commercially-managed investment fund, the owner or coowner should inquire whether the financial institution is able to receive ACH payments; if not, the owner or coowner should make alternative arrangements.

        (4)  If after submission of deposit account information, it is determined that ACH payments cannot be accepted by the designated financial institution, pending receipt of new deposit account information, payment will be made by check drawn to the registered owner or both coowners and mailed to the address of record.

        (5)  (i) Bonds issued on or after October 1, 1989. As set forth in paragraph (b) of this section and in the Series HH offering contained in Circular No. 2-80, interest on Series HH bonds issued on or after October 1, 1989, will be paid by the ACH method. In the absence of extraordinary circumstances, a request to discontinue payment by the ACH method in favor of payment by check will not be accepted.

        (ii) Bonds issued prior to October 1, 1989. An ACH arrangement established for Series HH bonds issued prior to October 1, 1989, shall remain in effect until it is terminated by a request from the owner or coowner submitted to the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, Parkersburg, WV 26102-1328.

        (6)  Series HH interest payments made by the ACH method are governed by the regulations at 31 CFR part 370.

        (7)  The Bureau of the Fiscal Service, Parkersburg, WV 26102 should be notified if:

        (i) An interest check is not received or is lost after receipt or

        (ii) An ACH payment is not credited to the designated account and the financial institution has no record of receiving it. The notice should include the owner or coowner's name and taxpayer identifying number and the interest payment date.

      Subpart H—General Provisions for Payment

        § 353.35   Payment (redemption).

#### § § 353.35

        (a)  Payment of a savings bond will be made to the person or persons entitled under the provisions of these regulations, except that checks in payment will not be delivered to addresses in areas with respect to which the Department of the Treasury restricts or regulates the delivery of checks drawn against funds of the United States. See Department of the Treasury Circular No. 655, current revision (31 CFR part 211). Payment will be made without regard to any notice of adverse claims to a bond and no stoppage or caveat against payment of a bond will be entered.

        (b) A Series EE bond issued on January 1, 2003, or earlier, will be paid at any time after 6 months from its issue date. A Series EE bond issued on February 1, 2003, or thereafter, will be paid at any time after 12 months from its issue date. Bonds will be paid at the current redemption value shown in Department of the Treasury Circular, Fiscal Service Series No. 1-80 (31 CFR part 351).

        (c)  A Series HH bond will be paid at any time after six months from issue date. A Series HH bond issued in an authorized exchange or reinvestment transaction will be paid at face value. A Series HH bond issued for cash will be paid at the current redemption value shown in Department of the Treasury Circular, Fiscal Service Series No. 2-80, Second Revision (31 CFR part 352). If the bond is redeemed at less than face value, the difference represents an adjustment of interest. In any case where Series HH bonds are surrendered to a designated Federal Reserve Bank or Branch or the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, Parkersburg, WV 26106-1328, for redemption in the month prior to an interest payment date, redemption will not be deferred but will be made in regular course, unless the presenter specifically requests that the transaction be delayed until that date. A request to defer redemption made more than one month preceding the interest payment date will not be accepted.

#### § § 353.36

        A savings bond registered in single ownership form (, without a coowner or beneficiary) will be paid to the owner during his or her lifetime upon surrender with an appropriate request.

        § 353.37   Payment during lives of both coowners.

#### § § 353.37

        A savings bond registered in coownership form will be paid to either coowner upon surrender with an appropriate request, and upon payment (as determined in § 353.43), the other coowner will cease to have any interest in the bond. If both coowners request payment, payment will be made by check drawn in the form, “John A. Jones AND Mary C. Jones”.

        § 353.38   Payment during lifetime of owner of beneficiary bond.

#### § § 353.38

        A savings bond registered in beneficiary form will be paid to the registered owner during his or her lifetime upon surrender with an appropriate request. Upon payment (as determined in § 353.43) the beneficiary will cease to have any interest in the bond.

        § 353.39   Surrender for payment.

#### § § 353.39

        (a)  An individual who is the owner or coowner of a Series EE bond may present the bond to an authorized paying agent for redemption. The presenter must be prepared to establish his or her identity in accordance with Treasury instructions and identification guidelines. The owner or coowner must sign the request for payment on the bond or, if authorized, on a separate detached request, and add his or her address. If the request for payment has been signed, or signed and certified, before presentation of the bond, the paying agent must be satisfied that the person presenting the bond for payment is the owner or coowner and may require the person to sign the request for payment again. If the bond is in order for payment, the paying agent will make immediate payment at the current redemption value without charge to the presenter. Paying agents are not authorized to process any case involving partial redemption or any case in which supporting evidence is required.

        (b)  In the case of bonds to which the procedure in paragraph (a) of this section, does not apply, or if otherwise preferred, the owner or coowner, or other person entitled to payment, should appear before an officer authorized to certify requests for payment, establish his or her identity, sign the request for payment, and provide information as to the address to which the check in payment is to be mailed. The bond must be forwarded to a designated Federal Reserve Bank or Branch or the Bureau of the Fiscal Service. Usually, payment will be expedited by submission to a designated Federal Reserve Bank or Branch. In all cases, the cost and risk of presentation of a bond will be borne by the owner. Payment will be made by check drawn to the order of the registered owner or other person entitled and will be mailed to the address requested.

        (c)  Requests executed more than six months before the date of receipt of a bond for payment will not be accepted. Neither will a bond be accepted if payment is requested as of a date more than three months in the future.

#### § § 353.40

        (a)  A bond may be paid by a paying agent or a designated Federal Reserve Bank without the owner's signature to the request for payment, if the bond bears the special endorsement of a paying agent specifically qualified to place such an endorsement on savings bonds.

        (b)  A signature by mark (X) must be witnessed by at least one disinterested person and a certifying officer. See subpart J. The witness must attest to the signature by mark substantially as follows: “Witness to signature by mark”, followed by his or her signature and address.

        (c)  If the name of the owner, coowner, or other person entitled to payment, as it appears in the registration or in evidence on file in the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, has been changed in any legal manner, the signature to the request for payment must show both names and the manner in which the change was made; for example, “Mary T. Jones Smith (Mary T. J. Smith or Mary T. Smith) changed by marriage from Mary T. Jones”, or “John R. Young, changed by order of court from Hans R. Jung”. See § 353.50.

        (d)  A request for payment, reinvestment, or exchange executed by an attorney-in-fact will be recognized if it is accompanied by a copy of the power of attorney which meets the following requirements:

        (1) The power of attorney must bear the grantor's signature, properly certified or notarized, in accordance with applicable State law;

        (2) The power of attorney must grant, by its terms, authority for the attorney-in-fact to sell or redeem the grantor's securities, sell his or her personal property, or, otherwise contain similar authority; and

        (3) In the case of a grantor who has become incapacitated, the power of attorney must conform with pertinent provisions of State law concerning its durability. Generally, in such circumstances, the power of attorney should provide that the authority granted will not be affected by the subsequent incompetence or incapacity of the grantor. Medical evidence or other proof of the grantor's condition may be required in any case.

        § 353.60   Payment to representative of an estate.

#### § § 353.60

        (a) The representative of an estate of an owner who is a minor, an aged person, incompetent, absentee, et al., may receive payment upon request:

        (1) If the registration shows the name and capacity of the representative;

        (2) If the registration shows the capacity but not the name of the representative and the request is accompanied by appropriate evidence; or

        (3) If the registration includes neither the name of the representative nor his or her capacity but the request is accompained by appropriate evidence.

        (b) Appropriate evidence for paragraphs (a) (2) and (3) of this section includes a certified copy of the letters of appointment or, if the representative is not appointed by a court, other proof of qualification. Except in the case of corporate fiduciaries, the evidence must show that the appointment is in full force and be dated not more than one year prior to the presentation of the bond for payment. The request for payment appearing on the back of a bond must be signed by the representative as such, for example, “John S. Jones, guardian (committee) of the estate of Henry W. Smith, a minor (an incompetent)”.

        § 353.61   Payment after death.

#### § § 353.61

        After the death of the ward, and at any time prior to the representative's discharge, the representative of the estate will be entitled to obtain payment of a bond to which the ward was solely entitled.

        § 353.62   Payment to minors.

#### § § 353.62

        If the owner of a savings bond is a minor and the form of registration does not indicate that there is a representative of the minor's estate, payment will be made to the minor upon his or her request, provided the minor is of sufficient competency to sign the request for payment and to understand the nature of the transaction. In general, the fact that the request for payment has been signed by a minor and certified will be accepted as sufficient proof of competency and understanding.

        § 353.63   Payment to a parent or other person on behalf of a minor.

#### § § 353.63

        If the owner of a savings bond is a minor and the form of registration does not indicate that there is a representative of his or her estate, and if the minor is not of sufficient competency to sign the request for payment and to understand the nature of the transaction, payment will be made to either parent with whom the minor resides or to whom legal custody has been granted. If the minor does not reside with either parent, payment will be made to the person who furnishes the chief support for the minor. The request must appear on the back of the bond in one of the following forms:

        (a)

        (b)

        § 353.64   Payment, reinvestment, or exchange—voluntary guardian of an incapacitated person.

#### § § 353.64

        (a) Payment of bonds. When an adult owner of bonds is incapable of requesting payment as a result of incapacity and there is no other person legally qualified to do so, the relative, or other person, responsible for the owner's care and support may submit an application for recognition as voluntary guardian for the purpose of redeeming the owner's bonds, if the total redemption value of all of the owner's bonds does not exceed $20,000. The redemption value of the bonds shall be determined as of the date the bonds are received, accompanied by an appropriate request for payment. If the total redemption value exceeds $20,000, a legal representative must be appointed, as set forth in § 315.60.

        (b) Reinvestment of bonds. If the bonds have finally matured and it is desired to redeem them and reinvest the proceeds in other savings bonds, the new bonds must be registered in the name of the incapacitated person, followed by words showing that he or she is under voluntary guardianship; for example, “John Jones 123-45-6789, under voluntary guardianship”. A living coowner or beneficiary named on the matured bonds must be designated on the new bonds, unless such person furnishes a certified statement consenting to omission of his or her name. If an amount insufficient to purchase an additional bond of any authorized denomination of either series remains after the reinvestment, the voluntary guardian may furnish additional funds sufficient to purchase another bond of either series of the lowest available denomination. If additional funds are not furnished, the remaining amount will be paid to the voluntary guardian for the use and benefit of the incapacitated person.

        (c) Exchange of bonds. The provisions for reinvestment of the proceeds of matured bonds are equally applicable to any authorized exchange of bonds of one series for those of another.

        (a) A minor for whose estate no representative has been appointed may request reissue if the minor is of sufficient competency to sign his or her name to the request and to understand the nature of the transaction.

        (b) A bond on which a minor is named as beneficiary or coowner may be reissued in the name of a custodian for the minor under a statute authorizing gifts to minor upon the request of the adult whose name appears on the bond as owner or coowner.

        (c) A minor coowner for whose estate no representative has been appointed, may be named sole owner upon the request of the competent coowner.

        (d) Reissue to eliminate the name of a minor or incompetent for whose estate a legal representative has been appointed is permitted only if supported by evidence that a court has authorized the representative of the minor's or incompetent's estate to request the reissue. See § 353.23.

      Subpart L—Deceased Owner, Coowner or Beneficiary

        § 353.70   General rules governing entitlement.

#### § § 353.70

        The following rules govern ownership or entitlement where one or both of the persons named on a bond have died without the bond having been surrendered for payment or reissue:

        (a)  If the owner of a bond registered in single ownership form has died, the bond becomes the property of that decedent's estate, and payment or reissue will be made as provided in this subpart.

        (b) —(1)  If one of the coowners named on a bond has died, the surviving coowner will be recognized as the sole and absolute owner, and payment or reissue will be made as though the bond were registered in the name of the survivor alone. Any request for reissue by the surviving coowner must be supported by proof of death of the other coowner.

        (2)  If both coowners named on a bond have died, the bond becomes the property of the estate of the coowner who died last, and payment or reissue will be made as if the bond were registered in the name of the last deceased coowner alone. Proof of death of both coowners will be required to establish the order of death.

        (3)  If both coowners die under conditions where it cannot be established, either by presumption of law or otherwise, which coowner died first, the bond becomes the property of both equally, and payment or reissue will be made accordingly.

        (c) —(1)  If the owner of a bond registered in beneficiary form has died and is survived by the beneficiary, upon proof of death of the owner, the beneficiary will be recognized as the sole and absolute owner of the bond. Payment or reissue will be made as though the bond were registered in the survivor's name alone. A request for payment or reissue by the beneficiary must be supported by proof of death of the owner.

        (2)  If the beneficiary's death occurs before, or simultaneously with, that of the registered owner, payment or reissue will be made as though the bond were registered in the owner's name alone. Proof of death of the owner and beneficiary is required to establish the order of death.

        (d)  If the person who becomes entitled to a bond because of the death of an owner is an alien who is a resident of an area with respect to which the Department of the Treasury restricts or regulates the delivery of checks drawn against funds of the United States or its agencies or instrumentalities, delivery of the redemption check will not be made so long as the restriction applies. See Department of the Treasury Circular No. 655, current revision (31 CFR part 211).

        § 353.71   Decedent's estate.

#### § § 353.71

        (a)  (1) A legal representative of a deceased owner's estate may request payment of savings bonds to the estate, or may distribute the savings bonds to the persons entitled.

        (2) Appropriate proof of appointment for the legal representative of the estate is required. Letters of appointment must be dated not more than one year prior to the date of submission of the letters of appointment.

        (b)  If the estate has been settled previously through judicial proceedings, the persons entitled may request payment or reissue of savings bonds. A certified copy of the court-approved final accounting for the estate, the court's decree of distribution, or other appropriate evidence is required.

        (c)  If there is no formal or regular administration and no representative of the estate is to be appointed, the person appointed to receive or distribute the assets of a decedent's estate without regular administration under applicable local law summary or small estates procedures may request payment or reissue of savings bonds. Appropriate evidence is required.

        (d)  If the total redemption value of the Treasury securities and undelivered payments, if any, held directly on our records that are the property of the decedent's estate is greater than $100,000, administration of the decedent's estate will be required. The redemption value of savings bonds and the principal amount of marketable securities will be used to determine the value of securities, and will be determined as of the date of death. Administration may also be required at the discretion of the Department for any case.

        (e) —(1)  A voluntary representative is a person qualified according to paragraph (e)(3) of this section, to redeem or distribute a decedent's savings bonds. The voluntary representative procedures are for the convenience of the Department; entitlement to the decedent's savings bonds and held payments, if any, is determined by the law of the jurisdiction in which the decedent was domiciled at the date of death. Voluntary representative procedures may be used only if:

        (i) There has been no administration, no administration is contemplated, and no summary or small estate procedures under applicable local law have been used;

        (ii) The total redemption value of the Treasury securities and held payments, if any, held directly on our records that are the property of the decedent's estate is $100,000 or less as of the date of death; and

        (iii) There is a person eligible to serve as the voluntary representative according to paragraph (e)(3) of this section.

        (2)  A voluntary representative may:

        (i) Redeem the decedent's savings bonds that are eligible for redemption on behalf of the persons entitled by the law of the jurisdiction in which the decedent was domiciled at the date of death;

        (ii) Distribute the decedent's savings bonds to the persons entitled by the law of the jurisdiction in which the decedent was domiciled at the date of death.

        (3)  An individual eighteen years of age or older may act as a voluntary representative according to the following order of precedence: A surviving spouse; if there is no surviving spouse, then a child of the decedent; if there are none of the above, then a descendant of a deceased child of the decedent; if there are none of the above, then a parent of the decedent; if there are none of the above, then a brother or sister of the decedent; if there are none of the above, then a descendant of a deceased brother or sister of the decedent; if there are none of the above, then a next of kin of the decedent, as determined by the law of the jurisdiction in which the decedent was domiciled at the date of death. As used in this order of precedence, child means a natural or adopted child of the decedent.

        (4)  By serving, the voluntary representative warrants that the distribution of payments or savings bonds is to the persons entitled by the law of the jurisdiction in which the decedent was domiciled at the date of death. The United States is not liable to any person for the improper distribution of payments or securities. Upon payment or transfer of the securities at the request of the voluntary representative, the United States is released to the same extent as if it had paid or delivered to a representative of the estate appointed pursuant to the law of the jurisdiction in which the decedent was domiciled at the date of death. The voluntary representative shall indemnify and hold harmless the United States and all creditors and persons entitled to the estate of the decedent. The amount of the indemnification is limited to an amount no greater than the value received by the voluntary representative.

        (f)  If there has been no administration, no administration is contemplated, no summary or small estate procedures under applicable local law have been used, and there is no person eligible to serve as a voluntary representative pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section, then a creditor may make a claim for the amount of the debt, providing the debt has not been barred by applicable local law.

        (ii)  If a bond is registered in the name of a governing body which is empowered to act as a unit, and which holds title to the property of a religious, educational, charitable or nonprofit organization or a public corporation, the request should be signed in the name of the body by an authorized person. Ordinarily, a signed and certified request will be accepted without further evidence.

        (iii)  If a bond is registered in the name of a public or private corporation or a governmental body as fiduciary, the request must be signed by an authorized officer in the name of the organization as fiduciary.

The request for reissue should be executed by the institution and any cofiduciary.

        (3)  If the fiduciary in whose name the bond is registered has been replaced by another fiduciary, satisfactory evidence of successorship must be furnished.

        (b)  At or after final maturity, a request for payment signed by any one or more of the fiduciaries will be accepted. Payment will be made by check drawn as the bond is registered.

        § 353.76   Payment or reissue after termination of the fiduciary estate.

#### § § 353.76

        A bond registered in the name or title of a fiduciary may be paid or reissued to the person who has become entitled by reason of the termination of a fiduciary estate. Requests for reissue made by a fiduciary pursuant to the termination of a fiduciary estate should be made on the appropriate form. Requests for payment or reissue by other than the fiduciary must be accompanied by evidence to show that the person has become entitled in accordance with applicable State law or otherwise. When two or more persons have become entitled, the request for payment or reissue must be signed by each of them.

        § 353.77   Exchanges by fiduciaries.

#### § § 353.77

        Fiduciaries are authorized to request an exchange of bonds of one series for those of another, pursuant to any applicable Department of the Treasury offering. A living coowner of beneficiary named on the bonds submitted in exchange may be retained in the same capacity on the new bonds.

#### § § 353.86

        § 353.88   Payment to a State claiming title to abandoned bonds.

#### § § 353.88

        (a)  The Department of the Treasury may, in its discretion, recognize an escheat judgment that purports to vest a State with title to a definitive savings bond that has reached final maturity and is in the State's possession, when the State presents evidence satisfactory to Treasury that the bond has been abandoned by all persons entitled to payment under Treasury regulations. A State claiming title to a definitive savings bond as the heir to a deceased owner must comply with the requirements of subpart L, and not this section. Treasury will not recognize an escheat judgment that purports to vest a State with title to a bond that has not reached its final maturity. Treasury also will not recognize an escheat judgment that purports to vest a State with title to a bond that the State does not possess, or a judgment that purports to grant the State custody of a bond, but not title.

        (b)  At a minimum, a State requesting payment under this section must demonstrate to Treasury's satisfaction that it made reasonable efforts to provide actual and constructive notice of the escheat proceeding to all persons listed on the face of the bond and all persons who may have an interest in the bond, and that those persons had an opportunity to be heard before the escheat judgment was entered.

        (c)  Payment to a State claiming title under this section fulfills the United States' obligations to the same extent as if payment had been made to the registered owner.

      § 354.2   Law governing rights and obligations of Federal Reserve Banks, and Sallie Mae; rights of any Person against Federal Reserve Banks and Sallie Mae.

#### § § 354.2

      (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the following are governed solely by the book-entry regulations contained in this part 354, the Securities Documentation (to the extent not inconsistent with these regulations) and Federal Reserve Bank Operating Circulars:

      (1) The rights and obligations of Sallie Mae and the Federal Reserve Banks with respect to:

      (i) A Book-entry Sallie Mae Security or Security Entitlement; and

      (ii) The operation of the Book-entry System as it applies to Sallie Mae Securities; and

      (2) The rights of any Person, including a Participant, against Sallie Mae and the Federal Reserve Banks with respect to:

      (i) A Book-entry Sallie Mae Security or Security Entitlement; and

      (ii) The operation of the Book-entry System as it applies to Sallie Mae Securities.

      (b) A security interest in a Security Entitlement that is in favor of a Federal Reserve Bank from a Participant and that is not recorded on the books of a Federal Reserve Bank pursuant to § 354.4(c)(1), is governed by the law (not including the conflict-of-law rules) of the jurisdiction where the head office of the Federal Reserve Bank maintaining the Participant's Securities Account is located. A security interest in a Security Entitlement that is in favor of a Federal Reserve Bank from a Person that is not a Participant, and that is not recorded on the books of a Federal Reserve Bank pursuant to § 354.14(c)(1), is governed by the law determined in the manner specified in § 354.3.

      (c) If the jurisdiction specified in the first sentence of paragraph (b) of this section is a State that has not adopted Revised Article 8 (incorporated by reference, see § 354.1), then the law specified in paragraph (b) shall be the law of that State as though Revised Article 8 had been adopted by that State.

      § 354.3   Law governing other interests.

#### § § 354.3

      (a) To the extent not inconsistent with the regulations in this part, the law (not including the conflict-of-law rules) of a Securities Intermediary's jurisdiction governs:

      (1) The acquisition of a Security Entitlement from the Securities Intermediary;

      (2) The rights and duties of the Securities Intermediary and Entitlement Holder arising out of a Security Entitlement;

      (3) Whether the Securities Intermediary owes any duties to an adverse claimant to a Security Entitlement;

      (4) Whether an Adverse Claim can be asserted against a Person who acquires a Security Entitlement from the Securities Intermediary or a Person who purchases a Security Entitlement or interest therein from an Entitlement Holder; and

      (5) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c) of this section, the perfection, effect of perfection or non-perfection and priority of a security interest in a Security Entitlement.

      (b) The following rules determine a “Securities Intermediary's jurisdiction” for purposes of this section:

      (1) If an agreement between the Securities Intermediary and its Entitlement Holder specifies that it is governed by the law of a particular jurisdiction, that jurisdiction is the Securities Intermediary's jurisdiction.

      (2) If an agreement between the Securities Intermediary and its Entitlement Holder does not specify the governing law as provided in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, but expressly specifies that the securities account is maintained at an office in a particular jurisdiction, that jurisdiction is the Securities Intermediary's jurisdiction.

      (3) If an agreement between the Securities Intermediary and its Entitlement Holder does not specify a jurisdiction as provided in paragraph (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section, the Securities Intermediary's jurisdiction is the jurisdiction in which is located the office identified in an account statement as the office serving the Entitlement Holder's account.

      (4) If an agreement between the Securities Intermediary and its Entitlement Holder does not specify a jurisdiction as provided in paragraph (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section and an account statement does not identify an office serving the Entitlement Holder's account as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the Securities Intermediary's jurisdiction is the jurisdiction in which is located the chief executive office of the Securities Intermediary.

      (c) Notwithstanding the general rule in paragraph (a)(5) of this section, the law (but not the conflict-of-law rules) of the jurisdiction in which the Person creating a security interest is located governs whether and how the security interest may be perfected automatically or by filing a financing statement.

      (d) If the jurisdiction specified in paragraph (b) of this section is a State that has not adopted Revised Article 8 (incorporated by reference, see § 354.1), then the law for the matters specified in paragraph (a) of this section shall be the law of that State as though Revised Article 8 had been adopted by that State. For purposes of the application of the matters specified in paragraph (a) of this section, the Federal Reserve Bank maintaining the Participant's Securities Account is a clearing corporation, and the Participant's interest in a Book-entry Security is a Security Entitlement.

      § 354.4   Creation of Participant's Security Entitlement; security interests.

#### § § 354.4

      (a) A Participant's Security Entitlement is created when a Federal Reserve Bank indicates by book-entry that a Book-entry Sallie Mae Security has been credited to a Participant's Securities Account.

      (b) A security interest in a Security Entitlement of a Participant in favor of the United States to secure deposits of public money, including without limitation deposits to the Treasury tax and loan accounts, or other security interest in favor of the United States that is required by Federal statute, regulation, or agreement, and that is marked on the books of a Federal Reserve Bank is thereby effected and perfected, and has priority over any other interest in the securities. Where a security interest in favor of the United States in a Security Entitlement of a Participant is marked on the books of a Federal Reserve Bank, such Federal Reserve Bank may rely, and is protected in relying, exclusively on the order of an authorized representative of the United States directing the transfer of the security. For purposes of this paragraph, an “authorized representative of the United States” is the official designated in the applicable regulations or agreement to which a Federal Reserve Bank is a party, governing the security interest.

      (c)(1) Sallie Mae and the Federal Reserve Banks have no obligation to agree to act on behalf of any Person or to recognize the interest of any transferee of a security interest or other limited interest in favor of any Person except to the extent of any specific requirement of Federal law or regulation or to the extent set forth in any specific agreement with the Federal Reserve Bank on whose books the interest of the Participant is recorded. To the extent required by such law or regulation or set forth in an agreement with a Federal Reserve Bank, or the Federal Reserve Bank Operating Circular, a security interest in a Security Entitlement that is in favor of a Federal Reserve Bank, Sallie Mae, or a Person may be created and perfected by a Federal Reserve Bank marking its books to record the security interest. Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, a security interest in a Security Entitlement marked on the books of a Federal Reserve Bank shall have priority over any other interest in the securities.

      (2) In addition to the method provided in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, a security interest, including a security interest in favor of a Federal Reserve Bank, may be perfected by any method by which a security interest may be perfected under applicable law as described in § 354.2(b) or § 354.3. The perfection, effect of perfection or non-perfection and priority of a security interest are governed by such applicable law. A security interest in favor of a Federal Reserve Bank shall be treated as a security interest in favor of a clearing corporation in all respects under such law, including with respect to the effect of perfection and priority of such security interest. A Federal Reserve Bank Operating Circular shall be treated as a rule adopted by a clearing corporation for such purposes.

      § 354.5   Obligations of Sallie Mae; no adverse claims.

#### § § 354.5

      (a) Except in the case of a security interest in favor of the United States or a Federal Reserve Bank or otherwise as provided in § 354.4(c)(1), for the purposes of this part 354, Sallie Mae and the Federal Reserve Banks shall treat the Participant to whose Securities Account an interest in a Book-entry Sallie Mae Security has been credited as the person exclusively entitled to issue a Transfer Message, to receive interest and other payments with respect thereof and otherwise to exercise all the rights and powers with respect to such Security, notwithstanding any information or notice to the contrary. Neither the Federal Reserve Banks nor Sallie Mae is liable to a Person asserting or having an Adverse Claim to a Security Entitlement or to a Book-entry Sallie Mae Security in a Participant's Securities Account, including any such claim arising as a result of the transfer or disposition of a Book-entry Sallie Mae Security by a Federal Reserve Bank pursuant to a Transfer Message that the Federal Reserve Bank reasonably believes to be genuine.

      (b) The obligation of Sallie Mae to make payments of interest and principal with respect to Book-entry Sallie Mae Securities is discharged at the time payment in the appropriate amount is made as follows:

      (1) Interest on Book-entry Sallie Mae Securities is either credited by a Federal Reserve Bank to a Funds Account maintained at such Bank or otherwise paid as directed by the Participant.

      (2) Book-entry Sallie Mae Securities are redeemed at maturity or pursuant to a call for redemption in accordance with their terms by a Federal Reserve Bank withdrawing the securities from the Participant's Securities Account in which they are maintained and by either crediting the amount of the redemption proceeds, including both principal and interest where applicable, to a Funds Account at such Bank or otherwise paying such principal and interest, as directed by the Participant.

      § 354.6   Authority of Federal Reserve Banks.

#### § § 354.6

      (a) Each Federal Reserve Bank is hereby authorized as fiscal agent of Sallie Mae to perform functions with respect to the issuance of Book-entry Sallie Mae Securities offered and sold by Sallie Mae, in accordance with the Securities Documentation, and Federal Reserve Bank Operating Circulars; to service and maintain Book-entry Sallie Mae Securities in accounts established for such purposes; to make payments of principal and interest with respect to such Book-entry Sallie Mae Securities as directed by Sallie Mae; to effect transfer of Book-entry Sallie Mae Securities between Participants' Securities Account as directed by the Participants; to effect conversions between Book-entry Sallie Mae securities and Definitive Sallie Mae Securities with respect to those securities as to which conversion rights are available pursuant to the applicable Securities Documentation; and to perform such other duties as fiscal agent as may be requested by Sallie Mae.

      (b) Each Federal Reserve Bank may issue Operating Circulars not inconsistent with this part, governing the details of its handling of Book-entry Sallie Mae Securities, Security Entitlements, and the operation of the Book-entry System under this part.

      § 354.7   Withdrawal of eligible Book-entry Sallie Mae Securities for conversion to definitive form.

#### § § 354.7

      (a) Eligible Book-entry Sallie Mae Securities may be withdrawn from the Book-entry System by requesting delivery of like Definitive Sallie Mae Securities.

      (b) A Federal Reserve Bank shall, upon receipt of appropriate instructions to withdraw Eligible Book-entry Sallie Mae Securities from book-entry in the Book-entry System, convert such securities into Definitive Sallie Mae Securities and deliver them in accordance with such instructions. No such conversion shall affect existing interests in such Sallie Mae Securities.

      (c) All requests for withdrawal of Eligible Book-entry Sallie Mae Securities must be made prior to the maturity or date of call of such securities.

      (d) Sallie Mae Securities which are to be delivered upon withdrawal may be issued in either registered or bearer form, to the extent permitted by the applicable Securities Documentation.

      § 354.8   Waiver of regulations.

#### § § 354.8

      The Secretary reserves the right, in the Secretary's discretion, to waive any provision(s) of the regulations in this part in any case or class of cases for the convenience of Sallie Mae, or in order to relieve any person or entity of unnecessary hardship, if such action is not inconsistent with law, does not adversely affect substantial existing rights, and the Secretary is satisfied that such action will not subject Sallie Mae to any substantial expense or liability.

      § 354.9   Liability of Sallie Mae and Federal Reserve Banks.

#### § § 354.9

      Sallie Mae and the Federal Reserve Banks may rely on the information provided in a Transfer Message, and are not required to verify the information. Sallie Mae and the Federal Reserve Banks shall not be liable for any action taken in accordance with the information set out in a Transfer Message or evidence submitted in support thereof.

      § 354.10   Additional provisions.

#### § § 354.10

      (a)  In any case or any class of cases arising under these regulations, Sallie Mae may require such additional evidence and a bond of indemnity, with or without surety, as may in the judgment of Sallie Mae be necessary for the protection of the interests of Sallie Mae.

      (b)  The interest of a debtor in a Security Entitlement may be reached by a creditor only by legal process upon the Securities Intermediary with whom the debtor's securities account is maintained, except where a Security Entitlement is maintained in the name of a secured party, in which case the debtor's interest may be reached by legal process upon the secured party. The regulations in this part do not purport to establish whether a Federal Reserve Bank is required to honor an order or other notice of attachment in any particular case or class of cases.

### Part 355

**Authority:** Authority: 12 U.S.C. 391; 31 U.S.C. Ch. 31.

**Source:** Source: 65 FR 65700, Nov. 1, 2000, unless otherwise noted.

      § 355.0   What does this part cover?

#### § § 355.0

      This part governs checks issued for payments in connection with United States securities. These checks, referred to as “fiscal agency checks,” are issued by a designated Federal Reserve Bank in its capacity as fiscal agent of the United States. The checks are drawn on the payor Federal Reserve Bank in its banking capacity. The drawer of a fiscal agency check is the United States, and the drawee is a Federal Reserve Bank. The rights and liabilities of the United States, the Federal Reserve Banks, and others are set out in this part.

      § 355.1   Do any other regulations cover fiscal agency checks?

#### § § 355.1

      The regulations governing checks drawn on the United States and on designated depositories of the United States do not apply to fiscal agency checks, unless a statute specifically provides differently, or unless we state differently in this part. If a definition or matter pertaining to fiscal agency checks is not specifically covered in this part, we will apply the provisions of Regulations J of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, at 12 CFR part 210. To the extent not otherwise covered by this part or by Regulation J, we will apply the provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code (U.C.C.)

      § 355.2   What special terms do I need to know to understand this part?

#### § § 355.2

      means:

      (1) Any insured bank, mutual savings bank or savings bank as defined in 12 U.S.C. 1813, or any institution eligible to become an insured bank under 12 U.S.C. 1815;

      (2) Any insured credit union as defined in 12 U.S.C. 1752, or any credit union eligible to become an insured credit union under 12 U.S.C. 1781;

      (3) Any member as defined in 12 U.S.C. 1422; and

      (4) Any savings association as defined in 12 U.S.C. that is an insured depository institution as defined in the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, 12 U.S.C. 1811  or is eligible to become an insured depository institution under that Act.

      means a check for a payment in connection with a United States security drawn upon a Reserve Bank and issued on our behalf by the Reserve Bank in its capacity as fiscal agent of the United States.

      means the person or persons to whom a fiscal agency check is made payable.

      means the Reserve Bank on which a fiscal agency check is drawn.

      means a depository institution that sends a fiscal agency check directly to a Reserve Bank for payment or collection.

      means any Federal Reserve Bank or any branch of a Federal Reserve Bank.

      for the purpose of this part, means a direct obligation of the United States, including a Treasury bill, note, bond or savings bond/note.

      refers to the Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary's delegates at the Treasury Department and the Bureau of the Fiscal Service. The term also extends to any fiscal or financial agency acting on behalf of the United States when designated to act by the Secretary or the Secretary's delegates. The term does not refer to a United States Savings Bond issuing or paying agent.

      § 355.3   Where can I cash my fiscal agency check?

#### § § 355.3

      Presentment of a fiscal agency check must be made to the payor Reserve Bank. The payor Reserve Bank will only cash a fiscal agency check presented by the payee who can be identified to the satisfaction of the Reserve Bank. Otherwise, a fiscal agency check must be presented through banking channels. A refusal to accept or to pay fiscal agency check presented by a person other than the payee, or by a payee who is not reasonably identified, does not constitute dishonor.

      § 355.4   Is there a time limit on cashing a fiscal agency check?

#### § § 355.4

      A payor Reserve Bank may refuse to pay a fiscal agency check presented more than six (6) months after the issue date of the check. If the check is not presented within this time, you must follow the procedures in § 355.10.

      § 355.5   What warranties does a presenting bank make?

#### § § 355.5

      (a) A presenting bank makes the warranties required of a sender under subpart A of regulation J (12 CFR part 210). This paragraph does not limit any warranty by a presenter or other party arising under State law.

      (b) We are not barred from recovering on a breach of warranty solely because:

      (1) Our negligence contributed to a fraudulent endorsement or material alteration;

      (2) We did not promptly discover an unauthorized signature or alteration;

      (3) An impostor fraudulently caused the issuance of a fiscal agency check in the name of any existing payee; or

      (4) Our employee fraudulently caused the issuance of a fiscal agency check in the name of any existing payee.

      § 355.6   What happens if the presenting bank breaches its warranty?

#### § § 355.6

      If the presenting bank breaches its warranty, the payor Reserve Bank may either return the check to the presenting bank or send notice of the breach to the presenting bank. If the presenting bank does not make prompt restitution when it receives the returned check or notice of breach, we may begin appropriate collection procedures.

      § 355.7   What notice should I give if I do not receive my check or if a check is lost, stolen, or destroyed?

#### § § 355.7

      If a fiscal agency check is not received within a reasonable time after a payment is due, or if a check is lost, stolen, or destroyed, you must provide prompt written notification. Your written notice may be sent to us or to the payor Reserve Bank. You may give notice by telephone, but we will not issue a replacement check until you confirm the notice in writing. The written notice must provide enough information for us to identify the account and the security to which the payment relates. We will stop payment on the fiscal agency check if we have a reasonable time to act before final payment.

      § 355.8   How can I get a replacement fiscal agency check?

#### § § 355.8

      The payor Federal Reserve Bank will issue a replacement fiscal agency check if:

      (a) You submit written notice:

      (b) The check is unpaid;

      (c) We determine that recovery of the original check is unlikely; and

      (d) The payee and endorsee, if any, of the check execute the required indemnification agreement.

      § 355.9   What should I do if I recover a check reported as lost, stolen, destroyed, or not received?

#### § § 355.9

      If you recover the original check you must notify us in writing. If we have not yet issued a replacement check, we will remove the stop payment order against the original check. If we have already issued a replacement check, you must return the original check to us.

      § 355.10   What happens if I present my check to the payor Reserve Bank more than six months after the issue date of the check?

#### § § 355.10

      If the payor Reserve Bank refuses payment on a fiscal agency check solely because it is presented more than six (6) months after the issue date of the check, a replacement check will be issued if you:

      (a) Surrender the original check; and

      (b) Executive the required indemnification agreement.

      § 355.11   What should I do if the endorsement on my check is forged or unauthorized?

#### § § 355.11

      If we verify the existence or a forged or unauthorized endorsement on a paid fiscal agency check, the payor Reserve Bank will issue a replacement check to the person entitled. The payee or endorsee must execute an affidavit that there has been a forged or unauthorized endorsement. We may also require an indemnification agreement.

      § 355.12   What requirements apply if the check is payable to two or more persons?

#### § § 355.12

      If the fiscal agency check is payable to two or more persons, the requirements of this part apply to all designated payees.

      § 355.13   Are there any additional requirements related to fiscal agency checks?

#### § § 355.13

      We may require an indemnification agreement, with or without surety. You must provide any additional evidence we consider necessary. We will require any information necessary for the protection of the interests of the United States.

      § 355.14   Can these regulations be waived?

#### § § 355.14

      We reserve the right, in our discretion, to waive any provision of the regulations in this part in any case or class of cases for the convenience of the United States, or to relieve any person of unnecessary hardship, if the waiver is not inconsistent with law and will not subject the United States to substantial expense or liability.

      § 355.15   Can these regulations be amended?

#### § § 355.15

      We may, at any time, supplement, amend, or revise the regulations in this part.

      Subpart A—General Information

        § 356.0   What authority does the Treasury have to sell and issue securities?

#### § § 356.0

        Chapter 31 of Title 31 of the United States Code authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to issue United States obligations, and to offer them for sale with the terms and conditions that the Secretary prescribes.

        § 356.1   To which securities does this circular apply?

#### § § 356.1

        The provisions in this part, including the appendices, and each individual auction announcement govern the sale and issuance of marketable Treasury securities issued on or after March 1, 1993. This part also governs all securities eligible for the STRIPS (Separate Trading of Registered Interest and Principal of Securities) Program (See § 356.31.). In addition, these provisions and the auction announcements govern any other types of securities we may issue under this part.

        § 356.2   What definitions do I need to know to understand this part?

#### § § 356.2

        means a Treasury bill where the security description is “13-Week Bill” as referenced on the Treasury auction announcement.

        means an amount that bidders must pay to us for interest income as part of the settlement amount. _Accrued interest_ compensates us up front for interest that bidders will be paid but did not earn because it is attributable to a period of time prior to the issue date. (See appendix B, section I, paragraph D of this part for additional explanation and examples.)

        means, for an interest component stripped from an inflation-protected security, an amount derived by:

        (1) Multiplying the semiannual interest rate by the par amount, and then

        (2) Multiplying this value by: 100 divided by the Reference CPI of the original issue date (or dated date, when the dated date is different from the original issue date). (See appendix B, section V of this part for an example of how to calculate the adjusted value.)

        means a bidding process by which we sell marketable Treasury securities to the public.

        means an agreement in a format acceptable to Treasury between a submitter or clearing corporation and a depository institution that authorizes us to:

        (1) Deliver awarded securities to the book-entry securities account of a designated depository institution in the commercial book-entry system, and

        (2) Charge a funds account of a designated depository institution for the settlement amount of the securities.

        means an offer to purchase a stated par amount of securities, either competitively or noncompetitively, in an auction.

        means the total par amount of securities bid for in an auction divided by the total par amount of securities awarded. It excludes bids by, and awards to, the Federal Reserve for its own account.

        as further defined in appendix A, means a person or an entity that offers to purchase Treasury securities in an auction either directly or through a depository institution or dealer. We may consider two or more persons or entities to be one bidder based on their relationship or their actions in participating in an auction. We consider a controlled account to be a bidder when an investment adviser bids in the name of the controlled account (See § 356.15.).

        means a number we assign to each institutional submitter and to certain other bidders. We assign such numbers either to identify certain bidders or to grant separate bidder status to different parts of the same corporate or partnership structure.

        means a security that is issued or maintained as an accounting entry or electronic record. ( § 356.4.)

        means any day on which the Federal Reserve Banks are open for business.

        means the redemption of a security prior to maturity under the terms specified in its auction announcement.

        means a one-day non-interest-bearing security that may be held in TreasuryDirect and that automatically matures and is rolled over each day until its owner requests that it be redeemed.

        means a clearing agency as defined in section 3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(23)). A clearing corporation must be registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission under section 17A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and its rules.

        means a bid to purchase a stated par amount of securities at a specified yield, discount rate, or discount margin.

        (CPI) means the monthly non-seasonally adjusted U.S. City Average All Items _Consumer Price Index_ for All Urban Consumers, published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the Department of Labor. We use the CPI as the basis for adjusting the principal amounts of inflation-protected securities. (See appendix D.)

        means the principal component of a security that has been stripped of its interest components.

        means the unique identifying number assigned to each separate security issue and each separate STRIPS component. _CUSIP number_s are provided by the CUSIP Service Bureau of Standard & Poor's Corporation. CUSIP is an acronym for Committee on Uniform Securities Identification Procedures.

        means a bidder that directs a depository institution or dealer to submit or forward a bid for a specific amount of securities in a specific auction on the bidder's behalf. Only depository institutions and dealers may submit bids for customers directly to us, or forward them to another depository institution or dealer.

        means the date from which interest accrues for notes and bonds. The dated date and issue date are usually the same. In those cases where interest begins accruing prior to the issue date, however, the dated date will be prior to the issue date.

        means:

        (1) An entity described in Section 19(b)(1)(A), excluding subparagraph (vii), of the Federal Reserve Act (12 U.S.C. 461(b)(1)(A)).

        means the discount divided by 100 and multiplied by the par amount. (See appendix B for formulas and examples.)

        means the margin over the index that equates the present values of the assumed cash flows on a floating rate note to the sum of the price of and accrued interest on the floating rate note. The assumed cash flows are calculated based upon the index rate applicable to the dated date. Bidders in floating rate note auctions bid on the basis of discount margin. (See appendix B.)

        means a rate of return, on an annual basis, on bills held until they mature. The discount rate is expressed in percentage terms and based on a 360-day year. It is also referred to as the “bank discount rate.” (See appendix B for formulas and examples.)

        means a cash account maintained by a depository institution at a Federal Reserve Bank.

( appendix B for methods and examples for computing the index rate.)

        means, for an inflation-protected security, the Reference CPI of a particular date divided by the Reference CPI of the original issue date. (When the dated date is different from the original issue date, the denominator of the index ratio is the Reference CPI of the dated date rather than that of the original issue date.)

        means, for an inflation-protected security, the value of the security derived by multiplying the par amount by the applicable index ratio as described in appendix B, section I, paragraph B.

        means the annual percentage rate of interest paid on the par amount (or the inflation-adjusted principal) of a specific issue of notes or bonds. (See appendix B for methods and examples of interest calculations on notes and bonds.)

        means an auction in which each successful competitive bidder pays the price equivalent to the yield, discount rate, or discount margin that it bid.

        means, for a single-price auction, a bid to purchase a stated par amount of securities at the highest yield, discount rate, or discount margin awarded to competitive bidders. For a multiple-price auction, a noncompetitive bid means a bid to purchase securities at the weighted average yield, discount rate, or discount margin of awards to competitive bidders.

        means the par amount of securities we are offering to the public for purchase in an auction, as specified in the auction announcement.

        means the stated value of a security at original issuance.

        means a natural person.

        means the difference between par and the price of the security, when the price is greater than par.

        means the price of a security per 100 dollars of its stated value as calculated using the formulas in appendix B.

        means, for an inflation-protected security, the yield based on the payment stream in constant dollars. In other words, the real yield is the yield in the absence of inflation.

        (Ref CPI) means, for an inflation-protected security, the index number applicable to a given date. (See appendix B, section I, paragraph B.)

        means the auction of an additional amount of an outstanding security.

        means a Treasury bill, note, or bond, each as described in this part. _Security_ also means any other obligation we issue that is subject to this part according to its auction announcement. Security includes an interest or principal component under the STRIPS program, as well as a certificate of indebtedness.

        means final and complete payment for securities awarded in an auction and delivery of those securities.

        means the total of the par amount of securities awarded, less any discount amount or plus any premium amount, and plus any accrued interest. For inflation-protected securities, the settlement amount also includes any inflation adjustment when such securities are reopened or when the dated date is different from the issue date.

        means an auction in which all successful bidders pay the same price regardless of the yields, discount rates, or discount margins they each bid.

        means the fixed amount over the life of a floating rate note that is added to the index rate in order to determine the interest rate of the floating rate note. The spread will be determined in the auction of a new floating rate note and is expressed in tenths of a basis point (, to three decimals). Additionally, the spread will be equal to the high discount margin at the time a new floating rate note is auctioned.

        (Separate Trading of Registered Interest and Principal of Securities) means our program under which eligible securities are authorized to be separated into principal and interest components, and transferred separately. These components are maintained and transferred in the commercial book-entry system.

        means a person or entity submitting bids directly to us for its own account, for customer accounts, or both. Only depository institutions and dealers are permitted to submit bids for customer accounts. We permit investment advisers to submit bids on behalf of controlled accounts.

        means an interest component from a stripped security.

        (or “us”) means the Secretary of the Treasury and his or her delegates, including the Department of the Treasury, Bureau of the Fiscal Service, and their representatives. The term also includes Federal Reserve Banks acting as fiscal agents of the United States.

        means the average of the yields, discount rates, or discount margins at which we award securities to competitive bidders in multiple-price auctions weighted by the par amount of securities allotted at each yield, discount rate, or discount margin.

        means the annualized rate of return to maturity on a non-indexed security. _Yield_ is expressed as a percentage. For an inflation-protected security, yield means the real yield. Yield is also referred to as “yield to maturity.” (See appendix B.)

        means a prospective bidder in an auction.

        § 356.3   What is the role of the Federal Reserve Banks in this process?

#### § § 356.3

        The Treasury Department authorizes Federal Reserve Banks, as fiscal agents of the United States, to perform all activities necessary to carry out the provisions of this part, any auction announcements, and applicable regulations.

        § 356.4   What are the book-entry systems in which auctioned Treasury securities may be issued or maintained?

#### § § 356.4

        We issue marketable Treasury securities into the commercial book-entry system and into accounts maintained directly on the records of the Department of the Treasury (“securities held directly with Treasury”).

        (a)  When depository institutions or dealers submit bids for Treasury securities in an auction, securities awarded as a result of those bids are generally held in the commercial book-entry system. Specifically, we maintain book-entry accounts in the National Book-Entry System ® (“NBES”) for Federal Reserve Banks, depository institutions, and other authorized entities, such as government and international agencies and foreign central banks. In their accounts, depository institutions maintain securities held for their own account and for the accounts of others. The accounts held for others include those of other depository institutions and dealers, which may, in turn, maintain accounts for others.

        (b)  Account holders maintain accounts in a book-entry system directly on the records of the Department of the Treasury. Securities held directly with Treasury are subject to the terms and conditions in this part, the auction announcement, and the regulations governing the system in which the securities are held. ( subtitle B, chapter II of this title.)

        § 356.5   What types of securities does the Treasury auction?

#### § § 356.5

        We offer securities under this part exclusively in book-entry form and as direct obligations of the United States issued under Chapter 31 of Title 31 of the United States Code.

      Subpart B—Bidding, Certifications, and Payment

        § 356.10   What is the purpose of an auction announcement?

#### § § 356.10

        By issuing an auction announcement, we provide public notice of the sale of bills, notes, and bonds. The auction announcement lists the specifics of each auction, e.g., offering amount, term and type of security, CUSIP number, and issue and maturity dates. The auction announcement and this part, including the Appendices, specify the terms and conditions of sale. If anything in the auction announcement differs from this part, the auction announcement will control. If you intend to bid, you should read the applicable auction announcement along with this part.

        § 356.11   How are bids submitted in an auction?

#### § § 356.11

        (a)  (1) All bids must be submitted using an approved method, which depends on the system into which the awarded securities will be issued. ( § 356.4.)  The approved submission methods for these respective systems are explained in this section. A bidder must provide its assigned bidder identification numbers if it has been assigned one. We have the option of accepting or rejecting incomplete bids.

        (2) We must receive competitive and noncompetitive bids prior to their respective closing times, which are stated in the auction announcement. We will not include late bids in the auction. For bids other than those submitted on paper forms, our computer time stamp will establish the receipt time. You are bound by your bids after the closing time.

        (3) We are not responsible for any delays, errors, or omissions. We are not responsible for any failures or disruptions of equipment or communications facilities used for participating in Treasury auctions.

        (4) Submitters are responsible for bids submitted using computer equipment on their premises, whether or not such bids are authorized.

        (b)  (1) If you are a submitter and the awarded securities are to be issued in the commercial book-entry system, you must submit bids using one of our approved electronic methods except for contingency situations.

        (2) You must have an agreement on file with us under which you agree to our terms and conditions for access to our system for participating in our auctions.

        (3) In contingency situations, such as a power outage, we may accept bids by a telephone call to designated Treasury employees if you submit them prior to the relevant bidding deadline.

        (c)  You must submit your bids in accordance with the regulations governing the system in which the security will be held. You may reinvest the proceeds of a maturing security held directly with Treasury as permitted by the system in which it is held.

> [69 FR 45202, July 28, 2004, as amended at 70 FR 57440, Sept. 30, 2005; 87 FR 40439, July 7, 2022]

        § 356.12   What are the different types of bids and do they have specific requirements or restrictions?

#### § § 356.12

        (a)  All bids must state the par amount of securities bid for and must equal or exceed the minimum to bid amount stated in the auction announcement. Bids in larger amounts must be in the multiple stated in the auction announcement.

        (b) —(1)  You may not bid noncompetitively for more than $10 million. The maximum bid limitation does not apply if you are bidding solely through a request to reinvest the proceeds of a maturing security held directly with Treasury, which is a noncompetitive bid.

        (2)  You may not bid noncompetitively in an auction in which you are bidding competitively. You may not bid noncompetitively if, in the security being auctioned, you hold a position in when-issued trading or in futures or forward contracts at any time between the date of the auction announcement and the time we announce the auction results. During this same timeframe, a noncompetitive bidder may not enter into any agreement to purchase or sell or otherwise dispose of the securities it is acquiring in the auction. For this paragraph, futures contracts include those:

        (i) That require delivery of the specific security being auctioned;

        (ii) For which the security being auctioned is one of several securities that may be delivered; or

        (iii) That are cash-settled.

        (c) —(1) —(i)  A competitive bid must show the discount rate bid, expressed with three decimals in .005 increments. The third decimal must be either a zero or a five, for example, 5.320 or 5.325. We will treat any missing decimals as zero, for example, a bid of 5.32 will be treated as 5.320. The rate bid may be a positive number or zero.

        (ii)  A competitive bid must show the yield bid, expressed with three decimals, for example, 4.170. We will treat any missing decimals as zero, for example, a bid of 4.1 will be treated as 4.100. The yield bid may be a positive number or zero.

        (iii)  A competitive bid must show the real yield bid, expressed with three decimals, for example, 3.070. We will treat any missing decimals as zero, for example, a bid of 3 will be treated as 3.000. The real yield may be a positive number, a negative number, or zero.

        (iv)  A competitive bid must show the discount margin bid, expressed as a percentage with three decimals, for example, 0.290 percent. We will treat any missing decimals as zero, for example, a bid of 0.29 will be treated as 0.290. The discount margin bid may be positive, negative, or zero.

        (2)  There is no limit on the maximum dollar amount that you may bid for competitively, either at a single yield, discount rate, or discount margin, or at different yields, discount rates, or discount margins. However, a competitive bid at a single yield, discount rate, or discount margin that exceeds 35 percent of the offering amount will be reduced to that amount. For example, if the offering amount is $10 billion, the maximum bid amount we will recognize at any one yield, discount rate, or discount margin from any bidder is $3.5 billion. (See § 356.22 for award limitations.)

        (3)  You may not bid competitively in an auction in which you are bidding noncompetitively. You may not bid competitively for securities to be held directly with Treasury.

        § 356.13   When must I report my net long position and how do I calculate it?

#### § § 356.13

        (a)  (1) If you are bidding competitively in an auction, you must report your net long position when the total of your bids plus your net long position in the security being auctioned equals or exceeds the net long position reporting threshold ( table.). We will specify this threshold in the auction announcement for each security (_See_ § 356.10.). The threshold is typically 35 percent of the offering amount, but we may state a different threshold in the auction announcement. To see whether you must report your net long position, follow this table:

        (2) Also, if you have more than one bid in an auction and you must report either your net long position or a zero, you must report that figure only once. Finally, if you are a customer and must report either your net long position or a zero, you must report that figure through only one depository institution or dealer. (See § 356.14(d).)

        (b)  You must calculate your net long position as of one half-hour prior to the closing time for receipt of competitive bids.

        (c)  Except as modified in paragragh (d) of this section, your net long position is the sum total of the par amounts of:

        (1) Your holdings of outstanding securities with the same CUSIP number as the security being auctioned;

        (2) Your holdings of STRIPS principal components of the security being auctioned, and;

        (3) Your positions, in the security being auctioned, in:

        (i) When-issued trading, including when-issued trading positions of the STRIPS principal components;

        (ii) Futures contracts that require delivery of the specific security being auctioned (but not futures contracts for which the security being auctioned is one of several securities that may be delivered, and not futures contracts that are cash-settled); and

        (iii) Forward contracts that require delivery of the specific security being auctioned or of the STRIPS principal component of that security.

        (d)  In a reopening (additional issue) of an outstanding security, you may subtract the exclusion amount stated in the auction announcement from:

        (1) Your holdings of the outstanding securities (paragraph (c)(1) of this section) combined with

        (2) Your holdings of STRIPS principal components of the security being auctioned (paragraph (c)(2) of this section). We will specify the amount of holdings that you may exclude from the net long position calculation in the auction announcement. You may not take the exclusion if your combined holdings are zero or less. The exclusion is optional, but if you take the exclusion, you must include any holdings that exceed the exclusion amount in calculating your net long position. If the exclusion amount is greater than your combined holdings (paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section), you may calculate the combined holdings as zero, but they cannot be included in the calculation as a negative number.

        § 356.14   What are the requirements for submitting bids for customers?

#### § § 356.14

        (a)  Only depository institutions or dealers may submit bids for customers ( definitions at § 356.2), or for customers of intermediaries, under the requirements set out in this section. If a bid fulfills a guarantee to sell to a customer a specified amount of securities at the price determined in the auction, then the bid is a bid of that customer.

        (b)  Submitters must remit payment for bids they submit on behalf of customers, including customers of intermediaries, that result in awards of securities in the auction.

        (c)  Submitters must provide the names of customers whenever they submit bids for them. Submitters must provide the names of their direct customers as well as customers of any intermediaries who are forwarding customer bids. For individuals, submitters must provide the customer's full name (first and last). For institutional customers, submitters must provide the name of the institution, and the bidder identification number if the customer provides it. For trusts or other fiduciary estates (See appendix A.), submitters must provide on the customer list:

        (1) The full name or title of the trustee or fiduciary;

        (2) A reference to the document creating the trust or fiduciary estate with date of execution; and

        (3) The employer identification number (not social security number) of the trust or fiduciary estate. We do not consider trusts to be a separate bidder that have not been assigned, or that do not provide, an employer identification number.

        (d)  For each customer competitive bid, the submitter must provide the customer's name, the amount bid, and the yield, discount rate, or discount margin. The submitter or intermediary must also report the net long position amount if the customer provides it. The submitter must inform a customer of the net long position reporting requirement (See § 356.13.) if the customer is bidding for $100 million or more of securities. If the submitter's or intermediary's personnel know that the customer's position information is not correct, the submitter or intermediary may not submit the customer's bid.

        (e)  For each noncompetitive bid, the submitter must provide the customer's name and the amount bid. Submitters may either provide the customer's name with the bid or, if the list of customers is lengthy, the submitter may provide a summary bid amount covering all noncompetitive customers. If it provides a summary bid amount, the submitter must transmit the list of individual customers and their bid amounts by close of business on the auction day. However, the submitter must be able to provide the customer list details by the noncompetitive bidding deadline if requested.

        § 356.15   What rules apply to bids submitted by investment advisers?

#### § § 356.15

        (a)  The auction rules that apply to investment advisers are determined by the relationship between “investment advisers” and “controlled accounts.” An investment adviser means any person or entity that has investment discretion for the bids or positions of a different person or entity (a controlled account). A person or entity has investment discretion if it determines what, how many, and when securities will be purchased or sold on behalf of another person or entity. We consider a person that is employed or supervised by an investment adviser to be part of that investment adviser. We also consider the bids or positions of controlled accounts to be separate from the bids or positions of the person or entity with which they would otherwise be associated under the bidder categories in appendix A of this part.

        (b)  (1) An investment adviser has two options for whose name to use when bidding on behalf of controlled accounts.

        (2) Using the first option (paragraph (b)(1)(i)), an investment advisor could bid noncompetitively up to the noncompetitive bidding limit only for itself, as a single bidder. Using the second option (paragraph (b)(1)(ii)), an investment adviser could bid noncompetitively for each separately named controlled account up to the noncompetitive bidding limit. The investment adviser could also bid noncompetitively in its own name in the same auction up to the noncompetitive bidding limit. An investment adviser may not bid for a controlled account both noncompetitively and competitively in the same auction. If an investment adviser is bidding competitively in the name of a controlled account, the controlled account is subject to the award limitations of § 356.22(b).

        (c)  If it is bidding competitively, an investment adviser must calculate the amount of its bids and positions for purposes of the net long position reporting requirement found in § 356.13(a). In addition to its own competitive bids and positions, the investment adviser must also include in the calculation all other competitive bids and positions that it controls. If the net long position is reportable, the investment adviser must report it as a total in connection with only one bid as stated in § 356.13(a). This requirement applies regardless of whether the investment adviser bids in its own name or in the name of its controlled accounts. The following table shows which positions an investment adviser must include to determine whether it meets the net long position reporting threshold in § 356.13(a). If an investment adviser does meet the reporting threshold, the table also shows which positions must be included in, and which may be excluded from, the net long position calculation.

        (d)  When an investment adviser bids for a controlled account, we deem the investment adviser to have certified that it is complying with this part and the auction announcement for the security. Further, we deem the investment adviser to have certified that the information it provided about bids for controlled accounts is accurate and complete.

        (e)  Investment advisers that submit competitive bids in the names of controlled accounts are responsible for prorating any awards at the highest accepted yield, discount rate, or discount margin using the same percentage that we announce.See § 356.21 for examples of how to prorate.

> [69 FR 45202, July 28, 2004, as amended at 78 FR 46429, July 31, 2013]

        § 356.16   Do I have to make any certifications?

#### § § 356.16

        § 356.17   How and when do I pay for securities awarded in an auction?

#### § § 356.17

        (a)  By bidding in an auction, you agree to pay the settlement amount for any securities awarded to you. (See § 356.25.) For notes and bonds, the settlement amount may include a premium amount, accrued interest, and, for inflation-protected securities, an inflation adjustment.

        (b)  You must pay for your awarded securities by a debit entry to a deposit account that you are authorized to debit or by using the redemption proceeds of your certificate of indebtedness. Payment by debit entry occurs on the settlement date for the actual settlement amount due. ( § 356.25.)

        (c)  Unless you make other provisions, payment of the settlement amount must be by charge to the funds account of a depository institution at a Federal Reserve Bank.

        (1) A submitter that does not have a funds account at a Federal Reserve Bank or that chooses not to pay by charge to its own funds account must have an approved autocharge agreement on file with us before submitting any bids. Any depository institution whose funds account will be charged under an autocharge agreement will receive advance notice from us of the total par amount of, and price to be charged for, securities awarded as a result of the submitter's bids.

        (2) A submitter that is a member of a clearing corporation may instruct that delivery and payment be made through the clearing corporation for securities awarded to the submitter for its own account. To do this, the following requirements must be met prior to submitting any bids:

        (i) We must have acknowledged and have on file an autocharge agreement between the clearing corporation and a depository institution. By entering into such an agreement, the clearing corporation authorizes us to provide aggregate par and price information to the depository institution whose funds account will be charged under the agreement. The clearing corporation is responsible for remitting payment for auction awards of the clearing corporation member.

        (ii) We must have acknowledged and have on file a delivery and payment agreement between the submitter and the clearing corporation. By entering into such an agreement, the submitter authorizes us to provide award and payment information to the clearing corporation.

      Subpart C—Determination of Auction Awards; Settlement

        § 356.20   How does the Treasury determine auction awards?

#### § § 356.20

        (a) —(1)  First we accept in full all non-competitive bids that were submitted by the noncompetitive bidding deadline. After the closing time for receipt of competitive bids we start accepting those at the lowest yields, discount rates, or discount margins, through successively higher yields, discount rates, or discount margins, up to the amount required to meet the offering amount. When necessary, we prorate bids at the highest accepted yield, discount rate, or discount margin as described below. If the amount of noncompetitive bids would absorb all or most of the offering amount, we will accept competitive bids in an amount sufficient to provide a fair determination of the yield, discount rate, or discount margin for the securities we are auctioning.

        (2)  Generally, the total amount of bids at the highest accepted yield, discount rate, or discount margin exceeds the offering amount remaining after we accept the noncompetitive bids and the competitive bids at the lower yields, discount rates, or discount margins. In order to keep the total amount of awards as close as possible to the announced offering amount, we award a percentage of the bids at the highest accepted yield, discount rate, or discount margin. We derive the percentage by dividing the remaining par amount needed to fill the offering amount by the par amount of the bids at the high yield, discount rate, or discount margin and rounding up to the next hundredth of a whole percentage point, for example, 17.13%.

        (b)  If a Treasury non-indexed or inflation-protected note or bond auction results in a yield lower than 0.125 percent, the interest rate will be set at   of one percent, and successful bidders' award prices will be calculated accordingly. ( appendix B to this part for formulas.)

        (1)  The interest rate we establish produces the price closest to, but not above, par when evaluated at the yield of awards to successful competitive bidders.

        (2)  The interest rate we establish produces the price closest to, but not above, par when evaluated at the weighted-average yield of awards to successful competitive bidders.

        (c)  The interest rate will be the spread plus the index rate (as it may be adjusted on the calendar day following each auction of 13-week bills) subject to a minimum daily interest accrual rate of zero percent.

        (d)  We round price calculations to six decimal places on the basis of price per hundred, for example, 99.954321 (See appendix B to this part).

        (1)  We award securities to both noncompetitive and competitive bidders at the price equivalent to the highest accepted yield, discount rate, or discount margin at which bids were accepted. For inflation-protected securities, the price for awarded securities is the price equivalent to the highest accepted real yield.

        (2) —(i)  We award securities to competitive bidders at the price equivalent to each yield, discount rate, or discount margin at which their bids were accepted.

        (ii)  We award securities to noncompetitive bidders at the price equivalent to the weighted average yield, discount rate, or discount margin of accepted competitive bids.

> [69 FR 45202, July 28, 2004, as amended at 69 FR 53621, Sept. 2, 2004; 76 FR 11080, Mar. 1, 2011; 78 FR 46429, July 31, 2013; 87 FR 40440, July 7, 2022]

        § 356.21   How are awards at the high yield, discount rate, or discount margin calculated?

#### § § 356.21

        (a)  We generally prorate bids at the highest accepted yield, discount rate, or discount margin under § 356.20(a)(2) of this part. For example, if 80.15% is the announced percentage at the highest yield, discount rate, or discount margin, we award 80.15% of the amount of each bid at that yield, discount rate, or discount margin. A bid for $100 million at the highest accepted yield, discount rate, or discount margin would be awarded $80,150,000 in this example. We always make awards for at least the minimum to bid, and above that amount we make awards in the appropriate multiple to bid. For example, Treasury bills may be issued with a minimum to bid of $100 and multiples to bid of $100. Say we accept an $18,000 bid at the high discount rate, and the percent awarded at the high discount rate is 88.27%. We would award $15,900 to that bidder, which is an upward adjustment from $15,888.60 ($18,000 × .8827) to the nearest multiple of $100. If we were to award 4.65% of bids at the highest accepted rate, for example, the award for a $100 bid at that rate would be $100, rather than $4.65, in order to meet the minimum to bid for a bill issue.

        (b)  The same prorating rules apply to customers as apply to submitters. Depository institutions and dealers, whether submitters or intermediaries, are responsible for prorating awards for their customers at the same percentage that we announce. For example, if 80.15% is the announced percentage at the highest yield, discount rate, or discount margin, then each customer bid at that yield, discount rate, or discount margin must be awarded 80.15%.

> [69 FR 45202, July 28, 2004, as amended at 74 FR 26086, June 1, 2009; 78 FR 46430, July 31, 2013]

        § 356.22   Does the Treasury have any limitations on auction awards?

#### § § 356.22

        (a)  The maximum award to any noncompetitive bidder is $10 million. This limit does not apply to bidders bidding solely through a request to reinvest the proceeds of a maturing security held directly with Treasury.

        (b)  The maximum award is 35 percent of the offering amount less the bidder's net long position as reportable under § 356.13. For example, in a note auction with a $10 billion offering amount, and therefore a maximum award of $3.5 billion, a bidder with a reported net long position of $1 billion could receive a maximum auction award of $2.5 billion. When the bids and net long positions of more than one person or entity must be combined, as is the case with investment advisers and controlled accounts (See § 356.15(c).), we will use this combined amount for the purpose of this 35 percent award limit.

        § 356.23   How are the auction results announced?

#### § § 356.23

        (a) After the conclusion of the auction, we will make the auction results available on our website at

        (b) The auction results will include such information as:

        (1) The amounts of bids we accepted and the amount of securities we awarded;

        (2) The range of accepted yields, discount rates, or discount margins.

        (3) The proration percentage;

        (4) The interest rate for a note or bond;

        (5) A breakdown of the amounts of noncompetitive and competitive bids we accepted from, and awarded to, the public;

        (6) The amounts of bids tendered and accepted from the Federal Reserve Banks for their own accounts;

        (7) The bid-to-cover ratio; and

        (8) Other information that we may decide to include.

        § 356.24   Will I be notified directly of my awards and, if I am submitting bids for others, do I have to provide confirmations?

#### § § 356.24

        (a) —(1)  We will provide notice to all submitters letting them know whether their bids were successful or not.

        (2)  If we are to deliver awarded securities under a delivery and payment agreement, we will provide notice of the awards to the clearing corporation that is a party to the agreement.

        (b)  If you are a submitter for customers, you are responsible for notifying them of their awards. You are also responsible for notifying any intermediaries that forwarded successful bids to you. Similarly, an intermediary is responsible for providing notification of any awards to its customers and any intermediaries from whom it received bids.

        (c)  We will provide notice to each depository institution that has entered into an autocharge agreement with a submitter or a clearing corporation of the amount to be charged, on the issue date, to the institution's funds account at the Federal Reserve Bank servicing the institution. We will provide this notification no later than the day after the auction.

        (d) —(1) —(i)  Any customer awarded a par amount of $2 billion or more in an auction must send us a confirmation in written form or via e-mail containing the information in paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section. The confirmation must be sent no later than 10 a.m. Eastern Time on the next business day following the auction. If sent in written form, the confirmation must be signed by the customer or authorized representative. Confirmations sent by e-mail must be sent by the customer or authorized representative. Confirmations signed or sent by an authorized representative must include the capacity in which the representative is acting.

        (ii)  The information the customer must provide is:

        (A) A confirmation of the awarded bid(s), including the name of each submitter that submitted the bid(s) on the customer's behalf, and

        (B) A statement indicating whether the customer had a reportable net long position as defined in § 356.13. If a position had to be reported, the statement must provide the amount of the position and the name of the submitter that the customer requested to report the position.

        (2)  A submitter or intermediary submitting or forwarding bids for a customer must notify the customer of the customer confirmation reporting requirement if we award the customer $2 billion or more as a result of those bids.

        § 356.25   How does the settlement process work?

#### § § 356.25

        Securities bought in the auction must be paid for by the issue date. The payment amount for awarded securities will be the settlement amount as defined in § 356.2. (See formulas in appendix B.) There are several ways to pay for securities:

        (a)  If you are paying by debit entry to a deposit account as provided for in § 356.17(b), we will charge the settlement amount to the specified account on the issue date.

        (b)  Where the submitter's method of payment is an authorized charge to the funds account of a depository institution as provided for in § 356.17(c), we will charge the settlement amount to the specified funds account on the issue date.

        (c)  If you are paying with the redemption proceeds of your certificate of indebtedness as provided for in § 356.17(b), we will redeem the certificate of indebtedness for the settlement amount of the security and apply the proceeds on the issue date.

      Subpart D—Miscellaneous Provisions

        § 356.30   When does the Treasury pay principal and interest on securities?

#### § § 356.30

        (a)  We will pay principal on bills, notes, and bonds on the maturity date as specified in the auction announcement. Interest on bills consists of the difference between the discounted amount paid by the investor at original issue and the par value we pay to the investor at maturity. Interest on notes and bonds accrues from the dated date. Interest is payable on a semiannual or quarterly basis on the interest payment dates specified in the auction announcement through the maturity date. If any principal or interest payment date is a Saturday, Sunday, or other day on which the Federal Reserve System is not open for business, we will make the payment (without additional interest) on the next business day. If a bond is callable, we will pay the principal prior to maturity if we call it under its terms, which include providing appropriate public notice.

        (b)  (1) This table explains the amount that we will pay to holders of inflation-protected securities at maturity.

        (2) Regardless of whether or not we pay an additional amount, we will base the final interest payment on the inflation-adjusted principal at maturity.

        (c) —(1)  We discharge our payment obligations when we credit payment to the account maintained at a Federal Reserve Bank for a depository institution or other authorized entity, or when we make payment according to the instructions of the person or entity maintaining the account. Further, we do not have any obligations to any person or entity that does not have an account with a Federal Reserve Bank. We also will not recognize the claims of any person or entity:

        (i) That does not have an account at a Federal Reserve Bank, or

        (ii) With respect to any accounts not maintained at a Federal Reserve Bank.

        (2)  We discharge our payment obligations when we make payment to a depository institution for credit to the account specified by the owner of the security, when we make payment for a certificate of indebtedness to be issued and held in the owner's account, or when we make payment according to the instructions of the security's owner or the owner's legal representative.

        § 356.31   How does the STRIPS program work?

#### § § 356.31

        (a)  Notes or bonds (other than Treasury floating rate notes) may be “stripped”—divided into separate principal and interest components. These components must be maintained in the commercial book-entry system. Stripping is done at the option of the holder, and may occur at any time from issuance until maturity. We provide the CUSIP numbers and payment dates for the principal and interest components in auction announcements and on our Web site at

        (b) —(1)  The minimum par amount of a non-indexed security that may be stripped is $100. Any par amount to be stripped above $100 must be in a multiple of $100.

        (2)  Principal components stripped from non-indexed securities are maintained in accounts, and transferred, at their par amount. They have a CUSIP number that is different from the CUSIP number of the fully constituted (unstripped) security.

        (3)  Interest components stripped from non-indexed securities have the following features:

        (i) They are maintained in accounts, and transferred, at their original payment value, which is derived by multiplying the semiannual interest rate and the par amount;

        (ii) Their interest payment date becomes the maturity date for the component;

        (iii) All interest components with the same maturity date have the same CUSIP number, regardless of the underlying security from which the interest payments were stripped, and therefore are fungible (interchangeable).

        (iv) the CUSIP numbers of interest components are different from the CUSIP numbers of principal components and fully constituted securities, even if they have the same maturity date, and therefore are not fungible.

        (c) —(1)  The minimum par amount of an inflation-protected security that may be stripped is $100. Any par amount to be stripped above $100 must be in a multiple of $100.

        (2)  Principal components stripped from inflation-protected securities are maintained in accounts, and transferred, at their par amount. At maturity, the holder will receive the inflation-adjusted principal or the par amount, whichever is greater. (See § 356.30.) A principal component has a CUSIP number that is different from the CUSIP number of the fully constituted (unstripped) security.

        (3) —(i)  _Interest components_ stripped from inflation-protected securities are maintained in accounts, and transferred, at their adjusted value. This value is derived by multiplying the semiannual interest rate by the par amount and then multiplying this value by: 100 divided by the Reference CPI of the original issue date. (The dated date is used instead of the original issue date when the dates are different.) See appendix B, section V of this part for an example of how to do this calculation.

        (ii)  When an interest payment is stripped from an inflation-protected security, the interest payment date becomes the maturity date for the component. All interest components with the same maturity date have the same CUSIP number, regardless of the underlying security from which the interest payments were stripped. Such interest components are fungible (interchangeable). The CUSIP numbers of interest components are different from the CUSIP numbers of principal components and fully constituted securities, even if they have the same maturity date.

        (iii)  At maturity, the payment to the holder will be derived by multiplying the adjusted value of the interest component by the Reference CPI of the maturity date, divided by 100. See appendix B, section V of this part for an example of how to do this calculation.

        (iv)  If the CPI is rebased to a different time base reference period (See appendix D.), the adjusted values of all outstanding inflation-protected interest components will be converted to adjusted values based on the new base reference period. At that time, we will publish information that describes how this conversion will occur. After rebasing, any interest components created from a security that was issued during a prior base reference period will be issued with adjusted values calculated using reference CPIs under the most-recent base reference period.

        (d)  Stripped interest and principal components may be reconstituted, that is, put back together into their fully constituted form. A principal component and all related unmatured interest components, in the appropriate minimum or multiple amounts or adjusted values, must be submitted together for reconstitution. Because inflation-protected interest components are different from non-indexed interest components, they are not interchangeable for reconstitution purposes.

        (e)  Subparts A, B, and D of part 357 of this chapter govern notes and bonds stripped into their STRIPS components, unless we state differently in this part.

        § 356.32   What tax rules apply?

#### § § 356.32

        (a)  Securities issued under this part are subject to all applicable taxes imposed under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, or its successor. Under section 3124 of title 31, United States Code, the securities are exempt from taxation by a State or political subdivision of a State, except for State estate or inheritance taxes and other exceptions as provided in that section.

        (b)  Special federal income tax rules for inflation-protected securities, including stripped inflation-protected principal and interest components, are set forth in Internal Revenue Service regulations.

        (c)  Special federal income tax rules for floating rate notes are set forth in Internal Revenue Service regulations.

        § 356.33   Does the Treasury have any discretion in the auction process?

#### § § 356.33

        (a) We have the discretion to:

        (1) Accept, reject, or refuse to recognize any bids submitted in an auction;

        (2) Award more or less than the amount of securities specified in the auction announcement;

        (3) Waive any provision of this part for any bidder or submitter; and

        (4) Change the terms and conditions of an auction.

        (b) Our decisions under this part are final. We will provide a public notice if we change any auction provision, term, or condition.

        (c) We reserve the right to modify the terms and conditions of new securities and to depart from the customary pattern of securities offerings at any time.

        § 356.34   What could happen if someone does not fully comply with the auction rules or fails to pay for securities?

#### § § 356.34

        (a)  If a person or entity fails to comply with any of the auction rules in this part, we will consider the circumstances and take what we deem to be appropriate action. This could include barring the person or entity from participating in future auctions under this part. We also may refer the matter to an appropriate regulatory agency.

        (b)  If you fail to pay for awarded securities in a timely manner, we may require you to pay liquidated damages of up to one percent of the par amount of securities we awarded to you. Our use of this liquidated damages remedy does not preclude us from using any other appropriate remedy.

A Treasury security is maintained in the commercial book-entry system if it is credited by a Federal Reserve Bank to a Participant's Securities Account. The regulations governing the commercial book-entry system are found at subpart B of this part, and are referred to as Treasury/Reserve Automated Debt Entry System (TRADES).

        (2)  ®. The _Legacy Treasury Direct_ system is a non-Internet-based book-entry system maintained by Treasury for purchasing and holding marketable Treasury securities as book-entry products. A Treasury security is maintained in Legacy Treasury Direct if it is credited to a Legacy Treasury Direct account as described in § 357.20 of this part. Treasury securities are held directly by the Department of the Treasury in accounts maintained in the investor's name. A Legacy Treasury Direct account may be accessed through a designated Federal Reserve Bank or the Bureau of the Fiscal Service. See subpart C of this part for rules pertaining to Legacy Treasury Direct.

        (3)  ®. _TreasuryDirect_ is a book-entry, online system maintained by the Department of the Treasury for purchasing and holding eligible marketable Treasury securities, United States Savings Bonds, and certificates of indebtedness in electronic form as a computer record on the books of Treasury. The regulations governing TreasuryDirect are found at 31 CFR part 363.

        (b)  A Treasury security maintained in Legacy Treasury Direct may be transferred to an account in TRADES or to an account in TreasuryDirect in accordance with § 357.22(a). Securities may not be transferred to Legacy Treasury Direct from other systems.

        § 357.21   Registration.

#### § § 357.21

        (a)  (1) Registration of a security conclusively establishes ownership, except in the case of partnership nominees, in which case the Department reserves the right to treat the registration as conclusive of ownership. The registration may not, except as provided in this subpart, include any restriction on the authority of an owner to change the data in the account master record, transfer the security, or effect any other change in the securities portfolio.

        (2) The registration of all securities held by an owner should be uniform with respect to the owner's name. An owner must be identified by the name by which the owner is ordinarily known, preferably including at least one full given name. A suffix, such as  or  must be included when ordinarily used, or when necessary to distinguish members of the same family.

        (3) If an additional security is deposited in an existing account, the security will be registered in the same name and form of registration that appears in the designated account master record. One who holds a security as  should use that name when depositing another security rather than  or

        (b)  A security may be registered in the names of one or two individuals, but only in one of the following forms:

        (1)  In the name of one individual.

        (2) —(i) —(A)  In the names of two individuals, joined by the word “and”, and followed by the words “without right of survivorship”. A security so registered shall conclusively confer on each owner an undivided interest in the security.

        (B)  In the names of two individuals, joined by the word “and”, and followed by the words “with right of survivorship”. A security so registered shall confer on each owner an undivided interest in the security and shall create a conclusive right of survivorship.

        (ii)  In the names of two individuals, joined by the word “or”. A security so registered shall confer on each owner an undivided interest in the security and shall create a conclusive right of survivorship.

        (iii)  In the name of one individual followed by the words “Payable on death to” (or “P.O.D.”) another individual.

        (3) —(i)  A security may not be registered in the name of a minor in his or her own right as an owner. If a security is so registered and the Department thereafter receives evidence or information of that fact, the Department may suspend processing of any transaction request with respect to the security until either a legal guardian has been appointed or a natural guardian, as provided in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section, has been recognized. Where a legal guardian is appointed, the Department will require a certified copy of the court order making such appointment. See § 357.28(c).

        (ii)  A security may be registered in the name of a natural guardian of a minor for whose estate no legal representative has been appointed. The parent with whom the minor resides will be recognized as the natural guardian. If the minor resides with both parents, either or both may be recognized as natural guardian(s). If the minor does not reside with either parent, the Department may recognize the person who furnishes the minor's chief support as the natural guardian.

        (iii)  A security may be registered as provided under an applicable gift to minors statute.

        (4) —(i)  A security may not be registered in the name of an individual in his or her own right as an owner if that individual is incompetent. If a security is so registered, or if the owner subsequently becomes incompetent after the security is purchased, and the Department receives evidence or information of that fact, the Department may suspend any transaction with respect to the security until a legal guardian, conservator, or other representative of the incompetent's estate has been appointed, or a voluntary guardian, as provided in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section, has been recognized. Where a legal guardian, conservator, or other representative is appointed, the Department will require a certified copy of the court order making such appointment. See § 357.28(c).

        (ii)  If a legal guardian has not been appointed, and the face amount of the securities held in one or more accounts in Legacy Treasury Direct ® by an owner who had become incompetent does not exceed, in the aggregate, $20,000 (par amount), upon submission to, and approval by, the Department of an appropriate form, a relative or other person responsible for an incompetent's care and support will be recognized as voluntary guardian for purpose of making a transaction request under § 357.28(b)(4). All persons known by the Department to have an interest in the incompetent's estate, as required by the application form, must agree to the designation of the voluntary guardian. The security may be re-registered in the name of the voluntary guardian.

        (c)  A security may be registered in the name of a representative of an estate. If there is more than one representative, the names of some representatives may be omitted if followed by language that indicates the existence of other representatives. In such cases, those named in the registration shall be conclusively presumed by the Department to have authority to make a transaction request on behalf of all the representatives. The form of registration must identify the specific capacity of the representative(s) and the estate represented.

        (d)  A security may be registered in the name of a private corporation, unincorporated association, or partnership. The full legal name of the organization, as set forth in its charter, articles of incorporation, constitution, partnership agreement, or other documents from which its powers are derived, must be included in the registration. The name may be followed by a reference to a particular account or fund, other than a trust fund, such as an escrow account.

        (1)  The legal name of a business, fraternal, religious, or other private _corporation_ must be followed by descriptive words indicating the corporate status unless the term  or the abbreviation  is part of the name or the name is that of a corporation or association organized under Federal law, such as a national bank or Federal savings and loan association.

        (2)  Unless the name of a lodge, club, labor union, veterans or religious organization, or similar organization which is not incorporated (whether or not it is chartered by or affiliated with a parent organization which is incorporated) includes the words  the registration must include descriptive words indicating the organization's unincorporated status. A security may not be registered in the name of an _unincorporated association_ if the legal title to its property or the legal title to the funds with which the security is to be purchased is held by trustees. In such a case, the security should be registered in the name of the trustees in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section. The term  should not be used to describe a trust fund, a partnership or a business conducted under a trade name.

        (3)  Unless the name of a partnership includes the word  the registration must include descriptive words indicating partnership status.

        (e)  A security may be registered in the name of a State, county, city, town, village, school district, or other governmental entity, body, or corporation established by law. If a governmental officer is authorized to act as a trustee or custodian, a security may be registered in the title, or name and title, of the governmental officer. The form of registration should reflect the capacity in which the governmental entity or officer is authorized to hold property (e.g., it may be authorized to hold property in its own name or as trustee or custodian).

        (f)  A security may be registered in the name of an individual, with the United States Treasury as beneficiary, provided a reference to the statute which authorizes gifts to be made to the United States to reduce the public debt, is included.

        § 357.22   Transfers.

#### § § 357.22

        (a)  A security may be transferred only as authorized by this part. A security may be transferred from an account in Legacy Treasury Direct® to an account in the commercial book-entry system or to an account in TreasuryDirect®. A security may also be transferred between accounts in  The Department may delay transfer of a newly purchased security from a Legacy Treasury Direct account to an account in commercial book entry or TreasuryDirect for a period not to exceed (30) calendar days from the date of issue. This provides time for the investor to become aware of any unauthorized debits.

        (1)  The owner must identify the securities to be transferred, in the manner required by the transaction request. If such identification is not provided, the request will not be processed and will be returned.

        (2)  A security may be transferred from an account only in a denominational amount authorized by the offering under which the security was issued. Any security remaining in the securities portfolio after the transfer must also be in an authorized denominational amount.

        (3) —(i)  A transfer of a security within Legacy Treasury Direct is effective when an appropriate entry is made in the name of the transferee on the Legacy Treasury Direct records.

        (ii)  A transfer of a security from Legacy Treasury Direct to the commercial book-entry system is effective as provided in subpart B. If a transfer cannot be completed, and the security is sent back to Legacy Treasury Direct, the Department will redeposit the security in the original account.

        (iii)  A transfer of a security from Legacy Treasury Direct to TreasuryDirect is effective as provided in 31 CFR part 363. If the transfer cannot be completed, the Department will redeposit the security in the original account.

        (b) —(1)  If a security is registered in beneficiary form or a form which provides for a right of survivorship, upon the death of an owner, the beneficiary or survivor shall be the sole and absolute owner, notwithstanding any purported testamentary disposition by the decedent and notwithstanding any State or other law to the contrary. The Department will honor a transaction request by a beneficiary or a survivor (in the case of a security registered in the form described in § 357.21(b)(2)(i)(B)) only upon proof of death of an owner.

        (2)  If a security is registered in a form that does not provide for a right of survivorship, succession shall be determined in accordance with the applicable law of the deceased owner's domicile at the time of death.

        (c)  If a security is registered in the name of a representative who has died, resigned, or been removed, succession shall be determined in accordance with applicable law and the terms of the document under which the representative was acting.

        (d) —(1)  If a security is registered in the name of a corporation or an unincorporated association that has been dissolved, merged or consolidated into another organization, succession shall be determined in accordance with applicable law and the terms of the documents by which the dissolution, merger, or consolidation was effected.

        (2)  If a partnership is dissolved or terminated, succession shall be determined in accordance with applicable law and the terms of the partnership agreement.

        (e)  If a security is registered in the name and title of a governmental officer who has died, resigned, or has been removed, succession shall be determined in accordance with applicable law.

        § 357.23   Judicial proceedings—sovereign immunity.

#### § § 357.23

        (a)  The Department and the Federal Reserve Banks are not proper defendants in a judicial proceeding involving competing claims to a security held in Legacy Treasury Direct ® nor are they subject to any injunction or restraining order issued with respect to a security. The Department will not recognize a notice of a pending or contemplated judicial or administrative proceeding affecting a security in Legacy Treasury Direct.

        (b) —(1)  The Department will recognize a final order entered by a court that affects ownership rights in a security in Legacy Treasury Direct if:

        (i) The order is consistent with the provisions of this subpart and the terms and conditions of the security; and

        (ii) The Department has received evidence of the order, as provided in paragraph (c) of this section.

        (2)  The Department will honor a transaction request submitted by a person appointed by a court and having authority under an order of a court to dispose of the security or payment with respect thereto if:

        (i) The ordered disposition of the security or payments with respect thereto is consistent with the provisions of this subpart and the terms and conditions of the security; and

        (ii) The Department has received evidence of the appointment and order, as provided in paragraph (c) of this section.

        (c)  Before the Department will recognize an order or determination entered by a court, the Department must have received a certified copy of the judgment, decree, or order and any additional documents deemed necessary by the Department. A certificate from the clerk of the court, bearing the seal of the court, must also be submitted stating that the judgment, decree, or order is still in full force and has not been stayed or appealed, and that the time for filing an appeal has passed. Before the Department will honor a transaction request submitted by a person appointed by a court, the Department must receive a certified copy of the order making the appointment and describing specifically the person's authority, and any additional documents deemed necessary by the Department.

        § 357.24   Availability and disclosure of Legacy Treasury Direct ® records.

#### § § 357.24

        (a)  All records with respect to a Legacy Treasury Direct account are held confidential. Consistent with the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a), information relating to those accounts will be released only to the owner except:

        (1) As provided in these regulations;

        (2) As provided in Treasury regulations contained in 31 CFR part 323; or

        (3) As otherwise provided by law.

        (1) Sufficient information is provided to identify the owner; and

        (2) Sufficient information is provided to identify the Legacy Treasury Direct account.

        (c)  A request for information will be honored only if, in the sole judgment of the Department or the Federal Reserve Bank to which the inquiry is made, the identity and right of the requester to the information have been established.

        § 357.25   Security interests.

#### § § 357.25

        (a)  The Department will not recognize any notice or claim of a lien, encumbrance, or security interest of any kind, including a pledge, in a security in Legacy Treasury Direct ® except as provided in § 357.23 and in paragraph (b) of this section.

        (b)  The Department will accept and hold pursuant to the provisions of 31 U.S.C. 9303, book-entry bonds, notes or bills submitted in lieu of a surety bond as security for the performance of a duty or obligation required by Federal law in accordance with said section.

        § 357.26   Direct Deposit.

#### § § 357.26

        (a)  A payment by the Department with respect to a security shall be by direct deposit unless it is deemed necessary by the Department to make payment by another means. Direct Deposit payments are governed by the regulations at 31 CFR part 370.

        (b)  Where the Legacy Treasury Direct ® securities account is in the name of individual(s) in their own right, and the deposit account at the financial institution is in the name of individual(s) in their own right, the two accounts must contain at least one name that is common to both.

        (c)  Where the deposit account to which payments are to be directed is held in the name of the financial institution itself acting as sole trustee, or as co-trustee, or is in the name of a commercially-managed investment fund, particular inquiry should first be made of the financial institution to make certain that the direct deposit payments can be received, and alternate arrangements made if it cannot do so.

        (d)  All payments relating to a single account master record must be made to the same designated account at a financial institution.

        (e)  The deposit account to which payments are directed should preferably be established in a form identical to the registration of the securities account, particularly where the securities are registered jointly or with right of survivorship, to assure that the rights of ownership and of survivorship can be more easily identified and preserved. Neither the United States nor any Federal Reserve Bank shall be liable for any loss sustained because the interests of the holder(s) of a deposit account to which payments are made are not the same as the interests of the owner(s) of the security.

        § 357.27   Reinvestment.

#### § § 357.27

        (a)  Upon the request of an owner, the redemption proceeds of a security may be reinvested at maturity in a new security in the same form of registration, provided a new security is then being offered by the Department and provision for reinvestment is made in the offering. The new security must be in an authorized denominational amount and will be issued in accordance with the terms of the offering. If the new security is issued at a premium or with accrued interest, an additional payment will be required from the investor. If the new security is issued at a discount, the difference will be remitted to the owner.

        (b)  A request by an owner for a single or successive reinvestment of a Treasury bill must be made in accordance with the terms prescribed on the tender form submitted at the time of purchase of the original bill, or by a subsequent transaction request received not less than ten (10) business days prior to the maturity date of the bill. A request to revoke a direction to reinvest the proceeds of a bill must be received by the Department not less than ten (10) business days prior to the maturity date of the bill. If either a request for reinvestment or revocation of a reinvestment request is received less than ten (10) business days prior to maturity of the original bill, the Department may in its discretion act on such request if sufficient time remains for processing.

        (c)  If the date on which a security matures or is called does not coincide with the issue date of the security being purchased through reinvestment, the Department may, at its option, hold the redemption proceeds in the same form of registration as the maturing or called security, but no interest shall accrue or be paid on such funds.

        § 357.28   Transaction requests.

#### § § 357.28

        (a)  Unless otherwise authorized by the Department, a transaction request must be submitted on a transaction request form. In the case of certain transactions specified by the Department, the owner's signature on the form must be certified or guaranteed, as provided in § 357.31. If the transaction request form is received more than six (6) months after its execution, it will not be honored by the Department and will be returned to the sender for further instructions.

        (b) —(1)  A transaction request must be signed by the owner of the security. In addition to any required certification, a transaction request form executed by a person by mark, e.g., “(X)”, must be witnessed by a disinterested person. The following language should be added to the form and be signed by the witness:

        (2)  If an individual's name has been changed from that appearing in the registration, the individual should sign both names to the transaction request form and state the manner in which the change occurred.

        (3)  A transaction request involving a security registered in the name of a natural guardian of a minor may be executed by the natural guardian. If a security is registered in the names of both parents as natural guardians of a minor, both must execute a transaction request. However, the Department will not honor a transaction request by the natural guardian(s):

        (i) Which would transfer the security to a natural guardian in his or her own right; or

        (ii) After the Department receives notice of the minor's attainment of majority, the qualification of a legal guardian or similar representative, or the death of the minor.

        (4)  A transaction request involving a security belonging to an owner who has become incompetent may be executed by a voluntary guardian, but only after approval by the Department of the voluntary guardian's application for such designation. However, the Department will not honor a transaction request by the voluntary guardian:

        (i) Which would transfer the security to a voluntary guardian in his or her own right; or

        (ii) After the Department receives notice of the ward's restoration to competency, the qualification of a legal guardian or similar representative, or the death of the ward. See § 357.21(b)(4).

        (c) —(1)  Any representative of an owner's estate, other than a trustee, may execute a transaction request form if the representative submits to the Department properly authenticated evidence of the authority to act. The evidence will not be accepted if dated more than one year prior to the date of submission of the transaction request.

        (2)  If a decedent's estate has been settled previously through judicial proceedings, the persons entitled may make a transaction request. A certified copy of the court-approved final accounting for the estate, the court's decree of distribution, or other appropriate evidence will be required.

        (3)  If there is no formal or regular administration and no representative of the decedent's estate is to be appointed, the person appointed to receive or distribute the assets of a decedent's estate without regular administration under applicable local law summary or small estates procedures may make a transaction request. Appropriate evidence will be required.

        (4)  If the total redemption value of the Treasury securities and undelivered payments, if any, held directly on our records that are the property of the decedent's estate is greater than $100,000, administration of the decedent's estate will be required. The redemption value of savings bonds and the principal amount of marketable securities will be used to determine the value of securities, and will be determined as of the date of death. Administration may also be required at the discretion of the Department for any case.

        (5) —(i)  A voluntary representative is a person qualified according to paragraph (c)(5)(iii) of this section, to make a transaction request. The voluntary representative procedures are for the convenience of the Department; entitlement to the decedent's securities and held payments, if any, is determined by the law of the jurisdiction in which the decedent was domiciled at the date of death. Voluntary representative procedures may be used only if:

        (A) There has been no administration, no administration is contemplated, and no summary or small estate procedures under applicable local law have been used;

        (B) The total redemption value of the Treasury securities and held payments, if any, that are the property of the decedent's estate is $100,000 or less as of the date of death; and

        (C) There is a person eligible to serve as the voluntary representative according to paragraph (c)(5)(iii) of this section.

        (ii)  A voluntary representative may make a transaction request to distribute the securities to or for the benefit of the persons entitled by laws of the jurisdiction in which the decedent was domiciled at the date of death.

        (iii)  An individual eighteen years of age or older may act as a voluntary representative according to the following order of precedence: A surviving spouse; if there is no surviving spouse, then a child of the decedent; if there are none of the above, then a descendant of a deceased child of the decedent; if there are none of the above, then a parent of the decedent; if there are none of the above, then a brother or sister of the decedent; if there are none of the above, then a descendant of a deceased brother or sister of the decedent; if there are none of the above, then a next of kin of the decedent, as determined by the law of the jurisdiction in which the decedent was domiciled at the date of death. As used in this order of precedence, child means a natural or adopted child of the decedent.

        (iv)  By serving, the voluntary representative warrants that the distribution of securities or proceeds is to or on behalf of the persons entitled by the law of the jurisdiction in which the decedent was domiciled at the date of death. The United States is not liable to any person for the improper distribution of securities or proceeds. Upon distribution of the securities or proceeds at the request of the voluntary representative, the United States is released to the same extent as if it had paid or delivered to a representative of the estate appointed pursuant to the law of the jurisdiction in which the decedent was domiciled at the date of death. The voluntary representative shall indemnify and hold harmless the United States and all creditors and persons entitled to the estate of the decedent. The amount of the indemnification is limited to an amount no greater than the value received by the voluntary representative.

        (v)  If there has been no administration, no administration is contemplated, no summary or small estate procedures under applicable local law have been used, and there is no person eligible to serve as a voluntary representative pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section, then a creditor may make a claim for payment of the amount of the debt, providing the debt has not been barred by applicable local law.

        (d) —(1)  A transaction request involving a security registered in the name of a corporation or an unincorporated association (either in its own right or in a representative capacity), may be executed by an authorized person on its behalf. The request must be supported by evidence of the person's authority to act.

        (2)  A transaction request involving a security registered in the name of a partnership must be executed by a general partner.

        (e)  A transaction request involving a security registered in the name of a State, county, city, school district, or other governmental entity, public body or corporation, must be executed by an authorized officer of the entity. The request must be supported by evidence of the officer's authority to act.

        (f)  A transaction request involving a security registered in the title of a public officer must be executed by the officer. The request must be supported by evidence of incumbency.

        (g)  A transaction request made by an attorney-in-fact must be accompanied by the original power of attorney or a properly authenticated copy. A power of attorney must be executed in the presence of a notary public or a certifying individual. See § 357.31. The power of attorney will not be accepted if it was executed more than two (2) years before the date the transaction request was executed, unless the power provides that the authority of the attorney-in-fact continues notwithstanding the incapacity of the principal. If two or more attorneys-in-fact are named, all must execute the transaction request unless the power authorizes fewer than all to act. A transaction request executed by an attorney-in-fact seeking transfer of a security to the attorney-in-fact will not be accepted unless expressly authorized by the document appointing the attorney-in-fact.

#### § § 357.29

        For purposes of a transaction request affecting payment instructions with respect to a security, a proper request must be received not less than ten (10) business days preceding the next payment date. If a transaction request is received less than ten (10) business days preceding a payment date, the Department may in its discretion act on such request if sufficient time remains for processing. If a transaction request is received too late for completion of the requested transaction, the transaction request will be acted upon with respect to future payments only.

No other interest shall accrue or be paid on such proceeds after the security is redeemed.

        § 357.31   Certifying individuals.

#### § § 357.31

        (a)  The following individuals may certify signatures on transaction request forms:

        (1) Officers and employees of depository institutions, corporate central credit unions, and institutions that are members of Treasury-recognized signature guarantee programs who have been authorized:

        (i) Generally to bind their respective institutions by their acts;

        (ii) Unqualifiedly to guarantee signatures to assignments of securities; or

        (iii) To certify assignments of securities.

        (2) Officers and authorized employees of Federal Reserve Banks.

        (3) Officers of Federal Land Banks, Federal Intermediate Credit Banks and Banks for Cooperatives, the Central Bank for Cooperatives, and Federal Home Loan Banks.

        (4) Commissioned officers and warrant officers of the Armed Forces of the United States but only with respect to signatures executed by Armed Forces personnel, civilian field employees, and members of their families.

        (5) Such other persons as the Commissioner of the Fiscal Service or his designee may authorize.

        (b)  The following individuals are authorized to certify signatures on transaction request forms executed in a foreign country:

        (1) United States diplomatic or consular officials.

        (2) Managers and officers of foreign branches of depository institutions and institutions that are members of Treasury-recognized signature guarantee programs.

        (3) Notaries public and other officers authorized to administer oaths, provided their official position and authority are certified by a United States diplomatic or consular official under seal of the office.

        (c) —(1)  Except as specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, a certifying individual shall require that the transaction request form be signed in the certifying individual's presence after he or she has established the identity of the person seeking the certification. An employee who is not an officer should insert the words “Authorized signature” in the space provided for the title. A certifying individual and the organization for which he or she is acting are jointly and severally liable for any loss the United States may incur as a result of the individual's negligence in making the certification.

        (2)  The transaction request form need not be executed in the presence of a certifying individual if he or she unqualifiedly guarantees the signature, in which case the certifying individual shall, after the signature, add the following endorsement: “Signature guaranteed, First National Bank of Smithville, Smithville, NH, by A.B. Doe, President”, and add the date. In guaranteeing a signature, the certifying individual and the organization for which he or she is acting warrant to the Department that the signature is genuine and that the signer had the legal capacity to execute the transaction request.

        (3)  A transaction request form need not be actually signed by the owner in any case where a certifying individual associated with a depository institution has placed an endorsement on the form reading substantially as follows: “Absence of signature by owner and validity of transaction guaranteed, Second State Bank of Jonesville, Jonesville, NC, by B.R. Butler, Vice President”. The endorsement should be dated, and the seal of the institution should be added. This form of endorsement is an unconditional guarantee to the Department that the institution is acting for the owner under proper authorization.

        (d)  The authority of a certifying individual to act is evidenced by affixing to the certification the following:

        (1)  The institution's seal or signature guarantee stamp; if the institution is an authorized paying agent for U.S. Savings Bonds, a legible imprint of the paying agent's stamp; or, if the institution is a member of the Security Transfer Agents Medallion Program (STAMP), a legible imprint of the STAMP signature guarantee stamp.

        (2)  A legible imprint of the program's signature guarantee stamp, e.g., the STAMP, SEMP, MSP stamp for members of the Securities Transfer Agents Medallion Program, the Stock Exchanges Medallion Program, or the New York Stock Exchange Incorporated Medallion Signature Program, respectively.

        (3)  Whatever is prescribed in procedures established by the Department.

        (4)  The entity's seal.

        (5)  The official seal or stamp of the office. If the certifying individual has no seal or stamp, then the official's position must be certified by some other authorized individual, under seal or stamp, or otherwise proved to the satisfaction of the Department.

        (7)  The evidence specified by the Commissioner or his designee.

        (e)  Neither the transferor, the transferee, nor any person having an interest in a security involved in the transaction may act as a certifying individual. However, an authorized officer or employee of a depository institution or of an institution that is a member of a Treasury-recognized signature guarantee program may act as a certifying individual on a transaction request for transfer of a security to the institution, or any request executed by another individual on behalf of the institution.

        § 359.4   In what form are Series I savings bonds issued?

#### § § 359.4

        Series I savings bonds are issued in book-entry form. Effective January 1, 2012, Treasury discontinued the issuance of definitive Series I savings bonds.

> [76 FR 66856, Oct. 28, 2011]

        § 359.5   What is the maturity period of a Series I savings bonds?

#### § § 359.5

        Series I savings bonds have a total maturity period of 30 years from the issue date, consisting of an original maturity period of 20 years and an extension period of 10 years.

        § 359.6   When may I redeem my Series I bond?

#### § § 359.6

        (a)  You may redeem your Series I savings bond issued on January 1, 2003, or earlier, at any time after six months from its issue date.

        (b) Bonds issued on February 1, 2003, or thereafter. You may redeem your Series I savings bond issued on February 1, 2003, or thereafter, at any time after 12 months from its issue date.

> [68 FR 2667, Jan. 17, 2003, as amended at 68 FR 7427, Feb. 14, 2003]

        § 359.7   If I redeem a Series I savings bonds before five years after the issue date, is there an interest penalty?

#### § § 359.7

        If you redeem a bond less than five years after the issue date, we will reduce the overall earning period by three months. For example, if you redeem a bond issued January 1, 2002, nine months later on October 1, 2002, the redemption value will be determined by applying the value calculation procedures and composite rate for that bond as if the redemption date were three months earlier (July 1, 2002). However, we will not reduce the redemption value of a bond subject to the three-month interest penalty below the issue price (par). This penalty does not apply to bonds redeemed five years or more after the issue date.

        § 359.8   How does interest accrue on Series I savings bonds?

#### § § 359.8

        A bond accrues interest based on both a fixed rate of return and a semiannual inflation rate. A single, annual rate called the composite rate reflects the combined effects of the fixed rate and the semiannual inflation rate. For more information, see appendix B of part 359.

        § 359.9   When are interest rates for Series I savings bonds announced?

#### § § 359.9

        (a) The Secretary will furnish fixed rates, semiannual inflation rates, and composite rates for Series I savings bonds in announcements published each May 1 and November 1.

        (b) If the regularly scheduled date for the announcement is a day when the Treasury is not open for business, then the Secretary will make the announcement on the next business day. However, the effective date of the rates remains the first day of the month of the announcement.

        (c) The Secretary may announce rates at any other time.

        § 359.10   What is the fixed rate of return?

#### § § 359.10

        The Secretary, or the Secretary's designee, determines the fixed rate of return. The fixed rate is established for the life of the bond. The fixed rate will always be greater than or equal to 0.00%.   The most recently announced fixed rate is only for bonds purchased during the six months following the announcement, or for any other period of time announced by the Secretary.

> [73 FR 65543, Nov. 4, 1008]

        § 359.11   What is the semiannual inflation rate?

#### § § 359.11

        The index used to determine the semiannual inflation rate is the non-seasonally adjusted CPI-U (the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers for the U.S. City Average for All Items, 1982-84 = 100) published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the U.S. Department of Labor. (For further information on CPI-U considerations,  appendix C to part 359 at section 1.) The semiannual inflation rate reflects the percentage change, if any, in the CPI-U over a six-month period. We announce this rate twice a year, in May and November. The semiannual inflation rate we announced in May 2002 reflects the percentage change between the CPI-U figures from the preceding March 2002 and September 2001. The rate of change over the six-month period, if any, will be expressed as a percentage, rounded to the nearest one-hundredth of one percent. More specifically, the semiannual inflation rate will be determined by the following formula (the resulting rate will be rounded to the nearest one-hundredth of one percent):

        § 359.12   What happens in deflationary conditions?

#### § § 359.12

        In certain deflationary situations, the semiannual inflation rate may be negative. Negative semiannual inflation rates will be used in the same way as positive semiannual inflation rates. However, if the semiannual inflation rate is negative to the extent that it completely offsets the fixed rate of return, the redemption value of a Series I bond for any particular month will not be less than the value for the preceding month.

        § 359.13   What are composite rates?

#### § § 359.13

        Composite rates are single, annual interest rates that reflect the combined effects of the fixed rate and the semiannual inflation rate. The composite rate will always be greater than or equal to 0.00%.

> [73 FR 65544, Nov. 4, 1008]

        § 359.14   How are composite rates determined?

#### § § 359.14

        Composite rates are set according to the following formula (See appendix A to part 359 for examples of calculations involving composite interest rates.):

        § 359.15   When is the composite rate applied to Series I savings bonds?

#### § § 359.15

        The most recently announced composite rate applies to a bond during its next semiannual rate period. A bond's semiannual rate periods are consecutive six-month periods, the first of which begins with the bond's issue date. This means that there can be a delay of several months from the time of a composite rate announcement to the time that rate determines interest earnings for a bond. For example, if you purchased a bond in April, its semiannual rate periods begin every April and October. At the beginning of the semiannual rate period in April, the most recently announced composite rate would have been the rate we announced the previous November. This rate will determine interest earnings for your bond for the next six months, through the end of September. At the beginning of the semiannual rate period in October, the most recently announced composite rate would be the rate announced the previous May. This rate will determine interest earnings for your bond through the end of the following March. However, if you purchased a bond instead in May, its semiannual rate periods begin in May and November. Therefore, the composite rates announced in May and November will apply immediately to this bond. (See appendix C to part 359 at § 2 for a discussion of rate lag.)

        § 359.16   When does interest accrue on Series I savings bonds?

#### § § 359.16

        (a) Interest, if any, accrues on the first day of each month; that is, we add the interest earned on a bond during any given month to its value at the beginning of the following month.

        (b) The accrued interest compounds semiannually.

        § 359.17   When is interest payable on Series I savings bonds?

#### § § 359.17

        Interest earnings are payable upon redemption.

        § 359.18   Is the determination of the Secretary on rates and values final?

#### § § 359.18

        The Secretary's determination of fixed rates of return, semiannual inflation rates, composite rates, and savings bonds redemption values is final and conclusive.

        § 359.19   How is interest calculated?

#### § § 359.19

        We base all calculations of interest on a $25 unit. We use the value of this unit to determine the value of bonds in higher denominations. The effect of rounding off the value of the $25 unit increases at higher denominations. This can work to your slight advantage or disadvantage, depending on whether we round the value up or down.

      Subpart B—Definitive Series I Savings Bonds

        § 359.25   What were the denominations and prices of definitive Series I savings bonds?

        § 359.26   When are definitive Series I savings bonds validly issued?

#### § § 359.26

        A definitive bond is validly issued when it is registered as provided in part 360, and when it bears an issue date and the validation indicia of an authorized issuing agent.

        § 359.27   What is the issue date of a definitive Series I savings bond?

        § 359.70   May Fiscal Service waive any provision in this part?

#### § § 359.70

        We may waive or modify any provision of this part in any particular case or class of cases for the convenience of the United States or in order to relieve any person or persons of unnecessary hardship:

        (a) If such action would not be inconsistent with law or equity;

        (b) If it does not impair any material existing rights; and

        (b)  (1) Registrations requested must be clear, accurate and complete, conform substantially with one of the forms set forth in this subpart, and include the taxpayer identifying number of the owner or first-named coowner. The registration of all bonds owned by the same individual or fiduciary estate should be uniform with respect to the name of the owner and any description of the fiduciary capacity.

        (2) An individual should be designated by the name he or she is ordinarily known by or uses in business, including at least one full given name. The name may be preceded or followed by any applicable title, such as Mr., Mrs., Ms., Miss, Dr., Rev., M.D., or D.D.

        § 360.6   Authorized forms of registration.

#### § § 360.6

        Subject to any limitations or restrictions contained in these regulations on the right of any person to be named as owner, coowner, or beneficiary, bonds should be registered as indicated in this section. A savings bond registered in a form not substantially in agreement with one of the forms authorized by this subpart is not considered validly issued.

        (a)  A bond may be registered in the names of individuals in their own right, but only in one of the forms authorized by this paragraph (a).

        (1)  A bond may be registered in the name of one individual.

        (2)  A bond may be registered in the names of two individuals in the alternative as coowners. The form of registration “A and B” is not authorized.

        (3)  A bond may be registered in the name of one individual payable on death to another. “Payable on death to” may be abbreviated to “P.O.D.”.

A bond's registration should conform to a form authorized by this paragraph. A common trust fund established and maintained by a financial institution authorized to act as a fiduciary will be considered a single fiduciary estate within the meaning of the regulations in this part.

        (2)  A bond may be registered in the name and fiduciary capacity of the legally appointed or authorized representative of the estate of a minor, incompetent, aged or infirm person, absentee, et al., or of a personal or testamentary trust.

        (3)  Bonds may be registered in the name and title, or title alone, of the trustee of an eligible employee thrift, savings, vacation, 401(k) or similar plan, as defined in § 360.13.

        (c)  A person who desires to have a bond become the property of the United States upon his or her death may designate the United States Treasury as beneficiary.

        § 360.11   Computation of amount.

#### § § 360.11

        (a)  The purchases of bonds in the name of any person in an individual capacity are computed separately from purchases in a fiduciary capacity, e.g., as representative for the estate of an individual.

        (b)  In computing the purchases for each person, the following outstanding bonds are included:

        (1) All bonds registered in the name and bearing the taxpayer identifying number of that person alone;

        (2) All bonds registered in the name of the representative of the estate of that person and bearing that person's taxpayer identifying number; and

        (3) All bonds registered in the name of that person as coowner that also bear that person's taxpayer identifying number.

        (c)  In computing the purchases for each person, the following are excluded:

        (1) Bonds on which that person is named beneficiary;

        (2) Bonds to which that person has become entitled—

        (i) Under § 360.70 as surviving beneficiary upon the death of the registered owner;

        (ii) As an heir or a legatee of the deceased owner;

        (iii) By virtue of the termination of a trust or the happening of a similar event; and

        (3) Bonds that are purchased and redeemed within the same calendar year.

        § 360.12   Disposition of excess.

#### § § 360.12

        If any person at any time has savings bonds issued during any one calendar year in excess of the prescribed amount, instructions should be obtained from the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, Parkersburg, WV 26106-1328, for appropriate adjustment of the excess. Under the conditions specified in § 360.90, the Commissioner of the Fiscal Service may permit excess purchases to stand in any particular case or class of cases.

        § 360.13   Employee plans—Conditions of eligibility.

#### § § 360.13

        (a)  Employee thrift, savings, vacation, 401(k), and similar plans are contributory plans established by the employer for the exclusive and irrevocable benefit of its employees or their beneficiaries. Each plan must afford employees the means of making regular savings from their wages through payroll deductions and provide for employer contributions to be added to these savings.

        (b)  (1) The term  means all the employees' contributions and _assets_ purchased with them and the employer's contributions and assets purchased with them, as well as accretions, such as dividends on stock, the increment in value on bonds and all other income; but, notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the right to demand and receive all assets credited to the account of an employee shall not be construed to require the distribution of assets in kind when it would not be possible or practicable to make such a distribution; for example, Series I bonds may not be reissued in unauthorized denominations.

        (2) The word  means:

        (i) The person or persons, if any, designated by the employee in accordance with the terms of the plan to receive the benefits of the plan upon the employee's death; or

        (ii) The estate of the employee.

        (c)  An employee plan must conform to the following rules in order to be eligible for the special limitation provided in § 360.10.

        (1)  All assets of a plan must be credited to the individual accounts of participating employees and may be distributed only to them or their beneficiaries, except as provided in paragraph (c)(3) of this section.

        (2)  Bonds may be purchased only with assets credited to the accounts of participating employees and only if the amount taken from any account at any time for that purpose is equal to the purchase price of a $50 bond or bonds in an authorized denomination or denominations, and shares in the bonds are credited to the accounts of the individuals from which the purchase price was derived, in amounts corresponding with their shares. For example, if $100 credited to the account of John Jones is commingled with funds credited to the accounts of other employees to make a total of $5,000 with which a Series I bond in the denomination of $5,000 (face amount) is purchased in December 1998 and registered in the name and title of the trustee, the plan must provide, in effect, that John Jones' account be credited to show that he is the owner of a Series I bond in the denomination of $100 (face amount) bearing an issue date of December 1, 1998.

        (3)  Each participating employee has an irrevocable right to request and receive from the trustee all assets credited to the employee's account (or their value, if the employee prefers) without regard to any conditions other than the loss or suspension of the privilege of participating further in the plan. A plan may limit or modify such right in any manner required for qualification of the plan under section 401 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (26 U.S.C. 401).

        (4)  Upon the death of an employee, his or her beneficiary shall have the absolute and unconditional right to demand and receive from the trustee all assets credited to the account of the employee or their value, if he or she so prefers.

        (5)  (i) When settlement is made with an employee or his or her beneficiary with respect to any bond registered in the name and title of the plan trustee in which the employee has a share, the bond must be paid or reissued to the extent of the share.

        (ii) If an employee or the beneficiary is to receive distribution in kind, bonds bearing the same issue dates as those credited to the employee's account will be reissued in the name of the employee or the employee's beneficiary to the extent entitled, in authorized denominations, in any authorized form of registration, upon the request and certification of the trustee.

        (d)  A trustee of an employee plan who desires to purchase bonds under the special limitation should submit to the designated Federal Reserve Bank or Branch a copy of:

        (1) The plan;

        (2) Any instructions issued under the plan that concern Series I bonds; and

        (3) The trust agreement, in order to establish the plan's eligibility.

        (e)  Savings bonds may be purchased under certain vacation plans. Questions concerning the eligibility of these plans to purchase bonds in excess of the general limitation should be addressed to the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, Parkersburg, WV 26106-1328.

      Subpart D—Limitations on Transfer or Pledge

        § 360.15   Transfer.

#### § § 360.15

        Savings bonds are not transferable and are payable only to the owners named on the bonds, except as specifically provided in these regulations and then only in the manner and to the extent so provided.

        § 360.16   Pledge.

#### § § 360.16

        A savings bond may not be hypothecated, pledged, or used as security for the performance of an obligation.

      Subpart E—Judicial Proceedings

        § 360.20   General.

#### § § 360.20

        (a) The Department of the Treasury will not recognize a judicial determination that gives effect to an attempted voluntary inter vivos transfer of a bond, or a judicial determination that impairs the rights of survivorship conferred by the regulations in this part upon a coowner or beneficiary. All provisions of this subpart are subject to these restrictions, except as provided in § 360.24.

        (b) The Department of the Treasury will recognize a claim against an owner of a savings bond and conflicting claims of ownership of, or interest in, a bond between coowners or between the registered owner and the beneficiary, if established by valid, judicial proceedings specifically listed in this subpart. Escheat proceedings will not be recognized under this subpart. Section 360.23 specifies evidence required to establish the validity of judicial proceedings. Treasury may require any other evidence to establish the validity of judicial proceedings, such as evidence that the proceeding provided due process, complied with this part, and complied with relevant state law.

        (c) The Department of the Treasury and the agencies that issue, reissue, or redeem savings bonds will not accept a notice of an adverse claim or notice of pending judicial proceedings, nor undertake to protect the interests of a litigant not in possession of a savings bond.

        § 360.21   Payment to judgment creditors.

#### § § 360.21

        (a)  The Department of the Treasury will pay (but not reissue) a savings bond to the purchaser at a sale under a levy or to the officer authorized under appropriate process to levy upon property of the registered owner or coowner to satisfy a money judgment. Payment will be made only to the extent necessary to satisfy the money judgment. The amount paid is limited to the redemption value 60 days after the termination of the judicial proceedings. Except in the case of a levy by the Internal Revenue Service, payment of a bond registered in coownership form pursuant to a judgment or a levy against only one coowner is limited to the extent of that coowner's interest in the bond. That interest must be established by an agreement between the coowners or by a judgment, decree, or order of a court in a proceeding to which both coowners are parties. Payment of a bond registered in coownership form pursuant to a levy by the Internal Revenue Service will be made if the levy is against either coowner on the bond.

        (b)  The Department of the Treasury will pay, at current redemption value, a savings bond to a trustee in bankruptcy, a receiver of an insolvent's estate, a receiver in equity, or a similar court officer under the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section.

        § 360.22   Payment or reissue pursuant to divorce.

#### § § 360.22

        (a)  (1) The Department of the Treasury will recognize a divorce decree that ratifies or confirms a property settlement agreement disposing of bonds or that otherwise settles the interests of the parties in a bond. Reissue of a savings bond may be made to eliminate the name of one spouse as owner, coowner, or beneficiary or to substitute the name of one spouse for that of the other spouse as owner, coowner, or beneficiary pursuant to the decree. However, if the bond is registered in the name of one spouse with another person as coowner, there must be submitted either:

        (i) A request for reissue by the other person; or

        (ii) a certified copy of a judgment, decree, or court order entered in proceedings to which the other person and the spouse named on the bond are parties, determining the extent of the interest of that spouse in the bond. Reissue will be permitted only to the extent of that spouse's interest.

        (2) The evidence required under § 360.23 must be submitted in every case. When the divorce decree does not set out the terms of the property settlement agreement, a certified copy of the agreement must be submitted. Payment, rather than reissue, will be made if requested.

        (b)  When payment or reissue under this section is to be made, the rights of the parties will be those existing under the regulations current at the time of the entry of the final judgment, decree, or court order.

        § 360.23   Evidence.

#### § § 360.23

        (a)  To establish the validity of judicial proceedings, certified copies of the final judgment, decree, or court order, and of any necessary supplementary proceedings, must be submitted. If the judgment, decree, or court order was rendered more than six months prior to the presentation of the bond, there must also be submitted a certification from the clerk of the court, under court seal, dated within six months of the presentation of the bond, showing that the judgment, decree, or court order is in full force.

        (b)  A request for payment by a trustee in bankruptcy or a receiver of an insolvent's estate must be supported by appropriate evidence of appointment and qualification. The evidence must be certified by the clerk of the court, under court seal, as being in full force on a date that is not more than six months prior to the presentation of the bond.

        (c)  A request for payment by a receiver in equity or a similar court officer, other than a receiver of an insolvent's estate, must be supported by a copy of an order that authorizes the presentation of the bond for redemption, certified by the clerk of the court, under court seal, as being in full force on a date that is not more than six months prior to the presentation of the bond.

        § 360.24   Payment pursuant to judicial or administrative forfeiture.

The forfeited bonds and the completed Fiscal Service Form 1522 are to be mailed to the Department of the Treasury, Bureau of the Fiscal Service, Parkersburg, WV 26106-1328.

        (b)  (1) Upon receipt and review of the Fiscal Service Form 1522, as described in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, the Bureau of the Fiscal Service will make payment to the forfeiture fund specified on the form.

        (2) The Bureau of the Fiscal Service will record the forfeiture, the forfeiture fund into which the proceeds were paid, the contact point, and any related information.

        (3) The Bureau of the Fiscal Service will rely exclusively upon the information provided by the Federal agency in the Fiscal Service Form 1522 and will not make any independent evaluation of the validity of the forfeiture order, the request for payment, or the authority of the individual signing the request for payment.

        (4) The amount paid is limited to the redemption value of the savings bonds as of the date of forfeiture specified in the Fiscal Service Form 1522.

As a condition for granting relief, the Commissioner of the Fiscal Service, as designee of the Secretary of the Treasury, may require a bond of indemnity, in the form, and with the surety, or security, he or she considers necessary to protect the interests of the United States. In all cases, the claimant or claimants must identify the lost, stolen, destroyed, mutilated, or defaced savings bond or savings bonds by serial number or serial numbers and must submit satisfactory evidence of the loss, theft, or destruction, or a satisfactory explanation of the mutilation or defacement.

        § 360.26   Application for relief; after receipt of bond.

#### § § 360.26

        (e) If the application is approved on or before February 14, 2014, relief will be granted either by the issuance of a bond bearing the same issue date as the bond for which the claim was filed or by payment.

#### § § 360.37

        A savings bond registered in coownership form will be paid to either coowner upon surrender with an appropriate request, and upon payment (as determined in § 360.43), the other coowner will cease to have any interest in the bond.

#### § § 360.39

        (a)  The owner, coowner, or other person entitled to payment of a definitive Series I bond may present the bond to an authorized paying agent for redemption. The presenter must establish his or her identity and entitlement to payment in accordance with Treasury instructions and identification guidelines. The presenter must sign the request for payment on the bond or, if authorized, on a separate detached request, and add his or her address. If the request for payment has been signed, or signed and certified, before presentation of the bond, the paying agent must be satisfied that the person presenting the bond for payment is the owner, coowner, or other person entitled to payment, and may require the person to sign the request for payment again. If the bond is in order for payment, the paying agent will make payment at the current redemption value without charge to the presenter. Paying agents are not authorized to process any case involving partial redemption.

        (b)  In the case of definitive bonds to which the procedure in paragraph (a) of this section, does not apply, or if otherwise preferred, the owner or coowner, or other person entitled to payment should establish his or her identity to the satisfaction of an officer authorized by the regulations in this part to certify requests for payment, sign the requests for payment, and provide delivery information for the payment. The bonds must be forwarded to a designated Federal Reserve Bank or Branch or the Bureau of the Fiscal Service. Usually, payment will be expedited by submission to a designated Federal Reserve Bank or Branch. In all cases, the cost and risk of presentation of a bond will be borne by the owner. Payment will be made to the registered owner or other person entitled and will be delivered according to the instructions of the owner or the other person entitled and the regulations in this part.

        (c)  Requests executed more than six months before the date of receipt of a bond for payment will not be accepted. Neither will a bond be accepted if payment is requested as of a date more than three months in the future.

#### § § 360.40

        (a)  A bond may be paid by a paying agent or a designated Federal Reserve Bank or Branch without the owner's signature to the request for payment if the bond bears the special endorsement of a paying agent specifically qualified to place such an endorsement on savings bonds.

        (b)  A signature by mark (X) must be witnessed by at least one disinterested person and a certifying officer. See subpart I of this part. The witness must attest to the signature by mark substantially as follows: “Witness to signature by mark”, followed by his or her signature and address.

        (c)  If the name of the owner, coowner, or other person entitled to payment, as it appears in the registration or in any related evidence or documents has been changed in any legal manner, the signature to the request for payment must show both names and the manner in which the change was made; for example, “Mary T. Jones Smith (Mary T. J. Smith or Mary T. Smith) changed by marriage from Mary T. Jones”, or “John R. Young, changed by order of court from Hans R. Jung”. See § 360.50.

        (d)  A request for payment executed by an attorney-in-fact on behalf of the bond owner or other person entitled to payment of the bond will be recognized if it is accompanied by a copy of the power of attorney which meets the following requirements:

        (1) The power of attorney must bear the grantor's signature, properly certified or notarized, in accordance with applicable State law;

        (2) The power of attorney must grant, by its terms, authority for the attorney-in-fact to sell or redeem the grantor's securities, sell his or her personal property, or otherwise contain similar authority; and

        (3) In the case of a grantor who has become incapacitated, the power of attorney must conform with pertinent provisions of State law concerning its durability. Generally, in such circumstances, the power of attorney should provide that the authority granted will not be affected by the subsequent incompetence or incapacity of the grantor. Medical evidence or other proof of the grantor's condition may be required in any case.

        § 360.41   Partial redemption.

#### § § 360.41

        A bond may be redeemed in part at current redemption value, but only in amounts corresponding to authorized denominations, upon surrender of the bond to a designated Federal Reserve Bank or Branch or to the Bureau of the Fiscal Service in accordance with § 360.39(b). In any case in which partial redemption is requested, the phrase “to the extent of $_____ (face amount) and reissue of the remainder” should be added to the request.

For example, if the owner or either coowner of a bond dies after the bond has been surrendered for reissue, the bond will be regarded as having been reissued in the decedent's lifetime.

        § 360.47   Authorized reissue; during lifetime.

#### § § 360.47

        A bond belonging to a living individual may be reissued in any form of registration authorized by the regulations in this part upon an appropriate request under the conditions and for the purposes outlined in this section.

        (2) To name as new sole owner the personal trust estate created by at least one of the coowners or which designates as beneficiary at least one of the coowners.

        (c)  A bond registered in beneficiary form may be reissued:

        (1) To substitute another individual as beneficiary; or

        § 360.48   Restrictions on reissue; denominational exchange.

#### § § 360.48

        (a)  After February 14, 2014, the Department of the Treasury will no longer reissue Series I bonds in definitive (paper) form. After that date, a request for reissue of a Series I bond for any reason will only be processed under one of the following conditions:

        (1) If the new owner requests payment in the same transaction; or

        (2) If the new owner provides instructions to reissue in the form of a book-entry bond in a TreasuryDirect® account. This option is available for persons who are eligible to open a TreasuryDirect® account under the regulations in 31 CFR part 363.

        An owner, coowner, or beneficiary whose name is changed by marriage, divorce, annulment, order of court, or in any other legal manner after the issue of the bond should submit the bond with a request for reissue to substitute the new name for the name inscribed on the bond. Documentary evidence may be required in any appropriate case.

        § 360.51   Requests for reissue.

#### § § 360.51

        Subject to the conditions set out in this subpart, a request for reissue of bonds in coownership form must be signed by both coowners, except that a request solely to eliminate the name of one coowner may be signed by that coowner only.

#### § § 360.64

        (a)  (1) When an adult owner of bonds is incapable of requesting payment as a result of incapacity and there is no other person legally qualified to do so, the relative, or other person, responsible for the owner's care and support may submit an application for recognition as voluntary guardian for the purpose of redeeming the owner's bonds, if the total redemption value of all of the owner's bonds does not exceed $20,000. The bonds and application should be submitted to a designated Federal Reserve Bank or the Bureau of the Fiscal Service.

        (2) The redemption value of the bonds shall be determined as of the date the bonds are received, accompanied by an appropriate request for payment. If the total redemption value exceeds $20,000, a legal representative must be appointed, as set forth in § 360.60.

        (b)  (1) If the bonds have matured and ceased earning interest, they may be redeemed and the proceeds reinvested in any other savings bonds available. The new bonds must be registered in the name of the incapacitated person, followed by words showing that he or she is under voluntary guardianship; for example, “John Jones 123-45-6789, under voluntary guardianship”. A living coowner or beneficiary named on the matured bonds must be designated on the new bonds, unless such person furnishes a certified statement consenting to omission of his or her name.

        (2) If an amount insufficient to purchase an additional bond of any authorized denomination of savings bond remains after the reinvestment, the voluntary guardian may furnish additional funds sufficient to purchase another savings bond of the lowest available denomination.

#### § § 360.65

        A bond on which a minor or other person under legal disability is named as the owner or coowner, or in which he or she has an interest, may be reissued under the following conditions, but only in accordance with subpart H of this part:

        (a) A minor for whose estate no representative has been appointed may request reissue if the minor is of sufficient competency to sign his or her name to the request and to understand the nature of the transaction.

        (b) Except to the extent provided in paragraph (a) of this section, reissue will be restricted to a form of registration which does not adversely affect the existing ownership or interest of a minor or other person under legal disability. Requests for reissue should be executed by the person authorized to request payment under §§ 360.60 and 360.63, or the person who may request recognition as voluntary guardian under § 360.64.

      Subpart K—Deceased Owner, Coowner or Beneficiary

        § 360.70   General rules governing entitlement.

#### § § 360.70

        The rules in this section govern ownership or entitlement where one or both of the persons named on a bond have died without the bond having been surrendered for payment or reissue. Appropriate proof of death will be required.

        (a)  If the owner of a bond registered in single ownership form has died, the bond becomes the property of that decedent's estate, and payment or reissue will be made as provided in this subpart.

        (b) —(1)  If one of the coowners named on a bond has died, the surviving coowner will be recognized as the sole and absolute owner, and payment or reissue will be made as though the bond were registered in the name of the survivor alone. Any request for reissue by the surviving coowner must be supported by proof of death of the other coowner.

        (2)  If both coowners named on a bond have died, the bond becomes the property of the estate of the coowner who died last, and payment or reissue will be made as if the bond were registered in the name of the last deceased coowner alone. Proof of death of both coowners will be required to establish the order of death.

        (3)  If both coowners die under conditions where it cannot be established, either by presumption of law or otherwise, which coowner died first, the bond becomes the property of the estates of both equally, and payment or reissue will be made accordingly.

        (c) —(1)  If the owner of a bond registered in beneficiary form has died and is survived by the beneficiary, upon proof of death of the owner, the beneficiary will be recognized as the sole and absolute owner of the bond. Payment or reissue will be made as though the bond were registered in the survivor's name alone. A request for payment or reissue by the beneficiary must be supported by proof of death of the owner.

        (2)  If the beneficiary's death occurs before, or simultaneously with, that of the registered owner, payment or reissue will be made as though the bond were registered in the owner's name alone. Proof of death of the owner and beneficiary is required to establish the order of death.

        (d)  If the person who becomes entitled to a bond because of the death of an owner is an alien who is a resident of an area with respect to which the Department of the Treasury restricts or regulates the delivery of remittances, including checks and electronic payments, drawn against funds of the United States or its agencies or instrumentalities, delivery of the redemption payment will not be made so long as the restriction applies. See Department of the Treasury Circular No. 655, current revision (31 CFR part 211).

        § 360.71   Decedent's estate.

#### § § 360.71

        (a)  (1) A legal representative of a deceased owner's estate may request payment of savings bonds to the estate, or may distribute the savings bonds to the persons entitled.

        (2) Appropriate proof of appointment for the legal representative of the estate is required. Letters of appointment must be dated not more than one year prior to the date of submission of the letters of appointment.

        (b)  If the estate has been settled previously through judicial proceedings, the persons entitled may request payment or reissue of the savings bonds. A certified copy of the court-approved final accounting for the estate, the court's decree of distribution, or other appropriate evidence is required.

        (c)  If there is no formal or regular administration and no representative of the estate is to be appointed, the person appointed to receive or distribute the assets of a decedent's estate without regular administration under applicable local law summary or small estates procedures may request payment or reissue of savings bonds. Appropriate evidence is required.

        (d)  If the total redemption value of the Treasury securities and undelivered payments, if any, held directly on our records that are the property of the decedent's estate is greater than $100,000, administration of the decedent's estate will be required. The redemption value of savings bonds and the principal amount of marketable securities will be used to determine the value of securities, and will be determined as of the date of death. Administration may also be required at the discretion of the Department for any case.

        (e) —(1)  A voluntary representative is a person qualified according to paragraph (e)(3) of this section, to request payment or distribution of a decedent's savings bonds. The voluntary representative procedures are for the convenience of the Department; entitlement to the decedent's savings bonds and held payments, if any, is determined by the law of the jurisdiction in which the decedent was domiciled at the date of death. Voluntary representative procedures may be used only if:

        (i) There has been no administration, no administration is contemplated, and no summary or small estate procedures under applicable local law have been used;

        (ii) The total redemption value of the Treasury securities and held payments, if any, held directly on our records that are the property of the decedent's estate is $100,000 or less as of the date of death; and

        (iii) There is a person eligible to serve as the voluntary representative according to paragraph (e)(3) of this section.

        (2)  A voluntary representative may:

        (i) Redeem the decedent's savings bonds that are eligible for redemption on behalf of the persons entitled by the law of the jurisdiction in which the decedent was domiciled at the date of death;

        (ii) Distribute the decedent's savings bonds to the persons entitled by the law of the jurisdiction in which the decedent was domiciled at the date of death.

        (3)  An individual eighteen years of age or older may act as a voluntary representative according to the following order of precedence: A surviving spouse; if there is no surviving spouse, then a child of the decedent; if there are none of the above, then a descendant of a deceased child of the decedent; if there are none of the above, then a parent of the decedent; if there are none of the above, then a brother or sister of the decedent; if there are none of the above, then a descendant of a deceased brother or sister of the decedent; if there are none of the above, then a next of kin of the decedent, as determined by the law of the jurisdiction in which the decedent was domiciled at the date of death. As used in this order of precedence, child means a natural or adopted child of the decedent.

        (4)  By serving, the voluntary representative warrants that the distribution of payments or savings bonds is to the persons entitled by the law of the jurisdiction in which the decedent was domiciled at the date of death. The United States is not liable to any person for the improper distribution of payments or securities. Upon payment or distribution of the securities at the request of the voluntary representative, the United States is released to the same extent as if it had paid or delivered to a representative of the estate appointed pursuant to the law of the jurisdiction in which the decedent was domiciled at the date of death. The voluntary representative shall indemnify and hold harmless the United States and all creditors and persons entitled to the estate of the decedent. The amount of the indemnification is limited to an amount no greater than the value received by the voluntary representative.

        (f)  If there has been no administration, no administration is contemplated, no summary or small estate procedures under applicable local law have been used, and there is no person eligible to serve as a voluntary representative pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section, then a creditor may make a claim for payment of the amount of the debt, providing the debt has not been barred by applicable local law.

#### § § 360.72

      Subpart L—Fiduciaries

        § 360.75   Payment or reissue during the existence of the fiduciary estate.

#### § § 360.75

        (a)  A request for reissue or payment signed by at least one, but less than all, of the fiduciaries named in the registration shall be deemed sufficient and acceptable proof that less than all of the fiduciaries may properly execute the request. If the fiduciaries named in the registration are still acting, no further evidence will be required. In other cases, i.e., cases in which the fiduciary is not designated by name and title in the bond registration or a fiduciary designated in the bond registration is no longer acting, the request must be made in accordance with subparts J and K of this part.

        (b)  If a bond is registered in the name of a public or private corporation, such as a financial institution, or a governmental body as fiduciary, the request must be signed by an authorized officer in the name of the organization as fiduciary. Ordinarily, a signed and certified request will be accepted without further evidence.

        (c)  A bond held by a financial institution as a trustee may be reissued in the name of the institution as trustee of its common trust fund to the extent that participation in the common trust fund is authorized by law or regulation. The request for reissue should be executed by the institution and any co-trustee.

        (d)  If the fiduciary in whose name the bond is registered has been replaced by another fiduciary, a properly executed form or satisfactory evidence of successorship should be furnished.

        § 360.76   Payment or reissue after termination of the fiduciary estate.

#### § § 360.76

        A bond registered in the name or title of a fiduciary may be paid or reissued to the person who has become entitled by reason of the termination of an estate, other than a decedent's estate (see subpart K of this part). Requests for reissue made by a fiduciary pursuant to the termination of a fiduciary estate should be made on the appropriate form. Requests for payment or reissue by other than the fiduciary must be accompanied by evidence to show that the person has become entitled in accordance with applicable State law or otherwise. When two or more persons have become entitled, the request for payment or reissue must be signed by each of them.

      Subpart M—Escheat and Unclaimed Property Claims by States

        § 360.77   Payment to a State claiming title to abandoned bonds.

#### § § 360.77

        (a)  The Department of the Treasury may, in its discretion, recognize an escheat judgment that purports to vest a State with title to a definitive savings bond that has stopped earning interest and is in the State's possession, when the State presents evidence satisfactory to Treasury that the bond has been abandoned by all persons entitled to payment under Treasury regulations. A State claiming title to a definitive savings bond as the heir to a deceased owner must comply with the requirements of subpart L of this part, and not this section. Treasury will not recognize an escheat judgment that purports to vest a State with title to a bond that is still earning interest. Treasury also will not recognize an escheat judgment that purports to vest a State with title to a bond that the State does not possess, or a judgment that purports to grant the State custody of a bond, but not title.

        (b)  At a minimum, a State requesting payment under this section must demonstrate to Treasury's satisfaction that it made reasonable efforts to provide actual and constructive notice of the escheat proceeding to all persons listed on the face of the bond and all persons who may have an interest in the bond, and that those persons had an opportunity to be heard before the escheat judgment was entered.

        (c)  Payment to a State claiming title under this section fulfills the United States' obligations to the same extent as if payment had been made to the registered owner.

      Subpart B—General Provisions Governing Securities Held in TreasuryDirect

        §§ 363.7-363.8   [Reserved]

#### § §§ 363.7-363.8

        § 363.9   What does this subpart cover?

#### § § 363.9

        This subpart provides general rules governing securities held within the TreasuryDirect ® system. Provisions in the subparts governing specific securities that conflict with these general rules will supersede these general rules.

> [70 FR 57433, Sept. 30, 2005]

        § 363.10   What is a TreasuryDirect ® account?

#### § § 363.10

        A TreasuryDirect account is an online account maintained by us solely in your name in which you may hold and conduct transactions in eligible book-entry Treasury securities.

        (a)  The primary account is the account that you establish when initially opening your TreasuryDirect account. The primary account may contain the following Treasury securities:

        (1)  A primary account for an individual may contain Treasury securities purchased initially as book-entry securities that are your personal holdings registered in single owner, owner with beneficiary, and primary owner with secondary owner forms of registration; gifts of savings bonds that have not yet been delivered; and converted savings bonds that were transferred from the conversion linked account.

        (2)  A primary account for an entity may contain Treasury securities purchased initially as book-entry securities registered in the name of the entity and converted savings bonds in the name of the entity that were transferred from the conversion linked account.

        (b)  A linked account is an account that is a separate account from your primary account, but that is connected to your primary account. You use your primary account as a portal to open and access the linked account. Linked accounts include the following:

        (1)  A custom account is an account that is linked to your primary account. You use your primary account as the portal to open and access your custom account. You may informally designate a purpose for the custom account, for example, “vacation fund”, or “Johnny's college fund”. However, the designation as to purpose has no legal effect; the registration of the securities held in the custom account determines ownership (Annual purchase limitations include securities held in custom accounts). You, as an individual owner, may use your custom account to buy, redeem, and transfer securities that you own in single owner, owner with beneficiary, and primary owner with secondary owner forms of registration. An individual owner may also buy and deliver gift savings bonds from the custom account. An entity account manager, acting on behalf of an entity, may use the entity's custom account to buy, redeem, and transfer securities registered in the entity form of registration.

        (2)  A minor account is an account established by an individual custodian for an individual who has not yet reached the age of 18 years. We do not permit an entity to open a minor account. A minor account is linked to the custodian's primary account. The minor is the owner of the securities, but the custodian controls the account on behalf of the minor. (See § 363.27 for more information about minor accounts.)

        (3)  means a linked account in TreasuryDirect that contains only savings bonds that have been converted from definitive bonds to book-entry bonds.

        (c)  If a TreasuryDirect primary account and all associated linked accounts have had no holdings and no activity for a period of two years, we reserve the right to close the account, along with all linked accounts.

        (c) We do not permit a voluntary representative to purchase securities on behalf of the estate of a decedent.

        (d) We may reject any application for the purchase of a security, in whole or in part. We may refuse to issue a security in any case or class of cases, if we deem the action to be in the public interest. Our decision in any such respect is final.

        § 363.20   What do I need to know about the forms of registration that are available for purchases of securities through my TreasuryDirect ® account?

#### § § 363.20

        (a)  (1) Registration must express the actual ownership of, and interest in, the security. Registration conclusively establishes ownership of a security.

        (2) You must provide a last name and a first name for each individual included in the registration of the security.

        (3) You must provide the valid taxpayer identification number for each person named in the registration of the security.

        (b)  The forms of registration available for individuals for purchases of securities made through your TreasuryDirect account are single owner, owner with beneficiary, and primary owner with secondary owner, unless the forms of registration available for a security are specifically limited by the subpart governing that security.

        (1)  (i) A single owner is the individual named in the registration of a book-entry security or a converted savings bond without a beneficiary, secondary owner, or coowner.

        (ii) A single owner may add a beneficiary or secondary owner.

        (iii) A single owner may conduct permitted online transactions on securities held in his or her account.

        (iv) Upon the death of the single owner, his or her estate is entitled to the security. In determining entitlement, the law of the decedent's domicile will be followed.

        (v) Registration example: “John Doe, SSN 123-45-6789.”

        (2)  (i) The purchaser must be named as the owner with another individual as beneficiary.

        (ii) The owner may remove or change the beneficiary without the consent of the beneficiary.

        (iii) The owner may conduct permitted online transactions on securities held in his or her account without the consent of the beneficiary.

        (iv) The beneficiary has no ownership rights to the security during the owner's lifetime. Upon the death of the owner, the security becomes the property of the surviving beneficiary, despite any attempted testamentary disposition or any applicable local law to the contrary.

        (v) If the beneficiary does not survive the owner, the security belongs to the estate of the owner.

        (vi) If both the owner and the beneficiary die under conditions where it cannot be established, either by presumption of law or otherwise, who died first, the security is the property of the estate of the owner.

        (vii) In order for the beneficiary to obtain the security or the redemption proceeds after the death of the owner, the beneficiary must provide proof of death of the owner. If the beneficiary has a TreasuryDirect account, the security will be transferred to that account. If the beneficiary does not have an account, he or she may establish an account. Alternatively, a beneficiary named on a savings bond may request redemption. If the beneficiary requests redemption, he or she must provide ACH instructions for the payment.

        (viii) Registration example: “John Doe, SSN 123-45-6789 POD (payable on death to) Jane Doe, SSN 987-65-4321.”

        (ii) The primary owner holds the securities in his or her account and may view or conduct permitted online transactions in the securities.

        (iv) The secondary owner has no rights to view or conduct transactions in any security unless the primary owner gives the secondary owner these rights.

        (v) The primary owner may give the secondary owner the right to view any security or rights to view and conduct transactions in any security online from the account of the secondary owner.

        (vi) Once the right to conduct transactions in a security has been given to the secondary owner, the primary owner may view and conduct transactions in the security from the primary owner's account, and the secondary owner may view and conduct transactions in the security using the secondary owner's own account.

        (vii) The primary owner may revoke any rights previously given to the secondary owner at any time.

        (viii) Upon the death of either the primary or secondary owner, the security becomes the property of the survivor, despite any attempted testamentary disposition or any applicable local law to the contrary.

        (ix) If both the primary and the secondary owner die under conditions where it cannot be established, either by presumption of law or otherwise, who died first, the security is the property of the estate of the primary owner.

        (x) In order for the secondary owner to obtain the security or the security proceeds after the death of the primary owner, the secondary owner must provide proof of death of the primary owner. If the secondary owner has a TreasuryDirect account, the security will be transferred to that account. If the secondary owner does not have an account, he or she may establish an account. Alternatively, a secondary owner named on a savings bond may request redemption. If the secondary owner requests redemption, he or she must provide ACH instructions.

        (2)  A partnership form of registration is available for two or more individuals who are doing business as a partnership, including a limited liability partnership. Unless the name of a partnership includes the word “partnership,” the registration must include descriptive words indicating partnership status. The entity account manager must be a general partner, and must certify that he or she has the authority to act alone on behalf of the partnership with regard to this account. Registration example: “Smith and Jones Construction Company, a partnership, EIN 98-7654321, or SSN 987-65-4321.”

        (5)  A trust form of registration is available. The trust form of registration is not available for trusts in which the trustee is acting on behalf of a federal, state, or local government. The registration must identify the trust with specificity; at a minimum, it must include the authority or document creating the trust, the date the document was executed (except in the case of a probated will when the date is not necessary), the name of a trustee of the trust who is authorized to act alone on behalf of the trust with regard to the account, and any information that is necessary to distinguish the trust from any other trust. The registration may also include the names of additional trustees and the full name of the trust. If one or more of the trustees are individuals, and the entity account manager is an individual trustee, the entity account manager must be named in the registration. If an organization serving as a trustee of the trust will administer this account, the entity account manager must be a duly authorized employee of that organization who has the authority to act alone on behalf of the organization in its role as trustee of the trust with regard to the account, and the organization must be named in the registration. In either case, the entity account manager must certify that he or she has the authority to act alone on behalf of the trust with regard to the account. Registration examples: “John Doe, Trustee under Declaration of Trust dated January 1, 2001, SSN 123-45-6789”; “First National Bank, Trustee under Agreement with William Jones dated January 1, 2001, EIN 12-3456789”; “John Doe or Sarah Jones, Trustees under Agreement with Jane Doe dated January 1, 2001, SSN 123-45-6789”; “Sarah Jones, Trustee under the Will of Matthew Smith, deceased, SSN 123-45-6789”; “Jane Doe, Trustee of the Doe Family Trust dated January 1, 2001, EIN 12-3456789.”

        (6)  The decedent's estate form of registration is available for an individual or organization that has been appointed by a court according to state law to act on behalf of the estate of a decedent. This form of registration is not available where the legal representative is acting on behalf of a federal, state, or local government. The entity account manager must be a court-appointed individual legal representative who has the authority to act alone with regard to the account, or an employee of the court-appointed organizational legal representative who has the authority to act alone with regard to the account on behalf of the organization in its role as legal representative of the estate. Registration example: “John Doe, Legal Representative of the Estate of William Jones, a decedent, EIN 12-3456789, or SSN 123-45-6789.”

        (7)  A form of registration is available for an individual or organization that has been appointed according to state law to act on behalf of the estate of an incompetent person, a minor, or other living person. This form of registration is not available where the legal guardian is acting on behalf of a federal, state, or local government. The entity account manager must be a court-appointed legal guardian who has the authority to act alone with regard to the account, or an employee of the court-appointed organizational legal guardian who has the authority to act alone with regard to the account on behalf of the organization in its role as legal guardian. Registration example: “John Doe, Legal Guardian of the estate of William Jones.” The SSN of the incompetent person or the minor will be used.

#### § § 363.22

        (a) —(1)  A single owner can conduct transactions in securities held in his or her TreasuryDirect ® account.

        (2)  The owner can conduct transactions in securities held in his or her TreasuryDirect account. The beneficiary has no rights during the lifetime of the owner and therefore cannot conduct transactions in the securities.

        (3)  (i) The primary owner can conduct any permitted transaction in a security held in the primary owner's TreasuryDirect account. (See § 363.20(e)).

        (ii) If the primary owner has given the secondary owner the right to conduct transactions in a security, and has not revoked that right, then the secondary owner can conduct transactions in the security. Transactions that may be conducted by the secondary owner include transferring a marketable security, redeeming a savings bond, and changing the destination of interest and redemption payments for marketable securities.

        (b)  The rules for transactions governing converted savings bonds are contained in subpart E of this part.

        (c)  The entity account manager can conduct transactions in the securities held within the entity's account. Initially, the entity account manager is the individual who opens the account. The entity account manager may be changed to a different individual using procedures available on our Web site. The entity account manager must certify that he or she is authorized to act alone on behalf of the entity in accessing and conducting transactions on behalf of the entity with regard to the entity's account.

        § 363.27   What do I need to know about accounts for minors who have not had a legal guardian appointed by a court?

#### § § 363.27

        (a) We do not permit a minor to purchase securities.

        (b)  (1) A parent or an individual who provides the chief financial support of a minor may open an account for a minor. The person opening the account for a minor is referred to as the custodian of the minor's account.

        (2) The custodian is a fiduciary for the minor as to the securities held in the minor's account.

        (3) The custodian must have an existing primary TreasuryDirect ® account in order to open the minor's account.

        (i) The minor's account is an account that is linked to the custodian's primary account.

        (ii) The custodian must use his or her primary TreasuryDirect account as a portal to open and access the minor's account.

        (4) Securities contained in the minor's account will be registered in the name and SSN of the minor, in either sole owner, owner with beneficiary, or primary owner with secondary owner forms of registration.

        (c)  (1) Online instructions will be provided for establishing an account for a minor.

        (2) The custodian must certify that all transactions conducted through the account will be on the minor's behalf.

        (d)  The custodian must conduct all transactions in the minor's account on behalf of the minor. Access to the minor's account is through the custodian's primary account.

        (e)  (1) The custodian may purchase securities for and on behalf of the minor through the minor's account.

        (2) The custodian may redeem savings bonds on behalf of the minor through the minor's account. We will report the interest earned on the security to the name and SSN of the minor.

        (3) The custodian may not purchase gift savings bonds from the minor's account.

        (4) The custodian may transfer a security to another TreasuryDirect account, provided the account is a linked account bearing the name and taxpayer identification number of the minor. The custodian can transfer a marketable Treasury security to an account in the commercial book-entry system.

        (5) Securities may be transferred to the minor's account.

        (6) Gift savings bonds may be delivered to the minor's account.

        (7) The custodian may grant rights to view and conduct transactions in the security as may be permitted by § 363.22.

        (8) The custodian may purchase a zero-percent certificate of indebtedness on behalf of the minor. The zero-percent certificate of indebtedness is the property of the minor.

        (f)  (1) The only transactions that the custodian may make in the minor's account after the minor attains the age of 18 years are to purchase new securities, and to transfer the securities contained in the minor's account to another account in the name and SSN of the minor. The receiving account in the name and SSN of the minor may be a primary account established by the minor, or it may be another minor linked account with the same or a different custodian. The custodian may transfer one or more of the securities at a time, or the custodian may de-link the account and transfer all of the securities contained in the account to the minor's previously established primary TreasuryDirect account. The minor must establish his or her own primary TreasuryDirect account prior to transfer of his or her securities.

        (2) In order to gain control of the securities held in the minor's account, the minor must first open his or her own primary account.

        (3) The minor may gain control of the securities held in the minor's account by the custodian transferring the securities held in the minor's account to the minor's primary account, or the minor may request that Fiscal Service transfer the securities to his or her primary account.

        (4) The minor may gain control of his or her zero-percent certificate of indebtedness by the custodian de-linking the account and transferring the zero-percent certificate of indebtedness to the minor's primary account, or the minor may request that Fiscal Service de-link the account and transfer the zero-percent certificate of indebtedness to his or her primary account.

        (g)  We rely on the certification of the custodian that he or she is acting on behalf of the minor. We are not liable to the minor, or any other person or party acting on behalf of the minor, for the actions of the custodian, nor are we liable for the application of any proceeds from the transfer or redemption of securities held in the minor's account. The custodian agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the United States in the event that we suffer any loss on account of any claim relating to a minor account.

        (a) Refuse to open an account for any person;

        (b) Close any existing account, redeem, sell, or liquidate the securities held in the account, and pay the proceeds to the person entitled;

        § 363.30   What actions may Treasury take if funds used to purchase a security were credited or debited in error or through fraud?

#### § § 363.30

        (a) If Treasury sustains a loss because the funds used to purchase a security were debited from an account at a financial institution from which the TreasuryDirect account owner did not have the right to authorize such ACH debit entry, we reserve the right to redeem that security from the account and use the proceeds to reimburse Treasury for the loss. If such security has been transferred to another TreasuryDirect account, we reserve the right to reverse the transfer, redeem the security, and use the proceeds to reimburse Treasury for the loss. If such security has been redeemed or has matured and the proceeds paid to the account owner, we reserve the right to take any action that we deem appropriate, including redeeming other securities remaining in the account and using the proceeds to reimburse Treasury for the loss.

        (b) If an employer or a third-party agent acting on behalf of one or more employers certifies, under penalty of perjury, that it has made an erroneous ACH credit entry to purchase a TreasuryDirect certificate of indebtedness, we reserve the right to redeem securities from the TreasuryDirect account to which the entry was made in the amount of the erroneous entry and return the funds. No action will be taken if the certification is not received by Treasury within 45 days of the erroneous entry. We will only return funds if the erroneous entry was made to an account that does not belong to the intended recipient, is a duplicate payment, is in an amount that is greater than was authorized by the recipient, or was made in error because the employee was not in a pay status. We reserve the right to refuse to return an entry. By requesting that Treasury correct an erroneous entry, the employer agrees to indemnify Treasury for any loss that Treasury may incur as a result of the correction of the error and agrees to provide such information and assistance as Treasury may require.

        (c) If a financial institution, except a financial institution acting on behalf of an employer, makes an erroneous ACH credit entry to a TreasuryDirect® account and provides a certification as to the circumstances of the erroneous entry within 6 months of the entry date, we will notify the account owner of the erroneous ACH credit entry and attempt to resolve the issue. We reserve the right to place a hold on and to redeem securities from the TreasuryDirect® account to which the ACH credit entry was made in the amount of the erroneous credit entry and return the funds to the financial institution. The financial institution agrees to indemnify Treasury for any loss that Treasury may incur as a result of the correction of the error and agrees to provide information and assistance as Treasury may require.

        § 363.43   What are the procedures for certifying my signature on an offline application for a TreasuryDirect ® account, or on an offline transaction form?

#### § § 363.43

        (a)  For certifications within the United States, the certifying individual must be authorized to bind his or her institution by his or her acts, to guarantee signatures to assignments of securities, or to certify assignments of securities. The following table provides a list of authorized certifying individuals and the required evidence of authority. Members of Treasury-recognized signature guarantee programs are for security transfers only.

        (b)  The following table lists the authorized certifying individuals for foreign countries and the required evidence of the individual's authority.

        (c)  (1) The certifying individual must first establish the identity of the signer.

        (2) The form must be signed in the presence of the certifying individual.

        (3) If the certifying individual is not an officer, the certifying individual must insert the words “Authorized Signature” in the space provided for the title.

        (4) If the certifying individual is negligent in making the certification, the certifying individual and his or her organization are jointly and severally liable for any loss the United States may incur as a result of the negligence.

        (d)  (1) A security or other form requiring certification need not be executed in the presence of a certifying individual if the signature is unconditionally guaranteed by the certifying individual. To guarantee a signature, the certifying individual must add a dated endorsement after the signature. For example:

        (2) The certifying individual and his or her organization unconditionally guarantee to us that the signature is genuine and the signer had the legal capacity to execute the assignment or related form.

        (e)  (1) A form requiring a certified signature need not be signed when a certifying individual associated with a depository financial institution places the following endorsement on the security or the form:

        (2) The endorsement must be dated and the seal of the institution must be added.

        (3) This form of endorsement is an unconditional guarantee to us that the institution is acting for the signer under proper authorization.

        (f)  Any person having an interest in a security involved in the transaction cannot act as a certifying individual. However, an authorized officer or employee of a depository financial institution that is a member of a Treasury-recognized signature guarantee program can act as a certifying individual for transfer of a security to the institution or on behalf of the institution.

        § 363.44   What happens when a TreasuryDirect ® account owner dies and the estate is entitled to securities held in the account?

#### § § 363.44

        (a)  For an estate that is being administered, the legal representative of the estate must open a TreasuryDirect account in the name of the estate in order to conduct transactions. The legal representative of the estate may then conduct any transactions that are available to an individual account owner. We will require appropriate proof of appointment for the legal representative of the estate. Letters of appointment must be dated not more than one year prior to the date of submission of the letters of appointment.

        (b)  If the estate has been settled previously through judicial proceedings, the persons entitled may request payment of securities, if the securities are eligible for redemption, or may transfer the securities to the TreasuryDirect accounts of the persons entitled, if the securities are eligible for transfer. We will require a certified copy of the court-approved final accounting for the estate, the court's decree of distribution, or other appropriate evidence. If payment is requested, we will require ACH instructions to process the request.

        (c)  If there is no formal or regular administration and no representative of the estate is to be appointed, the person appointed to receive or distribute the assets of a decedent's estate without regular administration under summary or small estates procedures under applicable local law may request payment of securities, if the securities are eligible for redemption, or may transfer the securities to or on behalf of the persons entitled by the law of the jurisdiction in which the decedent was domiciled at the date of death, if the securities are eligible for transfer. We will require appropriate evidence. If payment is requested, we will require ACH instructions to process the request.

        (d)  If the total redemption value of the Treasury securities and undelivered payments, if any, held directly on our records that are the property of the decedent's estate is greater than $100,000, administration of the decedent's estate will be required. The redemption value of savings bonds and the principal amount of marketable securities will be used to determine the value of securities, and will be determined as of the date of death. Administration may also be required at the discretion of the Department for any case.

        (e) —(1)  A voluntary representative is a person qualified according to paragraph (e)(3) of this section, to redeem or transfer a decedent's securities. The voluntary representative procedures are for the convenience of the Department; entitlement to the decedent's securities and held payments, if any, is determined by the law of the jurisdiction in which the decedent was domiciled at the date of death. Voluntary representative procedures may be used only if:

        (i) There has been no administration, no administration is contemplated, and no summary or small estate procedures under applicable local law have been used;

        (ii) The total redemption value of the Treasury securities and held payments, if any, held directly on our records that are the property of the decedent's estate is $100,000 or less, as of the date of death, and

        (iii) There is a person eligible to serve as the voluntary representative according to paragraph (e)(3) of this section.

        (2)  A voluntary representative may:

        (i) Redeem the decedent's savings bonds that are eligible for redemption. Payment may be made to the voluntary representative on behalf of or directly to the persons entitled by the law of the jurisdiction in which the decedent was domiciled at the date of death;

        (ii) Transfer the decedent's securities to the persons entitled by the law of the jurisdiction in which the decedent was domiciled at the date of death.

        (3)  An individual eighteen years of age or older may act as a voluntary representative according to the following order of precedence: a surviving spouse; if there is no surviving spouse, then a child of the decedent; if there are none of the above, then a descendant of a deceased child of the decedent; if there are none of the above, then a parent of the decedent; if there are none of the above, then a brother or sister of the decedent; if there are none of the above, then a descendant of a deceased brother or sister of the decedent; if there are none of the above, then a next of kin of the decedent, as determined by the laws of the decedent's domicile at the date of death. As used in this order of precedence, child means a natural or adopted child of the decedent.

        (4)  By serving, the voluntary representative warrants that the distribution of payments or securities are to or on behalf of the persons entitled by the law of the jurisdiction in which the decedent was domiciled at the date of death. The United States is not liable to any person for the improper distribution of payments or securities. Upon payment or transfer of the securities to the voluntary representative, the United States is released to the same extent as if it had paid or delivered to a representative of the estate appointed pursuant to the law of the jurisdiction in which the decedent was domiciled at the date of death. The voluntary representative shall indemnify and hold harmless the United States and all creditors and persons entitled to the estate of the decedent. The amount of the indemnification is limited to an amount no greater than the value received by the voluntary representative.

        (5)  If there has been no administration, no administration is contemplated, no summary or small estate procedures under applicable local law have been used, and there is no person eligible to serve as a voluntary representative pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section, then a creditor may make a claim for payment of the amount of the debt, providing the debt has not been barred by applicable local law.

        § 363.45   What are the rules for judicial and administrative actions involving securities held in TreasuryDirect ®?

#### § § 363.45

        (a)  We are not subject to and will not accept a notice of an adverse claim or notice of pending judicial proceedings involving a security held in TreasuryDirect.

        (b)  The Department of the Treasury, Fiscal Service, and the Federal Reserve Banks are not proper defendants in a judicial proceeding involving competing claims to a security held in TreasuryDirect.

        (c)  We will recognize a divorce decree that either disposes of a security held in TreasuryDirect or ratifies a property settlement agreement disposing of a security that is the property of either of the parties. If the divorce decree does not set out the terms of the property settlement agreement, we will require a certified copy of the agreement.

        (d)  We will recognize a final order entered by a court that affects ownership rights in a security held in TreasuryDirect only to the extent that the order is consistent with the provisions of this part. The owner of the security must be a party to the proceedings.

        (e)  We will honor a transaction request submitted by a person appointed by a court and having authority under an order of a court to dispose of a security held in TreasuryDirect pursuant to a money judgment against the owner of the security, as owner is defined in § 363.6 of this part. In the case of savings bonds, we will only make payment pursuant to the court order to the extent of the money judgment. We will not transfer the savings bonds.

        (f)  We will honor an IRS notice of levy under section 6331 of the Internal Revenue Code:

        (1) Against the owner, as owner is defined in § 363.6 of this part, including a levy against the owner in the capacity of nominee, transferee, or alter ego;

        (2) Against a secondary owner, if the secondary owner has the right to conduct transactions in a security at the date and time the notice of levy is delivered to Fiscal Service; or

        (3) Against an owner's property to which a federal tax lien is attached.

        (g)  We will honor a transaction request submitted by a trustee in bankruptcy, a receiver of an insolvent's estate, a receiver in equity, or a similar court officer, if the original court order is against the owner, as owner is defined in § 363.6 of this part. In the case of savings bonds, we will only make payment. We will not transfer the savings bonds.

        (h)  We will not recognize a court order that attempts to defeat or impair the survivorship rights of a beneficiary, secondary owner, coowner of a converted savings bond, or the registered owner of an undelivered gift security held in TreasuryDirect.

        § 363.47   Will Fiscal Service pay Treasury securities pursuant to a forfeiture proceeding?

#### § § 363.47

        (a)  We will honor a judicial or administrative forfeiture order or declaration of forfeiture submitted by a federal agency. We will rely exclusively upon the information provided by the Federal forfeiting agency and will not make any independent evaluation of the validity of the forfeiture order, the request for payment, or the authority of the individual signing the transaction request. The amount to be paid or transferred is limited to the value of the security as of the date of forfeiture.

        (b)

        means the individual designated by the Federal investigative agency, United States Attorney's Office, or forfeiting agency, to receive referrals from Fiscal Service.

        means the federal law enforcement agency responsible for the forfeiture.

        means the process by which property may be forfeited by a federal agency. Administrative forfeiture is forfeiture by a federal agency without judicial proceedings resulting in a declaration of forfeiture; judicial forfeiture is a forfeiture through either a civil or criminal proceeding in a United States District Court resulting in a final judgment and order of forfeiture.

        (c)  A forfeiting agency must request forfeiture. An individual authorized by the forfeiting agency must sign the transaction request. The request must be mailed to the Department of the Treasury, Bureau of the Fiscal Service, Parkersburg, WV 26106-7015.

        (d)  Upon receipt and review of the transaction request, we will make payment to the forfeiture fund specified, if the security is eligible for payment, or we will transfer the security pursuant to the transaction request. We will record the forfeiture, the forfeiture fund into which the proceeds were paid or the security transfer records, the contact point, and any related information.

        (e)  All inquiries or claims from the previous owner will be referred to the contact point of the forfeiting agency. We will tell the person who inquired that we referred his or her inquiry to the contact point. We will not investigate the inquiry. We will defer to the forfeiting agency's determination of the appropriate course of action, including settlement where appropriate. Any settlement will be paid from the forfeiture fund into which the proceeds were deposited.

          § 363.131   What is a TreasuryDirect ® zero-percent certificate of indebtedness?

#### § § 363.131

          A TreasuryDirect® zero-percent certificate of indebtedness is a non-interest-bearing security that is issued daily, with a one-day maturity, which automatically rolls over at maturity until you request redemption. A zero-percent certificate of indebtedness has a minimum purchase amount of one cent. The only purpose of a zero-percent certificate of indebtedness is to accumulate funds for the purchase of another eligible security in the TreasuryDirect system. A zero-percent certificate of indebtedness within a minor's account is the property of the minor alone. The payroll zero-percent certificate of indebtedness is a restricted form of the zero-percent certificate of indebtedness that is held separately from the zero-percent certificate of indebtedness and used only for purchases made through the payroll savings plan.

#### § § 363.143

          You may purchase an eligible security by redeeming all or a portion of your zero-percent certificate of indebtedness and applying the proceeds toward the purchase of another eligible security.

#### § § 363.161

        Series E, Series EE, and Series I savings bonds issued in denominations of $25 or greater are eligible for conversion to book-entry bonds in TreasuryDirect ®.

#### § § 363.162

        The owner of a TreasuryDirect ® primary account may convert a definitive savings bond.

        (1) The owner of a definitive savings bond registered in the single owner or entity form of registration;

        (2) Either co-owner of a bond registered in the coowner form of registration; and

> [74 FR 19420, Apr. 29, 2009]

        § 363.163   How do I convert an eligible definitive savings bond?

#### § § 363.163

        We will provide online instructions for converting your definitive savings bond. You must surrender to us the definitive bond to be converted at the time of conversion.

        § 363.164   Is a converted savings bond eligible to be converted back into a definitive bond?

#### § § 363.164

        Once a definitive savings bond has been converted to a book-entry bond, it may not be converted back into a definitive bond.

        § 363.165   What happens when I convert a savings bond that is registered in my name as a single owner, either coowner, an owner with a beneficiary, or an entity?

#### § § 363.165

        (a)  When the conversion is approved, an unmatured savings bond that is registered in the name of the TreasuryDirect ® account owner as a single owner, either coowner, an owner with beneficiary, or an entity, will be released to the account owner's conversion linked account.

        (b)  A savings bond that has reached final maturity and is registered in the name of the TreasuryDirect account owner as a single owner, either coowner, an owner with beneficiary, or an entity, will be converted to a book-entry savings bond and automatically redeemed. The redemption proceeds will be used to purchase a zero-percent certificate of indebtedness in the account owner's name in the primary account.

> [74 FR 19420, Apr. 29, 2009]

        § 363.166   What happens when I convert a savings bond that is not registered in my name as owner, either coowner, or owner with beneficiary (including a bond registered in the name of a minor)?

#### § § 363.166

        We will presume that a savings bond registered in the name of someone other than the TreasuryDirect ® account owner (including a bond registered in the name of a minor) was purchased by the account owner as a gift for the registered owner. We will not permit an entity to convert a savings bond that is not registered in the name of the entity.

        (a) —(1)  An unmatured savings bond registered in the name of someone other than the account owner will be converted to a book-entry bond, released as a gift bond to the account owner's conversion linked account, and held until delivered to the TreasuryDirect account (or minor linked account, if the registered owner is a minor) of the registered owner.

        (2)  The TreasuryDirect account owner may deliver the converted gift bond to the TreasuryDirect account (or minor linked account, if the registered owner is a minor) of the registered owner, or, if the bond is registered in the coowner form of registration, to the account of either coowner. A bond registered in coowner or owner with beneficiary form of registration will retain the coowner or beneficiary form of registration upon delivery.

        (b) —(1)  A savings bond that has reached final maturity and is registered in the name of someone other than the account owner will be converted to a book-entry bond, released as a gift bond into the account owner's conversion linked account, and automatically redeemed. We will hold the redemption proceeds in the name of the registered owner of the definitive bond until the proceeds are delivered to the TreasuryDirect account (or minor linked account, if the registered owner is a minor) of the registered owner.

        (2)  If the gift bond has reached final maturity and has been automatically redeemed, then the Treasury Direct account owner may direct that the held redemption proceeds be delivered to the Treasury Direct account of the registered owner (or minor linked account, if the registered owner is a minor), where we will use the proceeds to purchase a zero-percent certificate of indebtedness in the name of the registered owner. If the bond is registered in the coowner form of registration, the account owner may direct that the held redemption proceeds be delivered to the account of either coowner, where we will use the proceeds to purchase a zero-percent certificate of indebtedness in the name of the coowner to whose account the bond was delivered.

        § 363.167   How will a converted savings bond be registered?

#### § § 363.167

        The registration of the converted bond will be the same as on the definitive bond, provided that it was registered properly in an authorized form of registration. We will change a definitive savings bond that was not registered in an authorized form of registration to the closest authorized form of registration. For example, a definitive savings bond erroneously registered “John Doe and Jane Doe” will be changed to “John Doe or Jane Doe.” We are not liable to any person for any such decision as to the closest form of authorized registration.

        § 363.168   What rules regarding registration apply to a converted savings bond?

#### § § 363.168

        (a)  By converting a definitive bond of any eligible series registered in the single owner or entity form of registration to book-entry in TreasuryDirect ®, the owner has consented to the bond being governed by the rules regarding registration contained in subpart C of this part.

        (b)  By converting a definitive bond of Series EE or Series I registered in an owner with beneficiary form of registration to a book-entry bond in TreasuryDirect, the owner has consented to the bond being governed by the rules regarding registration contained in subpart C of this part.

        (c)  The registration of a converted savings bond of Series E registered in the owner with beneficiary form of registration may be changed upon the request of the owner and the consent of the beneficiary. The transaction will not be conducted through the registered owner's TreasuryDirect account.

        (d)  The registration of a converted savings bond of any eligible series registered in the coowner form of registration may be changed upon the request of one coowner and the consent of the other coowner. The transaction will not be conducted through the registered owner's TreasuryDirect account.

        § 363.169   What transactions can I conduct in a converted savings bond on which I am registered as the single owner, either coowner, the owner with a beneficiary, or an entity?

#### § § 363.169

        (a)  By converting a definitive savings bond of any series registered in the single owner or entity form of registration to a book-entry bond, you have consented to the bond being treated as if it were originally issued as a book-entry bond in TreasuryDirect ®. The bond will be subject to the provisions of subpart C of this part. Any transaction available for a book-entry bond originally issued in the TreasuryDirect system is available for a converted bond registered in single owner or entity form of registration.

        (b)  By converting a definitive savings bond registered in the owner with beneficiary form of registration to a book-entry bond, you have consented to the bond being treated as if it were originally issued as a book-entry bond in TreasuryDirect. The bond will be subject to the provisions of subpart C of this part. Any transaction available for a book-entry bond purchased in the TreasuryDirect system is available for a converted bond of Series EE and Series I registered in the owner with beneficiary form of registration.

        (c)  The owner of a converted Series E bond registered in the owner with beneficiary form of registration may make the following transactions:

        (1)  The owner may provide the beneficiary with the right to view the bond in the beneficiary's TreasuryDirect account. Once the right to view the bond is provided to the beneficiary, the owner may not revoke that right.

        (2)  The owner may transfer the bond without a change of registration to another account in the name of the owner.

        (3)  The owner may remove the beneficiary's name from the registration with the consent of the beneficiary. The transaction will not be conducted through the registered owner's TreasuryDirect account. The bond will be changed to the single owner form of registration. Once the transaction is completed, the bond will be treated as a bond originally issued as a book-entry bond in TreasuryDirect, and will be subject to subpart C of this part. The owner may then perform any transaction available for book-entry bonds purchased in the TreasuryDirect system.

        (4)  The owner may remove his or her name from the registration and transfer the bond to the account of the beneficiary or a third party, with the consent of the beneficiary. The transaction will not be conducted through the registered owner's TreasuryDirect account. The bond will be transferred in the single owner form of registration. Once the transfer is completed, the bond will be treated as a bond originally issued as a book-entry bond in TreasuryDirect, and will be subject to subpart C of this part. The owner may then perform any transaction available for book-entry bonds purchased in the TreasuryDirect system.

        (d)  The converting coowner of a converted bond registered in the coowner form of registration may make the following transactions:

        (1)  The converting coowner may provide the non-converting coowner with the rights to view the bond or to view and redeem the bond through the non-converting coowner's TreasuryDirect account. Once either of these rights is provided to the non-converting coowner, the converting coowner may not revoke the right.

        (2)  The converting coowner may transfer the bond without a change in registration to another account in the name of the converting coowner. The bond may be transferred without the consent of the non-converting coowner, and will retain the coowner registration.

        (3)  The converting coowner (or the non-converting coowner, if the bond has been previously transferred to the account of the non-converting coowner) may remove the other coowner from the registration. The consent of the other coowner is required. The bond must reside in the account of the coowner who is requesting the transaction. The transaction will not be conducted through the registered owner's TreasuryDirect account. The bond's registration will be changed to the single owner form of registration. Once this transaction is completed, the bond will be treated as a bond originally issued as a book-entry bond in TreasuryDirect, and will be subject to subpart C of this part. The owner may then perform any transaction available for book-entry bonds purchased in the TreasuryDirect system.

        (4)  The converting coowner may remove his or her name from the registration and transfer the bond to either the account of the non-converting coowner or to the account of a third party. The consent of the non-converting coowner is required. The transaction will not be conducted through the registered owner's TreasuryDirect account. The bond will be transferred in the single owner form of registration. Once the transfer is completed, the bond will be treated as a bond originally issued as a book-entry bond in TreasuryDirect, and will be subject to subpart C of this part. The owner may then perform any transaction available for book-entry bonds purchased in the TreasuryDirect system.

#### § § 363.170

        The only transaction that you may conduct on a savings bond that you converted on which you are not registered as the owner, either coowner, or owner with beneficiary is to deliver the converted bond to the TreasuryDirect ® account of the registered owner.

        § 363.171   How do I redeem a converted savings bond?

#### § § 363.171

        (a) —(1)  You may redeem your converted savings bond of any series registered either in the single owner, owner with beneficiary, or entity form of registration any time prior to final maturity after the minimum holding period through your TreasuryDirect ® account.

        (2)  The converting coowner may redeem the converted savings bond of any series registered in the coowner form of registration at any time prior to final maturity after the minimum holding period through his or her TreasuryDirect account. The non-converting coowner may redeem the converted savings bond at any time prior to final maturity after the minimum holding period provided that he or she has been granted transaction rights in the converted bond by the converting coowner.

        (b) —(1)  If you have not previously redeemed or transferred your converted savings bond of any series registered in the single owner, owner with beneficiary, coowner, or entity forms of registration, it will be automatically redeemed for you at final maturity.

        (2) The redemption proceeds will be automatically used to purchase a zero-percent certificate of indebtedness registered in your name and held in your TreasuryDirect account.

#### § § 363.200

        This subpart provides the rules for holding marketable Treasury bills, notes, and bonds in book-entry form in TreasuryDirect ®.

        § 363.201   What other regulations govern book-entry marketable book-entry Treasury bills, notes, and bonds?

        (b) 31 CFR part 357 governs holding marketable book-entry Treasury bills, notes, and bonds in the Legacy Treasury Direct system and in the commercial book-entry system.

        § 363.202   What marketable Treasury securities may I purchase and hold through my TreasuryDirect ® account?

#### § § 363.202

        (a)  (1)  You may purchase any marketable Treasury security that is available for purchase through the TreasuryDirect ® website. One day each week, marketable securities that are scheduled for auction within 8 weeks will be made available on the TreasuryDirect website for scheduling an advance purchase, and are the only marketable securities that you can schedule for advance purchase.

        (2)  (i) Any marketable security purchase scheduled prior to May 15, 2010, and with an effective issue date of May 15, 2010, through July 9, 2010, will be treated as a new purchase, even if the transaction would have been treated as a reinvestment under the rules in effect prior to May 15, 2010.

        (ii) Any marketable security purchase scheduled prior to May 15, 2010, with an effective issue date after July 9, 2010, will be canceled.

        (b)  You may transfer into the system and maintain in your TreasuryDirect account any eligible marketable book-entry Treasury bill, note, or bond.

        § 363.203   After I purchase my marketable Treasury security in TreasuryDirect ®, is there a period of time during which I may not transfer the security?

#### § § 363.203

        Once you purchase a marketable Treasury security in TreasuryDirect, you may not transfer that security for a period of 45 calendar days after the issue date of the security, or the term of the security, whichever is less.

        § 363.204   What registrations are available for my marketable Treasury securities held in TreasuryDirect ®?

#### § § 363.204

        You may register your marketable Treasury securities in any form of registration permitted by § 363.20 of this part.

        § 363.205   How do I reinvest the proceeds of a maturing security held in TreasuryDirect ®?

#### § § 363.205

        (a)  The only method of reinvesting a maturing marketable security in TreasuryDirect ® is through the automatic reinvestment option available in your TreasuryDirect account. Purchasing a security by directing that the proceeds of a maturing security be used to purchase a zero-percent certificate of indebtedness, and then scheduling the purchase of a new security using the redemption proceeds of the zero-percent certificate of indebtedness, is not a reinvestment.

        (b)  You can schedule your reinvestment either at the time of purchase or after the security is issued into your TreasuryDirect account. You cannot schedule, edit, or cancel a reinvestment when the maturing security goes into a closed book period, or when a noncompetitive bid for the replacement security is no longer accepted, whichever comes first.

        (c)  Any marketable security can be reinvested.

        (d)  Reinvestments will be limited at any one time to 25 times for a 4-week bill, 7 times for a 13-week bill, 3 times for a 26-week bill, and once for all other marketable security types.

        (e)  If there is no security available for reinvestment with an issue date that coincides with the maturity date or call date, if invoked, of the maturing security, and with the same type and term, the scheduled reinvestment will be canceled and the proceeds of the maturing security will be returned to the customer.

        (f)  If there are insufficient funds from the maturing security to pay the full purchase price of the replacement security, we will either debit your primary account at a financial institution or pay the additional funds using the redemption proceeds of your zero-percent certificate of indebtedness.

        (1)  If the maturing security is purchased on or after May 15, 2010, we will pay the additional funds by a debit from your primary account at a financial institution if the maturing security was purchased within TreasuryDirect by a debit from a financial institution account or if the maturing security was received through a transfer. If we are unable to obtain sufficient funds from your primary account at a financial institution, the reinvestment will be canceled and we will refund the proceeds of the maturing security.

        (2)  If the maturing security is purchased on or after May 15, 2010, we will pay the additional funds using the redemption proceeds of your zero-percent certificate of indebtedness if the purchase of the maturing security was made using the zero-percent certificate of indebtedness. If the amount available from a redemption of the zero-percent certificate of indebtedness is insufficient to pay the additional amount, the reinvestment will be canceled and we will refund the proceeds of the maturing security.

        (3)  If the maturing security was purchased within TreasuryDirect or received through a transfer prior to May 15, 2010, we will debit your primary account at a financial institution for the additional funds. If we are unable to obtain sufficient funds from your primary account at a financial institution, the reinvestment will be canceled and we will refund the proceeds of the maturing security.

After the transfer is completed, you can change the registration to any form of registration permitted by these regulations.

        (2)  When a security is transferred into the TreasuryDirect account of an entity, the security will be transferred in the name of the entity, regardless of the form of registration prior to the transfer.

        A closed book period will be in effect for four business days prior to the date a marketable security interest and/or redemption payment is made. During the closed book period, you cannot change the registration of the security, change the payment destination of the proceeds, change the view or transaction rights, make transfers, or schedule, edit, or cancel a reinvestment. We will hold transactions requiring submission of a form for processing until the closed book period ends.

      Subpart A—General Information

        § 370.0   What does this part cover?

#### § § 370.0

        (a)  This part applies to the transfer of funds by the Automated Clearing House method as used by us in connection with United States securities. This part also provides regulations for the electronic submission of transaction requests through us, except as varied by agreement or as otherwise provided. This part does not apply to transactions for the sale of United States Savings Bonds accomplished through savings bond issuing agents generally, except and to the extent we direct otherwise.

        (b)  The Operating Rules of the National Automated Clearing House Association generally apply to these transactions. However, the Operating Rules do not apply to the extent that the Operating Rules are preempted entirely and excluded specifically by application of Financial Management Service regulations in part 210 of this chapter. In the event of any inconsistencies between this part 370 and either the Operating Rules or part 210, this part 370 applies.

        (c)  To the extent that Regulation E (12 CFR part 205) and Regulation Z (12 CFR part 226) of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System apply to transactions authorized by this part, those Federal laws are unaffected by this part 370.

        (d)  The terms of this part may be varied by agreement.

        § 370.1   What special terms do I need to know to understand this part?

#### § § 370.1

        means a transaction in accordance with the Operating Rules of the National Automated Clearing House Association, as modified by these regulations and other law. The regulations in this part control in the event of any inconsistencies with the applicable Operating Rules.

        means an ACH entry for the collection of money from a deposit account.

        means a demand deposit (checking), savings, or asset account (other than an occasional or incidental credit balance in a credit plan) held directly or indirectly by a financial institution.

        means a type of electronic signature. A signer creates a digital signature by using public-key encryption to transform a message digest of an electronic message. If a recipient of the digital signature has an electronic message, message digest function, and the signer's public key, the recipient can verify:

        (1) Whether the transformation was accomplished with the private key that corresponds to the signer's public key; and

        (2) Whether the electronic message has been altered since the transformation was made.

        means information that is stored in an electronic medium and is retrievable in perceivable form.

        means a signature of an electronic message that:

        (1) Identifies and authenticates a particular person as the source of the electronic message; and

        (2) Indicates such person's approval of the information contained in the electronic message.

        means:

        (1) Any insured bank as defined in section 3 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1813) or any bank that is eligible to make application to become an insured bank under section 5 of such Act (12 U.S.C. 1815);

        (2) Any mutual savings bank as defined in section 3 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1813) or any bank that is eligible to make application to become an insured bank under section 5 of such Act (12 U.S.C. 1815);

        (5) Any savings association as defined in section 3 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1813) that is an insured depository institution as defined in that act or is eligible to apply to become an insured depository institution under that act; and

        (6) Any Federal branch or agency of a foreign bank as defined in section 1(b) of the International Banking Act, as amended (12 U.S.C. 3101).

        means an algorithm that transforms an electronic message into a seemingly unintelligible, generally smaller, result called the message digest. A message digest function has these qualities:

        (1) The same electronic message yields the same message digest every time the algorithm is executed;

        (2) It is computationally infeasible that an electronic message can be derived from the message digest result produced by the algorithm; and

        (3) it is computationally infeasible that two electronic messages can be found that produce the same message digest using the algorithm.

        means, for the purpose of this part, funds paid by us to you.

        means any natural person or organization.

        means a cryptographic process which generates and employs a key pair, consisting of a public key and a different but mathematically related private key. One use of the public key is to verify a digital signature created by the private key.

The term does not extend to United States Savings Bond issuing and paying agents.

        means a deposit account owner, in subparts B and C, unless stated otherwise. The word “you” means a person who electronically submits transaction requests through us, in subpart D.

      Subpart B—Credit ACH Entries

        § 370.5   How can I appoint a financial institution to receive payments on my behalf?

#### § § 370.5

        You must name a financial institution to receive payments through credit entries using the ACH method. You also must identify the deposit account to which payments are to be made. To do this, you must use a form approved by us.

        § 370.6   What requirements apply to a financial institution that handles a credit entry?

#### § § 370.6

        A financial institution that accepts and handles a credit entry initiated by us agrees to the provisions of this subpart, and warrants that it will comply with all requirements imposed upon Receiving Depository Financial Institutions under the Operating Rules of the National Automated Clearing House Association, as modified by these regulations and other law.

        § 370.7   How can my financial institution change my designated deposit account?

#### § § 370.7

        If your financial institution requests us to make a change in your deposit account number or type of your account, we will change the information without requiring any confirmation from you. The request from the financial institution must be made following the Operating Rules of the National Automated Clearing House Association. The financial institution's request will be deemed an agreement by the institution to indemnify us and you for any loss resulting from the requested change.

        § 370.8   Are there any requirements related to a prenotification entry?

#### § § 370.8

        (a)  In our discretion, we may initiate a prenotification entry to a financial institution before we send a credit entry. We may also send a prenotification message whenever there is a change in the payment instructions. If we send a prenotification message, we will follow the time frames as established by the Operating Rules of the National Automated Clearing House Association. A prenotification is a zero-dollar ACH entry that can help us determine whether there might be problems with sending a subsequent credit entry.

        (b)  A financial institution must respond to a prenotification within the time frame for such responses as established by the Operating Rules of the National Automated Clearing House Association. If the receiving financial institution does not respond to the prenotification message within the specified time period, we may interpret the nonresponsiveness as the financial institution's agreement to this subpart. Furthermore, a financial institution warrants by its nonresponsiveness that the deposit account number and the type of account contained in the prenotification entry message was accurate as of the moment the financial institution received it.

        § 370.9   How can my payment instructions be changed?

#### § § 370.9

        Your payment instructions will continue to apply until either you or your financial institution requests us to make a change.

        § 370.10   What can cause my payments to be suspended?

#### § § 370.10

        (a)  We will suspend payments if we receive notice that your deposit account has been closed, that someone named on your deposit account is dead or has been declared legally incompetent, that there is a change in the title of your deposit account that alters your interests; or, if a corporation is the owner, that it has been dissolved.

        (b)  We will suspend payments when we receive notice that an owner of a bond, security, or investor account is dead or has been declared legally incompetent, or in any case where we receive notice of a change in the name or status of an organization or representative named on a bond, security, or investor account.

        (c)  Payments will continue to be suspended until we receive satisfactory evidence as to who is authorized or entitled to receive payments.

        § 370.11   What must my financial institution do when it receives a payment?

#### § § 370.11

        An institution which receives a payment on behalf of its customer must:

        (a) Upon receipt, make the payment available to you on the payment date. If a scheduled payment date is not a business day for the Federal Reserve Bank of the district in which the institution is located, payment will be made on the next-succeeding business day. If the institution is unable to make a credit entry to the designated account, it must return the payment in accordance with the Operating Rules of the National Automated Clearing House Association.

        (b) Promptly notify us when your account has been closed, or when it is on notice of the death or legal incapacity of you or any other individual named on your account, or when it is on notice of the dissolution of a corporation in whose name the deposit account is held. The institution must return all payments received along with an explanation for the return.

        § 370.12   What happens if an error is made in a credit entry, or if a duplicate credit entry is made?

#### § § 370.12

        If we make an erroneous credit entry under this part, we will make a corrected credit entry to your account. We will then take action to recover the erroneous credit entry, or any duplicate credit entry, as follows:

        (a)  We will send a notice to the financial institution to which the erroneous or duplicate credit entry was sent. When it receives this notice, the financial institution must immediately return to the appropriate Federal Reserve Bank an amount equal to the credit entry. If the institution is unable to do this, the institution must immediately notify us, and provide any information that it has about the matter. We reserve the right to request the return of a partial amount of an erroneous or duplicate credit entry.

        (b)  Where the erroneous or duplicate credit entry has not been returned, we will undertake any other actions that are appropriate. To the extent permitted by law, the collection action may include deducting the amount owed from future credit entries made to the deposit account to which the erroneous or duplicate credit entry was made.

        (c)  If a financial institution has not responded within 60 calendar days of the notice, its acceptance of the credit entry will be considered an authorization for a debit in the amount of the entry. The debit will be made from the account maintained or utilized by the financial institution at the Federal Reserve Bank to which the entry was made. An institution designated by a financial institution to receive payment on its behalf, in permitting the usage, is deemed to have authorized a debit. The debit will be made from its account maintained at the Federal Reserve Bank to which the entry was made. The institution to which the credit entry has been directed is deemed to have agreed to provide information and assistance to recover any erroneous or duplicate entry. You are also deemed to have agreed to provide information and assistance, and to take any action provided by law to recover an erroneous or duplicate credit entry.

        § 370.13   Can time limits for taking an action on a credit entry be extended?

#### § § 370.13

        If we or your financial institution are delayed beyond applicable time limits in taking any action with respect to a credit entry because of circumstances beyond our control, then the time for taking that action will be extended as necessary until the cause of the delay ends.

        § 370.14   Can substitute payment procedures be used?

#### § § 370.14

        We may use substitute payment procedures, instead of ACH, if we consider it to be necessary. Any such action is final.

        § 370.15   What limitations exist on liability?

#### § § 370.15

        (a) We may rely on the information provided by you or anyone else authorized to provide information concerning your financial institution or deposit account to which payments are to be made. We do not need to verify this information. We are not liable for any action we may take in reliance on the information furnished.

        (b) Our liability does not extend beyond the amount of the payment due.

        (c) When you name a financial institution to receive payments on your behalf, you are appointing that institution as your agent for the receipt of payments. When a credit entry is made to your financial institution for deposit to your account following your instructions, we no longer have any further responsibility for that payment. Where your financial institution has arranged with the Federal Reserve Bank to have payments made through another financial institution, the crediting of your payment to that institution relieves us of any further responsibility for that payment.

      Subpart C—Debit Entries

        § 370.20   What requirements apply if I want to authorize a debit entry to my deposit account?

#### § § 370.20

        (a)  You may pay for a security and related fees by authorizing us to initiate one or more debit entries to your deposit account. For a purchase of a book-entry security to be held in an investor account maintained by us, you must be named on the investor account. The authorization must be accomplished only through forms or means approved by us.

        (b)  You only may authorize single-entry debits for purchases of book-entry securities held in  You only may authorize recurring debit entries for purchases of definitive savings bonds.

        (c)  To the extent that payments by us with respect to a security are to be made through credit entries, you must receive debit and credit entries in the same deposit account.

        (d)  The authorization must have your signature and that of any other person whose signature is required to withdraw funds from the deposit account. We need not verify your identity or the authenticity of your signature.

        § 370.21   Are there any requirements related to a prenotification entry?

#### § § 370.21

        (a)  In our discretion, we may initiate a prenotification entry to a financial institution prior to sending a debit entry. A prenotification is a zero-dollar ACH entry that can help us determine whether there might be problems with sending a subsequent debit entry.

        (b)  If sent, a financial institution must respond to a prenotification within the time frame for such responses as established by the National Automated Clearing House Association. If the receiving financial institution does not respond to the prenotification message within the specified time period, we may interpret the nonresponsiveness as the financial institution's agreement to this subpart. Furthermore, a financial institution warrants by its nonresponsiveness that the deposit account number and the type of account contained in the prenotification entry message was accurate as of the moment the financial institution received it.

        § 370.22   What requirements apply to a financial institution that debits a deposit account?

#### § § 370.22

        A financial institution that debits a deposit account upon receiving a debit initiated by us agrees to the provisions of this subpart. A financial institution that does so also warrants that it has the authority to receive debit entries.

        § 370.23   What other requirements apply to a financial institution?

#### § § 370.23

        The financial institution warrants that it will comply with all requirements imposed upon Receiving Depository Financial Institutions under the Operating Rules of the National Automated Clearing House Association, as modified by these regulations and other law.

        § 370.24   What right does the Bureau of the Fiscal Service have to terminate or suspend debit entries?

#### § § 370.24

        We may terminate or suspend the availability of one or more debit entries in any case or class of cases, and may do so without notice at any time. A decision to terminate or suspend the availability of debit entries is in our sole discretion and is final.

        § 370.25   What rights do I have to terminate or suspend debit entries?

#### § § 370.25

        (a)  If you are an investor account owner or deposit account owner, you generally may terminate or suspend one or more debit entries by notifying us orally or in writing at least three business days before the scheduled date of a transfer. In response to an oral notice, we may require you to give written notice, to be received by us within fourteen days of an oral notice. An oral notice ceases to be binding after fourteen days if you fail to provide the required written confirmation. A suspension will remain in effect for the duration you specify, but for no more than six months. The termination and suspension methods need not be recited in the authorization. These termination or suspension rights are in addition to those that you may have through your financial institution under Regulation E of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (12 CFR part 205).

        (b)  If you submit a debit entry authorization in conjunction with a Treasury auction tender for the purchase of a book-entry security, you cannot terminate or suspend a debit entry after the auction closes.

        § 370.26   What limitations exist on liability?

#### § § 370.26

        If we sustain a loss because a financial institution fails to handle an entry in accordance with this part, the financial institution is liable to us for the loss, but not beyond the amount of the debit entry. In no instance does our liability extend beyond the amount of the debit entry.

      Subpart D—Electronic Submission of Transaction Requests Through the Bureau of the Fiscal Service

        § 370.35   Does the Bureau of the Fiscal Service accept all electronically signed transaction requests?

#### § § 370.35

        An electronic signature will not be accepted if it has not been accomplished through a method that has been approved for specific purposes by us.

        § 370.36   When does a transaction request become effective?

#### § § 370.36

        Except for auction bids of U.S. securities or unless otherwise agreed, a transaction request becomes effective at the moment we send a confirmation message. In no instance does a transaction request become effective before we actually receive the request.

        § 370.37   Where is the point of transaction for an electronically submitted transaction request?

#### § § 370.37

        For jurisdiction and venue purposes, the point of transaction for a transaction request handled pursuant to this subpart is Parkersburg, West Virginia, regardless of from where the transaction request is transmitted or where the transaction request is actually processed.

        § 370.38   What is the legal effect of an electronic signature?

#### § § 370.38

        An electronic signature and any electronic message to which it is affixed or attached may not be denied legal effect, including legal effect as a signature, a writing, or an original, solely because the signature or record is in electronic form.

        § 370.39   To what extent is a digital signature admissible in any civil litigation or dispute?

#### § § 370.39

        In asserting a digital signature against you in any civil litigation or dispute, extrinsic evidence of authenticity as a condition precedent of admissibility (such as testimony about the scientific validity of digital signatures) is not necessary to establish:

        (a) That a digital signature corresponds to a specific public key pair, and;

        (b) That an electronic message to which the digital signature is affixed has not been altered from its original form.

        § 370.40   Can I be held accountable if my negligence contributes to a forged signature?

#### § § 370.40

        (a)  If your failure to exercise ordinary care substantially contributes to the submission of a forged signature, then you cannot claim that the signature is a forgery. However, we cannot invoke this section against you if we cannot first establish that we were reasonable in relying upon the signature. If we can do so, you bear the burden of production and the burden of persuasion in establishing your exercise of ordinary care. If you cannot do so, then you cannot claim that the signature is a forgery.

        (b)  This section has no application in any dispute involving a debit authorization or credit card transaction.

        § 370.41   What limitations exist on liability?

#### § § 370.41

        In no instance does our liability extend beyond the amount of the transaction.

      Subpart E—Additional Provisions

        § 370.45   What is the status of a security if the remittance cannot be collected?

#### § § 370.45

        If we cannot promptly collect all of the remittance for a security, we may in our discretion cancel the security unless it has been legally transferred for value to a third person who had no knowledge of the improper debit entry at the time of the transfer.

        § 370.46   Are there any situations in which the Bureau of the Fiscal Service may waive these regulations?

#### § § 370.46

        We reserve the right, in our discretion, to waive any provision of these regulations in any case or class of cases. We may do so if such action is not inconsistent with law and will not subject the United States to substantial expense or liability.

        § 370.47   To what extent may the Bureau of the Fiscal Service change these regulations?

#### § § 370.47

        Any aspect of this part may be changed at any time and without notice. You assume the risk that a change may terminate a provision that was to your advantage. Nothing in this part creates vested rights in your favor.

        (a) Accepting and reviewing tenders;

        (b) Calculating redemption operation results;

        (c) Issuing notices of redemptions;

        (d) Accepting deliveries of Treasury securities at settlement; and

        (e) Processing the Treasury payment for securities delivered at settlement.

      Subpart B—Offering, Certifications, and Delivery

        § 375.10   What is the purpose of the redemption operation announcement?

#### § § 375.10

        We provide public notice that we are redeeming Treasury securities by issuing a redemption operation announcement. This announcement lists the details of each proposed redemption operation, including the maximum redemption amount, the range of maturities of eligible securities, descriptions of the securities that fall within that maturity range, and the redemption operation and settlement dates. The redemption operation announcement and this part specify the terms and conditions of a redemption operation. If anything in the redemption operation announcement differs from anything in this part, the redemption operation announcement will apply. Accordingly, you should read the applicable redemption operation announcement along with this part.

        § 375.11   Who may participate in a redemption operation?

#### § § 375.11

        (a)  To be a submitter, you must be an institution that the Federal Reserve Bank of New York has approved to conduct open market transactions with the Bank.

        (b)  A person or entity other than a submitter may participate only if it arranges to have an offer or offers submitted on its behalf by a submitter.

        § 375.12   How do I submit an offer?

#### § § 375.12

        As a submitter, you must submit an offer in a tender to the Treasury via the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. You must submit any tenders in an approved format and the Bank must receive them prior to the closing time stated in the redemption operation announcement. If we do not receive your tenders timely, we will reject them. Your tenders are binding on you after the closing time specified in the redemption operation announcement. You are responsible for ensuring that we receive your tenders on time. We will not be responsible in any way for any unauthorized tender submissions or for any delays, errors, or omissions in submitting tenders.

        § 375.13   What requirements apply to offers?

#### § § 375.13

        (a)  You may only submit competitive offers (specifying a price). All offers must state the security description, par amount, and price of each security offered. All offers must equal or exceed the minimum offer amount, and be in the multiple, stated in the redemption operation announcement.

        (b)  You must express offered prices in terms of price per $100 of par with three decimals, e.g., 102.172. The first two decimals represent fractional 32nds of a dollar. The third decimal represents eighths of a 32nd of a dollar, and must be a 0, 2, 4, or 6. For example, an offer of 102.172 means one hundred two and seventeen 32nds and two eighths of a 32nd, or in decimals, 102.5390625.

        (c)  There is no limit on the number of offers you may make for each eligible security. There is also no limit on the number of eligible securities you may offer.

        § 375.14   Do I have to make any certifications?

#### § § 375.14

        By submitting a tender offering a security or securities for sale, you certify that you are in compliance with this part and the redemption operation announcement.

        § 375.15   Who is responsible for delivering securities?

#### § § 375.15

        As a submitter, you are responsible for delivering any securities we accept in the redemption operation, including any securities for which you submitted offers on behalf of others. (See § 375.23.) All securities you deliver must be free and clear of all liens, charges, claims, and any other restrictions.

      Subpart C—Determination of Redemption Operation Results; Settlement

        § 375.20   When will the Treasury decide on which offers to accept?

#### § § 375.20

        We will determine which offers or portions of offers to accept after the closing time for receipt of tenders. All such determinations will be final.

        § 375.21   When and how will the Treasury announce the redemption operation results?

#### § § 375.21

        We will make an official announcement of the redemption operation results through a press release. For each security we redeem, the press release will include such information as the amounts offered and accepted, the highest price accepted, and the remaining privately held amount outstanding.

        § 375.22   Will I receive confirmations and, if I am submitting offers for others, do I have to provide confirmations?

#### § § 375.22

        (a)  We will provide a confirmation of acceptance or rejection in the form of a results message to submitters of offers by the close of the business day of the redemption operation.

        (b)  If you submit a successful offer for a customer, you are responsible for notifying that customer of the impending redemption.

        § 375.23   How does the securities delivery process work?

#### § § 375.23

        If any of the offers you submitted are accepted, you must transfer the correct book-entry Treasury securities in the correct par amount against the correct settlement amount on the settlement date. You must deliver the securities to the account specified in the redemption operation announcement.

      Subpart D—Miscellaneous Provisions

        § 375.30   Does the Treasury have any discretion in this process?

#### § § 375.30

        (a) We have the discretion to:

        (1) Accept or reject any offers or tenders submitted in a redemption operation;

        (2) Redeem less than the amount of securities specified in the redemption operation announcement;

        (3) Add to, change, or waive any provision of this part; or

        (4) Change the terms and conditions of a redemption operation.

        (b) Our decisions under this part are final. We will provide a public notice if we change any redemption operation provision, term or condition.

        § 375.31   What could happen if someone does not fully comply with the redemption operation rules or fails to deliver securities?

#### § § 375.31

        (a)  If a person or entity fails to comply with any of the redemption operation rules in this part, we will consider the circumstances and take what we deem to be appropriate action. This could include barring the person or entity from participating in future redemption operations under this part and future auctions under 31 CFR part 356. We also may refer the matter to an appropriate regulatory agency.

        (b)  If you fail to deliver securities on time, we may require you to pay liquidated damages of up to 1% of your projected settlement amount.

    PART 391—WAIVER OF INTEREST, ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS, AND PENALTIES

### Part 391

**Authority:** Authority: 31 U.S.C. 3701; 31 U.S.C. 3711; 31 U.S.C. 3717.

**Source:** Source: 50 FR 6344, Feb. 15, 1985, unless otherwise noted.

      § 391.0   Scope of regulations.

#### § § 391.0

      These regulations apply to the waiver of late charges on claims due the Bureau of the Fiscal Service as authorized by 31 U.S.C. 3717(h). They are consistent with the Federal Claims Collection Standards on interest, administrative costs, and penalties prescribed jointly by the General Accounting Office and the Department of Justice and set forth in 4 CFR 102.13. The term “claim” as used in this part refers to an amount of money or property that has been determined to be owed to the Bureau of the Fiscal Service from any person, organization, or entity, except another Federal agency. The term “late charges” as used in this part includes interest, administrative costs, and penalties. When applying the following regulations, a distinction shall be drawn between an adjustment and a waiver. An adjustment is an account correction under any circumstances where the Bureau records a claim or accrues late charges to which it is not legally entitled. An adjustment may be made without the promulgation of regulations. A waiver applies whenever the Bureau accrues late charges it is entitled to assess and later relinquishes that right. Two examples of an adjustment are: (a) Where the underlying claim is without merit, and (b) where the debtor is not notified of the claim as required by 31 U.S.C. 3717. The latter includes being misinformed as to the amount of the charges or the time of their commencement.

      § 391.1   General.

#### § § 391.1

      (a)  Late charges may be waived:

      (1) When the underlying claim is compromised in accordance with 4 CFR part 103;

      (2) Where the underlying claim is not compromised but it is appropriate to waive late charges under the criteria of 4 CFR part 103 relating to enforcement policy;

      (3) When collection of the underlying claim is terminated in accordance with 4 CFR part 104;

      (4) When a claim is suspended in accordance with 4 CFR part 104.

      (5) Where the cost of collecting the unpaid late charges would approach or exceed the amount of unpaid late charges to be collected and the amount of late charges does not qualify for referral to a collection agency or the Department of Justice;

      (6) Where the late charges pertain to claims involving savings bonds and notes arising under 31 U.S.C. 3105 and 3106 which are replaced pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3126;

      (7) For reasons of equity or good conscience as provided in § 391.2.

      (b)  Late charges may be waived in full or in part.

      § 391.2   Equitable considerations.

#### § § 391.2

      For reasons of equity and good conscience, late charges may be waived under the circumstances identified in this section.

      (a) Where, without fault or bad faith, the debtor could not submit payment within 30 days of the interest accrual date, the mandatory waiver provision in 4 CFR 102.13(g) may be extended. Such waiver will be considered on a case-by-case basis. Examples include, but are not limited to:

      (1) Postal service delays in forwarding the notice of indebtedness to a new address; and

      (2) Late receipt of the notice of indebtedness where the debtor was away from home on an extended vacation or hospitalized.

      (b) Where an installment plan is contemplated and the amount of the late charges in relation to the amount of reasonably affordable installment payments is so large that the debt may never be paid, late charges may be waived.

      § 391.3   Resolution of disputes.

#### § § 391.3

      (a) To avoid the accrual of additional late charges during the resolution of a dispute, a debtor has the option of paying the amount of the claim and filing a request for a refund together with a request for review of the claim.

      (b) Where the claim is a result of the Bureau's administrative error, late charges accruing during the review period may be waived unless the Bureau's actions would have placed a reasonable person on notice that the Bureau erred and that the person should inquire further.

      (c) Where the claim is a result of the debtor's error or negligence and the administrative review is unreasonably protracted, late charges accruing during the protracted portion of the review period may be waived.

      (d) The period for administrative review begins on the date the request for review is received and ends 10 days after the final determination is mailed to the debtor. This paragraph shall not apply if the request for review is made in bad faith or for purposes of delay.

      § 391.4   Documentary evidence.

#### § § 391.4

      (a) When late charges are waived, the debtor's administrative file shall be properly documented with a memorandum. The memorandum shall contain a brief narrative statement describing the circumstances leading to the waiver and the reason(s) for granting the waiver.

      (b) A credit report or a financial statement sworn to by the debtor may be required before waiver of late charges is approved for a compromise, suspension, or termination, except where the cost of obtaining such a report or statement exceeds the late charges due.

      § 391.5   Waiver approval.

#### § § 391.5

      Waivers of late charges shall be approved by the Commissioner of the Bureau of the Fiscal Service or designee, except that compromises and terminations of the underlying claim shall be upon the recommendation of the Chief Counsel in accordance with 31 CFR 5.3.
