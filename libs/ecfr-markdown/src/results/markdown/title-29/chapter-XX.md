      § 2200.4   Computing time.

#### § § 2200.4

      (a)  The following rules apply in computing any time period specified in these rules or by any order that does not specify a method of computing time.

      (1)  When the period is stated in days or a longer unit of time:

      (i) Exclude the day of the event that triggers the period;

      (ii) Count every day, including intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and Federal holidays; and

      (iii) Include the last day of the period, but if the last day is a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal holiday, the period continues to run until the end of the next day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal holiday.

      (2)  When the period is stated in working days, count every day except intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and Federal holidays.

      (3)  Unless the Commission or the Judge orders otherwise, if the receiving Commission office is closed on the last day for filing due to inclement weather or other circumstance, then the time for filing is extended to the first day the office is open that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal holiday.

      (4)  Unless a different time is set by a rule or order, the last day ends:

      (i) For documents filed electronically in the Commission's E-File System, at 11:59 p.m. in the time zone of the receiving Commission office; and

      (ii) For filing by other means, when the receiving Commission office is scheduled to close.

      (5)  The “next day” is determined by continuing to count forward when the period is measured after an event and backward when measured before an event.

      (6)  “Federal holiday” means:

      (i) The day set aside by statute for observing New Year's Day, Martin Luther King Jr.'s Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, Juneteenth National Independence Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Columbus Day, Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, or Christmas Day; and,

      (ii) Any day declared a holiday by the President or Congress.

      (7)  (i) If a judge orders that a document is due in 40 days, count every calendar day starting the day after that order (day 1) until reaching day 40 (due date). If the receiving Commission office is closed on day 40 (such as on a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal holiday), the document would be due the next day the office is open. In other words, if day 40 falls on a Saturday, and the following Monday is a Federal holiday, the document would be due on Tuesday, the day after the holiday.

      (ii) If a judge orders that a document is due 14 days before a hearing, count backwards starting the day before the hearing (day 1) until reaching day 14. If the receiving Commission office is closed on day 14 (such as on a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal holiday), the document would be due on the last day the office is open before the Saturday, Sunday, or Federal holiday. In other words, if day 14 falls on a Sunday, and the Friday before is a Federal holiday, the document would be due on Thursday, the day before the holiday.

      (b)  When a party may or must act within a specified time after service and service is made by U.S. Mail under § 2200.7, 3 days are added after the period would otherwise expire under § 2200.4(a).  that this provision does not apply to computing the time for filing a petition for discretionary review under § 2200.91(b).

      § 2200.5   Extension of time.

#### § § 2200.5

      The Commission or the Judge on their own initiative or, upon motion of a party, for good cause shown, may enlarge or shorten any time prescribed by these rules or prescribed by an order. All such motions shall be in writing and shall conform with § 2200.40, but, in exigent circumstances in a case pending before a Judge, an oral request may be made and shall be followed by a written motion filed with the Judge within such time as the Judge prescribes. A request for an extension of time should be received in advance of the date on which the pleading or document is due to be filed. However, in exigent circumstances, an extension of time may be granted even though the request was filed after the designated time for filing has expired. In such circumstances, the party requesting the extension must show, in writing, the reasons for the party's failure to make the request before the time prescribed for the filing had expired. The motion may be acted upon before the time for response has expired.

      § 2200.6   Record address.

#### § § 2200.6

      (a) Every pleading or document filed by any party or intervenor shall contain the name, current address, telephone number, and email address of the party or intervenor's representative or, if there is no representative, the party or intervenor's own name, current address, telephone number, and email address. Any change in such information shall be communicated promptly in writing to the Judge, or the Executive Secretary if no Judge has been assigned, and to all other parties and intervenors. A party or intervenor who fails to furnish such information shall be deemed to have waived its right to notice and service under these rules.

      (b) Representatives, parties, and intervenors who file case documents electronically in the Commission's E-File System pursuant to § 2200.8(c) are responsible for both maintaining a valid email address associated with the registered account and regularly monitoring that email address.

See paragraph (c) of this section.

      (c)  Affected employees who are not members of a collective bargaining unit may elect party status under § 2200.20(a). If more than one employee so elects, the Judge shall provide for them to be treated as one party.

      (d)  A representative of a party or intervenor shall be deemed to control all matters respecting the interest of such party or intervenor in the proceeding.

      § 2200.23   Appearances and withdrawals.

      (a) —(1)  A representative of a party or intervenor shall enter an appearance by signing the first document filed on behalf of the party or intervenor in accordance with paragraph (a)(2) of this section or subsequently by filing an entry of appearance in accordance with paragraph (a)(3) of this section.

      (2)  If the first document filed on behalf of a party or intervenor is signed by a representative, the representative shall be recognized as representing that party. No separate entry of appearance by the representative is necessary, provided the document contains the information required by § 2200.6.

      (3)  Where a representative has not previously appeared on behalf of a party or intervenor, the representative shall file an entry of appearance with the Executive Secretary, or Judge if the case has been assigned. The entry of appearance shall be signed by the representative and contain the information required by § 2200.6.

      (b)  Any counsel or representatives of record desiring to withdraw their appearance, or any parties desiring to withdraw the appearance of their counsel or representatives of record, must file a motion conforming with § 2200.40 with the Commission or the Judge requesting leave to withdraw, showing that prior notice of the motion has been given by the counsel or representative or party to the client or counsel or representative, as the case may be, and providing current contact information for the client, including street address, email address, and phone number. The motion of counsel to withdraw may, in the discretion of the Commission or the Judge, be denied where it is necessary to avoid undue delay or prejudice to the rights of a party or intervenor.

#### § § 2200.24

      The brief of an amicus curiae may be filed only by leave of the Commission or the Judge. The brief may be conditionally filed with the motion for leave conforming to § 2200.40. A motion for leave shall identify the interest of the applicant and shall state the reasons why a brief of an amicus curiae is desirable. Any amicus curiae shall file its brief within the time allowed the party whose position the amicus will support unless the Commission or the Judge, for good cause shown, grants leave for later filing. In that event, the Commission or the Judge may specify within what period an opposing party may answer. The brief of an amicus curiae shall conform to § 2200.74 or § 2200.93.

    Subpart C—Pleadings and Motions

      § 2200.30   General rules.

#### § § 2200.30

      (a)  Pleadings and other documents (other than exhibits) shall be typewritten, double spaced, with typeface of text being no smaller than 12-point and typeface of footnotes being no smaller than 11-point, on letter size opaque paper (8  inches by 11 inches). All margins shall be 1  inches. Pleadings and other documents shall be fastened without the use of staples at the upper left corner.

      (b)  Each allegation or response of a pleading or motion shall be simple, concise, and direct.

      (c)  Each allegation or response shall be made in separate numbered paragraphs. Each paragraph shall be limited as far as practicable to a statement of a single set of circumstances.

      (d)  Statements in a pleading may be adopted by reference in a different part of the same pleading or in another pleading or in any motion. A copy of any written instrument which is an exhibit to a pleading is a part of the pleading for all purposes.

      (e)  A party may set forth two or more statements of a claim or defense alternatively or hypothetically. When two or more statements are made in the alternative and one of them would be sufficient if made independently, the pleading is not made insufficient by the insufficiency of one or more of the alternative statements. A party may state as many separate claims or defenses as it has regardless of consistency. All statements shall be made subject to the signature requirements of § 2200.32.

      (f)  Any pleading, motion, or other document shall contain a caption complying with § 2200.31 and a signature complying with § 2200.32. The form and content of motions shall conform with § 2200.40.

      (g)  The rules of pleading established by this subpart are not determinative in deciding which party bears the burden of persuasion on an issue. By pleading a matter affirmatively, a party does not waive its right to argue that the burden of persuasion on the matter is on another party.

      (h)  The Commission or the Judge may refuse for filing any pleading or motion that does not comply with the requirements of this subpart.

The signature of a representative or party also constitutes a certificate by the representative or party that the representative or party has read the pleading, motion, or other document, that to the best of the representative's or party's knowledge, information, and belief, formed after reasonable inquiry, it is well grounded in fact and is warranted by existing law or a good faith argument for the extension, modification, or reversal of existing law, and that it is not included for any improper purpose, such as to harass or to cause unnecessary delay or needless increase in the cost of litigation. If a pleading, motion, or other document is signed in violation of this rule, such signing party or its representative shall be subject to the sanctions set forth in § 2200.101 or § 2200.104. A signature by a party representative constitutes a representation by the representative that the representative understands that the rules and orders of the Commission and its Judges apply equally to attorney and non-attorney representatives.

      (b)  A petition for modification of abatement date shall be in writing and shall include the following information:

      (1) All steps taken by the employer, and the dates of such action, in an effort to achieve compliance during the prescribed abatement period.

      (2) The specific additional abatement time necessary in order to achieve compliance.

      (c)  A petition for modification of abatement date shall be filed with the Area Director of the United States Department of Labor who issued the citation no later than the close of the next working day following the date on which abatement was originally required.

      (2) Affected employees or the representatives may file an objection in writing to such petition with the aforesaid Area Director. Failure to file such objection within 10 working days of the date of posting of such petition shall constitute a waiver of any further right to object to said petition.

      (3) The Secretary or the Secretary's duly authorized agent shall have the authority to approve any uncontested petition for modification of abatement date filed pursuant to paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.

      (4) The Secretary or the Secretary's authorized representative shall not exercise the Secretary's approval power until the expiration of 15 working days from the date the petition was posted pursuant to paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section by the employer.

      (d)  Where any petition is objected to by the Secretary or affected employees, such petition shall be processed as follows:

      § 2200.40   Motions and requests.

#### § § 2200.40

      (a)  An application or request for an order must be made by written motion. A motion shall not be included in another pleading or document, such as a brief or petition for discretionary review, but shall be made in a separate document. In exigent circumstances in cases pending before a Judge, an oral motion may be made during an off-the-record telephone conference if the motion is subsequently reduced to writing and filed within such time as the judge prescribes.

      (b)  All motions shall contain a caption complying with § 2200.31 and a signature complying with § 2200.32. Requests for orders that are presented in any other form, such as by a business letter or by an email, shall not be considered or granted.

      § 2200.50   [Reserved]

#### § § 2200.50

      § 2200.51   Prehearing conferences and orders.

#### § § 2200.51

      (a)  (1) The Judge may, upon the Judge's discretion, consult with the attorneys, non-attorney party representatives, and any self-represented parties, by a scheduling conference, telephone, mail, or other suitable means, and within 30 days after the filing of the answer, enter a scheduling order that limits the time:

      (i) To join other parties and to amend the pleadings;

      (ii) To file and hear motions; and

      (iii) To complete discovery.

      (2) The scheduling order also may include:

      (i) The date or dates for conferences before hearing, a final prehearing conference, and hearing; and

      (ii) Any other matters appropriate to the circumstances of the case.

      (b)  In addition to the prehearing procedures set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 16, the Judge may, upon the Judge's own initiative or on the motion of a party, direct the parties to confer among themselves to consider settlement, stipulation of facts, or any other matter that may expedite the hearing.

      (c)  Parties must fully prepare for a useful discussion of all procedural and substantive issues involved in prehearing conferences and shall participate in such conferences in good faith. Parties failing to do so may be subject to sanctions under §§ 2200.101 and 2200.104.

      § 2200.52   General provisions governing discovery.

#### § § 2200.52

      (a) —(1)  In conformity with these rules, any party may, without leave of the Commission or the Judge, obtain discovery by one or more of the following methods:

      (i) Production of documents or things or permission to enter upon land or other property for inspection and other purposes to the extent provided in § 2200.53;

      (ii) Requests for admission to the extent provided in § 2200.54; and

      (iii) Interrogatories to the extent provided in § 2200.55.

      (iv) Discovery is not available under these rules through depositions except to the extent provided in § 2200.56.

      (v) In the absence of a specific provision, discovery procedures shall be in accordance with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, except that the provisions of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(a) do not apply to Commission proceedings. This exception does not preclude any prehearing disclosures (including disclosure of expert testimony and written reports) directed in a scheduling order entered under § 2200.51.

      (2)  A party may initiate all forms of discovery in conformity with these Rules at any time after the filing of the first responsive pleading or motion that delays the filing of an answer, such as a motion to dismiss. Discovery shall be initiated early enough to permit completion of discovery no later than 14 days prior to the date set for hearing, unless the Judge orders otherwise.

      (3)  Every document relating to discovery required to be served on a party shall be served on all parties.

      (4)  Unless the Commission or the Judge orders otherwise, the parties may stipulate that:

      (i) A deposition may be taken before any person, at any time or place, on any notice, and in the manner specified—in which event it may be used in the same way as any other deposition; and

      (ii) Other procedures governing or limiting discovery may be modified—but a stipulation extending the time for any form of discovery must be approved by the Commission or the Judge if it would interfere with the time set forth for completing discovery, for hearing a motion, or for hearing.

      (b)  The information or response sought through discovery may concern any matter that is not privileged and that is relevant to the subject matter involved in the pending case and proportional to the needs of the case, considering the importance of the issues at stake, the parties' relative access to relevant information, the parties' resources, the importance of the discovery in resolving the issues, and whether the burden or expense of the proposed discovery outweighs its likely benefit. Information within this scope of discovery need not be admissible in evidence to be discoverable.

      (c)  The frequency or extent of the discovery methods provided by these rules may be limited by the Commission or the Judge if it is determined that:

      (1) The discovery sought is unreasonably cumulative or duplicative, or it is obtainable from some other source that is more convenient, less burdensome, or less expensive;

      (2) The party seeking discovery has had ample opportunity to obtain the information sought by discovery in the action; or

      (3) The proposed discovery is outside the scope permitted by paragraph (b) of this section.

      (d) —(1)  The initial claim of privilege shall specify the privilege claimed and the general nature of the material for which the privilege is claimed. In response to an order from the Commission or the Judge, or in response to a motion to compel, the claim shall: Identify the information that would be disclosed; set forth the privilege that is claimed; and allege the facts showing that the information is privileged. The claim shall be supported by affidavits, depositions, or testimony and shall specify the relief sought. The claim may be accompanied by a motion for a protective order or by a motion that the allegedly privileged information be received and the claim ruled upon in camera, that is, with the record and hearing room closed to the public, or ex parte, that is, without the participation of parties and their representatives. The Judge may enter an order and impose terms and conditions on the Judge's examination of the claim as justice may require, including an order designed to ensure that the allegedly privileged information not be disclosed until after the examination is completed.

      (2)  If the Judge upholds the claim of privilege, the Judge may order and impose terms and conditions as justice may require, including a protective order. If the Judge overrules the claim, the person claiming the privilege may obtain as of right an order sealing from the public those portions of the record containing the allegedly privileged information pending interlocutory or final review of the ruling, or final disposition of the case, by the Commission. Interlocutory review of such an order shall be given priority consideration by the Commission.

      (3)  A Judge may utilize the procedures set forth in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section outside of discovery proceedings, including during the hearing.

      (e)  In connection with any discovery procedures and where a showing of good cause has been made, the Commission or the Judge may make any order including, but not limited to, one or more of the following:

      (1) That the discovery not be had;

      (2) That the discovery may be had only on specified terms and conditions, including a designation of the time or place;

      (3) That the discovery may be had only by a method of discovery other than that selected by the party seeking discovery;

      (4) That certain matters not be inquired into, or that the scope of the discovery be limited to certain matters;

      (5) That discovery be conducted with no one present except persons designated by the Commission or the Judge;

      (6) That a deposition after being sealed be opened only by order of the Commission or the Judge;

      (7) That a trade secret or other confidential research, development, or commercial information not be disclosed or be disclosed only in a designated way;

      (8) That the parties simultaneously file specified documents or information enclosed in sealed envelopes to be opened as directed by the Commission or the Judge.

      (f) —(1)  A party may file a motion conforming to § 2200.40 for an order compelling discovery when another party refuses or obstructs discovery. In considering a motion to compel, the Judge shall treat an evasive or incomplete answer as a failure to answer.

      (2)  If a party fails to comply with an order compelling discovery, the Judge may enter an order to redress the failure. Such order may issue upon the initiative of a Judge, after affording an opportunity to show cause why the order should not be entered, or upon the motion of a party conforming to § 2200.40. The order may include any sanction stated in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 37, including the following:

      (i) An order that designated facts shall be taken to be established for purposes of the case in accordance with the claim of the party obtaining that order;

      (ii) An order refusing to permit the disobedient party to support or to oppose designated claims or defenses or prohibiting it from introducing designated matters in evidence;

      (iii) An order striking pleadings or parts of pleadings or staying further proceedings until the order is obeyed; and

      (iv) An order dismissing the action or proceeding or any part of the action or proceeding or rendering a judgment by default against the disobedient party.

      (g)  None of the discovery procedures set forth in these rules shall be used in a manner or at a time which shall delay or impede the progress of the case toward hearing status or the hearing of the case on the date for which it is scheduled, unless, in the interests of justice, the Judge shall order otherwise. Unreasonable delays in utilizing discovery procedures may result in termination of the party's right to conduct discovery.

      (h)  All show cause orders issued by the Commission or the Judge under paragraph (f) of this section shall be served in a manner prescribed in § 2200.7(o).

      (i)  A party that has responded to a request for discovery with a response that was complete when made is under no duty to supplement the response to include information subsequently acquired, except as follows:

      (1) A party is under a duty to promptly supplement the response with respect to any question directly addressed to:

      (i) The identity and location of persons having knowledge of discoverable matters; and

      (ii) The identity of each person expected to be called as an expert witness at the hearing, the subject matter on which the person is expected to testify, and the substance of the person's testimony.

      (2) A party is under a duty to promptly amend a prior response if the party obtains information upon the basis of which:

      (i) The party knows that the response was incorrect when made; or

      (ii) The party knows that the response though correct when made is no longer true and the circumstances are such that a failure to amend the response is in substance a knowing concealment.

      (3) A duty to supplement responses may be imposed by order of the court, agreement of the parties, or at any time prior to the hearing through new requests for supplementation of prior responses.

      (j)  Requests for production or inspection under § 2200.53, requests for admission under § 2200.54 and responses to requests for admission, interrogatories under § 2200.55 and the answers to interrogatories, and depositions under § 2200.56 shall be served upon other counsel or parties, but shall not be filed with the Commission or the Judge. The party responsible for service of the discovery material shall retain the original and become the custodian.

      (k)  If relief is sought under § 2200.101 or § 2200.52(e), (f), or (g) concerning any interrogatories, requests for production or inspection, requests for admissions, answers to interrogatories, or responses to requests for admissions, copies of the portions of the interrogatories, requests, answers, or responses in dispute shall be filed with the Commission or the Judge contemporaneously with any motion filed under § 2200.101 or § 2200.52(e), (f), or (g).

      (l)  If interrogatories, requests, answers, responses, or depositions are to be used at the hearing or are necessary to a prehearing motion which might result in a final order on any claim, the portions to be used shall be filed with the Commission or the Judge at the outset of the hearing or at the filing of the motion insofar as their use can be reasonably anticipated. Section 2200.56(f) prescribes additional procedures pertaining to the use of depositions at a hearing.

      (m)  When documentation of discovery not previously in the record is needed for review or appeal purposes, upon an application and order of the Commission or the Judge, the necessary discovery documents shall be filed with the Executive Secretary of the Commission.

      § 2200.53   Production of documents and things.

#### § § 2200.53

      (a)  At any time after the filing of the first responsive pleading or motion that delays the filing of an answer, such as a motion to dismiss, any party may serve on any other party a request to:

      (1) Produce and permit the party making the request, or a person acting on the party's behalf, to inspect and copy any designated documents, or to inspect and copy, test, or sample any tangible things which are in the possession, custody, or control of the party upon whom the request is served;

      (2) Permit entry upon designated land or other property in the possession or control of the party upon whom the request is served for the purpose of inspection and measuring, surveying, photographing, testing, or sampling the property or any designated object or operation on the property.

      (b)  The request shall set forth the items to be inspected, either by individual item or by category, and describe each item and category with reasonable particularity. It shall specify a reasonable time, place, and manner of making the inspection and performing related acts. The party upon whom the request is served shall serve a written response within 30 days after service of the request, unless the requesting party allows a longer time. The Commission or the Judge may allow a shorter time or a longer time, should the requesting party deny an extension. The response shall state, with respect to each item or category, that inspection and related activities will be permitted as requested, unless the request is objected to in whole or in part, in which event the reasons for objection shall be stated. If objection is made to part of an item or category, that part shall be specified. To obtain a ruling on an objection by the responding party, the requesting party shall file a motion conforming to § 2200.40 with the Judge and shall annex its request to the motion, together with the response and objections, if any.

      § 2200.54   Request for admissions.

#### § § 2200.54

      (a) —(1)  Any time after the filing of the first responsive pleading or motion that delays the filing of an answer, such as a motion to dismiss, a party may serve on any other party a written request to admit, for purposes of the pending action only, the truth of any matters within the scope of § 2200.52(b) relating to:

      (i) Facts, the application of law to fact, or opinions about either; and

      (ii) The genuineness of any described documents.

      (2)  Each matter must be separately stated. The number of requested admissions shall not exceed 25, including subparts, except upon the agreement of the parties or by order of the Commission or the Judge. A request to admit the genuineness of a document must be accompanied by a copy of the document unless it is, or has been, otherwise furnished or made available for inspection and copying.

      (3)  A matter is admitted unless, within 30 days after being served, the party to whom the request is directed serves on the requesting party a written answer or objection addressed to the matter and signed by the party or its representative. A shorter or longer time for responding may be provided by written stipulation of the parties or by order of the Commission or the Judge.

      (4)  If a matter is not admitted, the answer must specifically deny it or state in detail why the answering party cannot truthfully admit or deny it. A denial must fairly respond to the substance of the matter; and when good faith requires that a party qualify an answer or deny only a part of a matter, the answer must specify the part admitted and qualify or deny the rest. The answering party may assert lack of knowledge or information as a reason for failing to admit or deny only if the party states that it has made reasonable inquiry and that the information it knows or can readily obtain is insufficient to enable it to admit or deny.

      (5)  The grounds for objecting to a request must be stated. A party must not object solely on the ground that the request presents a genuine issue for hearing.

      (6)  The requesting party may move to determine the sufficiency of an answer or objection. Unless an objection is sustained, the Commission or the Judge must order that an answer be served. On finding that an answer does not comply with this rule, the Commission or the Judge may order either that the matter is admitted or that an amended answer be served. The Commission or the Judge may defer the final decision until a prehearing conference or a specified time before hearing.

      (b)  A matter admitted under paragraph (a) of this section is conclusively established unless the Commission or the Judge on motion permits the admission to be withdrawn or amended. The Commission or the Judge may permit withdrawal or modification if it would promote the presentation of the merits of the case and if the Commission or the Judge is not persuaded that it would prejudice the requesting party in maintaining or defending the case on the merits. An admission under paragraph (a) of this section is not an admission for any other purpose and cannot be used against the party in any other proceeding.

      § 2200.55   Interrogatories.

#### § § 2200.55

      (a)  At any time after the filing of the first responsive pleading or motion that delays the filing of an answer, such as a motion to dismiss, any party may serve interrogatories upon any other party. The number of interrogatories shall not exceed 25 questions, including subparts, except upon the agreement of the parties or by order of the Commission or the Judge. The party seeking to serve more than 25 questions, including subparts, shall have the burden of persuasion to establish that the complexity of the case or the number of citation items necessitates a greater number of interrogatories.

      (b)  All answers shall be made in good faith and as completely as the answering party's information will permit. The answering party is required to make reasonable inquiry and ascertain readily obtainable information. An answering party may not give lack of information or knowledge as an answer or as a reason for failure to answer, unless the answering party states that it has made reasonable inquiry and that information known or readily obtainable by it is insufficient to enable it to answer the substance of the interrogatory.

      (c)  Each interrogatory shall be answered separately and fully under oath or affirmation. If the interrogatory is objected to, the objection shall be stated in lieu of the answer. The answers are to be signed by the person making them and the objections shall be signed by the party or its counsel. The party on whom the interrogatories have been served shall serve a copy of its answers or objections upon the propounding party within 30 days after the service of the interrogatories. The Judge may allow a shorter or longer time. The burden shall be on the party submitting the interrogatories to file a motion conforming to § 2200.40 for an order with respect to any objection or other failure to answer an interrogatory.

      § 2200.56   Depositions.

#### § § 2200.56

      (a)  Depositions of parties, intervenors, or witnesses shall be allowed only by agreement of all the parties or on order of the Commission or the Judge following the filing of a motion of a party stating good and just reasons. All depositions shall be before an officer authorized to administer oaths and affirmations at the place of examination. The deposition shall be taken in accordance with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, particularly Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 30.

      (b)  A motion to take depositions may be filed after the filing of the first responsive pleading or motion that delays the filing of an answer, such as a motion to dismiss.

      (c)  Any depositions allowed by the Commission or the Judge may be taken after 14 days' written notice to the other party or parties. The 14-day notice requirement may be waived by the parties pursuant to § 2200.52(a)(4)(i).

      (d)  The party that notices the deposition must state in the notice the method for recording the testimony. Unless the Commission or the Judge orders otherwise, testimony may be recorded by audio, audiovisual, or stenographic means. Witnesses whose depositions are taken and the person recording the deposition shall each be paid the same fees that are paid for like services in the federal courts. Any party may arrange to transcribe a deposition. The party noticing the deposition shall pay the recording costs, any witness fees, and mileage expense. Deposition subpoenas shall comply with § 2200.65.

      (e)  Depositions taken under this rule may be used for discovery, to contradict or impeach the testimony of a deponent as a witness, or for any other purpose permitted by the Federal Rules of Evidence and the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, particularly Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 32. An audio or audiovisual deposition offered into evidence in whole or in part must be accompanied by a transcription of the deposition. All transcription costs must be borne by the party offering the deposition into evidence.

      (f)  Except when used for purposes of impeachment, at least 7 days prior to the hearing, the parties or counsel shall furnish to the Judge and all opposing parties or counsel the transcribed excerpts from depositions (by page and line number) which they expect to introduce at the hearing. Four working days later, the adverse party or counsel for the adverse party shall furnish to the Judge and all opposing parties or counsel additional transcribed excerpts from the depositions (by page and line number) which they expect to be read pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 32(a)(4), as well as any objections (by page and line number) to opposing party's or counsel's depositions. With reasonable notice to the Judge and all parties or counsel, other excerpts may be read.

#### § § 2200.60

      Except by agreement of the parties, or in an expedited proceeding under § 2200.103, when a hearing is first set, the Judge shall give the parties and intervenors notice of the time, place, and nature of the hearing at least 30 days in advance of the hearing. If a hearing is being rescheduled, or if exigent circumstances are present, at least 10 days' notice shall be given. The Judge will designate a place and time of hearing that involves as little inconvenience and expense to the parties as is practicable.

      § 2200.61   Submission without hearing.

#### § § 2200.61

      (a) A case may be fully stipulated by the parties and submitted to the Commission or the Judge for a decision at any time. The stipulation of facts shall be in writing and signed by the parties or their representatives. The submission of a case under this rule does not alter the burden of proof, the requirements otherwise applicable with respect to adducing proof, or the effect of failure of proof.

      (b) Motions for summary judgment are governed by § 2200.40(j).

      § 2200.62   Postponement of hearing.

#### § § 2200.62

      (a)  A hearing may be postponed by the Judge on the Judge's own initiative or for good cause shown upon the motion of a party. A motion for postponement shall state the position of the other parties, either by a joint motion or by a representation of the moving party. The filing of a motion for postponement does not automatically postpone a hearing. The form and content of such motions shall comply with § 2200.40.

      (b)  A motion for postponement grounded on conflicting engagements of counsel or employment of new counsel shall be promptly filed.

      (c)  A motion to postpone a hearing must be received at least 10 days prior to the hearing. A motion for postponement received less than 10 days prior to the hearing will generally be denied unless good cause is shown for late filing.

      (d)  No postponement in excess of 60 days shall be granted without the concurrence of the Chief Administrative Law Judge. The original of any motion seeking a postponement in excess of 60 days shall be filed with the Judge and a copy sent to the Chief Administrative Law Judge.

      § 2200.63   Stay of proceedings.

#### § § 2200.63

      (a)  Stays are not favored. A party seeking a stay of a case assigned to a Judge shall file a motion for stay conforming to § 2200.40 with the Judge and send a copy to the Chief Administrative Law Judge. A motion for a stay shall state the position of the other parties, either by a joint motion or by the representation of the moving party. The motion shall set forth the reasons a stay is sought and the length of the stay requested.

      (b)  The Judge, with the concurrence of the Chief Administrative Law Judge, may grant any motion for stay for the period requested or for such period as is deemed appropriate.

      (c)  The parties in a stayed proceeding shall be required to submit periodic reports on such terms and conditions as the Judge may direct. The length of time between the reports shall be no longer than 90 days unless the Judge otherwise orders.

      § 2200.64   Failure to appear.

#### § § 2200.64

      (a)  The failure of a party to appear in person or by a duly authorized representative at the hearing constitutes a waiver of the right to a hearing. A failure of the Secretary to appear constitutes abandonment of the case. A failure of the Respondent to appear is deemed an admission of the facts alleged and consent to the relief sought in the Complaint (or, in Simplified Proceedings, the citation and notification of proposed penalty). The Judge may default the non-appearing party without further proceeding or notice.

      (b)  Requests for reinstatement must be made, in the absence of extraordinary circumstances, within 7 days after the scheduled hearing date. See § 2200.90(c).

      (c)  The Commission or the Judge, upon a showing of good cause, may excuse such failure to appear. In such event, the hearing will be rescheduled as expeditiously as possible from the issuance of the Judge's order.

      § 2200.65   Issuance of subpoenas; petitions to revoke or modify subpoenas; payment of witness fees and mileage; right to inspect or copy data.

#### § § 2200.65

      (a)  On behalf of the Commission or any Commission member, the Judge shall, on the application of any party, issue to the applying party subpoenas requiring the attendance and testimony of witnesses and/or the production of any evidence, including, but not limited to, relevant books, records, correspondence, or documents, in the witness' possession or under the witness' control, at a deposition or at a hearing before the Commission or the Judge. The party to whom the subpoena is issued shall be responsible for its service. Applications for subpoenas, if filed prior to the assignment of the case to a Judge, shall be filed with the Executive Secretary at One Lafayette Centre, 1120 20th Street NW, Suite 980, Washington, DC 20036-3457. After the case has been assigned to a Judge, applications shall be filed with the Judge. Applications for subpoena(s) may be made ex parte. The subpoena shall show on its face the name and address of the party at whose request the subpoena was issued.

      (b)  A subpoena may be served by any person who is not a party and is not less than 18 years of age. Service of a subpoena upon the person it names may be made by service on the person named, by certified mail return receipt requested, or by leaving a copy at the person's principal place of business or at the person's residence with a person of suitable age and discretion who resides there. A subpoena may be served at any place in the United States or any Territory or possession of the United States. A subpoena may command a person to attend and produce documents or tangible things, from any place in the United States or any Territory or possession of the United States, at any designated place of hearing or deposition.

      (c)  Any person served with a subpoena, whether requiring attendance and testimony (ad testificandum) or for the production of evidence (duces tecum), shall, within 5 days after the date of service of the subpoena, move in writing to revoke or modify the subpoena if the person does not intend to comply. All motions to revoke or modify shall be served on the party at whose request the subpoena was issued. The Commission or the Judge shall revoke or modify the subpoena if in its opinion the evidence whose production is required does not relate to any matter under investigation or in question in the proceedings or the subpoena does not describe with sufficient particularity the evidence to be produced, or if for any other reason sufficient in law the subpoena is otherwise invalid. The Commission or the Judge shall make a simple statement of procedural or other grounds for the ruling on the motion to revoke, modify, or affirm. The motion to revoke or modify, any answer filed, and any ruling on the motion shall become part of the record.

      (d)  Persons compelled to submit data or other information at a public proceeding are entitled to retain documents they submitted that contain the data or information, or to procure a copy of such documents upon their payment of lawfully prescribed costs. If such persons submit the data or other information by testimony, they are entitled to a copy of the transcript of their testimony upon their payment of the lawfully prescribed costs.

      (e)  Witnesses summoned to appear for a deposition or to appear before the Commission or the Judge shall be paid the same witness fees and mileage expense that are paid witnesses in the federal courts. Witness fees and mileage expense shall be paid by the party at whose instance the witness appears.

      (f)  Upon the failure of any person to comply with the subpoena issued upon the request of a party, the Commission by its counsel shall recommend to the U.S. Department of Justice that proceedings be initiated in the appropriate district court for the enforcement of the subpoena, if in the Commission's judgment the enforcement of the subpoena would be consistent with law and with policies of the Act. In such instances, neither the Commission nor its counsel shall be deemed to have assumed responsibility for the effective prosecution of the subpoena before the court.

      § 2200.66   Transcript of testimony.

#### § § 2200.66

      (a)  Hearings shall be transcribed verbatim. A copy of the transcript of testimony taken at the hearing, duly certified by the reporter, shall be filed with the Judge before whom the matter was heard.

      (b)  The Commission shall bear all expenses for court reporters' fees and for copies of the hearing transcript received by it. Each party is responsible for securing and paying for its copy of the transcript.

      (c)  Error in the transcript of the hearing may be corrected by the Judge on the Judge's own motion, on joint motion by the parties, or on motion by any party. The motion shall conform to § 2200.40 and shall state the error in the transcript and the correction to be made. The official transcript shall reflect the corrections.

      § 2200.67   Duties and powers of Judges.

#### § § 2200.67

      It shall be the duty of the Judge to conduct a fair and impartial hearing, to assure that the facts are fully elicited, to adjudicate all issues and avoid delay. The Judge shall have authority with respect to cases assigned to the Judge, between the time the Judge is designated and the time the Judge issues a decision, subject to the rules and regulations of the Commission, to:

      (a) Administer oaths and affirmations;

      (b) Issue authorized subpoenas and rule on petitions to modify, revoke, or affirm, in accordance with § 2200.65;

      (d) Rule upon offers of proof and receive relevant evidence;

      (e) Take or cause depositions to be taken whenever the needs of justice would be served;

      (f) Regulate the course of the hearing and, if appropriate or necessary, exclude persons or counsel from the hearing for contemptuous conduct and strike all related testimony of witnesses refusing to answer any proper questions;

      (g) Hold conferences for the settlement or simplification of the issues;

      (h) Dispose of procedural requests or similar matters, including motions referred to the Judge by the Commission and motions to amend pleadings; also to dismiss complaints, or portions of complaints, and to order hearings reopened or, upon motion, consolidated prior to issuance of a decision;

      (i) Make decisions that conform to 5 U.S.C. 557 of the Administrative Procedure Act;

      (j) Call and examine witnesses and to introduce into the record documentary or other evidence;

      (k) Approve or appoint an interpreter;

      (l) Request the parties to state their respective positions concerning any issue in the case or theory in support of their position;

      (m) Adjourn the hearing as the needs of justice and good administration require;

      § 2200.68   Recusal of the Judge.

#### § § 2200.68

      (a)  A Judge may recuse themself from a proceeding whenever the Judge deems it appropriate.

      (b)  A Judge shall recuse themself under circumstances that would require disqualification of a Federal judge under Canon 3(C) of the Code of Conduct for United States Judges, except that the required recusal may be set aside under the conditions specified by Canon 3(D).

      (c)  Any party may request that the Judge, at any time following the Judge's designation and before the filing of a decision, be recused under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section or both by filing with the Judge, promptly upon the discovery of the alleged facts, an affidavit setting forth in detail the matters alleged to constitute grounds for recusal.

      (d)  If the Judge finds that a request for recusal has been filed with due diligence and that the material filed in support of the request establishes that recusal either is appropriate under paragraph (a) of this section or is required under paragraph (b) of this section, the Judge shall recuse themself from the proceeding. If the Judge denies a request for recusal, the Judge shall issue a ruling on the record, stating the grounds for denying the request, and shall proceed with the hearing, or, if the hearing has closed, proceed with the issuance of a decision under the provisions of § 2200.90.

      § 2200.70   Exhibits.

#### § § 2200.70

      (b)  Unless the Judge finds it impractical, a copy of each exhibit shall be given to the other parties and intervenors. A party may remove an exhibit from the official record during the hearing or at the conclusion of the hearing only upon permission of the Judge. The Judge, in the Judge's discretion, may permit the substitution of a duplicate for any original document offered into evidence.

      (c)  A Judge may, in the Judge's discretion, deny the admission of any exhibit because of its excessive size, weight, or other characteristic that prohibits its convenient transportation and storage. A party may offer into evidence photographs, models, or other representations of any such exhibit.

      (d)  All exhibits offered but denied admission into evidence, except exhibits referred to in paragraph (c) of this section, shall be placed in a separate file designated for rejected exhibits.

      (e)  A party may on motion request the return of a physical exhibit within 30 days after expiration of the time for filing a petition for review of a Commission final order in a United States Court of Appeals under section 11 of the Act, 29 U.S.C. 660, or within 30 days after completion of any proceedings initiated in a Court of Appeals. The motion shall be addressed to the Executive Secretary and provide supporting reasons. The exhibit shall be returned if the Executive Secretary determines that it is no longer necessary for use in any Commission proceeding.

      (f)  Any person may on motion to the Executive Secretary request custody of a physical exhibit for use in any court or tribunal. The motion shall state the reasons for the request and the duration of custody requested.

      (c) Once the Judge rules definitively on the record—either before or at the hearing—a party need not renew an objection or offer of proof to preserve a claim of error for appeal.

      § 2200.73   Interlocutory review.

#### § § 2200.73

      (a)  Interlocutory review of a Judge's ruling is discretionary with the Commission. A petition for interlocutory review may be granted only where the petition asserts and the Commission finds:

      (1) That the review involves an important question of law or policy that controls the outcome of the case, and that immediate review of the ruling will materially expedite the final disposition of the proceedings or subsequent review by the Commission may provide an inadequate remedy; or

      (2) That the ruling will result in a disclosure, before the Commission may review the Judge's report, of information that is alleged to be privileged.

      (b)  Within 7 days following the service of a Judge's ruling from which review is sought, a party may file a petition for interlocutory review with the Commission. Responses to the petition, if any, shall be filed within 7 days following service of the petition. Service of the filed petition on the other parties and intervenors shall be accomplished in a manner prescribed in § 2200.7(c). A copy of the petition and responses shall be filed with the Judge. The petition is denied unless granted within 30 days of the date of receipt by the Commission's Executive Secretary. A corporate party that files a petition for interlocutory review or a response to such a petition under this section shall file with the Commission a copy of its declaration of corporate parents, subsidiaries, and affiliates previously filed with the Judge under the requirements of § 2200.35 or § 2200.37(d)(4). In its discretion the Commission may refuse to accept for filing a petition or response that fails to comply with this disclosure requirement. A corporate party filing the declaration required by this paragraph shall have a continuing duty to advise the Executive Secretary of any changes to its declaration until the petition is deemed denied or a decision is issued on the merits.

      (c)  The Commission's decision not to grant a petition for interlocutory review shall not preclude a party from raising an objection to the Judge's interlocutory ruling in a petition for discretionary review.

      (d) —(1)  The filing of a petition for interlocutory review of a Judge's ruling concerning an alleged trade secret shall stay the effect of the ruling until the petition is deemed denied or ruled upon.

      (2)  In all other cases, the filing or granting of a petition for interlocutory review shall not stay a proceeding or the effect of a ruling unless otherwise ordered.

      (e)  The Judge may be requested to provide the Commission with written views on whether the petition is meritorious. When the written comments are filed with the Commission, the Judge shall serve the comments on all parties in a manner prescribed in § 2200.7(c).

      (f)  Notice shall be given to the parties if the Commission decides to request briefs on the issues raised by an interlocutory review. See § 2200.93—Briefs before the Commission.

      (g)  A petition for interlocutory review is deemed to be filed only when received by the Commission, as specified in § 2200.8(d)(3)(ii).

      (a) —(1)  The Judge shall prepare a decision that conforms to 5 U.S.C. 557 of the Administrative Procedure Act and constitutes the final disposition of the proceedings. The decision shall be in writing and shall include findings of fact, conclusions of law, and the reasons or bases for them, on all the material issues of fact, law, or discretion presented on the record. The decision shall include an order affirming, modifying, or vacating each contested citation item and each proposed penalty or directing other appropriate relief. A decision finally disposing of a petition for modification of the abatement period shall contain an order affirming or modifying the abatement period.

      (2)  The Judge shall serve a copy of the decision on each party in a manner prescribed in § 2200.7(c).

      (b) —(1)  The _Judge's report_ shall consist of the entire record, including the Judge's decision.

      (2)  On the eleventh day after service of the decision on the parties, the Judge shall file the report with the Executive Secretary for docketing.

      (3)  Promptly upon filing of the Judge's report, the Executive Secretary shall docket the report and notify all parties of the docketing date. The date of docketing of the Judge's report is the date that the Judge's report is made for purposes of section 12(j) of the Act, 29 U.S.C. 661(j).

      (4)  (i) Until the Judge's report has been directed for review or, in the absence of a direction for review, until the decision has become a final order as described in paragraph (f) of this section, the Judge may correct clerical errors arising through oversight or inadvertence in decisions, orders, or other parts of the record under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(a). If a Judge's report has been directed for review, the decision may be corrected during the pendency of review with leave of the Commission.

      (ii) After a Judge's decision has become a final order as described in paragraph (f) of this section, the Commission or the Judge may correct a clerical mistake or a mistake arising from oversight or omission under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(a).

      (c)  Until the Judge's report has been docketed by the Executive Secretary, the Judge may relieve a party of default or grant reinstatement under § 2200.101(b), § 2200.52(f)(2), or § 2200.64(b).

      (d)  Except for documents filed under paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section, which shall be filed with the Judge, on or after the date of docketing of the Judge's report all documents shall be filed with the Executive Secretary.

      (e)  Settlement documents shall be filed in the manner prescribed in § 2200.100(c).

      (f)  If no Commissioner directs review of a report on or before the thirtieth day following the date of docketing of the Judge's report, the decision of the Judge shall become a final order of the Commission.

      § 2200.91   Discretionary review; petitions for discretionary review; statements in opposition to petitions.

#### § § 2200.91

      (a)  Review by the Commission is not a right. A Commissioner may, as a matter of discretion, direct review on the Commissioner's own motion or on the petition of a party.

      (b)  A party adversely affected or aggrieved by the decision of the Judge may seek review by the Commission by filing a petition for discretionary review with the Executive Secretary at any time following the service of the Judge's decision on the parties but no later than 20 days after the date of docketing of the Judge's report. Service of the filed petition on the other parties and intervenors shall be accomplished in a manner prescribed in § 2200.7(c). The earlier a petition is filed, the more consideration it can be given. A petition for discretionary review may be conditional, and it may state that review is sought only if a Commissioner were to direct review on the petition of an opposing party.

      (c)  Where a petition for discretionary review has been filed by one party, any other party adversely affected or aggrieved by the decision of the Judge may seek review by the Commission by filing a cross-petition for discretionary review. The cross-petition may be conditional. See paragraph (b) of this section. A cross-petition shall be filed directly with the Executive Secretary within 27 days after the date of docketing of the Judge's report. The earlier a cross-petition is filed, the more consideration it can be given.

      (d)  No particular form is required for a petition for discretionary review. A petition should state why review should be directed, including: Whether the Judge's decision raises an important question of law, policy, or discretion; whether review by the Commission will resolve a question about which the Commission's Judges have rendered differing opinions; whether the Judge's decision is contrary to law or Commission precedent; whether a finding of material fact is not supported by a preponderance of the evidence; whether a prejudicial error of procedure or an abuse of discretion was committed. A petition should concisely state the portions of the decision for which review is sought and should refer to the citations and citation items (for example, citation 3, item 4a) for which review is sought. A petition shall not incorporate by reference a brief or legal memorandum. Brevity and the inclusion of precise references to the record and legal authorities will facilitate prompt review of the petition.

      (e)  A petition for discretionary review is filed when received by the Commission, as specified in § 2200.8(d)(3)(ii).

      (f)  A petition for review under this section is, under 5 U.S.C. 704, a prerequisite to the seeking of judicial review of the final agency action. The effect of filing a petition for review is to stay the decision of the Judge.

      (g)  Statements in opposition to petitions for discretionary review may be filed in the manner specified in this section for the filing of petitions for discretionary review. Statements in opposition shall concisely state why the Judge's decision should not be reviewed with respect to each portion of the petition to which it is addressed.

      § 2200.92   Review by the Commission.

#### § § 2200.92

      (a)  Unless the Commission orders otherwise, a direction for review establishes jurisdiction in the Commission to review the entire case. The issues to be decided on review are within the discretion of the Commission.

      (b)  At any time within 30 days after the docketing date of the Judge's report, a Commissioner may, on the Commissioner's own motion, direct that a Judge's decision be reviewed. Factors that may be considered in deciding whether to direct review absent a petition include, but are not limited to, whether the case raises novel questions of law or policy or involves a conflict between Administrative Law Judges' decisions. When a Commissioner directs review on the Commissioner's own motion, the issues ordinarily will be those specified in the direction for review or any later order.

      (c)  The Commission will ordinarily not review issues that the Judge did not have the opportunity to pass upon. In exercising discretion to review issues that the Judge did not have the opportunity to pass upon, the Commission may consider such factors as whether there was good cause for not raising the issue before the Judge, the degree to which the issue is factual, the degree to which proceedings will be disrupted or delayed by raising the issue on review, whether the ability of an adverse party to press a claim or defense would be impaired, and whether considering the new issue would avoid injustice or ensure that judgment will be rendered in accordance with the law and facts.

      § 2200.93   Briefs before the Commission.

#### § § 2200.93

      (a)  The Commission ordinarily will request the parties to file briefs on issues before the Commission. After briefs are requested, a party may, instead of filing a brief, file a letter setting forth its arguments or a letter stating that it will rely on its petition for discretionary review or previous brief. A party not intending to file a brief shall notify the Commission in writing within the applicable time for filing briefs and shall serve a copy on all other parties. The provisions of this section apply to the filing of briefs and letters filed in lieu of briefs.

      (b)  Unless the briefing notice states otherwise:

      (1)  The party required to file the first brief shall do so within 40 days after the date of the briefing notice. All other parties shall file their briefs within 30 days after the first brief is served. Any reply brief permitted by these rules or by order shall be filed within 15 days after the second brief is served.

      (2)  (i) If one petition for discretionary or interlocutory review has been filed, the petitioning party shall file the first brief.

      (ii) If more than one petition has been filed, the party whose petition was filed first shall file the first brief.

      (iii) If no petition has been filed, the parties shall file simultaneous briefs.

      (3)  The party that filed the first brief may file a reply brief, or, if briefs are to be filed simultaneously, both parties may file a reply brief. Additional briefs are otherwise not allowed except by leave of the Commission.

      (c)  An extension of time to file a brief will ordinarily not be granted except for good cause shown. A motion for extension of time to file a brief shall be filed at the Commission no later than 5 days prior to the expiration of the time limit prescribed in paragraph (b) of this section, shall comply with § 2200.40, and shall include the following information: when the brief is due, the number and duration of extensions of time that have been granted to each party, the length of extension being requested, the specific reason for the extension being requested, and an assurance that the brief will be filed within the time extension requested.

      (d)  The Commission may decline to accept a brief that is not timely filed. If a petitioning party fails to respond to a briefing notice or expresses no interest in review, the Commission may vacate the direction for review, or it may decide the case without that party's brief. If the non-petitioning party fails to respond to a briefing notice or expresses no interest in review, the Commission may decide the case without that party's brief. If a case was directed for review upon a Commissioner's own motion, and any party fails to respond to the briefing notice, the Commission may either vacate the direction for review or decide the case without briefs.

      (e)  Except by permission of the Commission, a main brief, including briefs and legal memoranda it incorporates by reference, shall contain no more than 35 pages of text. A reply brief, including briefs and legal memoranda it incorporates by reference, shall contain no more than 20 pages of text.

      (f)  Briefs shall be typewritten, double spaced, with typeface of text being no smaller than 12-point and typeface of footnotes being no smaller than 11-point, on letter size opaque paper (8  inches by 11 inches). All margins shall be 1  inches.

      (g)  A brief in excess of 15 pages shall include a table of contents.

      (h)  The Commission may return briefs that do not meet the requirements of paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section.

      (i)  The Commission may allow a brief of an amicus curiae pursuant to the criteria and time period set forth in § 2200.24. Any brief of an amicus curiae must meet the requirements of paragraphs (b) through (h) of this section. No reply brief of an amicus curiae will be received.

      § 2200.94   [Reserved]

#### § § 2200.94

      § 2200.95   Oral argument before the Commission.

#### § § 2200.95

      (a)  Upon motion of any party or upon its own motion, the Commission may order oral argument. Parties requesting oral argument must demonstrate why oral argument would facilitate resolution of the issues before the Commission. Normally, motions for oral argument shall not be considered until after all briefs have been filed.

      (b)  The Executive Secretary shall advise all parties whether oral argument is to be heard. Within a reasonable time before the oral argument is scheduled, the Executive Secretary shall inform the parties of the time and place therefor, the issues to be heard, and the time allotted to the parties.

      (c)  (1) Except under extraordinary circumstances, a request for postponement must be filed at least 10 days before oral argument is scheduled.

      (2) The Executive Secretary shall notify the parties of a postponement in a manner best calculated to avoid unnecessary travel or inconvenience to the parties. The Executive Secretary shall inform all parties of the new time and place for the oral argument.

      (d)  (1) Counsel shall be afforded such time for oral argument as the Commission may provide by order. Requests for enlargement of time may be made by motion filed reasonably in advance of the date fixed for the argument.

      (2) The petitioning party shall argue first. If the case is before the Commission on cross-petitions, the Commission will inform the parties in advance of the order of appearance.

      (3) Counsel may reserve a portion of the time allowed for rebuttal but in opening argument shall present the case fairly and completely and shall not reserve points of substance for presentation during rebuttal.

      (4) Oral argument should undertake to emphasize and clarify the written arguments appearing in the briefs. The Commission will look with disfavor on any oral argument that is read from a previously filed document.

      (5) At any time, the Commission may terminate a party's argument or interrupt the party's presentation for questioning by the Commissioners.

      (e)  Should either party fail to appear for oral argument, the party present may be allowed to proceed with its argument.

      (f)  Where two or more consolidated cases are scheduled for oral argument, the consolidated cases shall be considered as one case for the purpose of allotting time to the parties unless the Commission otherwise directs.

      (g)  Where more than one counsel argues for a party to the case or for multiple parties on the same side in the case, it is counsels' responsibility to agree upon a fair division of the total time allotted. In the event of a failure to agree, the Commission will allocate the time. The Commission may, in its discretion, limit the number of counsel heard for each party or side in the argument. No later than 5 days prior to the date of scheduled argument, the Commission must be notified of the names of the counsel who will argue.

      (h)  (1) The parties may use exhibits introduced into evidence at the hearing. If a party wishes to use a visual aid not part of the record, written notice of the proposed use shall be given to opposing counsel 15 days prior to the argument. Objections, if any, shall be in writing, served on all adverse parties, and filed not fewer than 7 days before the argument.

      (2) No visual aid shall introduce or rely upon facts or evidence not already part of the record.

      (3) If visual aids or exhibits other than documents are to be used at the argument, counsel shall arrange with the Executive Secretary to have them placed in the hearing room on the date of the argument before the Commission convenes.

      (4) Parties using visual aids not introduced into evidence shall have them removed from the hearing room unless the Commission directs otherwise. If such visual aids are not reclaimed by the party within a reasonable time after notice is given by the Executive Secretary, such visual aids shall be disposed of at the discretion of the Executive Secretary.

      (i)  (1) Unless the Commission directs otherwise, oral arguments shall be electronically recorded and made part of the record. Any other sound recording in the hearing room is prohibited. Oral arguments shall also be transcribed verbatim. A copy of the transcript of the oral argument taken by a qualified court reporter, shall be filed with the Commission. The Commission shall bear all expenses for court reporters' fees and for copies of the hearing transcript received by it.

      (2) Persons desiring to listen to the recordings shall make appropriate arrangements with the Executive Secretary. Any party desiring a written copy of the transcript is responsible for securing and paying for its copy.

      (3) Error in the transcript of the oral argument may be corrected by the Commission on its own motion, on joint motion by the parties, or on motion by any party. The motion shall state the error in the transcript and the correction to be made. The official transcript shall reflect the corrections.

      (j)  A party that fails to file a brief shall not be heard at the time of oral argument except by permission of the Commission.

      (k)  (1) An amicus curiae will not be permitted to participate in the oral argument without leave of the Commission upon proper motion. Participation generally will be limited to a portion of the time allotted to the party in whose interest the amicus curiae seeks to participate. In extraordinary circumstances, the amicus curiae may be allotted its own time for oral argument.

      (2) A motion by amicus curiae seeking leave to participate in oral argument shall be filed no later than 14 days prior to the date oral argument is scheduled.

      (3) The motion of an amicus curiae for leave to participate at oral argument shall identify the interest of the applicant and shall state the reason(s) why its participation at oral argument is desirable.

      (4) Motions in opposition to the motion of an amicus curiae for leave to participate in the oral argument must be filed within 10 days of the date of the motion.

#### § § 2200.100

      (a)  Settlement is permitted and encouraged by the Commission at any stage of the proceedings.

      (b) —(1)  If the parties have agreed to a partial or full settlement, they shall so notify the Judge in a written joint submission (titled “Notification of Settlement” or “Notification of Partial Settlement,” as appropriate), in which the parties shall:

      (i) List the contested items that have been settled and, if only a partial settlement agreement has been reached, also list the contested items that remain to be decided;

      (ii) If posting of the settlement agreement is required by § 2200.7(g), certify that the parties' settlement agreement has been posted in the manner prescribed by that rule and certify the date of posting;

      (iii) If party status has been elected under § 2200.20, certify that the party has been afforded an opportunity to provide input on all matters pertaining to the settlement before the agreement is finalized; and

      (iv) If the settlement agreement includes the withdrawal of a notice of contest, citation, notification of proposed penalty, or petition for modification of abatement period, state whether such withdrawal is with prejudice.

      (2) The parties shall not incorporate the settlement agreement in, or append it to, the joint submission required in paragraph (b)(1) of this section or substitute the settlement agreement for the required joint submission.

      (3)  If the requirements of paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section have been met with respect to all contested citation items and no affected employees who have elected party status have raised an objection to the reasonableness of any abatement period, the Judge shall issue an Order acknowledging that the parties have resolved all contested citation items and agreed to terminate the proceeding before the Commission.

      (c)  A Notification of Settlement submitted after a Judge's report has been issued shall be filed with the Executive Secretary. Proof of service shall be filed with the Notification of Settlement, showing service upon all parties and authorized employee representatives in the manner prescribed by § 2200.7(c) and (d) and the posting of notice to non-party affected employees in the manner prescribed by § 2200.7(g). The parties shall also file a draft order terminating the proceedings for adoption by the Judge or, if the Judge's report has been issued, by the Commission. If the time has not expired under these rules for electing party status, an order acknowledging the termination of the proceedings before the Commission because of the settlement shall not be issued until at least 14 days after service or posting to consider any affected employee's or authorized employee representative's objection to the reasonableness of any abatement time. The affected employee or authorized employee representative shall file any such objection within this time. If such objection is filed, the Commission or the Judge shall provide an opportunity for the affected employees or authorized employee representative to be heard and present evidence on the objection, which shall be limited to the reasonableness of the abatement period.

The cause for the exclusion shall be stated in writing or may be stated in the record if the exclusion occurs during the course of the hearing. Where the person removed is a party's attorney or other representative, the Judge shall suspend the proceeding for a reasonable time for the purpose of enabling the party to obtain another attorney or other representative.

#### § § 2200.120

      (a) —(1)  (i) _Voluntary settlement_ applies only to notices of contests by employers and to applications for fees under the Equal Access to Justice Act and 29 CFR part 2204.

      (ii) Upon motion of any party conforming to § 2200.40 after the docketing of the notice of contest, or with the consent of the parties at any time in the proceedings, the Chief Administrative Law Judge may assign a case to a Settlement Judge for proceedings under this section. In the event either the Secretary or the employer objects to the use of a Settlement Judge procedure, such procedure shall not be imposed.

      (2)  Voluntary settlement procedures shall be for a period not to exceed 75 days, unless extended with the concurrence of the Chief Administrative Law Judge.

      (b) —(1)  _Mandatory settlement_ applies only to notices of contest by employers in which the aggregate amount of the penalties sought by the Secretary is $205,000 or greater. Periodically, the aggregate amount of penalties for case referral to Mandatory Settlement Proceedings may be adjusted proportionately upon consideration of the penalty increases required by the Inflation Adjustment Act of 2015. The adjusted aggregate penalty amount for case referral to Mandatory Settlement will be posted on the Commission's website ().

      (2)  Notwithstanding any other provisions of these rules, upon the docketing of the notice of contest, the Chief Administrative Law Judge shall assign to the Settlement Part any case which satisfies the criteria set forth in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. The Chief Administrative Law Judge shall appoint a Settlement Judge, who shall be a Judge other than the one assigned to hear and decide the case, except as provided in paragraph (f)(2) of this section.

      (3)  (i) The Settlement Judge may consult all attorneys, non-attorney representatives, and self-represented parties by any suitable means to schedule the Settlement Conference and to facilitate preparation for the conference.

      (ii) The Settlement Judge may issue a preconference scheduling order addressing procedural matters, including but not limited to, formal pleadings, settlement status conference calls, ex parte caucus calls, and allowing, limiting, or suspending discovery during the settlement proceedings.

      (iii) The Settlement Conference shall be conducted as soon as practicable, taking into consideration the case size, the complexity of the issues, and the time needed to complete preconference preparation.

      (iv) Mandatory settlement procedures under this section shall be for a period not to exceed 120 days, unless extended with the concurrence of the Chief Administrative Law Judge.

      (v) If at the conclusion of the settlement proceedings the case has not been settled, the Settlement Judge shall promptly inform the Chief Administrative Law Judge in accordance with § 2200.120(f)(2).

      (c)  (1) The Settlement Judge shall confer with the parties regarding the whole or partial settlement of the case and seek resolution of as many issues as is feasible.

      (2) The Settlement Judge may require the parties to provide statements of the issues in controversy and the factual predicate for each party's position on each issue and may enter other orders as appropriate to facilitate the proceedings.

      (3) The Settlement Judge may allow or suspend discovery during the settlement proceedings.

      (4) The Settlement Judge has the discretion to engage in ex parte communications throughout the course of settlement proceedings. The Settlement Judge may suggest privately to each attorney or other representative of a party what concessions the client should consider and assess privately with each attorney or other representative the reasonableness of the party's case or settlement position.

      (5) The Settlement Judge may, with the consent of the parties, conduct such other settlement proceedings as may aid in the settlement of the case.

      (d) —(1)  The Settlement Judge shall convene and preside over conferences between the parties. The Settlement Judge shall designate the time, place, and nature of the conference.

      (2)  The Settlement Judge may require that any attorney or other representative who is expected to try the case for each party be present. The Settlement Judge may also require that the party's representative be accompanied by an official of the party having full settlement authority on behalf of the party. The parties and their representatives or attorneys are expected to be completely candid with the Settlement Judge so that the Settlement Judge may properly guide settlement discussions. The failure to be present at a settlement conference or otherwise to comply with the orders of the Settlement Judge or the refusal to cooperate fully within the spirit of this rule may result in default or the imposition of sanctions under § 2200.101.

      (3)  (i) All statements made and all information presented during the course of settlement proceedings under this section shall be regarded as confidential and shall not be divulged outside of these proceedings except with the consent of the parties. The Settlement Judge shall issue appropriate orders to protect the confidentiality of settlement proceedings.

      (ii) The Settlement Judge shall not divulge any statements or information presented during private negotiations with a party or the party's representative during settlement proceedings except with the consent of that party.

      (iii) The following shall not be admissible in any subsequent hearing, except by stipulation of the parties:

      (A) Evidence of statements or conduct in settlement proceedings under this section within the scope of Federal Rule of Evidence 408,

      (B) Notes or other material prepared by or maintained by the Settlement Judge in connection with settlement proceedings, and

      (C) Communications between the Settlement Judge and the Chief Administrative Law Judge in connection with settlement proceedings including the report of the Settlement Judge under paragraph (f) of this section.

      (iv) Documents and factual information disclosed in the settlement proceeding may not be used in litigation unless obtained through appropriate discovery or subpoena.

      (v) With respect to the Settlement Judge's participation in settlement proceedings, the Settlement Judge shall not discuss the merits of the case with any other person, nor appear as a witness in any hearing of the case.

      (vi) The requirements of paragraph (d)(3) of this section apply unless disclosure is required by any applicable law or public policy.

      (e)  No material of any form required to be held confidential under paragraph (d)(3) of this section shall be considered part of the official case record required to be maintained under 29 U.S.C. 661(g), nor shall any such material be open to public inspection as required by section 661(g), unless the parties otherwise stipulate. With the exception of an order approving the terms of any partial settlement agreed to between the parties as set forth in paragraph (f)(1) of this section, the Settlement Judge shall not file or cause to be filed in the official case record any material in the Settlement Judge's possession relating to these settlement proceedings, including but not limited to communications with the Chief Administrative Law Judge and the Settlement Judge's report under paragraph (f) of this section, unless the parties otherwise stipulate.

      (f)  (1) The Settlement Judge shall promptly notify the Chief Administrative Law Judge in writing of the status of the case at the conclusion of the settlement period or such time that the Settlement Judge determines further negotiations would be fruitless. If the Settlement Judge has made such a determination and a settlement agreement is not achieved within 75 days of the case being assigned to voluntary settlement proceedings or within 120 days of being assigned for mandatory settlement proceedings, the Settlement Judge shall then advise the Chief Administrative Law Judge in writing. The Chief Administrative Law Judge may then in the Chief Administrative Law Judge's discretion allow an additional period of time, for further proceedings under this section. If at the expiration of the period allotted under this paragraph the Settlement Judge has not approved a full settlement, the Settlement Judge shall furnish to the Chief Administrative Law Judge copies of any written stipulations and orders embodying the terms of any partial settlement the parties have reached.

      (2) At the termination of the settlement period without a full settlement, the Chief Administrative Law Judge shall promptly assign the case to an Administrative Law Judge other than the Settlement Judge or Chief Administrative Law Judge for appropriate action on the remaining issues. If all the parties, the Settlement Judge, and the Chief Administrative Law Judge agree, the Settlement Judge may be retained as the Hearing Judge.

      (g)  Notwithstanding the provisions of § 2200.73 regarding interlocutory review, any decision concerning the assignment of any Judge and any decision by the Settlement Judge to terminate settlement proceedings under this section is not subject to review, appeal, or rehearing.

    Subparts I-L [Reserved]

    Subpart M—Simplified Proceedings

      § 2200.200   Purpose.

#### § § 2200.200

      (a) The purpose of the Simplified Proceedings subpart is to provide simplified procedures for resolving contests under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, so that parties before the Commission may reduce the time and expense of litigation while being assured due process and a hearing that meets the requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 554. These procedural rules will be applied to accomplish this purpose.

      (b) Procedures under this subpart are simplified in a number of ways. The major differences between these procedures and those provided in subparts A through G of the Commission's rules of procedure are as follows.

      (1) Complaints and answers are not required.

      (2) Pleadings generally are not required. Early discussions among the parties and the Judge are required to narrow and define the disputes between the parties.

      (3) The Secretary is required to provide the employer with certain informational documents early in the proceeding.

      (4) Discovery is not permitted except as ordered by the Judge.

      (5) Interlocutory appeals are not permitted.

      (6) Hearings are less formal. The admission of evidence is not controlled by the Federal Rules of Evidence except as provided for in § 2200.209(c). The Judge may allow the parties to argue their case orally at the conclusion of the hearing, and may allow or require post-hearing briefs or statements of position. The judge may render a decision from the bench.

      § 2200.201   Application.

#### § § 2200.201

      The rules in this subpart will govern proceedings before a Judge in a case chosen for Simplified Proceedings under § 2200.203.

      § 2200.202   Eligibility for Simplified Proceedings.

#### § § 2200.202

      (a) Those cases selected for Simplified Proceedings will be those that do not involve complex issues of law or fact. Cases appropriate for Simplified Proceedings will generally include those with one or more of the following characteristics:

      (1) Relatively few citation items,

      (2) An aggregate proposed penalty of not more than $20,000,

      (3) No allegation of willfulness or a repeat violation,

      (4) Not involving a fatality,

      (5) A hearing that is expected to take less than 2 days, or

      (6) A small employer whether self-represented or represented by counsel.

      (b) Those cases with an aggregate proposed penalty of more than $20,000, but not more than $30,000, if otherwise appropriate, may be selected for Simplified Proceedings at the discretion of the Chief Administrative Law Judge.

> [84 FR 14558, Apr. 10, 2019; 84 FR 45655, Aug. 30, 2019]

      § 2200.203   Commencing Simplified Proceedings.

#### § § 2200.203

      (a)  Upon receipt of a Notice of Contest, the Chief Administrative Law Judge may, at the Chief Administrative Law Judge's discretion, assign an appropriate case for Simplified Proceedings.

      (b)  Within 21 days of the notice of docketing, any party may request that the case be assigned for Simplified Proceedings. The request must be in writing. For example, “I request Simplified Proceedings” will suffice. The request must be sent to the Executive Secretary. Copies must be sent to each of the other parties.

      (c)  The Chief Administrative Law Judge or the Judge assigned to the case may grant a party's request and assign a case for Simplified Proceedings at the Judge's discretion. Such request shall be acted upon within 14 days of its receipt by the Judge.

      (d)  If a party has requested Simplified Proceedings or the Judge has assigned the case for Simplified Proceedings, the times for filing a complaint or answer will not run. If a request for Simplified Proceedings is denied, the period for filing a complaint or answer will begin to run upon issuance of the notice denying Simplified Proceedings.

      § 2200.204   Discontinuance of Simplified Proceedings.

#### § § 2200.204

      (a)  If it becomes apparent at any time that a case is not appropriate for Simplified Proceedings, the Judge assigned to the case may, upon motion by any party or upon the Judge's own motion, discontinue Simplified Proceedings and order the case to continue under conventional rules. Before discontinuing Simplified Proceedings, the Judge will consult with the Chief Administrative Law Judge.

      (b)  At any time during the proceedings any party may request that Simplified Proceedings be discontinued and that the matter continue under conventional procedures. A motion to discontinue must conform to § 2200.40 and explain why the case is inappropriate for Simplified Proceedings. Responses to such motions shall be filed within the time specified by § 2200.40. Joint motions to return a case to conventional proceedings shall be granted by the Judge and do not require a showing of good cause, except that the Judge may deny such a motion that is filed less than 30 days before a scheduled hearing date.

      (c)  If Simplified Proceedings are discontinued, the Judge may issue such orders as are necessary for an orderly continuation under conventional rules.

      § 2200.205   Filing of pleadings.

#### § § 2200.205

      (a)  Once a case is designated for Simplified Proceedings, the complaint and answer requirements are suspended. If the Secretary has filed a complaint under § 2200.34(a), a response to a petition under § 2200.37(d)(5), or a response to an employee contest under § 2200.38(a), and if Simplified Proceedings has been ordered, no response to these documents will be required.

      (b)  Limited, if any, motion practice is contemplated in Simplified Proceedings, but all motion practice shall conform with § 2200.40.

      § 2200.206   Disclosure of information.

#### § § 2200.206

      (a)  (1) Within 21 days after a case is designated for Simplified Proceedings, the Secretary shall provide the employer, free of charge, copies of the narrative (Form OSHA 1-A) and the worksheet (Form OSHA 1-B) or their equivalents.

      (2) Within 30 days after a case is designated for Simplified Proceedings, the Secretary shall provide the employer with reproductions of any photographs or videotapes that the Secretary anticipates using at the hearing.

      (3) Within 30 days after a case is designated for Simplified Proceedings, the Secretary shall provide to the employer any exculpatory evidence in the Secretary's possession.

      (4) The Judge shall act expeditiously on any claim by the employer that the Secretary improperly withheld or redacted any portion of the documents, photographs, or videotapes on the grounds of confidentiality or privilege.

      (b)  When the employer raises an affirmative defense pursuant to § 2200.207(b), the Judge shall order the employer to disclose to the Secretary such documents relevant to the affirmative defense as the Judge deems appropriate.

      § 2200.207   Pre-hearing conference.

#### § § 2200.207

      (a)  As early as practicable after the employer has received the documents set forth in § 2200.206(a)(1), the Judge may conduct a pre-hearing conference, which the Judge may hold in person or by telephone or electronic means.

      (b)  At the pre-hearing conference, the parties may discuss the following: Settlement of the case; the narrowing of issues; an agreed statement of issues and facts; all defenses; witnesses and exhibits; motions; and any other pertinent matter. Except under extraordinary circumstances, any affirmative defenses not raised at the pre-hearing conference may not be raised later. At the conclusion of the conference, the Judge will issue an order that may set forth any agreements reached by the parties and that may specify the issues to be addressed by the parties at the hearing.

      § 2200.208   Discovery.

#### § § 2200.208

      Discovery, including requests for admissions, will only be allowed under the conditions and time limits set by the Judge.

      § 2200.209   Hearing.

#### § § 2200.209

      (a)  As soon as practicable after the conclusion of the pre-hearing conference, the Judge will hold a hearing on any issue that remains in dispute. The hearing will be in accordance with subpart E of these rules, except for § 2200.73 which will not apply.

      (b)  At the beginning of the hearing, the Judge will enter into the record all agreements reached by the parties as well as defenses raised during the pre-hearing conference. The parties and the Judge then will attempt to resolve or narrow the remaining issues. The Judge will enter into the record any further agreements reached by the parties.

      (c)  Except as to matters that are protected by evidentiary privilege, the admission of evidence is not controlled by the Federal Rules of Evidence, but the Judge may accept a written stipulation of the parties that the Federal Rules of Evidence shall apply in whole or, as specified, in part. The Judge will receive oral, physical, or documentary evidence that is not irrelevant, unduly repetitious, or unreliable. Testimony will be given under oath or affirmation.

      (d)  A reporter will be present at the hearing. An official verbatim transcript of the hearing will be prepared and filed with the Judge. Parties may purchase copies of the transcript from the reporter.

      (e)  Each party may present an oral argument at the close of the hearing. The Judge may allow or require post-hearing briefs or statements of position upon the request of either party or on the Judge's own motion. The form of any post-hearing briefs shall conform to § 2200.74 unless the Judge specifies otherwise.

      (f) —(1)  The Judge may render a decision from the bench. In rendering a decision from the bench, the Judge shall state the issues in the case and make clear both the Judge's findings of fact and conclusions of law on the record. The Judge shall reduce the bench decision in the matter to writing and serve it on the parties as soon as practicable, but no later than 45 days after the hearing. If additional time is needed, approval of the Chief Administrative Law Judge is required. The decision shall be prepared in accordance with § 2200.90(a). The written decision shall include, as an appendix, the bench decision as set forth in the transcript.

      (2)  If the Judge does not render a decision from the bench, the Judge will issue a written decision within 60 days of the close of the record. The record will ordinarily be deemed closed upon the latter of the filing of the hearing transcript, or the completion of any permitted post-hearing briefing. The decision will be in accordance with § 2200.90(a). If additional time is needed, approval of the Chief Administrative Law Judge is required.

      (g)  When the Judge issues a written decision, service, filing, and docketing of the Judge's written decision shall be in accordance with § 2200.90.

      § 2200.210   Review of Judge's decision.

#### § § 2200.210

      Any party may petition for Commission review of the Judge's decision as provided in § 2200.91. After the issuance of the Judge's written decision, the parties may pursue the case following the rules in Subpart F of this part.

      § 2200.211   Applicability of subparts A through G.

#### § § 2200.211

      The provisions of subpart D (§§ 2200.50-2200.57) and §§ 2200.34, 2200.37(d), 2200.38, 2200.71, and 2200.73 will not apply to Simplified Proceedings. All other rules contained in subparts A through G of the Commission's rules of procedure will apply when consistent with the rules in this subpart governing Simplified Proceedings.

**Authority:** Authority: 29 U.S.C. 661(g); 5 U.S.C. 552.

**Source:** Source: 71 FR 56350, Sept. 27, 2006, unless otherwise noted.

    § 2201.1   Purpose and scope.

#### § § 2201.1

    This part prescribes procedures to obtain information and records of the Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission (OSHRC or Commission) under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552. It applies only to records or information of the Commission or in the Commission's custody. This part does not affect discovery in adversary proceedings before the Commission. Discovery is governed by the Commission's Rules of Procedure in 29 CFR part 2200, subpart D.

    § 2201.2   Description of agency.

#### § § 2201.2

    OSHRC adjudicates contested enforcement actions under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, 29 U.S.C. 651-678. The Commission decides cases after the parties are given an opportunity for a hearing. All hearings are open to the public and are conducted at a place convenient to the parties by an Administrative Law Judge. Any Commissioner may direct that a decision of a Judge be reviewed by the full Commission. The President designates one of the Commissioners as Chairman, who is responsible on behalf of the Commission for the administrative operations of the Commission.

    § 2201.3   Delegation of authority and responsibilities.

#### § § 2201.3

    (a) The Chairman delegates to the Chief FOIA Officer the authority to act upon all requests for agency records. The Chief FOIA Officer shall, subject to the authority of the Chairman:

    (1) Have agency-wide responsibility for efficient and appropriate compliance with this section;

    (2) Monitor implementation of the FOIA throughout the agency and keep the Chairman and the Attorney General appropriately informed of the agency's performance in implementing this section;

    (3) Recommend to the Chairman such adjustments to agency practices, policies, personnel, and funding as may be necessary to improve implementation of this section;

    (4) Review and report to the Attorney General, through the Chairman, at such times and in such formats as the Attorney General may direct, on the agency's performance in implementing this section; and

    (5) Facilitate public understanding of the purposes of the statutory exemptions of this section by including concise descriptions of the exemptions in both the agency's FOIA Reference Guide, and the agency's annual report on this section, and by providing an overview, where appropriate, of certain general categories of agency records to which those exemptions apply.

    (b) The Chief FOIA Officer shall designate the FOIA Disclosure Officer(s), who shall be responsible for processing FOIA requests.

    (c) The Chief FOIA Officer shall designate the FOIA Public Liaison(s), who shall serve as the official(s) to whom a FOIA requester can raise concerns about the service the FOIA requester has received following an initial response. FOIA Public Liaisons shall be responsible for assisting in reducing delays, increasing transparency and understanding of the status of requests, and assisting in the resolution of disputes.

    (d) OSHRC establishes a FOIA Requester Service Center that shall be staffed by the FOIA Disclosure Officer(s) and FOIA Public Liaison(s). The address of the FOIA Requester Service Center is 1120 20th Street NW., 9th Floor, Washington, DC 20036-3457. The telephone number, fax number and additional contact information for the FOIA Requester Service Center is located on the agency's Web site at:  The FOIA Requester Service Center is available to provide information about the status of a request to the requester using the assigned tracking number (as described in § 2201.6(h)), including:

    (1) The date on which the agency originally received the request; and

    (2) An estimated date on which the agency will complete action on the request.

> [71 FR 56350, Sept. 27, 2006, as amended at 75 FR 41371, July 16, 2010; 81 FR 95037, Dec. 27, 2016]

    § 2201.4   General policy and definitions.

#### § § 2201.4

    (a)  Except for records and information exempted from disclosure by 5 U.S.C. 552(b) or published in the  under 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(1), all records of the Commission or in its custody are available to any person who requests them in accordance with § 2201.5. Records include any information that would be a record subject to the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 552 when maintained by the Commission in any format, including electronic format. In response to FOIA requests, the Commission will search for records manually or by automated means, except when an automated search would significantly interfere with the operation of the Commission's automated information system.

    (b)  The records of Commission activities are publicly available for inspection and copying, and may be accessed electronically on the Commission's Web site at  These records include:

    (1) Final decisions, including concurring and dissenting opinions, remand orders, as well as Administrative Law Judge decisions pending OSHRC review, briefing notices, and other significant orders;

    (2) OSHRC Rules of Procedure and Guides to those procedures;

    (3) Agency policy statements and interpretations adopted by OSHRC and not published in the  if any;

    (4) Administrative staff manuals that affect a member of the public, if any;

    (5) Copies of records that have been released to a person under the FOIA that, because of the subject matter, the Commission determines have become or are likely to become the subject of subsequent requests for substantially the same records, or that have been requested three or more times, as well as records the Commission determines absent a FOIA request could be of significant public interest; and

    (6) A general index of records referred to under paragraph (b)(5) of this section.

    (c)  Any member of the public may, upon request, access OSHRC's e-FOIA Reading Room via a computer terminal at the OSHRC National Office, located at 1120 20th St. NW., 9th Floor, Washington, DC 20036-3457. Such a request must be made in writing to the FOIA Requester Service Center, and indicate a preferred date and time for the requested access. OSHRC reserves the right to arrange a different date and time with the requester, if necessary.

    (d)  For purposes of this part:

    means a request from or on behalf of a person who seeks information for a use or purpose that furthers his or her commercial, trade, or profit interests, which can include furthering those interests through litigation. The FOIA Disclosure Officer shall determine, whenever reasonably possible, the use to which a requester will put the requested records. When it appears that the requester will put the records to a commercial use, either because of the nature of the request itself or because the FOIA Disclosure Officer has reasonable cause to doubt a requester's stated use, the FOIA Disclosure Officer shall provide the requester a reasonable opportunity to submit further clarification.

    means those expenses that the Commission actually incurs in searching for and duplicating (and, in the case of commercial use requests, reviewing) records to respond to a FOIA request. _Direct costs_ include, for example, the salary of the employee performing the work (the basic rate of pay for the employee, plus 16 percent of that rate to cover benefits) and the cost of operating duplication machinery. Not included in direct costs are overhead expenses such as the costs of space and heating or lighting of the facility in which the records are kept.

    means the making of a copy of a record, or of the information contained in it, necessary to respond to a FOIA request. Copies can take the form of paper, microform, audiovisual materials, or electronic records (for example, magnetic tape or disk), among others. The FOIA Disclosure Officer shall honor a requester's specified preference of form or format of disclosure if the record is readily reproducible with reasonable efforts in the requested form or format.

    means a preschool, a public or private elementary or secondary school, an institution of undergraduate higher education, an institution of graduate higher education, an institution of professional education, or an institution of vocational education, that operates a program of scholarly research. To be in this category, a requester must show that the request is authorized by and is made under the auspices of a qualifying institution and that the records are not sought for a commercial use but are sought to further scholarly research.

    does not include a delay that results from a predictable agency workload of requests under this section, unless the agency demonstrates reasonable progress in reducing its backlog of pending requests.

    means an institution that is not operated on a “commercial” basis, as that term is defined in this paragraph, and that is operated solely for the purpose of conducting scientific research the results of which are not intended to promote any particular product or industry. To be in this category, a requester must show that the request is authorized by and is made under the auspices of a qualifying institution and that the records are not sought for a commercial use but are sought to further scientific research.

    means any information that would be an OSHRC record subject to the requirements of the FOIA when maintained by OSHRC in any format, including an electronic format, and any such OSHRC record that is maintained for OSHRC by an entity under Government contract, for the purposes of records management.

    is any person or entity that gathers information of potential interest to a segment of the public, uses its editorial skills to turn the raw materials into a distinct work, and distributes that work to an audience. For purposes of this definition, the term “news” means information that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the public. Examples of news media entities include television or radio stations broadcasting to the public at large and publishers of periodicals (but only in those instances where they can qualify as disseminators of “news”) who make their products available for purchase or subscription by, or free distribution to, the general public. These examples are not all-inclusive. Moreover, as methods of news delivery evolve (for example the adoption of the electronic dissemination of newspapers through telecommunications services), such alternative media shall be considered to be news-media entities. For “freelance” journalists to be regarded as working for a news organization, they must demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication through that organization. A publication contract would be the clearest proof, but OSHRC shall also look to the past publication record of a requester in making this determination. To be in this category, a requester must not be seeking the requested records for a commercial use. However, a request for records supporting the news-dissemination function of the requester shall not be considered to be for a commercial use.

    means the examination of a record located in response to a request in order to determine whether any portion of it is exempt from disclosure. It also includes processing any record for disclosure—for example, doing all that is necessary to redact it and prepare it for disclosure. _Review_ costs are recoverable even if a record ultimately is not disclosed. Review time does not include time spent resolving general legal or policy issues regarding the application of exemptions.

    means the process of looking for and retrieving records or information responsive to a request. It includes page-by-page or line-by-line identification of information within records and also includes reasonable efforts to locate and retrieve information from records maintained in electronic form or format. The FOIA Disclosure Officer shall ensure that searches are done in the most efficient and least expensive manner reasonably possible. For example, the FOIA Disclosure Officer shall not search line-by-line where duplicating an entire document would be quicker and less expensive.

    means a regular Federal working day. It does not include Saturdays, Sundays, or Federal legal public holidays.

    § 2201.5   Procedure for requesting records.

#### § § 2201.5

    (a)  All requests for information must be made in writing to the FOIA Disclosure Officer and may be: Mailed or delivered; faxed; or emailed. Requests may also be made using the Commission's online FOIA request form (which is a downloadable PDF file found at ) and the completed form can be submitted by mail, fax, or email. Contact information for the FOIA Disclosure Officer is described in § 2201.3(d). For mailed or delivered requests, the words “Freedom of Information Act Request” must be printed on the face of the request's envelope or covering as well as the request itself.

    (b) A requester who is making a request for records about himself or herself must comply with verification of identity requirements as required by 29 CFR 2400.4 in OSHRC's Privacy Act regulations.

    (c) Where a request for records pertains to another individual, a requester may receive greater access by submitting either a notarized authorization signed by that individual or a declaration made in compliance with the requirements set forth in 28 U.S.C. 1746 by that individual authorizing disclosure of the records to the requester, or by submitting proof that the individual is deceased ( a copy of a death certificate or an obituary).

    (d)  A request must describe the records sought in sufficient detail to enable the Commission to locate them with a reasonable amount of effort. To the extent possible, the request should include specific information to identify the requested records, such as the docket number(s) or case name(s). Before submitting a request, the requester may contact the FOIA Disclosure Officer, as described in § 2201.3(d), to discuss the records being sought and receive assistance in describing them. If a determination is made after receiving a request that it does not reasonably describe the records sought, the FOIA Disclosure Officer will contact the requester to explain what additional information is needed or why the request is otherwise insufficient. A requester attempting to reformulate or modify such a request is encouraged to discuss the request with the FOIA Disclosure Officer. If a request does not reasonably describe the records sought, the agency's response may be delayed.

    (e) Requests may specify the preferred form or format (including electronic formats) of the response. The FOIA Disclosure Officer shall honor a requester's specified preference of form or format of disclosure if the record is readily reproducible with reasonable efforts in the requested form or format. When a requester does not specify the preferred form or format of the response, the FOIA Disclosure Officer shall respond in the form or format in which the record is most accessible to the Commission.

    (f) The requester must provide contact information, such as a phone number, email address, and/or mailing address, to facilitate the agency's communication with the requester.

    (g)  A request that complies with paragraph (a) of this section is deemed received on the actual date it is received by the Commission. A request that does not comply with paragraph (a) of this section is deemed received when it is actually received by the FOIA Disclosure Officer. For requests that are expected to result in fees exceeding $250, the request shall not be deemed to have been received until the requester is advised of the anticipated costs and the Commission has received full payment or satisfactory assurance of full payment as provided under § 2201.8(f).

    § 2201.6   Responses to requests.

#### § § 2201.6

    (a)  The FOIA Disclosure Officer will either grant or deny a request for records within 20 working days after receiving the request. The 20-day period shall not be tolled by the agency except in the following cases. In these cases, the agency's receipt of the requester's response to the agency's request for information or clarification ends the tolling period.

    (1) The agency may toll the 20-day period once while awaiting information that it has reasonably requested from the requester under this section. The agency may make more than one request to the requester for information not related to issues regarding fee assessment, but can only toll the 20-day period once; and

    (2) The agency may toll the 20-day period as many times as are necessary to clarify any issues regarding fee assessment.

    (b)  In unusual circumstances, the Commission may extend the time limit prescribed in paragraph (a) of this section by not more than 10 working days. The FOIA Disclosure Officer shall notify the requester in writing of the extension, the reasons for the extension and the date on which a determination is expected. “Unusual circumstances” exists, but only to the extent reasonably necessary to the proper processing of the particular request, when there is a need to:

    (1) Search for and collect the requested records from one of OSHRC's regional offices or off-site storage facilities;

    (2) Search for, collect, and appropriately examine a voluminous amount of separate and distinct records that are demanded in a single request; or

    (3) Consult, with all practicable speed, with another agency having a substantial interest in the determination of the request.

    (c)  The FOIA Disclosure Officer shall notify the requester in writing when it appears that a request cannot be completed within the allowable time (20 working days plus a 10-working-day extension). In such instances, the requester will be provided an opportunity to limit the scope of the request so that it may be processed in the time limit, or to agree to a reasonable alternative time frame for processing. The FOIA Disclosure Officer or FOIA Public Liaison shall be available to assist the requester for this purpose and shall notify the requester of the right to seek dispute resolution services from the National Archives and Records Administration's Office of Government Information Services (OGIS).

    (d)  To ensure the most equitable treatment possible for all requesters, the Commission will process requests on a first-in, first-out basis using a two-track processing system based upon the estimated time it will take to process the request.

    (1) The first track is for requests of simple to moderate complexity that are expected to be completed within 20 working days.

    (2) The second track is for requests involving “unusual circumstances” that are expected to take between 21 to 30 working days to complete and those that, because of their unusual volume or other complexity, are expected to take more than 30 working days to complete.

    (3) A requester should assume, unless otherwise notified by the Commission, that its request is in the first track of processing. The Commission will notify a requester when its request is placed in the second track for processing and that notification will include the estimated time for completion. Should subsequent information substantially change the estimated time to process a request, the requester will be notified in writing. In the case of a request expected to take more than 30 working days for action, a requester may modify the request to allow it to be processed faster or to reduce the cost of processing. Partial responses may be sent to a requester as documents are obtained by the FOIA Disclosure Officer from the supplying offices.

    (e)  (1) The Commission may place a person's request at the front of the queue for the appropriate track for that request upon receipt of a written request that clearly demonstrates a _compelling need_ for expedited processing. Requesters must provide detailed explanations to support their expedited requests. For purposes of determining expedited processing, the term  means:

    (i) That a failure to obtain requested records on an expedited basis could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of any individual; or

    (ii) That a request is made by a person primarily engaged in disseminating information, and that person establishes that there is an urgency to inform the public concerning actual or alleged Federal Government activity.

    (2) A person requesting expedited processing must include a statement certifying the compelling need given to be true and correct to the best of his or her knowledge and belief. The certification requirement may be waived by the Commission as a matter of agency discretion.

    (3) The FOIA Disclosure Officer will make the initial determination whether to grant or deny a request for expedited processing and will notify a requester within 10 calendar days after receiving the request whether processing will be expedited.

    (f)  When the FOIA Disclosure Officer denies a request for records, either in whole or in part, a request for expedited processing, and/or a request for fee waivers (see § 2201.9), the written notice of the denial shall state the reason for denial, give a reasonable estimate of the volume of matter denied (unless doing so would harm an interest protected by the exemption(s) under which the request was denied), set forth the name and title or position of the person responsible for the denial of the request, notify the requester of the right to appeal the determination as specified in § 2201.10, and notify the requester of the assistance available from the FOIA Public Liaison and the dispute resolution services offered by OGIS. A refusal by the FOIA Disclosure Officer to process the request because the requester has not made advance payment or given a satisfactory assurance of full payment required under § 2201.8(f) may be treated as a denial of the request and appealed under § 2201.10.

    (g)  The FOIA Disclosure Officer shall provide to the requester in writing a justification for deletions within records. The amount of information deleted from records shall be indicated on the released portion of the record, unless including that indication would harm an interest protected by the exemption under which the deletion is made. If technically feasible, the place in the record where the deletion is made, and the exemption under which the deletion is made, shall be marked.

    (h)  The FOIA Disclosure Officer shall assign an individualized tracking number to each request received for processing and provide the requester with the tracking number.

    (i)  In determining which records are responsive to a request, OSHRC ordinarily will include only records in its possession as of the date it begins its search for them. If any other date is used, OSHRC shall inform the requester of that date.

    § 2201.7   Confidential commercial information.

#### § § 2201.7

    (a)  (1)  means commercial or financial information obtained by OSHRC from a submitter that may be protected from disclosure under Exemption 4 of the FOIA, 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4).

    (2)  means any person or entity, including a corporation, State, or foreign government, but not including another Federal Government entity, that provides confidential commercial information, either directly or indirectly to OSHRC.

    (b)  A submitter of confidential commercial information must use good faith efforts to designate by appropriate markings, at the time of submission, any portion of its submission that it considers to be protected from disclosure under Exemption 4. These designations expire 10 years after the date of the submission unless the submitter requests and provides justification for a longer designation period.

    (c)  OSHRC shall promptly provide written notice to the submitter of confidential commercial information whenever records containing such information are requested under the FOIA if OSHRC determines that it may be required to disclose the records, provided the submitter has complied with paragraph (b) of this section or OSHRC has a reason to believe that the requested information may be protected from disclosure under Exemption 4, but has not yet determined whether the information is protected from disclosure. The notice must either describe the commercial information requested or include a copy of the requested records or portions of records containing the information.

    (d)  The notice requirements of this section do not apply if:

    (1) OSHRC determines that the information is exempt under the FOIA, and therefore will not be disclosed;

    (2) The information has been lawfully published or has been officially made available to the public;

    (3) Disclosure of the information is required by a statute other than the FOIA or by a regulation issued in accordance with the requirements of Executive Order 12600 of June 23, 1987; or

    (4) The designation made by the submitter under paragraph (b) of this section appears obviously frivolous. In such case, OSHRC shall give the submitter written notice of any final decision to disclose the information within a reasonable number of days prior to a specified disclosure date.

    (e)  OSHRC shall specify a reasonable time period within which the submitter must provide a response to the notice referenced above. If a submitter has any objections to disclosure, it should provide a detailed written statement that specifies all grounds for withholding the particular information under any exemption of the FOIA. In order to rely on Exemption 4 as basis for nondisclosure, the submitter must explain why the information constitutes a trade secret or commercial or financial information that is confidential. A submitter who fails to respond within the time period specified in the notice will be considered to have no objection to disclosure of the information. OSHRC is not required to consider any information received after the date of any disclosure decision. Any information provided by a submitter under this subpart may itself be subject to disclosure under the FOIA.

    (f)  OSHRC shall consider a submitter's objections and specific grounds for nondisclosure in deciding whether to disclose the requested information.

    (g)  OSHRC shall provide the submitter with written notice once a decision is made as to whether or not to disclose information over the submitter's objection. When a decision is made to disclose information over the submitter's objection, this notice shall include a statement of the reasons why each of the submitter's disclosure objections was not sustained, a description of the information to be disclosed or copies of the records as the agency intends to release them, and a specified disclosure date (which must be a reasonable time after the notice).

    (h)  OSHRC shall promptly notify the submitter when a requester files a lawsuit seeking to compel the disclosure of confidential commercial information.

    (i)  OSHRC shall notify the requester whenever it provides the submitter with notice and an opportunity to object to disclosure; whenever it notifies the submitter of its intent to disclose the requested information; and whenever a submitter files a lawsuit to prevent the disclosure of the information.

    § 2201.8   Fees for copying, searching, and review.

#### § § 2201.8

    (a)  The FOIA Disclosure Officer shall charge fees in accordance with the Uniform Freedom of Information Fee Schedule and Guidelines published by the Office of Management and Budget and in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section. See appendix A to this part. If the fees for a request are less than the threshold amount as provided in OSHRC's fee schedule, no fees shall be charged. The FOIA Disclosure Officer shall, however, waive the fees in the circumstances stated in § 2201.9.

    (b)  Fees for copying, searching and reviewing will be based on the direct costs of these services, including the average hourly salary (base plus DC locality payment), plus 16 percent for benefits, of the following three categories of employees involved in responding to FOIA requests: Clerical—based on an average of all employees at GS-9 and below; professional—based on an average of all employees at GS-10 through GS-14; and managerial—based on an average of all employees at GS-15 and above. OSHRC will calculate a schedule of fees based on these direct costs. The schedule of fees under this section appears in appendix A to this part. A copy of the schedule of fees may also be obtained at no charge from the FOIA Disclosure Officer. See § 2201.3(d).

    (1)  The fee per copy of each page shall be calculated in accordance with the per-page amount established in OSHRC's fee schedule. See appendix A to this part. For other forms of duplication, direct costs of producing the copy, including operator time, shall be calculated and assessed. Copying fees shall not be charged for the first 100 pages of copies unless the copies are requested for a commercial use. No copying fee shall be charged for educational, scientific, or news media requests if the agency fails to comply with any time limit in § 2201.6, provided that no unusual or exceptional circumstances (as those terms are defined in §§ 2201.6(b) and 2201.4(d), respectively) apply to the processing of the request.

    (2)  Search fees shall be calculated in accordance with the amounts established in OSHRC's fee schedule. See appendix A to this part. Commercial requesters shall be charged for all search time, except as described below. Search fees shall be charged even if the responsive documents are not located or if they are located but withheld on the basis of an exemption. However, search fees shall be limited or not charged as follows:

    (i)  Search fees shall not be charged for searching for decisions that the requester identifies by name and date, or by docket number, or that are otherwise easily identifiable.

    (ii)  No fee shall be charged if the request is not for a commercial use and is by an educational or scientific institution, whose purpose is scholarly or scientific research, or by a representative of the news media.

    (iii)  No fee shall be charged for the first two hours of searching if the request is not for a commercial use and is not by an educational or scientific institution, or a representative of the news media.

    (iv)  No fee shall be charged to search for records filed in the Commission's systems of records if the requester is the subject of the requested records. See the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a(f)(5) (fees to be charged only for copying).

    (v)  No search fee shall be charged if the Commission fails to comply with any time limit in § 2201.6, provided that no unusual or exceptional circumstances (as those terms are defined in §§ 2201.6(b) and2201.4(d), respectively) apply to the processing of the request.

    (3)  (i) If the Commission has determined that unusual circumstances, as defined in § 2201.6(b), apply and has provided timely written notice to the requester, a failure to comply with the time limit shall be excused for an additional 10 days and the Commission shall assess fees as usual.

    (ii) If the Commission has determined that unusual circumstances, as defined in § 2201.6(b), apply and more than 5,000 pages are necessary to respond to the request, the Commission may charge search fees, or, in the case of requesters described in § 2201.8(b)(2)(ii), may charge duplication fees, if the Commission provided timely written notice of unusual circumstances to the requester in accordance with § 2201.6(b) and the Commission discussed with the requester via written mail, email, or telephone (or made not less than three good-faith attempts to do so) how the requester could effectively limit the scope of the request in accordance with the FOIA. If this exception is satisfied, the Commission may charge all applicable fees incurred in the processing of the request even if such processing extends beyond an additional 10 days.

    (4) If a court has determined that exceptional circumstances exist, as defined in § 2201.4(d), a failure to comply with the time limits shall be excused for the length of time provided by the court order.

    (5)  A review fee shall be charged only for commercial requests. Review fees shall be calculated in accordance with the amounts established in OSHRC's schedule of fees. See appendix A to this part. A review fee shall be charged for the initial examination of documents located in response to a request to determine if it may be withheld from disclosure, and for the excision of withholdable portions. However, a review fee shall not be charged for review by the Chairman under § 2201.10 (Appeal of denials).

    (c)  The FOIA Disclosure Officer shall provide the requester with an invoice containing an itemization of assessed fees.

    (d)  When the FOIA Disclosure Officer reasonably believes that a requester, or a group of requesters acting in concert, is attempting to break a request into a series of requests for the purpose of evading the assessment of fees, the FOIA Disclosure Officer may aggregate any such requests and charge accordingly.

    (e)  If the total fee charges are likely to exceed $25, the FOIA Disclosure Officer shall notify the requester of the estimated amount of the charges, unless the requester has indicated a willingness to pay fees up to the estimated amount. The notification shall offer the requester an opportunity to confer with the FOIA Disclosure Officer to reformulate the request to meet the requester's needs at a lower cost. In cases in which a requester has been notified that actual or estimated fees amount to more than $25, the time period for responding to the request shall be tolled in accordance with § 2201.6(a)(2) and further work shall not be done on it until the requester agrees to pay the actual or estimated total fee. Any such agreement shall be memorialized in writing.

    (f)  Advance payment of fees will generally not be required. If, however, charges are likely to exceed $250, the FOIA Disclosure Officer shall notify the requester of the likely cost and: if the requester has a history of prompt payment of FOIA charges, obtain satisfactory assurance of full payment; or if the requester has no history of payment, require an advance payment of an amount up to the full estimated charge. If the requester has previously failed to pay a fee within 30 days of the date of billing, the FOIA Disclosure Officer shall require the requester to pay the full amount owed plus any interest owed as provided in paragraph (h) of this section or demonstrate that he or she has, in fact, paid the fee, and to make an advance payment of the full amount of the estimated charges before the FOIA Disclosure Officer begins to process the new request or a pending request from that requester.

    (g)  The Commission has discretion regarding its response to requests for services not required by the FOIA. For example, the FOIA does not require agencies to certify or authenticate responsive documents, nor does it require responsive documents to be sent by express mail. If these services are requested, the FOIA Disclosure Officer shall assess the direct costs of such services.

    (h)  The Commission's Office of the Executive Director shall begin assessing interest charges on unpaid bills starting on the thirty-first day after the date the bill was sent. Interest will accrue from the date of billing until the Commission receives full payment. Interest will be at the rate described in 31 U.S.C. 3717.

    (i)  If bills are unpaid 60 days after the mailing of a written notice to the requester, the Commission's Office of the Executive Director may resort to the debt collection procedures set out in the Debt Collection Act of 1982 (Pub. L. 97-365, 96 Stat. 1749), as amended, and its administrative procedures, including the use of consumer reporting agencies, collection agencies, and offset.

    § 2201.9   Waiver of fees.

#### § § 2201.9

    (a)  The FOIA Disclosure Officer shall waive part or all of the fees assessed under § 2201.8(b) if two conditions are satisfied: Disclosure of the information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government; and disclosure is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. Where the FOIA Disclosure Officer has reasonable cause to doubt the use to which a requester will put the records sought, or where that use is not clear from the request itself, the FOIA Disclosure Officer may seek clarification from the requester before assigning the request to a specific category for fee assessment purposes. The FOIA Disclosure Officer shall afford the requester the opportunity to show that the requester comes within these two conditions. The following factors may be considered in determining whether the two conditions are satisfied:

    (1) Whether the subject of the requested records concerns the operations or activities of the government;

    (2) Whether the disclosure is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of government operations or activities;

    (3) Whether the requester has a commercial interest that would be furthered by the requested disclosure; and, if so, whether the magnitude of the identified commercial interest of the requester is sufficiently large, in comparison with the public interest in disclosure, that disclosure is primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.

    (b)  If the two conditions stated in paragraph (a) of this section are met, the FOIA Disclosure Officer will ordinarily waive all fees. In exceptional cases, however, only a partial waiver may be granted if the request for records would impose an exceptional burden or require an exceptional expenditure of Commission resources, and the request for a waiver minimally satisfies the “public interest” requirement in paragraph (a) of this section.

    § 2201.10   Appeal of denials.

#### § § 2201.10

    (a)  A denial of a request for records, either in whole or in part, a request for expedited processing, or a request for fee waivers, may be appealed in writing to the Chairman of the Commission. To be considered timely, the appeal must be postmarked, or in the case of electronic submissions, transmitted, within 90 calendar days of the date of the agency's written notice of denial. The appeal should clearly identify the agency determination that is being appealed and the assigned FOIA tracking number. To facilitate handling, the requester should mark both the appeal and its envelope, or state in the subject line of an electronic transmission, “Freedom of Information Act Appeal.”

    (b)  The Chairman shall act on the appeal under 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(A)(ii) within 20 working days after the receipt of the appeal. An appeal ordinarily will not be adjudicated if the request becomes a matter of FOIA litigation. On receipt of any appeal involving classified information, the Chairman shall take appropriate action to ensure compliance with applicable classification rules.

    (c)  The Chairman shall provide the decision on an appeal in writing. If the Chairman wholly or partially upholds the denial of the request, the decision shall contain a statement that identifies the reasons for the affirmance, including any FOIA exemptions applied. The decision must include notification that the requester may obtain judicial review of the decision under 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(4)(B)-(G). The decision shall also inform the requester of the dispute resolution services offered by OGIS as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation. If the Chairman's decision is remanded or modified on appeal to the court, the requester will be notified by the agency of that determination in writing. The Commission shall then further process the request in accordance with the appeal determination and shall respond directly to the requester.

    (d)  Dispute resolution is a voluntary process. If the Commission agrees to participate in the dispute resolution services provided by OGIS, it will actively engage as a partner in the process in an attempt to resolve the dispute.

    (e)  Before seeking review by a court of the Commission's adverse determination, a requester generally must first submit a timely administrative appeal.

    § 2203.1   Purpose and scope.

#### § § 2203.1

    This part applies to all meetings of the Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission. Its purpose is to implement the Government in the Sunshine Act, 5 U.S.C. 552b. The rules in this part are intended to open to public observation, to the extent practicable, the meetings of the Commission, while preserving the Commission's ability to fulfill its adjudicatory responsibilities and protecting the rights of individuals.

    § 2203.2   Definitions.

#### § § 2203.2

    For the purposes of this part:

    means the simplified procedures described at 5 U.S.C. 552b(d)(4) for announcing and closing certain agency meetings.

    means the _General Counsel_ of the Commission, or any other person designated by the General Counsel to carry out his responsibilities under this part.

    means the deliberations of at least two Commissioners, where such deliberations determine or result in the joint conduct or disposition of “official Commission business.” A conference telephone call among the Commissioners is a  if it otherwise qualifies as a  under this paragraph. The term does not include:

    § 2203.3   Public attendance at Commission meetings.

#### § § 2203.3

    (a)  Commissioners will not jointly conduct or dispose of official Commission business in a meeting unless it is conducted in accordance with this part. Because the Commission was created for the purpose of adjudicating litigated cases, it can be expected that most of its meetings will be closed to the public. However, meetings that do not involve Commission adjudication or discussion of issues in cases before it will be open to the extent practicable. The public will not be allowed to participate in discussions during open meetings.

    (b)  Except where the Commission finds that the public interest requires otherwise, all or part of a meeting may be closed to the public, and information about a meeting may be withheld from the public, where the Commission determines that the meeting, or part of the meeting, or information about the meeting, is likely to:

    (1) Disclose matters that are:

    (i) Specifically authorized under criteria established by an Executive order to be kept secret in the interests of national defense or foreign policy and

    (ii) In fact properly classified pursuant to such Executive order;

    (2) Relate solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of the Commission;

    (3) Disclose matters specifically exempted from disclosure by statute (other than section 552 of title 5), provided that such statute

    (i) Requires that the matter be withheld from the public in such a manner as to leave no discretion on the issue, or

    (ii) Establishes particular criteria for withholding or refers to particular types of matters to be withheld;

    (4) Disclose trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person that are privileged or confidential;

    (5) Involve accusing any person of a crime, or formally censuring any person;

    (6) Disclose information of a personal nature where disclosure would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy;

    (7) Disclose investigatory records compiled for law enforcement purposes, or information which if written would be contained in such records, but only to the extent that the production of such records or information would:

    (i) Interfere with enforcement proceedings,

    (ii) Deprive a person of a right to a fair trial or an impartial adjudication,

    (iii) Constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy,

    (iv) Disclose the identity of a confidential source and, in the case of a record compiled by a criminal law enforcement authority in the course of a criminal investigation, or by an agency conducting a lawful national security intelligence investigation, confidential information furnished only by the confidential source,

    (v) Disclose investigative techniques and procedures, or

    (vi) Endanger the life or physical safety of law enforcement personnel;

    (8) Disclose information contained in or related to examination, operating, or condition reports prepared by, on behalf of, or for the use of an agency responsible for the regulation or supervision of financial institutions;

    (9) Disclose information the premature disclosure of which would:

    (i) Be likely to (A) lead to significant financial speculation in currencies, securities, or commodities, or (B) significantly endanger the stability of any financial institution, or

    (ii) Be likely to significantly frustrate implementation of a proposed Commission action, except where the Commission has already disclosed to the public the content or nature of its proposed action, or where the Commission is required by law to make such disclosure on its own initiative prior to taking final agency action on such proposal; or

    (10) Specifically concern the Commission's issuance of a subpoena or the Commission's participation in a civil action or proceeding, an action in a foreign court or international tribunal, or an arbitration, or the initiation, conduct, discussion or disposition by the Commission of a particular case of formal Commission adjudication.

    (c)  The Commission will hold regularly-scheduled meetings for the purpose of considering matters that may properly be closed to the public under paragraph (b)(4), (8), (9)(i) or (10) of this section, or any combination thereof. Primarily, these meetings will be held for the purpose of considering or disposing of particular cases of formal Commission adjudication. The Commission therefore expects to close all regularly-scheduled meetings. The procedures established in § 2203.4 apply to the public announcement and closing of regularly-scheduled meetings.

    (d)  All other meetings of the Commission will be open to public observation unless the Commission determines that all or part of a meeting is likely to disclose information of the kind set forth in any subparagraph of paragraph (b) of this section. The procedures established in § 2203.5 apply to the public announcement of Commission meetings that are not regularly scheduled and to the total or partial closing of these meetings.

> [50 FR 51679, Dec. 19, 1985, as amended at 62 FR 35963, July 3, 1997; 74 FR 63988, Dec. 7, 2009]

    § 2203.4   Procedures applicable to regularly-scheduled meetings.

#### § § 2203.4

    (a)  The Government in the Sunshine Act provides, at 5 U.S.C. 552b(d)(4), that qualified agencies may establish by regulation expedited procedures for announcing and closing certain meetings. Specifically, “[a]ny agency, a majority of whose meetings may properly be closed to the public pursuant to paragraph (4), (8), (9)(A), or (10) of subsection (c) [of the statute], or any combination thereof, may provide by regulation for the closing of such meetings or portions thereof [through the expedited closing procedure].” See § 2203.3(b)(4), (8), (9)(i) and (10), which are equivalent to the referenced paragraphs of the statute. The Commission had determined, for the reasons stated in paragraph (b) of this section, that it is qualified to adopt implementing regulations under 5 U.S.C. 552b(d)(4). It hereby announces that it will follow the expedited closing procedure authorized under that statutory provision in conducting its regularly-scheduled meetings.

    (b)  The Commission has determined that a majority of its meetings may be closed to the public under 5 U.S.C. 552b(c)(10). _See_ § 2203.3(b)(10). The Commission is an adjudicatory agency that has no regulatory functions. It was established to resolve disputes arising out of enforcement actions brought by the Secretary of Labor under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, 29 U.S.C. 651-678.  29 U.S.C. 659(c). The Commission's experience under the Government in the Sunshine Act has been that almost all of its meetings have been closed, in whole or in part, under 5 U.S.C. 552b(c)(10) because they involved only formal agency adjudication of specific cases.

    (c)  Regularly-scheduled meetings of the Commission will be held at 10:30 a.m. every Thursday, except for legal holidays, in the Hearing Room (Suite 965) of the Commission's national office at One Lafayette Centre, 1120-20th Street NW., Washington, DC 20036-3457. If a regularly-scheduled meeting is scheduled, public announcement of the time, date and place of the meeting will be made at the earliest practicable time by posting a notice in a prominent place at the Commission's national office. If a regularly-scheduled meeting is cancelled, a notice of cancellation will be posted in the same manner. Information about the subject of each regularly-scheduled meeting will be made available in the Office of the General Counsel, telephone number (202) 606-5410, at the earliest practicable time. However, no information that may be withheld under § 2203.3(b) will be made available, and individual items may be added to or deleted from the agenda at any time. Inquiries from the public regarding any regularly-scheduled meeting will be directed to the Office of the General Counsel.

    (d)  At the beginning of each regularly-scheduled meeting, the Commission will vote on whether to close the meeting. No proxy vote will be permitted and the vote of each Commissioner will be recorded. This record of each Commissioner's vote will be made available to the public at the Commission's national office immediately after the meeting.

> [50 FR 51679, Dec. 19, 1985, as amended at 58 FR 26066, Apr. 30, 1993; 73 FR 56492, Sept. 29, 2008]

    § 2203.5   Procedures applicable to other meetings.

#### § § 2203.5

    (a) —(1)  Public announcement will be made of every meeting that is not a regularly-scheduled meeting. This announcement will state the time, place, and subject of the meeting, whether it is to be open or closed, and the name and phone number of the person designated to respond to requests for information about the meeting. The announcement will be made at least one week before the meeting unless at least two Commissioners determine by a recorded vote that Commission business requires that such meeting be called at an earlier date. In that case, the Commission will make its public announcement at the earliest practicable time.

    (2)  The time or place of a meeting may be changed following the public announcement required by paragraph (a)(1) of this section, but only if public announcement of the change is made at the earliest practicable time. The subject of a meeting, or the determination by the Commission to open or close all or part of a meeting, may also be changed following the public announcement required by paragraph (a)(1) of this section; however, these changes may be made only if:

    (i) At least two Commissioners determine by recorded vote that Commission business so requires and that no earlier announcement of the change was possible and

    (ii) Public announcement of the change and the vote of each Commissioner on the change is made at the earliest practicable time.

    (3)  The announcements required under paragraph (a) of this section will be made by posting a notice in a prominent place at the Commission's national office. In addition, immediately following each announcement required by paragraph (a) of this section, notice of the same matters described in the posted notice will also be submitted for publication in the

    (b) —(1)  Action to close all or part of a meeting that is not regularly scheduled or to withhold information about a meeting that is not regularly scheduled, under any paragraph of § 2203.3(b), will be taken only when at least two Commissioners vote to take the proposed action.

    (2)  A separate vote of the Commissioners will be taken with respect to each Commission meeting or each part of a meeting that is proposed to be closed under paragraph (b) of this section or with respect to any information that is proposed to be withheld under paragraph (b) of this section.

    (3)  A single vote may be taken with respect to closing all or part of a series of meetings under paragraph (b) of this section, or with respect to any information concerning a series of meetings, so long as each meeting in the series involves the same particular matters and is scheduled to be held no more than 30 days after the initial meeting in the series.

    (4)  Any person whose interest may be directly affected by a portion of an open meeting may request that the Commission close that portion to the public for any of the reasons referred to in paragraph (b)(5), (6) or (7) of § 2203.3. Upon the motion of any Commissioner, the Commission will vote by recorded vote whether to grant the request.

    (5)  No proxy vote will be permitted for any vote required under paragraph (b) of this section. The vote of each participating Commissioner will be recorded.

    (6)  Within one day after any vote taken under paragraph (b) of this section, the vote of each Commissioner on the question will be made publicly available at the Commission's national office. If any part of a meeting is to be closed under paragraph (b) of this section, a full written explanation of the Commission's action, together with a list of all persons expected to attend the meeting and their affiliation, will be made publicly available at the Commission's national office within one day after the vote to close.

    § 2203.6   Certification by the General Counsel.

#### § § 2203.6

    For every meeting closed under any provision of these rules, the General Counsel will be asked to certify before the meeting that in his opinion the meeting may properly be closed to the public, and to state which exemptions he has relied upon. A copy of this certification, together with a statement (from the Commissioner presiding over the meeting) setting forth the time and place of the meeting and the persons present, shall be retained by the Commission as part of the transcript, recording or minutes of the meeting described in § 2203.7.

    § 2203.7   Transcripts, recordings and minutes of closed meetings.

#### § § 2203.7

    (a)  The Commission will make a complete transcript or electronic recording adequate to record fully the proceedings of each meeting, or portion of a meeting, closed to the public. However, if all or part of a meeting is closed under paragraph (b)(8), (9)(i) or (10) of § 2203.3, the Commission shall maintain either such a transcript or recording, or a set of minutes. Such minutes will fully and clearly describe all matters discussed and will provide a full and accurate summary of any actions taken, and the reasons for the actions. The minutes will also include a description of each of the views expressed on any item and a record of any roll call vote (reflecting the vote of each Commissioner on the question). In addition, the minutes will identify all documents considered in connection with any action.

    (b)  The Commission will make promptly available to the public, at its national office, the transcript, electronic recording, or minutes of the discussion of any item on the agenda, or of any testimony of any witness received at the meeting, except for such item or items of such discussion or testimony as the Commission determines to contain information which may be withheld under § 2203.3(b). Copies of the transcript, the minutes, or a transcription of the recording disclosing the identity of each speaker, with the deletions noted in the preceding sentence, will be furnished to any person at the actual cost of duplication or transcription. Requests to inspect or to have copies made of any transcript, electronic recording or set of minutes of any meeting, or any item(s) on the agenda of any meeting, should be made in writing to the General Counsel at the Office of the General Counsel, Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission, Room 941, One Lafayette Centre, 1120-20th Street NW., Washington, DC 20036-3457. The request should identify the time, date, and place of the meeting and briefly describe the items sought. The Commission will maintain a complete verbatim copy of the transcript, a complete copy of the minutes, or a complete electronic recording of each closed meeting, or closed portion of a meeting, for a period of at least two years after the meeting, or until one year after the conclusion of any Commission proceeding with respect to which all or part of the meeting was held, whichever occurs later.

#### § § 2204.101

      The Equal Access to Justice Act, 5 U.S.C. 504 (called “EAJA” in this part), provides for the award of attorney or agent fees and other expenses to eligible individuals and entities who are parties to certain administrative proceedings (called “adversary adjudications”) before the Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission. An eligible party may receive an award when it prevails over the Secretary of Labor, unless the Secretary's position in the proceeding was substantially justified or special circumstances make an award unjust. Alternatively, an eligible party, even if not a prevailing party, may receive an award under 5 U.S.C. 504(a)(4) when it successfully defends against an excessive demand made by the Secretary.

    Subpart B—Definitions

      § 2204.201   Definitions.

#### § § 2204.201

      For the purposes of this part:

      means a demand by the Secretary, in an adversary adjudication arising from the Secretary's action to enforce a party's compliance with a statutory requirement that is substantially in excess of the decision of the judge or Commission and is unreasonable when compared with such decision, under the facts and circumstances of the case.

      means the date on which a decision or order disposing of the merits of the adversary adjudication or any other complete resolution of the adversary adjudication, such as a settlement or voluntary dismissal, become final and unappealable, both within the agency and to the courts.

      (1) An individual whose net worth did not exceed $2,000,000 at the time the adversary adjudication was initiated; or

      (2) Any owner of an unincorporated business, or any partnership, corporation, association, unit of local government, or organization, the net worth of which did not exceed $7,000,000 at the time the adversary adjudication was initiated, and which had not more than 500 employees at the time the adversary adjudication was initiated; except that an organization described in section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 exempt from taxation under section 501(a) of such Code, or a cooperative association as defined in section 15(a) of the Agricultural Marketing Act, may be a party regardless of the net worth of such organization or cooperative association.

      means the _Secretary_ of Labor.

    Subpart C—EAJA Application

      § 2204.301   Application requirements.

#### § § 2204.301

      (a) A party seeking an award under EAJA shall file an application with the judge that conducted the adversarial adjudication within 30 days after the final disposition of the adversary adjudication.

      (b) The application shall identify the applicant and the proceeding for which an award is sought.

The exhibit may be in any form convenient to the applicant that provides full disclosure of the applicant's assets and liabilities and is sufficient to determine whether the applicant qualifies as a party as defined in § 2204.201. The judge or Commission may require an applicant to file additional information to determine its eligibility for an award.

      (b) Ordinarily, the net worth exhibit will be included in the public record of the proceeding. However, an applicant that objects to public disclosure of information in any portion of the exhibit and believes there are legal grounds for withholding it from disclosure may request that the documents be filed under seal or otherwise be treated as confidential, pursuant to §§ 2200.8 and 2200.52 of this chapter.

> [86 FR 26659, May 17, 2021, as amended at 86 FR 31166, June 11, 2021]

      § 2204.303   Documentation of fees and expenses.

#### § § 2204.303

      The application shall be accompanied by adequate documentation of the fees and other expenses incurred after the initiation of the adversary adjudication, including, but not limited to, the reasonable cost of any study, analysis, engineering report, test, or project.

A separate itemized statement shall be submitted for each professional firm or individual whose services are covered by the application, showing the hours spent in connection with the proceeding by each individual, a description of the specific services performed, the rate at which each fee has been computed, any expenses for which reimbursement is sought, the total amount claimed, and the total amount paid or payable by the applicant or by any other person or entity for the services provided. The judge or Commission may require the applicant to provide vouchers, receipts, or other substantiation for any fees or expenses claimed.

    Subpart D—Procedures for Considering Applications

      § 2204.401   Filing and service of documents.

#### § § 2204.401

      Any application for an award, or any accompanying documentation related to an application shall be filed and served on all parties to the proceeding in accordance with §§ 2200.7 and 2200.8 of this chapter, except as provided in § 2204.302(b) for confidential financial information.

      § 2204.402   Answer to application.

#### § § 2204.402

      (a) Within 30 days after service of an application, the Secretary shall file an answer to the application. Unless the Secretary requests an extension of time for filing or files a statement of intent to negotiate under paragraph (b) of this section, failure to file an answer within the 30-day period may be treated as a consent to the award requested.

      (b) If the Secretary and the applicant believe that the issues in the fee application can be settled, they may jointly file a statement of their intent to negotiate a settlement. The filing of this statement shall extend the time for filing an answer for an additional 30 days, and further extensions may be granted by the judge upon request.

      (c) The answer shall explain in detail any objections to the award requested and identify the facts relied on in support of the Secretary's position. If the answer is based on any alleged facts not already in the record of the proceeding, the Secretary shall include with the answer either supporting affidavits or a request for further proceedings under § 2204.405.

      § 2204.403   Reply.

#### § § 2204.403

      Within 15 days after service of an answer, the applicant may file a reply. If the reply is based on any alleged facts not already in the record of the proceeding, the applicant shall include with the reply either supporting affidavits or a request for further proceedings under § 2204.405.

      § 2204.404   Settlement.

#### § § 2204.404

      The applicant and the Secretary may agree on a proposed settlement of the award before final action on the application, either in connection with a settlement of the underlying adversary adjudication, or after the adversary adjudication has been concluded, in accordance with the Commission's standard settlement procedures as set forth in § 2200.120 of this chapter. If a prevailing party and the Secretary agree on a proposed settlement of an award before an application has been filed, the application shall be filed with the proposed settlement. If a proposed settlement of an underlying proceeding provides that each side shall bear its own expenses and the settlement is accepted, no application may be filed.

      § 2204.405   Further proceedings.

#### § § 2204.405

      (a) Ordinarily, the determination of an award will be made on the basis of the written record. However, on request of either the applicant or the Secretary, or on his or her own initiative, the judge presiding over an EAJA proceeding may, if necessary for a full and fair decision on the application, order the filing of additional written submissions; hold oral argument; or allow for discovery or hold an evidentiary hearing, but only as to issues other than whether the agency's position was substantially justified (such as those involving the applicant's eligibility or substantiation of fees and expenses). Any written submissions shall be made, oral argument held, discovery conducted, and evidentiary hearing held as promptly as possible so as not to delay a decision on the application for fees. Whether or not the position of the Secretary was substantially justified shall be determined on the basis of the administrative record, as a whole, which is made in the adversary adjudication for which fees and other expenses are sought.

      (b) A request for further proceedings under this section shall specifically identify the information sought or the disputed issues and shall explain why the additional proceedings are necessary to resolve the issues.

      § 2204.406   Decision.

#### § § 2204.406

      The preparation and issuance of decision on the fee application shall be in accordance with § 2200.90 of this chapter.

      (a)  The decision shall include written findings and conclusions on the applicant's eligibility and status as a prevailing party and an explanation of the reasons for any difference between the amount requested and the amount awarded. The decision shall also include, if applicable, findings on whether the Secretary's position was substantially justified, whether the applicant unduly protracted the proceedings, or whether special circumstances make an award unjust.

      (b)  The decision shall include written findings and conclusions on the applicant's eligibility and an explanation of the reasons why the agency's demand was or was not determined to be substantially in excess of the underlying decision in the matter and whether the Secretary's demand was or was not unreasonable. That determination shall be based upon all the facts and circumstances of the case.

      (c)  The judge presiding over an EAJA proceeding or the Commission on review may reduce the amount to be awarded, or deny any award, to the extent that the party during the course of the proceedings engaged in conduct which unduly and unreasonably protracted the final resolution of the matter in controversy.

      (1) Awards shall be based on rates customarily charged by persons engaged in the business of acting as attorneys, agents and expert witnesses, even if the services were made available without charge or at a reduced rate to the applicant.

      (2) An award for the fee of an attorney or agent under this paragraph (c) shall not exceed the hourly rate specified in 5 U.S.C. 504(b)(1)(A), except to account for inflation since the last update of the statute's maximum award upon the request of the applicant as documented in the application pursuant to § 2204.303. An award to compensate an expert witness shall not exceed the highest rate at which the Secretary pays expert witnesses. However, an award may include the reasonable expenses of the attorney, agent or witness as a separate item, if the attorney, agent or witness ordinarily charges clients separately for such expenses.

      (3) In determining the reasonableness of the fee sought for an attorney, agent, or expert witness, the following shall be considered:

      (i) If the attorney, agent, or witness is in private practice, his or her customary fee for similar services, or, if an employee of the applicant, the fully allocated cost of the services;

      (ii) The prevailing rate for similar services in the community in which the attorney, agent, or witness ordinarily perform services;

      (iii) The time actually spent in the representation of the applicant;

      (iv) The time reasonably spent in light of the difficulty or complexity of the issues in the proceeding; and

      (v) Such other factors as may bear on the value of the services provided.

      (4) The reasonable cost of any study, analysis, engineering report, test, project, or similar matter prepared on behalf of the party may be awarded, to the extent that the charge for the service does not exceed the prevailing rate for similar services, and the study or other matter was necessary for preparation of the applicant's case.

      § 2204.407   Commission review.

    § 2205.149   Program accessibility: discrimination prohibited.

#### § § 2205.149

    Except as otherwise provided in § 2205.150, no qualified individual with a disability shall, because the agency's facilities are inaccessible to or unusable by individuals with disabilities, be denied the benefits of, be excluded from participation in, or otherwise be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity conducted by the agency.

    § 2205.150   Program accessibility: existing facilities.

#### § § 2205.150

    (a)  The agency shall operate each program or activity so that the program or activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities. This paragraph (a) does not—

    (1) Necessarily require the agency to make each of its existing facilities accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities;

    (2) In the case of historic preservation programs, require the agency to take any action that would result in a substantial impairment of significant historic features of an historic property; or

    (3) Require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with this paragraph (a) would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the Chairman or his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that individuals with disabilities receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.

    (b) —(1)  The agency may comply with the requirements of this section through such means as redesign of equipment, reassignment of services to accessible buildings, assignment of aides to beneficiaries, home visits, delivery of services at alternate accessible sites, alteration of existing facilities and construction of new facilities, use of accessible rolling stock, or any other methods that result in making its programs or activities readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities. The agency is not required to make structural changes in existing facilities where other methods are effective in achieving compliance with this section. The agency, in making alterations to existing buildings, shall meet accessibility requirements to the extent compelled by the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), and any regulations implementing it. In choosing among available methods for meeting the requirements of this section, the agency shall give priority to those methods that offer programs and activities to qualified individuals with disabilities in the most integrated setting appropriate.

    (2)  In meeting the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section in historic preservation programs, the agency shall give priority to methods that provide physical access to individuals with disabilities. In cases where a physical alteration to an historic property is not required because of paragraph (a)(2) or (3) of this section, alternative methods of achieving program accessibility include—

    (i) Using audio-visual materials and devices to depict those portions of an historic property that cannot otherwise be made accessible;

    (ii) Assigning persons to guide individuals with disabilities into or through portions of historic properties that cannot otherwise be made accessible; or

    (iii) Adopting other innovative methods.

    (1) The agency shall furnish appropriate auxiliary aids where necessary to afford an individual with a disability an equal opportunity to participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, a program or activity conducted by the agency.

    (i) In determining what type of auxiliary aid is necessary, the agency shall give primary consideration to the requests of the individual with a disability.

    (ii) The agency need not provide individually prescribed devices, readers for personal use or study, or other devices of a personal nature.

    (2) Where the agency communicates with applicants and beneficiaries by telephone, TDD's or equally effective telecommunication systems shall be used.

    (b) The agency shall ensure that interested persons, including persons with impaired vision or hearing, can obtain information as to the existence and location of accessible services, activities, and facilities.

    (c) The agency shall provide signage at a primary entrance to each of its inaccessible facilities, directing users to a location at which they can obtain information about accessible facilities. The international symbol for accessibility shall be used at each primary entrance of an accessible facility.

    (d) This section does not require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with this section would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the Chairman or his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action required to comply with this section would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that, to the maximum extent possible, individuals with disabilities receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.

    (2) An individual seeking access to a record by mail shall, if possible, provide a signature, address, date of birth, place of birth, and a photocopy of a government-issued identification that includes a photo, such as a passport or a driver's license.

    (3) An individual seeking access to a record either by mail or in person who cannot provide the necessary documentation of identification specified in paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section may provide a declaration in accordance with 28 U.S.C. 1746, swearing or affirming to his or her identity and to the fact that he or she understands the penalties for false statements pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 1001.

    (d)  The parent or guardian of a minor or an individual judicially determined to be incompetent and seeking to act on behalf of such minor or incompetent shall, in addition to establishing his or her own identity, establish the identity of the minor or other individual he or she represents as required in paragraph (c) of this section and establish his or her own parentage or guardianship of the subject of the record by furnishing either a copy of a birth certificate showing parentage or a court order establishing the guardianship.

    (e)  An individual seeking to review a personal record in person may be accompanied by another individual of his or her own choosing.

    (f)  (1) The Privacy Officer shall inform the requester of the determination to grant the request and shall make the personal record available to the individual in the manner requested, that is, either by forwarding a copy of the information to the requester or by making it available for review, unless:

    (i) It is impracticable to provide the requester with a copy, in which case the requester shall be notified of this and informed of the procedures set forth in paragraph (c) of this section, or

    (ii) The Privacy Officer has reason to believe that the cost of a copy is considerably more expensive than anticipated by the requester, in which case the Privacy Officer shall notify the requester of the estimated cost, and ascertain whether the requester still wishes to be provided with a copy of the information.

    (2) Where a personal record is to be reviewed by the requester in person, the Privacy Officer shall inform the requester in writing of:

    (i) The date on which the record shall become available for review, the location at which it may be reviewed, and the hours for inspection;

    (ii) The requirements for verifying identity as set forth in paragraphs (c) and (d);

    (iv) The requester's right to have another individual review the record.

    (3) If the requester seeks to inspect the personal record without receiving a copy, the requester shall not leave OSHRC premises with the record and shall sign a statement identifying the specific record or category of records that has been reviewed.

    (g)  The denial of a written request to review a personal record shall be sent to the requester in writing and signed by the Privacy Officer. This response shall be provided when the requested record does not exist, does not contain personal information relating to the requester, or is exempt. The response shall include a statement regarding the determining factors of denial, and the requester's rights to administrative appeal and, thereafter, judicial review in a district court of the United States.

    § 2400.5   Special procedures for requesting medical records.

#### § § 2400.5

    (a) Upon an individual's request for access to any medical record about the requester, including any psychological record, the Privacy Officer shall make a preliminary determination on whether access to such record(s) could have an adverse effect upon the requester. If the Privacy Officer determines that access could have an adverse effect on the requester, OSHRC shall notify the requester in writing and advise that the record(s) at issue can be made available only to a physician of the requester's designation.

    (b) OSHRC shall forward such record(s) to the physician designated by the requester once the following requirements are met:

    (1) The requester has informed OSHRC of the designated physician's identity;

    (2) OSHRC has verified the identity of the physician; and

    (3) The physician has agreed to review the record(s) with the requester to both explain the meaning of the record(s) and offer counseling designed to temper any adverse reaction.

    (c) If, within 60 calendar days of OSHRC's written request for a designation, the requester has failed to respond or designate a physician, or the physician fails to agree to the release conditions, then OSHRC shall hold the records(s) in abeyance and advise the requester that this action may be construed as a technical denial. OSHRC shall also advise the requester of his or her rights to administrative appeal and, thereafter, judicial review in a district court of the United States.

    § 2400.6   Procedures for amending personal records.

#### § § 2400.6

    (a)  Upon review of an individual's personal record, that individual may submit a request to amend such record. This request shall be submitted in writing to the Privacy Officer, in accordance with § 2400.4(a)(1)'s procedures, and shall include a statement of the amendment requested and the reasons for such amendment, e.g., relevance, accuracy, timeliness or completeness of the record.

    (b)  Upon receiving an amendment request, the Privacy Officer shall promptly:

    (1) Acknowledge in writing within 10 working days the receipt of the request;

    (i) Correcting or eliminating any information that is found to be incomplete, inaccurate, irrelevant to a statutory purpose of OSHRC, or untimely and notifying the requester in writing when this action is complete; or

    (ii) Notifying the requester in writing of a determination not to amend the personal record, including the reasons for the denial, and advising the requester of his or her right to appeal in accordance with § 2400.7.

    § 2400.7   Procedures for appealing.

#### § § 2400.7

    (a)  (1) If a request to provide notification of a personal record, or to access or amend a personal record, is denied either in whole or in part, or if no determination is made within the period prescribed by this part, then the requester may appeal in writing to the Chairman by mailing an appeal letter to the following address: Privacy Appeal, OSHRC, One Lafayette Centre, 1120 20th Street NW, Ninth Floor, Washington, DC 20036-3457.

    (2) To be considered timely, the requester must submit the appeal letter within 30 calendar days of the date of denial, or within 90 calendar days of his or her request if the appeal is from a failure of the Privacy Officer to make a determination. The appeal letter should include, as applicable:

    (i) Reasonable identification of the system to which notification was sought, the personal record to which access was sought, or the amendment that was requested.

    (ii) A statement of the OSHRC action or failure to act being appealed and the relief sought.

    (iii) A copy of the request, the notification of denial, and any other related correspondence.

    (b)  The Chairman must make a final decision no later than 30 working days from the date of the request, but the Chairman may extend this time period for good cause. The requester, however, must be notified of the extension within the initial 30 working-day period, and the extension may not exceed 90 calendar days from the date of the request. Any personal record found on appeal to be incomplete, inaccurate, irrelevant, or untimely, shall within 30 working days of the date of such findings be appropriately amended.

    (c)  The decision of the Chairman constitutes the final decision of OSHRC on the right of the requester to be notified of, or to access or amend, a personal record. The decision on the appeal shall be in writing and, in the event of a denial, shall set forth the reasons for such denial and state the individual's right to obtain judicial review in a district court of the United States. An indexed file of the agency's decisions on appeal shall be maintained by the Privacy Officer.

    § 2400.8   Procedures for statements of disagreement and notification of amendment.

#### § § 2400.8

    (a)  If a final decision concerning an amendment request does not satisfy the requester, then the requester may provide a statement of disagreement that is of reasonable length and sets forth a position regarding the disputed information. This statement of disagreement shall be accepted by OSHRC and included in the relevant personal record. If deemed appropriate, OSHRC may also include a concise statement in the record of its reasons for not making a requested amendment.

    (b)  (1) OSHRC shall inform any person or other agency about an amendment to a personal record, or notation made to the record under paragraph (a) of this section, if that record has been disclosed to the person or agency, the amendment or notation was made pursuant to this part, and an accounting of the disclosure was made pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(c).

    (2) When a personal record is disclosed to a person or other agency after a notation under paragraph (a) of this section is made to the record, OSHRC shall clearly note any portion of the record that is disputed and provide a copy of any notation included in the record.

    § 2400.9   Schedule of fees.

#### § § 2400.9

    (a)  The purpose of this section is to establish fair and equitable fees to permit reproduction of personal records for concerned individuals.

    (b)  (1) For the fees associated with reproduction of personal records, refer to appendix A to part 2201, Schedule of Fees.

    (2) OSHRC shall not normally furnish more than one copy of any record.
