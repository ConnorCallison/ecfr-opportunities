  PART 141—ENTRY OF MERCHANDISE

### Part 141

**Authority:** Authority: 19 U.S.C. 66, 1448, 1484, 1498, 1624.

**Source:** Source: T.D. 73-175, 38 FR 17447, July 2, 1973, unless otherwise noted.

    Subpart A—Liability for Duties and Requirement To Enter Merchandise

      § 141.1   Liability of importer for duties.

#### § § 141.1

      (a)  Duties and the liability for their payment accrue upon imported merchandise on arrival of the importing vessel within a Customs port with the intent then and there to unlade, or at the time of arrival within the Customs territory of the United States if the merchandise arrives otherwise than by vessel, unless otherwise specially provided for by law.

      (b) —(1)  The liability for duties, both regular and additional, attaching on importation, constitutes a personal debt due from the importer to the United States which can be discharged only by payment in full of all duties legally accruing, unless relieved by law or regulation. Payment to a broker covering duties does not relieve the importer of liability if the duties are not paid by the broker. The liability may be enforced notwithstanding the fact that an erroneous construction of law or regulation may have enabled the importer to pass his goods through the customhouse without payment. Delivery of a Customs bond with an entry is solely to protect the revenue of the United States and does not relieve the importer of liabilities incurred from the importation of merchandise into the United States.

      (2)  An importer or his agent may pay Customs by using any of the applicable means provided in § 24.1(a).

      (3)  An importer may pay duties either:

      (i) Directly to Customs whether or not a licensed customhouse broker is used; or

      (ii) Through a licensed customhouse broker. When an importer uses a broker and elects to pay by check or bank draft, the importer may issue the broker either:

      (A) One check or bank draft payable to the broker covering both duties and the broker's fees and charges, in which case the broker shall pay the duties to Customs on behalf of the importer, or

      (B) Separate checks or bank drafts, one covering duties payable to the “U.S. Customs Service,” for transmittal by the broker to Customs, and the other covering the broker's fees and charges. The importer's check or bank draft for duties shall be delivered to Customs by the broker.

      (c)  The claim of the Government for unpaid duties against the estate of a deceased or insolvent importer has priority over obligations to creditors other than the United States. To the extent that a broker or a surety pays duties on behalf of an importer which files for bankruptcy protection, the broker or surety shall be entitled to assume the priority status of Customs under section 507(a)(7) of the Bankruptcy Code for that portion of Customs claim which the surety or broker has paid.

      (d)  The liability for duties also constitutes a lien upon the merchandise imported which may be enforced while such merchandise is in the custody or subject to the control of the United States.

      (e)  Neither the States nor their instrumentalities are entitled to any constitutional exemption from the payment of Customs duties.

      (f)  There shall be no liability for the payment of duties on the part of anyone to whom merchandise is consigned without his authority, if he refuses it. Such merchandise shall be treated as unclaimed (see part 27 of this chapter).

      § 141.2   Liability for duties on reimportation.

#### § § 141.2

      Dutiable merchandise imported and afterwards exported, even though duty thereon may have been paid on the first importation, is liable to duty on every subsequent importation into the Customs territory of the United States, but this does not apply to the following:

      (a) Personal and household effects taken abroad by a resident of the United States and brought back on his return to this country (see § 148.31 of this chapter);

      (b) Professional books, implements, instruments, and tools of trade, occupation, or employment taken abroad by an individual and brought back on his return to this country (see § 148.53 of this chapter);

      (c) Automobiles and other vehicles taken abroad for noncommercial use (see § 148.32 of this chapter);

      (d) Metal boxes, casks, barrels, carboys, bags, quicksilver flasks or bottles, metal drums, or other substantial outer containers exported from the United States empty and returned as usual containers or coverings of merchandise, or exported filled with products of the United States and returned empty or as the usual containers or coverings of merchandise (see § 10.7(b), (c), (d), and (e) of this chapter);

      (e) Articles exported from the United States for repairs or alterations, which may be returned upon the payment of duty on the value of repairs or alterations at the rate or rates which would otherwise apply to the articles in their repaired or altered conditions (see § 10.8 of this chapter);

      (f) Articles exported for exhibition under certain conditions (see §§ 10.66 and 10.67 of this chapter);

      (g) Domestic animals taken abroad for temporary pasturage purposes and returned within 8 months (see § 10.74 of this chapter);

      (h) Articles exported under lease to a foreign manufacturer (see § 10.108 of this chapter); or

      (i) Any other reimported articles for which free entry is specifically provided.

      § 141.3   Liability for duties includes liability for taxes.

#### § § 141.3

      The importer's liability for duties includes a liability for any internal revenue taxes which attach upon the importation of merchandise, unless otherwise provided by law or regulation.

      § 141.4   Entry required.

#### § § 141.4

      (e)  Merchandise qualifying for informal entry by regulation, pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 1498, is exempt from formal entry under 19 U.S.C. 1484 and this part, but must be entered as required under applicable regulations (see part 143, subpart C, and §§ 10.151 through 10.153, 128.24, 145.31, 145.32, 148.12, 148.13, 148.51, and 148.62 of this chapter).

    Subpart B—Right To Make Entry and Declarations on Entry

      § 141.11   Evidence of right to make entry for importations by common carrier.

#### § § 141.11

      (a)  Except where merchandise is released directly to the carrier in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, one of the following types of evidence of the right to make entry shall be filed in connection with the entry of merchandise imported by common carrier:

      (1) A bill of lading or air waybill, presented by the holder thereof, properly endorsed when endorsement is required under the law. A nonnegotiable bill of lading, or air waybill, may not be endorsed by the named consignee to give someone else the right to make entry. If the person making entry intends to use the original bill of lading or air waybill to obtain a duplicate bill of lading, duplicate air waybill, or carrier's certificate from the carrier, the exchange shall be made before the entry is filed, and the duplicate bill of lading, duplicate air waybill, or carrier's certificate shall be used to make entry in accordance with paragraph (a) (3) or (4) of this section. For purposes of this part, the rights of the consignor relating to an air waybill as prescribed by the Warsaw Convention (49 Stat. 3017) shall be protected.

      (2) An extract from a bill of lading or air waybill certified to be genuine by the carrier bringing the merchandise to the port of entry. Customs officers shall not certify extracts from bills of lading or air waybills.

      (3) A certified duplicate bill of lading or air waybill, with the carrier's certificate being in substantially the following form:

      (4) A carrier's certificate, which may be executed on the official entry form, or, in appropriate cases, by means of a rubber-stamped or typewritten combined carrier's certificate and release order with one signature on a copy of the bill of lading, airway bill, shipping receipt, or other comparable document. The rubber-stamped or typewritten certificate shall be in substantially the following form, which may be varied to include any of the qualifications on release shown in § 141.111(d):

      (5) A blanket carrier's release order on an appropriately modified bill of lading or air waybill covering any or all shipments which will arrive at the port on the carrier's conveyance during the period specified in the release order.

      (6) A shipping receipt or other document presented in lieu of a bill of lading or air waybill shall be accepted as authority for making entry only if it bears a carrier's certificate in accordance with paragraph (a)(4) of this section, or if entry is made by the actual consignee in person or in his name by a duly authorized agent.

      (b)  Where, in accordance with subsection (j) of section 484, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1484), merchandise is released from Customs custody (either under immediate delivery procedures in accordance with the provisions of subpart C of part 142 of this chapter, or after an entry has been filed in accordance with subpart A of part 142 of this chapter, or after an entry summary, which shall serve as both the entry and entry summary has been filed with estimated duties attached where appropriate in accordance with subpart B of part 142 of this chapter), to the carrier by whom the merchandise was brought to the port, the delivery of the merchandise by the carrier to the person filing the entry summary with estimated duties attached shall be deemed to be the certification required by subsection (h), section 484, Tariff Act of 1930. Customs responsibility under this optional entry procedure is limited to the collection of duties, and constitutes no representation whatsoever regarding the right of any person to obtain possession of the merchandise from the carrier. Consequently, no Customs official shall be liable to any person in respect to the delivery of merchandise released from Customs custody in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph.

      § 141.12   Right to make entry of importations by other than common carrier.

#### § § 141.12

      When merchandise is not imported by a common carrier, possession of the merchandise at the time of arrival in the United States shall be deemed sufficient evidence of the right to make entry.

      § 141.13   Right to make entry of abandoned or salvaged merchandise.

#### § § 141.13

      Underwriters of abandoned merchandise or salvors of merchandise saved from a wreck who are unable to produce a bill of lading, air waybill, certified duplicate bill of lading or air waybill, or carrier's certificate, shall produce evidence satisfactory to the port director of their right to act.

      § 141.14   Deceased or insolvent consignees and court-appointed administrators.

#### § § 141.14

      The executor or administrator of the estate of a deceased consignee, the receiver or other legal representative of an insolvent consignee, or the representative appointed in any action or proceeding at law to act for a consignee shall not be permitted to make entry unless he produces a duly endorsed bill of lading or air waybill, a carrier's certificate, or a duplicate bill of lading or air waybill, executed in accordance with subsections (h) or (i) of section 484, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1484), showing him to be the consignee for Customs purposes.

      § 141.15   Bond for production of bill of lading or air waybill.

#### § § 141.15

      (a)  If the person desiring to make entry is unable to present a bill of lading, air waybill, or other evidence of right to make entry in accordance with § 141.11, the port director may accept a bond for the production of a bill of lading or air waybill under the provisions of section 484(c), Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1484(c)). The bond shall be for the production of a bill of lading or air waybill, unless the person making entry intends to produce a carrier's certificate or certified duplicate bill of lading or air waybill. In that case, no bond is required because section 484(c) does not apply to entries made on a carrier's certificate or certified duplicate bill of lading or air waybill. If the port director is in doubt as to the propriety of accepting entry on a bond for the production of a bill of lading or air waybill, he shall request authority to do so from the Commissioner of Customs.

      (b)  The bond shall be on Customs Form 301 and contain the bond conditions set forth in § 113.69 of this chapter.

      (c)  A bond given for the production of a bill of lading or air waybill shall be considered as canceled upon production of a bill of lading or air waybill, and may be considered as satisfied but shall not be canceled upon the production of a carrier's certificate or certified duplicate bill of lading or air waybill.

      § 141.16   Disposition of documents.

#### § § 141.16

      (a)  When the return of the bill of lading or air waybill to the person making entry is requested in accordance with section 484(j), Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1484(j)), the port director shall obtain a receipt showing sufficient data from the bill of lading or air waybill to completely identify it and enable the auditor to verify the production of proper evidence of the right to make entry. The receipt shall also show any freight charges and weights that appear on the bill of lading or air waybill. The port director shall then return the bill of lading or air waybill to the person making entry with a notation thereon to the effect that entry has been made for the merchandise.

      (b)  When any of the other documents specified in § 141.11(a) (2) through (6) is used in making entry, it shall be retained by the port director as evidence that the person making entry is authorized to do so.

> [T.D. 73-175, 38 FR 17447, July 2, 1973, as amended by T.D. 78-394, 43 FR 49788, Oct. 25, 1978]

      § 141.17   Entry by nonresident consignee.

#### § § 141.17

      A nonresident consignee has the right to make entry, but any bond taken in connection with the entry shall have a resident corporate surety or, when a carnet issued under part 114 of this chapter is used as an entry form, an approved resident guaranteeing association.

      § 141.18   Entry by nonresident corporation.

#### § § 141.18

      A nonresident corporation (, one which is not incorporated within the customs territory of the United States or in the Virgin Islands of the United States) may not enter merchandise for consumption unless it:

      (a) Has a resident agent in the State where the port of entry is located who is authorized to accept service of process against that corporation or, in the case of an entry filed from a remote location pursuant to subpart E of part 143 of this chapter, has a resident agent authorized to accept service of process against that corporation either in the State where the port of entry is located or in the State from which the remote location filing originates; and

      (b) Files a bond on CBP Form 301, containing the bond conditions set forth in § 113.62 of this chapter having a resident corporate surety to secure the payment of any increased and additional duties which may be found due.

> [T.D. 73-175, 38 FR 17447, July 2, 1973, as amended by T.D. 84-213, 49 FR 41184, Oct. 19, 1984; CBP Dec. 09-47, 74 FR 69018, Dec. 30, 2009]

      § 141.19   Declaration of entry.

#### § § 141.19

      (a)  The consignee in whose name an entry is made under the provisions of section 484, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1484), shall execute the declaration specified in section 485(a), Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1485(a)) on:

      (1) The entry summary for merchandise entered for consumption, for warehouse, or for temporary importation under bond, or

      (2) The rewarehouse or the bonded manufacturing warehouse entry.

      (b) —(1)  When entry is made in a consignee's name by an agent who has knowledge of the facts and who is authorized under a proper power of attorney by that consignee to make declarations in accordance with section 485(f), Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1485(f)), a declaration on the entry or entry summary executed by that agent is sufficient and no bond to produce a declaration of the consignee is required.

      (2)  When entry is made in a consignee's name by an agent who does not meet the qualifications in paragraph (b)(1) of this section either:

      (i) A declaration of the consignee on Customs Form 3347-A shall be filed with the entry documentation or entry summary or

      (ii) A charge for the production of the declaration shall be made against the bond on Customs Form 301, containing the bond conditions set forth in § 113.62 of this chapter. No separate bond of the agent shall be required, since a charge against the bond on Customs Form 301, containing the bond conditions set forth in § 113.62 of this chapter satisfies the requirements of section 485(c), Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1485(c)).

      (3)  A nominal consignee who makes entry in his own name is not considered an agent within the purview of section 485(c), Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1485(c)), and he shall execute a declaration in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section.

      (c)  In the case of successive importations of books, magazines, newspapers, and periodicals within the scope of section 485(b), Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1485(b)), one declaration filed at the time of arrival of the first importation will be sufficient.

      § 141.20   Actual owner's declaration and superseding bond of actual owner.

#### § § 141.20

      (a) —(1)  A consignee in whose name an entry summary for consumption, warehouse, or temporary importation under bond is filed, or in whose name a rewarehouse entry or a manufacturing warehouse entry is made, and who desires, under the provisions of section 485(d), Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1485(d)), to be relieved from statutory liability for the payment of increased and additional duties shall declare at the time of the filing of the entry summary or entry documentation, as provided in § 141.19(a), that he is not the actual owner of the merchandise, furnish the name and address of the owner, and file with CBP, either at the port of entry or electronically within 90 days from the time of entry (see § 141.68) a declaration of the actual owner of the merchandise acknowledging that the actual owner will pay all additional and increased duties. The declaration of owner shall be filed on Customs Form 3347.

      (2)  If the consignee desires to be relieved from contractual liability for the payment of increased and additional duties voluntarily assumed by him under the single-entry bond which he filed in connection with the entry documentation and/or entry summary, or under his continuous bond against which the entry and/or entry summary is charged, he shall file a bond of the actual owner on Customs Form 301, containing the bond conditions set forth in § 113.62 of this chapter, with CBP, either at the port of entry or electronically within 90 days from the time of entry.

      (b)  Neither the declaration of the actual owner nor the bond of the actual owner shall be accepted unless executed by the actual owner or his duly authorized agent, and filed by the nominal consignee or his duly authorized agent.

      (c)  If the actual owner is a nonresident, the actual owner's declaration shall not be accepted as compliance with section 485(d), Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1485(d)), unless there is filed therewith the owner's bond on Customs Form 301, containing the bond conditions set forth in § 113.62 of this chapter, with a resident corporate surety.

      (d)  Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent the nominal consignee from filing the actual owner's declaration without the superseding bond for purposes other than relief from statutory liability for the payment of increased and additional duties under the provisions of section 485(d), Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1485(d)).

      § 141.57   Single entry for split shipments.

#### § § 141.57

      (a)  At the election of the importer of record, Customs may process a split shipment, pursuant to section 484(j)(2), Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1484(j)(2)), under a single entry, as prescribed under the procedures set forth in this section.

      (b)  A “split shipment”, for purposes of this section, means a shipment:

      (1) Which may be accommodated on a single conveyance, and which is delivered to and accepted by a carrier in the exporting country under one bill of lading or waybill, and is thus intended by the importer of record to arrive in the United States as a single shipment;

      (2) Which is thereafter divided by the carrier, acting on its own, into different portions which are transported and consigned to the same party in the United States; and

      (3) Of which the first portion and all succeeding portions arrive at the same port of entry in the United States, as listed in the original bill of lading or waybill; and all the succeeding portions arrive at the port of entry within 10 calendar days of the date of the first portion. If any portion of the shipment arrives at a different port, such portion must be transported in-bond to the port of destination where entry of the shipment is made.

      (c)  The importer of record must notify Customs, in writing, that the shipment has been split at the carrier's initiative, that the remainder of the shipment will arrive by subsequent conveyance(s), and that an election is being made to file a single entry for all portions. The required notification must be given as soon as the importer of record becomes aware that the shipment has been split, but in all cases notification must be made before the entry summary is filed.

      (d)  In order to make a single entry for a split shipment or obtain a special permit for the release of a split shipment under immediate delivery, an importer of record may follow the procedure prescribed in paragraph (d)(1) or (d)(2) of this section, as applicable.

      (1)  An importer of record may file an entry at such time as all portions of the split shipment have arrived at the port of entry (see paragraph (b)(3) of this section). In the alternative, again after the arrival of all portions of a split shipment at the port of entry, the importer of record may instead file a special permit for immediate delivery provided that the merchandise is eligible for such a permit under § 142.21(a)-(f) and (h) of this chapter. In either case, the importer of record must file Customs Form (CF) 3461 or CF 3461 alternate (CF 3461 ALT) as appropriate, or electronic equivalent, with Customs. The entry or special permit must indicate the total number of pieces in, as well as the total value of, the entire shipment as reflected on the invoice(s) covering the shipment.

      (2)  As provided in § 142.21(g) of this chapter, an importer of record may also file a special permit for immediate delivery after the arrival of the first portion of a split shipment at the port of entry (see paragraph (b)(3) of this section), but before the arrival of the entire shipment at such port, thus qualifying the split shipment for incremental release, under paragraph (e) of this section, as each portion of the shipment arrives at the port of entry (see paragraph (g)(2)(ii) of this section). In such case, a CF 3461 or CF 3461 ALT as appropriate, or electronic equivalent, must be filed with Customs. As each portion arrives at the port of entry, the importer of record must submit a copy of the CF 3461/CF 3461 ALT, or its electronic equivalent, adjusted to reflect the quantity of that particular portion relative to the quantity contained in the entire split shipment (see paragraph (b)(1) of this section); however, if both the carrier and the importer of record are automated, such adjustments may instead be made electronically to the CBP Automated Commercial Environment (ACE) or any other CBP-authorized electronic data interchange system. In the event that an entry has been pre-filed with Customs (see § 142.2(b) of this chapter), notification to Customs by the importer of record that a single entry will be filed for shipments released incrementally will serve as a request that the pre-filed entry be converted to an application for a special permit for immediate delivery (see § 142.21(g) of this chapter). The special permit must indicate the total number of pieces in, as well as the total value of, the entire shipment as reflected on the invoice(s) covering the shipment. Customs may limit the release of each portion of the split shipment upon arrival at the port of entry, as permitted under this paragraph, due to the need to examine the merchandise in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section.

      (e)  To secure the separate release upon arrival of each portion of a split shipment at the port of destination under paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the carrier responsible for initially splitting the shipment must present to Customs, either on a paper manifest or through an authorized electronic data interchange system, manifest information relating to the shipment that reflects exact information for each portion of the split shipment. The carrier responsible for splitting the shipment must notify other obligated entities (such as another carrier or freight forwarder) that have submitted electronic manifest information to Customs about the shipment that was split so that these parties can update their manifest information to Customs.

      (f)  Customs may require examination of any or all parts of the split shipment. For split shipments subject to the immediate delivery procedure of paragraph (d)(2) of this section, Customs reserves the right to deny incremental release should such an examination of the merchandise be necessary. The denial of incremental release does not preclude the use of the procedures specified in paragraph (d)(1) of this section.

      (g) —(1)  For merchandise entered under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the importer of record must file an entry summary within 10 working days from the time of entry.

      (2) —(i)  For merchandise released under a special permit for immediate delivery pursuant to paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the importer of record must file the entry summary, which serves as both the entry and the entry summary, within 10 working days after the merchandise or any part of the merchandise is authorized for release under the special permit or, for quota class merchandise, within the quota period, whichever expires first (see § 142.23 of this chapter).

      (ii)  For merchandise released under a special permit for immediate delivery pursuant to paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the importer of record must file the entry summary, which serves as both the entry and the entry summary, within 10 working days from the date of the first release of a portion of the split shipment. The filed entry summary must reflect all portions of the split shipment which have been released, to include quantity, value, correct classification and rate of duty. The entry summary cannot include any portions of the split shipment which have not been released.

      (3)  With the entry summary filed under paragraphs (g)(1) and (g)(2)(i) and (g)(2)(ii) of this section, the importer of record must attach estimated duties, taxes and fees applicable to the released merchandise. If the entry summary is filed electronically, the estimated duties, taxes and fees must be scheduled for payment at such time pursuant to the Automated Clearinghouse (see § 24.25 of this chapter).

      (h)  For purposes of section 484(j)(2), Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1484(j)(2)), the merchandise comprising the separate portions of a split shipment included on one entry will be classified as though imported together.

      (i) —(1)  The importer of record must enter separately those portions of a split shipment that do not arrive at the port of entry within 10 calendar days of the portion that arrived there first (see paragraph (b)(3) of this section).

      (2)  An importer of record will be required to file a separate entry for any portion of a split shipment if necessary to preclude the application of different rates of duty on a split shipment entry for merchandise that is classifiable under the same subheading of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS).

      (j) —(1)  The importer of record will be responsible for reviewing the total manifested quantity shown on the CF 3461/CF 3461 ALT, or electronic equivalent, in relation to all portions of the split shipment that arrived at the port of entry under paragraph (b)(3) of this section within the specified 10 calendar day period. At the conclusion of the specified 10 calendar day period, the importer of record must make any adjustments necessary to reflect the actual amount, value, correct classification and rate of duty of the merchandise that was released incrementally under the split shipment procedures. If all portions of the split shipment do not arrive within the required 10 calendar day period, the importer of record must file an additional entry or entries as appropriate to cover any remaining portions of the split shipment that subsequently arrive (see paragraph (i)(1) of this section).

      (2)  The importer of record must maintain sufficient documentary evidence to substantiate that the splitting of the shipment was done by the carrier acting on its own, and not at the request of the foreign shipper and/or the importer of record. This documentation should include a copy of the originating bill of lading or waybill under which the shipment was delivered to the carrier in the country of exportation or other supporting documentary evidence, such as a letter from the carrier confirming that the splitting of the shipment was done by the carrier on its own initiative. This documentary evidence as well as all other necessary records received or generated by or on behalf of the importer of record under this section must be maintained and produced, if requested, in accordance with part 163 of this chapter.

      (k) —(1)  Merchandise subject to quota and/or visa requirements is excluded from incremental release under the immediate delivery procedure set forth in paragraph (d)(2) of this section and § 142.21(g) of this chapter. Additionally, if by splitting a shipment any portion of it is subject to quota, no portion of the split shipment may be released incrementally.

      (2)  In addition, the port director may deny the use of the incremental release procedure set forth in paragraph (d)(2) of this section and § 142.21(g) of this chapter, as circumstances warrant.

      (3)  For merchandise described in paragraphs (k)(1) and (k)(2) of this section, that is excluded from the immediate delivery procedure of paragraph (d)(2) of this section and § 142.21(g) of this chapter, the importer of record may still file a single entry or special permit for immediate delivery under paragraph (d)(1) of this section covering the entire split shipment of such merchandise following, and to the extent of, its arrival within the required 10 calendar day period.

      § 141.58   Single entry for separately arriving portions of unassembled or disassembled entities.

#### § § 141.58

      (a)  At the election of the importer of record, an unassembled or disassembled entity arriving on multiple conveyances as contemplated under section 484(j)(1), Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1484(j)(1)), may be processed as a single entry, as prescribed under the procedures set forth in this section.

      (b)  An unassembled or disassembled entity for purposes of this section is an entity which:

      (1) Cannot, due to its size or nature, be shipped on a single conveyance, and is thus imported in an unassembled or disassembled condition;

      (2) Is ordered, invoiced and is classifiable under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS), as a single entity and is consigned to one person in the United States;

      (3) Is imported on more than one conveyance to the same port of entry in the United States; and

      (4) Involves the first portion and all succeeding portions arriving at the same United States port of entry within either:

      (i) 15 calendar days after the unlading of the first portion or arrival at the destination port if transported in bond for entities entered under the “hold all” method permitted in paragraph (d)(1) of this section; or

      (ii) 10 calendar days after the release of the first portion under special permit procedures for entities released incrementally as permitted in paragraph (d)(2) of this section.

      (c)  The importer of record must apply to file a single entry covering an entity described in paragraph (b) of this section. Applications may be made either by appropriately annotating a Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Form 3461, CBP Form 3461 ALT, or electronic equivalent, or by submitting a letter to CBP. The required application must be made no later than 5 working days in advance of the arrival of the first conveyance. Justification for the need for more than one conveyance must be provided in the application, which must include an affirmative statement that the entity cannot, due to its size or nature, be shipped on one conveyance. A copy of the relevant invoice or purchase order, or electronic equivalent, must accompany the application, along with the proposed appropriate single tariff number under the HTSUS. The port director will notify the applicant of the approval or denial of the application within 3 working days of the receipt of the application.

      (d)  In order to make a single entry for portions of an entity covered under this section that arrive at different times, an importer of record must follow the procedure prescribed in paragraphs (d)(1) or (d)(2) of this section, as applicable.

      (1)  An importer may file an entry at such time as all portions of the entity have arrived at the same port of entry in the United States. Any portion that arrives at a different port must be transported in-bond to the destination port where entry will be made. In the alternative, the importer may file a special permit for immediate delivery after arrival of all portions of the entity provided that it is eligible for such a permit under § 142.21(a)-(d), (f) and (i) of this chapter.

      (2)  As provided in § 142.21(h) of this chapter, an importer of record may file an application for a special permit for immediate delivery after the arrival of the first portion of the entity covered by paragraph (b) of this section, and its remaining portions may be released incrementally pursuant to the requirements set forth in paragraph (e) of this section. All portions of the shipment must timely arrive at the same port of entry in the United States. Any portion that arrives at a different port must be transported in-bond to the destination port where entry will be made.

      (e)  If an importer wishes to secure release of an entity under paragraph (d)(1) of this section after the entity's arrival, the importer must file with CBP a CBP Form 3461 or CBP Form 3461 ALT, as appropriate, or electronic equivalent. To secure the separate release upon arrival of each portion of a shipment under paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the importer must file with CBP a CBP Form 3461 or CBP Form 3461 ALT, as appropriate, or electronic equivalent after arrival of the first portion. As each successive portion arrives, the importer must submit a copy of the originally submitted CBP Form 3461/CBP Form 3461 ALT, annotated to specifically identify that particular portion. The CBP Form 3461/CBP Form 3461 ALT must indicate the order of the arriving portion in relation to the entire shipment as reflected on the invoice (for example, third of six portions). If both the carrier and the importer are automated, such adjustments may be made electronically through the CBP Automated Commercial System (ACS). The release of each portion upon arrival as permitted under this paragraph may be restricted due to CBP's need to examine the merchandise in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section. In addition, the importer of record must present to CBP either on paper or through an authorized electronic equivalent, specific and detailed information supplementing the CBP Form 3461 or 3461 ALT, relating to the merchandise on each conveyance which reflects exact information for that portion of the ordered entity (for example, detailed packing lists).

      (f)  CBP may require examination of any or all portions of the entity. CBP reserves the right to deny the release of each portion of such shipments as they arrive (, incremental release) should such an examination of the merchandise be necessary. The denial of incremental release does not preclude the use of the procedures specified in paragraph (d)(1) of this section.

      (g)  (1) For merchandise entered under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, an entry summary must be filed within 10 working days from the time of entry. For merchandise released under a special permit for immediate delivery, the entry summary, which serves as both the entry and entry summary, must be filed within 10 working days after the first portion of the entity is authorized for release under the special permit.

      (2) For merchandise released under a special permit for immediate delivery pursuant to paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the entry summary, which serves as both the entry and the entry summary, must be filed within 10 working days from the date of the first release of a portion of the unassembled or disassembled entity. However, the entry/entry summary for the entity cannot be filed before the last portion of the entity which is to be included on the entry has arrived.

      (3)  At the time the entry summary is filed under paragraphs (g)(1) and (g)(2) of this section, estimated duties, taxes and fees must be attached. If the entry summary is filed electronically, the estimated duties, taxes and fees must be scheduled for payment at such time pursuant to the Automated Clearinghouse procedures ( 19 CFR 24.25).

      (h)  Except as provided in paragraph (j) of this section, for purposes of section 484(j)(1), Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1484(j)(1)), the merchandise comprising the separate portions of an entity covered by paragraph (b) of this section included on one entry will be classified as though imported together. Any spare parts accompanying a portion of an entity must be classified and entered separately.

      (i)  When all portions of an entity do not arrive at the port of entry within the time constraints of paragraphs (b)(4)(i) and (ii) of this section, as applicable, a separate entry and entry summary must be filed for each portion that has already arrived, and for each portion that subsequently will arrive on separate conveyances. The merchandise included on each separate entry shall be classified in its condition as imported. Each entry would reflect the quantities, values, classifications and rates of duty, as appropriate, of the various components conveyed in each shipment, and not the value or classification of the ordered single entity.

      (j)  Merchandise subject to quota and/or visa requirements is entirely excluded from the procedures set forth in this section. Also, CBP reserves the right for the port director to deny use of the incremental release procedure and only release the shipment in its entirety as circumstances warrant, such as in the case where a particular shipment has been selected for examination.

    Subpart E—Presentation of Entry Papers

      § 141.61   Completion of entry and entry summary documentation.

#### § § 141.61

      (a) —(1)  Except when entry and entry summary documentation is filed with CBP electronically pursuant to the provisions of part 143 of this chapter:

      (i) Such documentation must be prepared on a typewriter (keyboard), or with ink, indelible pencil, or other permanent medium, and all copies must be legible;

      (ii) The entry summary must be signed by the importer ( § 101.1 of this chapter); and

      (iii) Entries, entry summaries, and accompanying documentation must be on the appropriate forms specified by the regulations and must clearly set forth all required information.

      (2)  Entry and entry summary documentation that is filed electronically pursuant to part 143 of this chapter must contain the information required by this section and must be certified ( §§ 143.35 and 143.44 of this chapter) by the importer of record or his duly authorized customs broker as being true and correct to the best of his knowledge. The importer of record, customs broker, or a duly authorized agent must be resident in the United States for purposes of receiving service of process. A certified electronic transmission is binding in the same manner and to the same extent as a signed document.

      (b)  An importer may omit from entry summary (CBP Form 7501, or its electronic equivalent) the marks and numbers previously provided for packages released or withdrawn.

      (c)  The entry summary filed for merchandise subject to an antidumping or countervailing duty order must include the unique identifying number assigned by the Department of Commerce, International Trade Administration. Any entry summary filed for merchandise subject to an antidumping or countervailing duty order not containing the identifying number will be rejected.

      (d)  The importer number must be reported on CBP Form 7501, or its electronic equivalent, as follows:

      (1)  Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the importer number of the importer of record and the consignee number of the ultimate consignee must be reported for each entry summary and for each drawback entry. When the importer of record and the ultimate consignee are the same, the importer number may be entered in both spaces provided on CBP Form 7501 (boxes 10 and 12), or its electronic equivalent, or the importer number may be entered in the space provided for the importer (box 12, or its electronic equivalent) and the word “SAME” may be entered in the space provided for the ultimate consignee (box 10, or its electronic equivalent).

      (2)  In the case of a consolidated entry summary covering the merchandise of more than one ultimate consignee, the importer number must be reported on CBP Form 7501 (box 12, or its electronic equivalent) and the notation “CONSOLIDATED” must be made in the space provided for the consignee number (box 10, or its electronic equivalent).

      (3)  If an importer of record desires to have refunds, bills, or notices of liquidation mailed in care of his agent, the agent's importer number must be reported on CBP Form 7501 in the box designated “Reference No” (box 22, or its electronic equivalent). In this case, the importer of record must file, or must have filed previously, a CBP Form 4811 authorizing the mailing of refunds, bills, or notices of liquidation to the agent.

      (4)  If a broker is used, the broker's number must be reported in the appropriate location on CBP Form 7501, or its electronic equivalent.

      (e) —(1) —(i) —(A)  For each class or kind of merchandise subject to a separate statistical reporting number, the applicable information required by the General Statistical Notes, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS), must be shown on the entry summary, CBP Form 7501. The applicable information must also be shown on the in-bond application filed pursuant to part 18 of this chapter when it is used to document an incoming vessel shipment proceeding to a third country pursuant to an entry for transportation and exportation, or immediate exportation.

      (B)  If a class or kind of merchandise from the same country of origin subject to the same statistical reporting number is included in more than one invoice, the importer may, at his option () list each invoice separately on the appropriate form listed under paragraph (e)(_1_)(i)(A) of this section and for each class or kind of merchandise within each invoice subject to a separate statistical reporting number, report the applicable information required by the General Statistical Notes, HTSUS; or () combine the information for each class or kind of merchandise and report it under one statistical reporting number for all invoices. When consolidating information from several invoices under one reporting number, a worksheet itemizing the entered value of the merchandise from each invoice in the manner prescribed in paragraph (f)(_2_)(ii) of this section must be attached to the appropriate form.

      (ii)  In addition to the information required by paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section, statistical information for which spaces are not provided on the appropriate form, must be shown as follows:

      (A) The name, the abbreviated designation or 4 digit code of the country of registry (flag) of the vessel expressed in terms of Annex B, HTSUS, must be placed in the block on the entry document for the name of the importing vessel or carrier.

      (B) The notation “Y” or “N” as appropriate, must be placed in column 33 of CBP Form 7501, or its electronic equivalent, and in the top right hand portion of CBP Form 7519, to identify the transaction as one between a buyer and a seller who are related in any manner, or as one between a buyer and a seller who are not so related.

      (C) The charges (aggregate cost of freight, insurance and all other charges), must be listed on CBP Form 7501 in column 33. The charges must be listed on CBP Form 7519, or its electronic equivalent in the rate column.

      (2)  The person filing the form is responsible for providing the information required by paragraph (e)(1) of this section. If the information required by subparagraph General Statistical Note 1(a)(xiv)(xvii), HTSUS, cannot be obtained readily, the person filing the form must provide reasonable estimates of the required information. The acceptance of an estimate for a particular transaction does not relieve the person filing the form from obtaining the necessary information for similar future transactions. The Center director may require additional documentation to substantiate the statistical information required by paragraph (e)(1) of this section. The importer must give an appropriate bond for the production of the required documentation, as follows:

      (i) Except for merchandise entered for warehouse, the documentation must be produced within 50 days after the entry summary (or the entry, if there is no entry summary) is required to be filed.

      (ii) If merchandise is entered for warehouse, the documentation must be produced within 2 months after the date of withdrawal, except that if an invoice is part of the documentation, the invoice must be produced within 50 days after the entry summary for warehouse is required to be filed.

      (3)  When the person filing the form estimates any of the values or charges, as provided for in General Statistical Note 1(b)(ii), HTSUS, except Canadian rail and truck charges, he must place either “(estimate)”, “(est)”, or (“E”) after the amount of each value or charge.

      (4)  The Center director will reject a form for failure to provide required statistical information if the information is omitted or if the information provided clearly appears on its face, or is known to the CBP officer, to be erroneous.

      (5)  Penalty procedures relating to erroneous statistical information will not be invoked against any person who in good faith attempts to comply with the statistical requirements of the General Statistical Note, HTSUS.

      (f) —(1)  If the entry, entry summary, or withdrawal documentation, as specified in paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section, covers a single invoice, the invoice information must be restated to show:

      (i) Gross amount of the invoice;

      (ii) Deduction of the aggregate amount of any non-dutiable charges involved in the amount;

      (iii) Further deduction of the aggregate of any deductions from the invoice values to make entered values; and

      (iv) Addition of the aggregate of any dutiable charges not included in the gross amount of the invoice and of any other additions to the invoice values to make entered values. The final amount in the summary computations must represent the aggregate of the entered values of all the merchandise covered by the invoice. The required information must be shown on a worksheet attached to the form or placed across columns 30 and 31 on CBP Form 7501, or its electronic equivalent and in the same general location on CBP Forms 7505, 7506.

      (2)  (i) If the importer or his agent elects the first option specified in paragraph (e)(1)(i)(B) of this section, the information required to be restated by paragraph (f)(1) of this section for a single invoice must be restated for each invoice. The required information must be shown on a worksheet attached to the form or placed across columns 30 and 31 on CBP Form 7501, or its electronic equivalent.

      (ii) If the importer or his agent elects the second option specified in paragraph (e)(1)(i)(B) of this section, the information required to be restated by paragraph (f)(1) of this section for a single invoice must be restated for each invoice. The final amount in the summary computation must represent the aggregate of the entered values of all the merchandise on each of the multiple invoices. The required information must be shown on an attached worksheet.

      (iii) The worksheet also must contain:

      (A) A statistical reporting number restatement for the merchandise from each invoice subject to the same statistical reporting number from the same country of origin, and

      (B) An aggregate total value which represents the entered value.

      (iv) To permit the identification of the merchandise entered under each reporting number, each class or kind of merchandise, from one country reported under a single statistical reporting number must be coded identically on each invoice and on the worksheet.

      (3)  “General average” means the liability to contribution of the owners of a cargo which arises when a sacrifice of a part of such cargo has been made for the preservation of the residue or when money is expended to preserve the whole. It only arises from actions impelled by necessity.

      (b)  A notice of lien for freight, charges, or contribution in general average pursuant to section 564, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1564), shall be filed with the port director on Customs Form 3485, signed by the authorized agent of the claimant and certified by him.

      (c)  When the cargo of a vessel is subject to contribution in general average, a preliminary notice thereof may be filed with the port director and individual notices of lien filed thereafter. Upon receipt of a preliminary notice, the port director shall withhold release of any merchandise imported in the vessel for 2 days (exclusive of Sunday and holidays) after such merchandise is taken into Customs custody, unless proof is submitted that the claim for contribution in general average has been paid or secured.

      (d)  A notice of lien upon merchandise entered for immediate transportation shall be filed by the claimant with the port director at the destination.

      (e)  A notice of lien shall be rejected and returned with the reason for rejection noted thereon if it is filed after any of the following actions have been taken concerning the merchandise:

      (f)  The acceptance of a notice of lien shall not in any manner affect the order of disposition and accounting for the proceeds of sales of forfeited and abandoned property provided for in Subpart D of part 127 and §§ 158.44 and 162.51 of this chapter.

      (g)  When any doubt exists as to the validity of a lien filed with the port director, he may require a bond on Customs Form 301, containing the bond conditions set forth in § 113.62 of this chapter, to hold him harmless from any liability which may result from withholding the release of the merchandise.

      § 141.113   Recall of merchandise released from Customs and Border Protection custody.

#### § § 141.113

      (a)(1)  Certain merchandise is required to be marked or labeled pursuant to the following provisions:

      (i) Section 304, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1304), pertaining to marking with country of origin;

      (ii) Textile Fiber Products Identification Act (15 U.S.C. 70);

      (iii) Wool Products Labeling Act (15 U.S.C. 68);

      (iv) Fur Products Labeling Act (15 U.S.C. 69); and

      (v) Chapter 91, Additional U.S. Note 4, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS), pertaining to special marking for watch and clock movements, cases, and dials.

      (2) If such merchandise is found after release to be not legally marked, the Center director may demand its return to CBP custody for the purpose of requiring it to be properly marked or labeled. The demand for marking or labeling shall be made not later than 30 days after the date of entry in the case of merchandise examined in public stores, and places of arrival, such as docks, wharfs, or piers. Demand may be made no later than 30 days after the date of examination in the case of merchandise examined at the importer's premises or such other appropriate places as determined by the port director or Center director.

      (b)  For purposes of determining whether the country of origin of textiles and textile products subject to the provisions of § 102.21 or § 102.22 of this chapter, as applicable, has been accurately represented to CBP, the release from CBP custody of any such textile or textile product shall be deemed conditional during the 180-day period following the date of release. If the Center director finds during the conditional release period that a textile or textile product is not entitled to admission into the commerce of the United States because the country of origin of the textile or textile product was not accurately represented to CBP, he shall promptly demand its return to CBP custody. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (h) of this section and § 113.62(n)(1) of this chapter, a failure to comply with a demand for return to CBP custody made under this paragraph shall result in the assessment of liquidated damages equal to the value of the merchandise involved.

      (c) —(1)  For purposes of determining the admissibility of any food, drug, device, cosmetic, or tobacco product imported pursuant to section 801(a) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 381(a)), as amended, the release from CBP custody of any such product will be deemed conditional. Unless extended in accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the conditional release period will terminate upon the earliest occurring of the following events:

      (i) The date that FDA issues a notice of refusal of admission;

      (ii) The date that FDA issues a notice that the merchandise may proceed; or

      (iii) Upon the end of the 30-day period following the date of release.

      (2)  The conditional release period provided under this paragraph (c) may be extended. The FDA must issue a written or electronic notice of sampling, detention, or other FDA action to the bond principal (, importer of record) within 30 days of the release of the merchandise in order for the extension of the conditional release period to be valid.

      (3)  If FDA refuses admission of a food, drug, device, cosmetic, or tobacco product into the United States, or if any notice of sampling or other request is not complied with, FDA will communicate that fact to the Center director. An authorized CBP official will demand the redelivery of the product to CBP custody. CBP will issue a notice of redelivery within 30 days from the date the product was refused admission by the FDA or from the date FDA determined the noncompliance with a notice of sampling or other request. The demand for redelivery may be made contemporaneously with the notice of refusal issued by the FDA. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (i) of this section, a failure to comply with a demand for redelivery made under this paragraph (c) will result in the assessment of liquidated damages equal to three times the value of the merchandise involved unless the port director has prescribed a bond equal to the domestic value of the merchandise pursuant to § 12.3(b) of this Chapter.

      (d)  If at any time after entry an authorized CBP official finds that any merchandise contained in an importation is not entitled to admission into the commerce of the United States for any reason not enumerated in paragraph (a), (b), or (c) of this section, an authorized CBP official shall promptly demand the return to CBP custody of any such merchandise which has been released.

      (e)  If the importer has not promptly complied with a request for samples or additional examination packages made by an authorized CBP official pursuant to § 151.11 of this chapter, an authorized CBP official may demand the return of the necessary merchandise to CBP custody.

      (f)  A demand for the return of merchandise to CBP custody shall be made on the importer of record, except that it shall be made on the actual owner if an actual owner's declaration and superseding bond have been filed in accordance with § 141.20 before the date of the demand.

      (g)  A demand for the return of merchandise to CBP custody shall be made on Customs Form 4647, or its electronic equivalent, or other appropriate form, or by letter. One copy, with the date of mailing or delivery noted thereon, shall be retained by an authorized CBP official and made part of the entry record.

      (h)  A demand for the return of merchandise to CBP custody shall not be made after the liquidation of the entry covering such merchandise has become final.

      (i)  When the demand of an authorized CBP official for return of merchandise to CBP custody is not complied with, liquidated damages shall be assessed, except in the case of merchandise entered under chapter 98, subchapter XIII, HTSUS (19 U.S.C. 1202), in an amount equal to the value of the merchandise not returned or three times the value of the merchandise not returned if the merchandise is restricted or prohibited merchandise or alcoholic beverages, as determined at the time of entry. The amount of liquidated damages to be assessed on merchandise entered under chapter 98, subchapter XIII, HTSUS is set forth in § 10.39(d)(3) of this chapter.

      § 142.14   Delinquent payment of Customs bills.

#### § § 142.14

      The following procedure shall be followed if an importer is substantially or habitually delinquent in the payment of Customs bills:

      (a)  The importer shall be advised in writing by the port director in which he is substantially or habitually delinquent that he shall file the entry summary documentation with estimated duties attached, before his merchandise may be released from Customs custody at that port. The notice shall state the reason for the action and advise the importer that if payment of all his delinquent Customs bills is not made within 10 working days from the date of the notice, he shall be required to file the entry summary document with estimated duties attached, before his merchandise may be released. In either case, the entry summary shall serve as both the entry and the entry summary.

      (b)  If the importer pays all his delinquent Customs bills within 10 working days after the date of the notice, the requirement shall be removed, and the importer need file only the entry documentation specified in § 142.3 to secure release of his merchandise.

      (c)  If the importer has not paid all his delinquent Customs bills within 10 working days after the date of the notice, he also shall be required to file the entry summary documentation, with estimated duties attached, at each Customs port. In this case, the entry summary shall serve as both the entry and the entry summary. This requirement shall remain in effect in each port of entry until notification is received from Headquarters that the requirement is removed and that the importer need submit only the entry documentation listed in § 142.3 to secure release of his merchandise.

      § 142.15   Failure to file entry summary timely.

#### § § 142.15

      If the entry summary documentation is not filed timely, the port director shall make an immediate demand for liquidated damages in the entire amount of the bond in the case of a single entry bond. When the transaction has been charged against a continuous bond, the demand shall be for the amount that would have been demanded if the merchandise had been released under a single entry bond. Any application to cancel liquidated damages incurred shall be made in accordance with part 172 of this chapter.

Entry documentation may also be transmitted electronically to the CBP Automated Commercial Environment (ACE) or any other CBP-authorized electronic data interchange system. The importer may use these documents in preparing the entry summary, CBP Form 7501, or its electronic equivalent, and must file them with the entry summary documentation within the time period stated in § 142.12(b). The entry summary documentation also must include any other documentation required for a particular shipment unless a bond for missing documentation is on file, as provided in § 141.66 of this chapter.

      (b)  When the entry summary documentation is filed or transmitted electronically at time of entry, the documentation listed in § 142.3 must be filed at the same time, except that CBP Form 3461 or 7533, or their electronic equivalents, will not be required. The importer also must file any additional invoice required for a particular shipment.

    Subpart C—Special Permit for Immediate Delivery

      Prohibited Merchandise, No Other Entry Filed

        § 142.29   Other procedures applicable.

#### § § 142.29

        Merchandise released under a special permit for immediate delivery shall be subject to the same procedures applicable to all other imported merchandise, unless specific procedures are set forth in this subpart.

      § 142.21   Merchandise eligible for special permit for immediate delivery.

#### § § 142.21

      Merchandise may be released under a special permit for immediate delivery, in accordance with section 448(b), Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1448(b)), in the following circumstances:

      (a)  At the discretion of the port director, merchandise arriving by land from Canada or Mexico may be released under a special permit for immediate delivery provided the importer has on file a bond on CBP Form 301, containing the bond conditions set forth in § 113.62 of this chapter. An entry summary shall be filed in accordance with § 142.22(b)(1), and estimated duties, if any, shall be deposited, within the time period specified in § 142.23 for all merchandise from contiguous countries released under a special permit except for fresh fruits and vegetables for human consumption released under the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section.

      (b)  (1) An application for a special permit for immediate delivery may be made for the transportation of fresh fruits and vegetables for human consumption arriving from Canada or Mexico to the importer's premises within the port of importation, but removed from the area immediately contiguous to the border.

      (2) The application shall be accompanied by a continuous bond on CBP Form 301, containing the bond conditions set forth in § 113.62 of this chapter.

      (3) The fresh fruits and vegetables shall be transported to the importer's premises in the vehicles in which they crossed the border or, if transshipment is necessary in vehicles provided by the importer. The fresh fruits and vegetables may be examined at the importer's premises. Those portions without commercial value may be disposed of in accordance with the provisions of § 158.11(b) of this chapter, and the balance shall be entered for consumption or transported in bond under an entry for immediate transportation without appraisement or under an entry for transportation and exportation.

      (c)  Merchandise may be released under the immediate delivery procedure if the shipment is consigned to or for the account of any agency or office of the United States Government, or to an officer or official of any such agency in his official capacity, as provided in § 10.101 of this chapter.

      (d)  Articles for a trade fair may be released under the immediate delivery procedure, as provided in § 147.13 of this chapter.

      (e) —(1)  At the discretion of the port director, merchandise subject to a tariff-rate quota may be released under a special permit for immediate delivery provided the importer has on file a bond on CBP Form 301, containing the bond conditions set forth in § 113.62 of this chapter. However, merchandise subject to a tariff-rate quota may not be incrementally released under a special permit for immediate delivery as provided in paragraphs (g) and (h) of this section. Nor is such merchandise eligible for release under a special permit pursuant to 19 CFR 141.58(d)(1). Where a special permit is authorized, an entry summary will be properly presented pursuant to § 132.1 of this chapter within the time specified in § 142.23, or within the quota period, whichever expires first. If proper presentation is not made until after the tariff-rate quota is filled, the merchandise shall not be entitled to the quota rate of duty, and the importer shall pay duties at the over-quota rate.

      (2)  At the discretion of the port director, perishable merchandise of a class approved by CBP Headquarters which is subject to an absolute quota may be released under a special permit for immediate delivery for removal to the importer's premises, or to any other location approved by the port director, until an entry summary is properly presented pursuant to § 132.1 of this chapter. However, merchandise subject to an absolute quota under this paragraph may not be incrementally released under a special permit for immediate delivery as provided in paragraphs (g) and (h) of this section. Nor is such merchandise eligible for release under a special permit pursuant to § 141.58(d)(1) of this chapter. Where a special permit is authorized, a proper entry summary must be presented for merchandise so released within the time specified in § 142.23, or within the quota period, whichever expires first. If the absolute quota is filled before the importer has properly presented an entry summary, he may either present an entry summary for warehouse or, under CBP supervision, export or destroy the merchandise.

      (f)  Merchandise may be released from warehouse under a special permit:

      (1) At the discretion of the port director when:

      (i) The warehouse is located a considerable distance from the customhouse and actual release of the merchandise from the warehouse may not be effected within the next full business day after the day of the payment of duty, and

      (ii) The port has sufficient manpower to permit such practice;

      (2) The importer shall have on file a bond on CBP Form 301, containing the bond conditions set forth in § 113.62 of this chapter; and

      (3) The immediate delivery permit shall be annotated to state that a warehouse withdrawal for consumption will be filed for this merchandise.

      (g)  Merchandise subject to § 141.57(d)(2) of this chapter, which is invoiced and delivered to the carrier as a single shipment, but which, due to the carrier's inability to accommodate the merchandise on a single conveyance, is shipped by the carrier in separate portions to the same port of entry in the United States as listed on the original bill of lading, may be released incrementally under a special permit. Incremental release means releasing each portion of such shipments separately as they arrive.

      (h)  Merchandise subject to § 141.58(d)(2) of this chapter, which is purchased, invoiced, and classified as a single entity under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS), and which is shipped in separate portions because its size or nature prevents shipping the entity on a single conveyance, may be released incrementally under a special permit.

      (i)  Headquarters may authorize the release of merchandise under the immediate delivery procedure in circumstances other than those described in § 142.21(a) through (h) provided a bond on CBP Form 301 containing the bond conditions set forth in § 113.62 of this chapter is on file.

      (2) A withdrawal for consumption, with estimated duties attached, which shall be filed only for merchandise released from warehouse under § 142.21(f) of this part;

      (c) Listing of all ports in which the initiating company has filed a similar application for Line Release.

      (d) Country of origin codes (ISO codes from Annex B of HTSUS) for the merchandise.

      (e) Shipper or manufacturer information: Name, address, city, province/state, country, postal code, indication by noting “M” or “S” whether this information relates to a manufacturer (M) or a shipper (S), and manufacturer identification number of the shipper or manufacturer.

      (f) Importer information (if importer is different than filer): Name, address, city, state and country, zip code, importer number, bond number, and surety code.

      (g) Entry filer information: Name, importer number, filer code, bond number, and surety code.

      (h) Product information: Product description, manifest unit of measure, HTSUS number described to sub-heading level for particular product or range of HTSUS numbers at sub-heading levels for multiple products for which Line Release is sought.

      (i) Election of whether the Line Release transaction is to be considered an entry or an immediate delivery.

      § 142.43   Line Release application approval process.

#### § § 142.43

      (a)  The port director shall review each Line Release application to determine whether the shipments qualify for Line Release processing. The port director may contact the applicant for further information, if necessary. An application that fails to elect whether the Line Release transaction is to be considered an entry or an immediate delivery will be returned to the applicant. If all required information is submitted, the application will be forwarded to Headquarters for final processing.

      (b)  A C-4 Code (Common Commodity Classification Code), which is a unique code identifying the shipper or manufacturer, importer, entry filer, and the product for each Line Release shipment, shall be assigned by Headquarters to each application approved for Line Release. Headquarters shall annotate each approved application with a C-4 Code and return the application to the port director who shall return the approved application to the entry filer.

      (c)  If the port director is considering the denial of a Line Release application, consideration shall be given to whether an application by the same filer for the same transaction has been approved at another port. If there is not an approved application at another port and the port director determines that the application shall be denied, the application shall be noted denied and returned to the entry filer without a C-4 Code annotation by the port director. If an application has been approved at another port, but the port director still questions whether the application should be approved at his port, the port director shall forward the application to the Assistant Commissioner, Office of Information Management. The Office of Information and Technology will review the application and will notify the port director of the final determination.

      § 142.44   Entry number range.

#### § § 142.44

      After an application for Line Release has received final approval, filers must provide the port director, in writing, with a range of entry numbers for use in the system so that an entry number can be assigned automatically to each Line Release transaction. For the purposes of this subpart, “entry number”, when the release is an immediate delivery, merely refers to the Line Release transaction number; this number does not become the actual entry number until an entry for the merchandise released under the immediate delivery procedure is filed. A separate range must be provided for each Line Release site at the port. These entry numbers shall be used for assignment within the Line Release system. Entry filers shall not assign these numbers to other entry transactions.

      § 142.45   Use of bar code by entry filer.

#### § § 142.45

      (a)  Upon receipt of an approved Line Release application, the entry filer, in accordance with instructions from the port director, shall preprint invoices with the C-4 Code in bar code and alpha-numeric format or print labels with the necessary information. Bar codes shall be printed in accordance with the specifications stated in Customs Publication 561 (). Labels or preprinted invoices also shall state the name of the shipper or manufacturer of the product and the name of the importer of record, if other than the entry filer, above the bar code and the name of the entry filer and a product description below the bar code.

      (b)  Multiple commodity processing allows more than one product to be released under one entry number. The shipper/manufacturer, importer of record and the entry filer must be the same. The product description is the only variable allowed. The commodities should be listed on one invoice with C-4 Code labels for each commodity attached to the invoice.

      (c)  If labels are used, the labels shall be affixed to the invoices in accordance with instructions from the port director. The entry filer may either affix the labels or distribute the labels to the shippers/manufacturers and instruct them in the use and placement of the labels.

      § 142.46   Presentation of invoice and assignment of entry number.

#### § § 142.46

      (a)  When merchandise that has been approved for Line Release is imported at a Line Release site, the carrier, importer or filer shall present Customs with an invoice with the bar code or codes printed or affixed and, according to the method of transportation, the appropriate manifest document.

      (b)  If after scanning the bar code at the Line Release site, the Customs officer verifies the data on the bar code with the information on the invoice, he will key the quantity on the invoice and an entry number will be automatically assigned to the transaction. If there are any differences between the system data and the invoice and bar code, including any differences in entry filer, the Customs officer shall order an examination.

      (c)  If the Line Release shipment requires other agency documentation, the Customs officer at the Line Release site will be alerted to that requirement electronically when he verifies the data on the bar code with the information on the invoice. If the required form is presented to the officer with the documentation package, the shipment may be released.

      § 142.47   Examinations of Line Release transactions.

#### § § 142.47

      (a)  Merchandise imported under Line Release generally may be released without further CBP processing. CBP, however, may choose to inspect any Line Release shipment. Examinations may be either specifically ordered by the CBP officer or random.

      (b)  CBP may void a Line Release transaction for the following reasons: Because of an examination, because a carrier transporting the Line Release merchandise is not a participant in a CBP-approved industry partnership program, or because a driver or conveyance is not authorized in accordance with the LBCIP. If this occurs, CBP will return the invoice to the carrier, and the entry filer, in order to enter merchandise, must prepare and submit either a CF 3461 or 3461 Alternate, or its electronic equivalent.

      § 142.48   Release procedure.

#### § § 142.48

      (a)  When the Customs officer at the Line Release site determines that a shipment is ready for release, release data, consisting of the entry number, the date and time of release, the inspector's badge number, the quantity and unit of measure, and the C-4 Code will be printed on the invoice and the manifest document and, when other agency documentation is presented, may be printed on that documentation. The invoice shall be returned to the entry filer and the manifest document shall be retained by Customs.

      (b)  The returned invoice with the release data shall be the release notification to non-ABI participants.

      (c)  If the Line Release entry filer is an operational ABI participant, the filer shall receive an electronic notification of the release consisting of the importer of record number, the port of entry, the filer code, the entry number, the date and time of release, the manufacturer code, the quantity and unit of measure, the release site, the HTSUS number(s), the C-4 Code and the country or countries of origin.

      § 142.49   Deletion of C-4 Code.

#### § § 142.49

      (a)  A port director may temporarily or permanently delete an entry filer's C-4 Code without providing the participant with any justification and without prior notification in cases of willfulness or when public health, interest, or safety so requires, thereby revoking the filer's use of Line Release.

      (b)  Entry filers may delete C-4 Codes from Line Release by notifying the port director in writing on a Deletion Data Loading Sheet. Such notification shall state the C-4 Code which is to be deleted, the port where the C-4 Code is to be deleted and the reason for the requested deletion. A copy of the originally approved Data Loading Sheet must be submitted with the Deletion Data Loading Sheet. If only a temporary deletion is desired, the filer shall state the requested effective date for the deletion and the date the C-4 Code is requested to be returned to Line Release processing.

      § 142.50   Line Release data base corrections or changes.

#### § § 142.50

      The applicant shall notify the port director of any changes in names, importer or filer numbers or bond information on a Line Release Data Loading Sheet as soon as possible. Notification shall be accomplished by the submission of a copy of the original loading sheet with a Correction Data Loading Sheet.

      § 142.51   Changing election of entry or immediate delivery.

#### § § 142.51

      An applicant who has already received a C-4 Code and wishes to change the election chosen on his Line Release application as to whether the release should be considered an entry or an immediate delivery must submit a letter requesting such change to the port director where the C-4 Code is used. This letter must include the C-4 Code to be changed and the date the change is to be effective. If the requested change is for a temporary time period, the letter shall include the date the releases are to return to the release type originally requested. Applications that fail to state the effective dates of the changes requested will be returned to the applicant.

      § 142.52   Port-wide and multiple port acceptance of Line Release.

#### § § 142.52

      (a)  If a C-4 Code has been approved by the port director, the C-4 Code may be used at any Line Release site at the port.

      (b)  In order for a C-4 Code approved at one port to be used at another port, the entry filer must submit an application to the port director of the other port. While uniform criteria shall be applied to approving similar shipments for Line Release at all ports, a port director may exercise his discretion to deny Line Release at his port even though a similar shipment may be approved at another port.

    § 142.0   Scope.

#### § § 142.0

    This part sets forth requirements and procedures relating to (a) the entry of merchandise, as authorized by section 484, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1484), and (b) special permits for immediate delivery of merchandise, as authorized by section 448(b), Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1448(b)).

#### § § 143.4

      The electronic data received and exchanged by a service bureau shall be considered confidential, and the service bureau shall maintain the accuracy of data received in the process of formatting and transmitting such data on behalf of a filer, and shall not disclose this data or any information connected therewith to any persons other than the filer or Customs (see § 111.24 of this chapter).

The participant will be notified, electronically and in writing, by the Director, User Support Services Division, of any action to place the participant on probation. The notice will specifically set forth the grounds for the proposed probation, and advise the participant that he will have 15 days from the date of the notice to show cause why the probationary period should not take effect. If the participant fails to respond within the allotted time, or fails to show to the satisfaction of the Director, User Support Services Division, that the probationary period should not take effect, the Director will notify the participant of the effective date of the probationary period. The length of the probationary period may, in the discretion of the Director, User Support Services Division, be extended up to a maximum of 90 days, if the participant's performance remains below standard, but, except for immediate revocation under § 143.7, participation will not be suspended or revoked until the probationary period has lasted a minimum of 30 days. The participant's performance will be closely monitored during this time, which will include working with the participant and providing any necessary guidance to assist the participant in bringing his performance back to standard.

      (b)  If deficiencies are not corrected within the probationary period, the participant will be suspended from operational status. The participant will be notified, electronically and in writing, by the Director, User Support Services Division, of any action to suspend participation. The notice will specifically set forth the grounds and effective date for the suspension, and the right to appeal the suspension to the Assistant Commissioner, Information and Technology, within 10 days following the date of the written notice of suspension (see § 143.8).

      (c)  To obtain reinstatement to operational status, a suspended participant must submit a letter to the Director, User Support Services Division, stating that the deficiencies for which the suspension was invoked have been corrected. If, after the participant has demonstrated compliance with the system performance requirements and operational standards specified in § 143.5 of this part, if required, the Director is satisfied that the deficiencies have been corrected, the participant will be reinstated.

      § 143.7   Revocation of ABI participation.

      If the participant files a written appeal with the Assistant Commissioner, Information and Technology, within 10 days following the date of the written notice of action to suspend or revoke participation as provided in §§ 143.6 and 143.7, the suspension or revocation of participation shall not take effect until the appeal is decided, except in those cases where the Executive Director, Trade Policy and Programs, Office of International Trade, or the Director, User Support Services Division, respectively, determines that participation was obtained through fraud or the misstatement of a material fact, or that continued participation would pose a potential risk of significant harm to the integrity and functioning of the system. The CBP officer who receives the appeal shall stamp the date of receipt of the appeal and the stamped date is the date of receipt for purposes of the appeal. The Assistant Commissioner shall inform the participant of the date of receipt and the date that a response is due under this paragraph. The Assistant Commissioner shall render his decision to the participant, in writing, stating his reasons therefor, by letter mailed within 30 working days following receipt of the appeal, unless this period is extended with due notification to the participant.

      § 143.32   Definitions.

#### § § 143.32

      The following are definitions for purposes of subparts D and E of this part:

      (a)  “ABI” means the Automated Broker Interface functionality that allows entry filers to transmit immediate delivery, entry and entry summary data electronically to, and receive electronic messaging from, CBP and receive transmissions from Automated Commercial Environment (ACE) or any other CBP-authorized electronic data interchange system.

      (b)  means any established mechanism approved by the Commissioner of CBP through which information can be transferred electronically.

      (c)  “AII” means Automated Invoice Interface and is a method of transmitting detailed invoice data through ABI.

      (d)  “Broker” means a customs broker licensed under part 111 of this chapter.

      (e)  “Certification” means the electronic equivalent of a signature for data transmitted through ABI. This electronic (facsimile) signature must be transmitted as part of the immediate delivery, entry or entry summary data. Such data are referred to as “certified”.

      (f)  “Data” when used in conjunction with immediate delivery, entryand/or entry summary means the information required to be submitted with the immediate delivery, entry and/or entry summary, respectively, in accordance with the CATAIR (CBP Publication 552, Customs and Trade Automated Interface Requirements) and/or CBP Headquarters directives. It does not mean the actual paper documents, but includes all of the information required to be in such documents.

      (g)  “Documentation” when used in conjunction with immediate delivery, entry and/or entry summary means the documents set forth in § 142.3 of this chapter, required to be submitted as part of an application for immediate delivery, entry and/or entry summary, but does not include the CBP Forms 7501, 3461, or their electronic equivalents (or alternative forms).

      (k)  “EIP” refers to modules of the Automated Broker Interface (ABI) that allow entry filers to transmit detailed invoice data and includes Automated Invoice Interface (AII) and any other electronic invoice authorized by CBP.

      (l)  “Filer” means the party certifying the electronic filing of the application for immediate delivery, entry or entry summary. Filer may be a broker or an importer of record filing his own entries through ABI without the use of a broker.

      (ii) The importer must have a centralized inventory control system that shows the location of all of the warehoused merchandise at all times, including merchandise in transit.

      (iv) Each proprietor of a warehouse listed on the application and each surety who underwrites that proprietor's custodial bond coverage under § 113.63 of this chapter shall sign the application.

      (2)  Application must be made in writing to the port director of the port in which the applicant's centralized inventory control system exists, with copies to all affected port directors, for exemptions from the requirements for transfer of merchandise from one bonded warehouse to another set forth in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.

      (4)  The records required to be maintained must include a centralized inventory control system and supporting documentation which meets the following requirements:

These documents must show the appropriate warehouse entry number or unique identifier, the description and quantity of the merchandise transferred, and must be properly authorized and signed evidencing shipment from and delivery to each location;

      (v) Maintain a consolidated permit file folder at the location where the merchandise was originally warehoused. The consolidated permit file folder must meet the requirements of § 19.12(d)(4) of this chapter regardless of the warehouse facility in which the action occurred. Documentation for all intracompany movements, including authorizations for movement, shipping documents, receiving reports, as well as documentation showing ultimate disposition of the merchandise must be filed in the consolidated permit file folder within seven business days;

      (vi) Maintain a subordinate permit file at all intracompany locations where merchandise is transferred containing copies of documentation required by § 19.12(d)(4) of this chapter and by paragraph (c)(3)(v) of this section relating to merchandise quantities transferred to the location. A copy of all documents in the subordinate permit file folder must be filed in the consolidated permit file folder within seven business days; no exceptions will be granted to this requirement. When the final withdrawal is made on the respective entry, the subordinate permit file shall be considered closed and filed at the intracompany location to which the merchandise was transferred; and

      (vii) File the withdrawal from Customs custody at the original warehouse location at which the merchandise was entered.

      (5)  The permit file folder requirements of paragraphs (c)(3)(v) and (c)(3)(vi) of this section may be waived if the proprietor's recordkeeping and inventory control system qualifies under the requirements of § 19.12(d)(4)(iii) of this chapter at all locations where bonded merchandise is stored.

      (6) —(i)  The transfer procedures permitted under paragraph (c) of this section shall not be available for merchandise with respect to which Customs is notified of the existence of a lien, as prescribed in § 141.112 of this chapter (see 19 U.S.C. 1564), until proof shall be produced at the original warehouse location that the lien has been satisfied or discharged.

      (2)  The dividing up for exportation of shipments arriving under warehouse withdrawals for indirect exportation will be permitted only when various portions of a shipment are destined to different destinations, when the export vessel cannot properly accommodate the entire quantity, or in other similar circumstances. In the case of merchandise moving under cover of a TIR carnet, if the merchandise is not to be exported or if the shipment is to be divided, appropriate entry will be required and the carnet discharged. The provisions of §§ 18.23 and 18.24 of this chapter concerning change of destination or retention of merchandise on the dock must also be followed in applicable cases.

      (e)  Merchandise in bulk and packaged articles which are customarily bought and sold by weight, gauge, or measure may be withdrawn for exportation or transportation only at the actual quantities ascertained at the time of the original entry for warehouse, except as otherwise provided for by law. In any case, the port director may require a special report of weight, gauge, or measure of the merchandise being exported if he deems it necessary.

      (f)  Merchandise withdrawn for exportation but not laden must be sent to general order unless other disposition is prescribed by the port director.

      (g)  Merchandise may be withdrawn for exportation at a foreign trade zone in the same or at a different port. The merchandise will be considered exported upon admission to a zone in zone-restricted status, as provided in § 146.44(c) of this chapter.

      (h) —(1)  Merchandise in a Class 9 warehouse (duty-free store) may be withdrawn for any of the purposes set forth in this subpart. However, only conditionally duty-free merchandise in a Class 9 warehouse intended for exportation or for delivery to persons and organizations set forth in subpart I, part 148, of this chapter, will be eligible for withdrawal under the sales ticket procedure specified in this paragraph.

      (2)  Sales ticket withdrawals must be made only under a blanket permit to withdrawal (see § 19.6(d) of this chapter) and the sales ticket will serve as the equivalent of the supplementary withdrawal. A sales ticket is an invoice of the proprietor's design which will include:

      (vi) A statement on the original copy (purchaser's copy) to the effect that goods purchased in a duty-free store will be subject to duty and/or tax with personal exemption if returned to the United States. At the time of purchase, the original sales ticket must be made out in the name of the purchaser and given to the purchaser. One copy of the sales ticket must be retained by the proprietor. This copy may be maintained electronically. A permit file copy will be attached to the parcel containing the purchased articles unless the proprietor has established and maintained an effective method to match the parcel containing the purchased articles with the purchaser. Additional copies may be retained by the proprietor.

      (3)  In addition to the records required in § 19.12(a) of this chapter, Class 9 warehouse proprietors must maintain a sales ticket register or similar accounting record for each warehouse entry. The sales ticket register of the proprietor must include the following information:

      (i) Warehouse entry number;

      (ii) Specific identifier, if applicable;

      (iii) Sales ticket date and number;

      (iv) Description;

      (v) Quantity; and

      (vi) Current balance.

No declaration is required on the entry.

      (c)  (1) Separate shipments consigned to the same consignee and received under separate withdrawals for transportation may be combined into one rewarehouse entry if the warehouse withdrawals are from the same original warehouse entry.

With the exception of alcohol and tobacco products, this procedure shall not be allowed for merchandise which is in any way restricted (for example, quota/visa). The combined rewarehouse entry shall have attached either copies of each warehouse entry package which is being combined into the single rewarehouse entry or a summary with pertinent information, that is, the date of importation, commodity description, size, HTSUS and entry numbers, for all entries withdrawn for consolidation as one rewarehouse entry. Any combining of separate withdrawals into one rewarehouse entry shall result in the rewarehouse entry being assigned the import date of the oldest entry being combined into the rewarehouse entry.

      (f)  Any examination necessary for identification of the merchandise, determination of shortages, or other purposes shall be made.

      (g)  If the rewarehouse entry is not filed within 15 calendar days after its arrival, the merchandise shall be disposed of in accordance with the applicable procedures in § 4.37 or § 122.50 or § 123.10 of this chapter. However, merchandise sent to a general order warehouse shall not be sold or otherwise disposed of as unclaimed until the expiration of the original 5-year period during which the merchandise may remain in warehouse under bond.

      (h)  A protest may be filed with CBP, either at the port of entry or electronically, against a liquidation made under § 159.7(a) or (b) of this chapter, or against a refusal to liquidate pursuant to said sections. In all other cases, any protest shall be filed against the original warehouse entry.

      Requests for adjustment of the amount of duty assessed under mail entries shall be handled as requests for administrative review in accordance with this subpart.

      § 145.22   Procedures for obtaining administrative review.

#### § § 145.22

      If an addressee is dissatisfied with the amount of duty assessed under a mail entry made before December 18, 2004, he may obtain administrative review in the following ways:

      (a) He may pay the assessed duty, take delivery of the merchandise, and send a copy of the mail entry to the issuing CBP office indicated on the mail entry, together with a statement of the reason it is believed the duty assessed is incorrect. Any invoices, bills of sale, or other evidence should be submitted with the statement. The addressee may show the mail entry number and date on his statement instead of sending a copy of the mail entry, but this may result in delay.

      (b) He may postpone acceptance of the shipment, and within the time allowed by the Postal regulations provide the postmaster with a written statement of his objections. The postmaster will forward the mail entry together with the addressee's statement and any invoices, bills of sale, or other evidence submitted by the addressee to the port director who issued the entry, and retain custody of the shipment until advice is received from the port director as to the disposition to be made. If the addressee is located near one of the ports at which CBP officers are authorized to review mail entries (see 39 CFR 10.5), the postmaster may send the mail entry to that port, together with the addressee's statement and evidence, for reconsideration by the port director.

      (c) He may pay the assessed duty and take delivery of the merchandise, and file a protest under section 514, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1514), in the form and manner prescribed in part 174 of this chapter. For mail entries made before December 18, 2004, a protest must be filed no later than 90 days after payment of the duties by the addressee. All other mail entries must be protested within 180 days after payment of the duties by the addressee.

Requests for adjustment in the amount of duty assessed under mail entries made under § 145.22(a) must be made in such time that the request can be acted upon by the port director within 90 days after receipt of the mail article and payment of the duties by the addressee. For a mail entry made before December 18, 2004, protests under § 145.22(c) of this chapter must be filed no later than 90 days after payment of the duties by the addressee, but may be acted upon by CBP after expiration of that 90-day period.

#### § § 145.25

If the duty has not been paid, the mail entry shall be returned to the postmaster concerned, together with a copy of the notice sent to the addressee.

  PART 146—FOREIGN TRADE ZONES

### Part 146

**Authority:** Authority: 19 U.S.C. 66, 81a-81u, 1202 (General Note 3(i), Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States), 1623, 1624.

**Source:** Source: T.D. 86-16, 51 FR 5049, Feb. 11, 1986, unless otherwise noted.

    Subpart A—General Provisions

      § 146.1   Definitions.

#### § § 146.1

      (a) The following words, defined in section 1 of the Foreign-Trade Zones Act of 1934, as amended (19 U.S.C. 81a), are given the same meaning when used in this part, unless otherwise stated: “Board”, “Grantee”, and “Zones”.

      (b) The following are general definitions for the purpose of this part:

      “Act” means the Foreign-Trade Zones Act of June 18, 1934, as amended (48 Stat. 998-1003; 19 U.S.C. 81a-u).

      “Activation” means approval by the grantee and port director for operations and for the admission and handling of merchandise in zone status.

      “Admit” means to bring merchandise into a zone with zone status.

      “Alteration” means a change in the boundaries of an activated zone or subzone; activation of a separate site of an already-activated zone or subzone with the same operator at the same port; or the relocation of an already-activated site with the same operator.

      “Conditionally admissible merchandise” is merchandise which may be imported into the U.S. under certain conditions. Merchandise which is subject to permits or licenses, or which may be reconditioned to bring it into compliance with the laws administered by various Federal agencies, is an example of conditionally admissible merchandise.

      “Constructive transfer” is a legal fiction which permits acceptance of a Customs entry for merchandise in a zone before its physical transfer to the Customs territory.

      “Customs territory” is the territory of the U.S. in which the general tariff laws of the U.S. apply. “Customs territory of the United States” includes only the States, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. (General Note 2, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (19 U.S.C. 1202)).

      “Deactivation” means voluntary discontinuation of the activation of an entire zone or subzone by the grantee or operator. Discontinuance of the activated status of only a part of a zone site is an alteration.

      “Default” means an action or omission that will result in a claim for duties, taxes, charges, or liquidated damages under the Foreign Trade Zone Operator Bond.

      “Domestic merchandise” is merchandise which has been (i) produced in the U.S. and not exported therefrom, or (ii) previously imported into Customs territory and properly released from Customs custody.

      “Foreign merchandise” is imported merchandise which has not been properly released from Customs custody in Customs territory.

      “Fungible merchandise” means merchandise which for commercial purposes is identical and interchangeable in all situations.

      “Merchandise” includes goods, wares and chattels of every description, except prohibited merchandise. Building materials, production equipment, and supplies for use in operation of a zone are not “merchandise” for the purpose of this part.

      “Operator” is a corporation, partnership, or person that operates a zone or subzone under the terms of an agreement with the zone grantee. Where used in this part, the term “operator” also applies to a “grantee” that operates its own zone.

      For those foreign trade zones located within the geographical limits of a port of entry, the term “port director” means the director of that port of entry. For those foreign trade zones located outside the geographical limits of a port of entry, the term “port director” means the director of the port of entry geographically nearest to where the foreign trade zone is located.

      “Prohibited merchandise” is merchandise the importation of which is prohibited by law on grounds of public policy or morals, or any merchandise which is excluded from a zone by order of the Board. Books urging treason or insurrection against the U.S., obscene pictures, and lottery tickets are examples of prohibited merchandise.

      “Reactivation” means a resumption of the activated status of an entire area that was previously deactivated without any change in the operator or the area boundaries. If the boundaries are different, the action is an alteration. If the operator is different, it is an activation.

      “Subzone” is a special-purpose zone established as part of a zone project for a limited purpose, that cannot be accommodated within an existing zone. The term “zone” also applies to a subzone, unless specified otherwise.

      “Transfer” means to take merchandise with zone status from a zone for consumption, transportation, exportation, warehousing, cartage or lighterage, vessel supplies and equipment, admission to another zone, and like purposes.

      “Unique identifier” means the numbers, letters, or combination of numbers and letters that identify merchandise admitted to a zone with zone status.

      “User” means a person or firm using a zone or subzone for storage, handling, or processing of merchandise.

      “Zone lot” means a collection of merchandise maintained under an inventory control method based on specific identification of merchandise admitted to a zone by lot.

      “Zone site” means the physical location of a zone or subzone.

      “Zone status” means the status of merchandise admitted to a zone, , nonprivileged foreign, privileged foreign, zone restricted, or domestic.

The port director may direct a Customs officer to supervise any transaction or procedure at a zone. Supervision may be performed through a periodic audit of the operator's records, quantity count of goods in a zone inventory, spot check of selected transactions or procedures, or review of recordkeeping, security, or conditions of storage in a zone.

      § 146.4   Operator responsibility and supervision.

#### § § 146.4

      (a)  The operator shall supervise all admissions, transfers, removals, recordkeeping, manipulations, manufacturing, destruction, exhibition, physical and procedural security, and conditions of storage in the zone as required by law and regulations. Supervision by the operator shall be that which a prudent manager of a storage, manipulation, or manufacturing facility would be expected to exercise, and may take into account the degree of supervision exercised by the zone user having physical possession of zone merchandise.

      (b)  The operator shall permit any Customs officer access to a zone.

      (c)  The operator is responsible for safekeeping of merchandise and records concerning merchandise admitted to a zone. The operator, at its liability, may allow the zone importer or owner of the goods to store, safeguard, and otherwise maintain or handle the goods and the inventory records pertaining to them.

      (d)  The operator shall (1) maintain the inventory control and recordkeeping system in accordance with the provisions of subpart B, (2) retain all records required in this part and defined in § 162.1(a) of this chapter, pertaining to zone merchandise for 5 years after the merchandise is removed from the zone, and (3) protect proprietary information in its custody from unauthorized disclosure. Records shall be readily available for Customs review at the zone.

      (e)  The operator shall maintain the zone and establish procedures adequate to ensure the security of merchandise located in the zone in accordance with applicable Customs security standards and specifications.

      (f)  The operator shall store and handle merchandise in a zone in a safe and sanitary manner to minimize damage to the merchandise, avoid hazard to persons, and meet local, state, and Federal requirements applicable to a specific kind of goods. All trash and waste will be promptly removed from a zone. Aisles will be established and maintained, and doors and entrances left unblocked for access by Customs officers and other persons in the performance of their official duties.

      (g)  The operator is authorized to provide guards or contract for guard service to safeguard the merchandise and ensure the security of the zone. This authorization does not limit the authority of the port director to assign Customs guards to protect the revenue under section 4 of the Act (19 U.S.C. 81d).

      (h)  The operator is responsible for complying with requirements for admission, manipulation, manufacture, exhibition, or destruction, shortage, or overage; inventory control and recordkeeping systems, transfer to Customs territory, and other requirements as specified in this part. If the operator elects to transfer merchandise from within the district boundaries (see definition of “district” at § 112.1) to his zone, he shall receipt for the merchandise at the time he picks it up for transportation to his facility. He becomes liable for the merchandise at that time.

#### § § 146.5

      § 146.6   Procedure for activation.

#### § § 146.6

      (a)  A zone operator, or where there is no operator, a grantee, shall make written application to the port director to obtain approval of activation of a zone or zone site. The area to be activated may be all or any portion of the zone approved by the Board. The application must include a description of all the zone sites covered by the application, any operation to be conducted therein, and a statement of the general character of the merchandise to be admitted. The port director may also require the operator or grantee to submit fingerprints on form FD 258 or electronically at the time of filing the application. If the operator is an individual, that individual's fingerprints may be required. If the operator or grantee is a business entity, fingerprints of all officers and managing officials may be required.

      (b)  The application must be accompanied by the following:

      (1) [Reserved]

      (2) A blueprint of the area approved by the Board to be activated showing area measurements, including all openings and buildings; and all outlets, inlets, and pipelines to any tank for the storage of liquid or similar product, that portion of the blueprint certified to be correct by the operator of the tank;

      (3) A gauge table, when appropriate, showing the capacity, in the appropriate unit, of any tank, certified to be correct by the operator of the tank;

      (4) A procedures manual describing the inventory control and recordkeeping system that will be used in the zone, certified by the operator or grantee to meet the requirements of subpart B; and

      (5) The written concurrence of the grantee, when the operator applies for activation, in the requested zone activation.

      (c)  As a condition of approval of the application, the port director may order an inquiry by a Customs officer into:

      (1) The qualifications, character, and experience of an operator and/or grantee and their principal officers; and

      (2) The security, suitability, and fitness of the facility to receive merchandise in a zone status.

      (d)  The port director shall promptly notify the applicant in writing of his decision to approve or deny the application to activate the zone. If the application is denied, the notification will state the grounds for denial which need not be limited to those listed in § 146.82. The decision of the port director will be the final Customs administrative determination in the matter. On approval of the application, a Foreign Trade Zone Operator's Bond shall be executed on Customs Form 301, containing the bond conditions of § 113.73 of this chapter.

      (e)  Upon the port director's approval of the application and acceptance of the executed bond, the zone or zone site will be considered activated; and merchandise may be admitted to the zone. Execution of the bond by an operator does not lessen the liability of the grantee to comply with the Act and implementing regulations.

#### § § 146.7

      (a)  An operator shall make written application to the port director for approval of an alteration of an activated area, including an alteration resulting from a zone boundary modification. The application must be accompanied by the supporting document requirements specified in § 146.6, as applicable. The port director may review the security, suitability, and fitness of the area, and shall reply to the applicant as provided for in § 146.6.

      (b)  A grantee, or an operator with the concurrence of a grantee, shall make written application to the port director for deactivation of a zone site, indicating by layout or blueprint the exact site to be deactivated. The port director shall not approve the application unless all merchandise in the site in zone status (other than domestic status) has been removed at the risk and expense of the operator. The port director may require an accounting of all merchandise in a zone as a condition of approving the deactivation. A zone may be reactivated using the above procedure if a sufficient bond is on file under § 146.6(d).

      (c)  When approval of an activated status has been suspended through the procedure in subpart G, the port director may require all goods in that area in zone status (other than domestic status) to be transferred to another zone, a bonded warehouse, or other location where they may lawfully be stored, if the port director considers that transfer advisable to protect the revenue or administer any Federal law or regulation.

      (d)  The port director may require an operator to furnish, on 10 days notice, a new Foreign Trade Zone Operator's Bond on Customs Form 301. If the operator fails to furnish the new bond, no more merchandise will be received in the zone in zone status. Merchandise in zone status (other than domestic status) will be removed at the risk and expense of the operator. A new bond may be required if (1) the activated zone area is substantially altered; (2) the character of merchandise admitted to the zone or operations performed in the zone are substantially changed; (3) the existing bond lacks good and sufficient surety; or (4) for any other reason that substantially affects the liability of the operator under the bond. Although a new bond may not be required, the operator shall obtain the consent of the surety to any material alteration in the boundaries of the zone.

      (e)  A grantee of an activated zone site shall make written application to the port director for approval of a new operator, submitting with the application a certification by the new operator that the inventory control and recordkeeping system meets the requirements of subpart B, and a copy of the system procedures manual if different from the previous operator's manual. The port director may order an inquiry into the qualifications, character, and experience of the operator and its principal officers.

      (f) The bond in § 146.6 shall be submitted by the operator before the operating agreement may become effective in respect to merchandise in zone status. The port director shall promptly notify the grantee, in writing, of the approval or disapproval of the application.

      (g)  The port director may make a written demand upon the operator to submit, within 30 days after the date of the demand, a written list of the names, addresses, social security numbers, and dates and places of birth of officers and persons having a direct or indirect financial interest in the operator, and of persons employed in the carriage, receipt or delivery of merchandise in zone status, whether employed by the zone operator or a zone user. If a list was previously furnished, the port director may make a written demand for the same information in respect to new persons employed in the carriage, receipt, or delivery of zone status merchandise within 10 days after such employment. The list need not include employees of common or contract carriers transporting goods to or from the zone.

      § 146.8   Seals, authority of operator to break and affix.

#### § § 146.8

      The port director may authorize an operator to break a Customs in-bond seal affixed under § 18.4 of this chapter, or under any Customs order or directive, on any vehicle or intermodal container containing merchandise approved for admission to the zone upon its arrival at the zone; or to affix a Customs in-bond seal to any vehicle or intermodal container of merchandise for which an entry, withdrawal, or other approval document has been obtained for movement in-bond from the zone. The authorized affixing or breaking of that seal will be considered to have been done under Customs supervision. The operator shall report to the port director, upon arrival of the vehicle or container at the zone, any seal found to be broken, missing, or improperly affixed, and hold the vehicle or container and its contents intact pending instructions from the port director. If the operator does not obtain the written concurrence of the carrier as to the condition of the seal or delivering conveyance, the port director shall deem the seal or delivering conveyance to be intact.

      § 146.9   Permission of operator.

#### § § 146.9

      An application for permission to admit merchandise into a zone, or to manipulate, manufacture, exhibit, or destroy merchandise in a zone must include the written concurrence of the operator, except where the regulations of this part provide for the making of application by the operator itself or where the operator files a separate specific or blanket application. The written concurrence of the operator in the removal of merchandise from a zone is not required because the merchandise is released by the port director to the operator for delivery from the zone, as provided in § 146.71 (a).

      § 146.10   Authority to examine merchandise.

#### § § 146.10

      (5)  The port director may require additional information or documentation as needed to conduct an examination of merchandise under Customs selective entry processing criteria, or to determine whether the merchandise is admissible to the zone.

      (c)  The port director will issue a permit for admission of merchandise to a zone when:

      (1) The application is properly executed and includes the zone status desired for the merchandise, as provided in subpart D of this part;

      (2) The operator's approval appears either on the application or in a separate specific or blanket approval;

      (3) The merchandise is retained for examination at the place of unlading, the zone, or other location designated by the port director, except for merchandise for direct delivery to a zone under §§ 146.39 and 146.40.

      (2) Shipments which are destined to the same zone applicant on a single business day, in which case the applicant shall:

      (i) Present the examination invoices required by paragraph (b) of this section to the port director before the merchadise is admitted into the zone,

      (ii) Have been approved for the direct transmittal of statistical trade information to the Bureau of Census under an agreement with that agency; and

#### § § 146.35

      (a)  Temporary deposit of merchandise in a zone is allowed in circumstances where the information or documentation necessary to complete the Customs Form 214 is not available at the time of arrival of merchandise within the jurisdiction of the port. The merchandise will be subject to examination as provided in § 146.36.

      (b)  An application for temporary deposit will be made to the port director on a properly signed and uniquely numbered Customs Form 214, annotated clearly “Temporary Deposit in a Zone”.

      (c)  Merchandise temporarily deposited under the provisions of this section has no zone status and is considered to be in the Customs territory. It will:

      (1) Be physically segregated from all other zone merchandise;

      (2) Be held under the bond and at the risk of the operator; and

      (3) Be manipulated only to the extent necessary to obtain sufficient information about the merchandise to file the appropriate admission or entry documentation.

      § 146.36   Examination of merchandise.

#### § § 146.36

      Except for direct delivery procedures provided for in § 146.39, all merchandise covered by a Customs Form 214 may be retained for Customs examination at the place of unlading, the zone, or another location, as designated by the port director. The port director may authorize release of the merchandise without examination, as provided in § 151.2 of this chapter. If a physical examination is conducted, the Customs officer shall note the results of the examination on the examination invoices.

      § 146.37   Operator admission responsibilities.

#### § § 146.37

      (a)  The operator shall maintain either:

The lot file will be maintained in sequential order by using the unique number assigned to each Customs Form 214 as the file reference number; or

      (2)  Where a Customs authorized inventory method other than a lot system (specific identification of merchandise) is used, e.g., First-In-First-Out (FIFO), no lot file is required but the operator shall maintain a file of all Customs Form's 214 in sequential order.

      (b)  The operator shall give a copy of the examination invoice to the person making entry to transfer the merchandise from the zone upon request of that person or the port director.

      (c)  The operator will be held liable under its bond for the receipt of merchandise admitted in the quantity and condition as described on the Customs Form 214, except as modified by a discrepancy report:

      (1) Signed jointly by the operator and carrier on the Customs Form 214 or other approved form within 15 days after admission of the merchandise, and reported to the port director within 2 working days thereafter; or

      (2) Submitted on Customs Form 5931 under the provisions of subpart A, part 158, of this chapter within 20 days after admission of the merchandise. The operator may file a Customs Form 5931 on behalf of the person who applied for admission of merchandise to the zone.

      (d)  The port director may authorize the receipt of zone status merchandise at a zone without physical supervision by a Customs officer (see § 146.3). In that case, the operator shall supervise the receipt of merchandise into the zone, report the receipt and condition of the merchandise, and mark packages with the unique Customs Form 214 number so that the merchandise can be traced to a particular Customs Form 214. Packages that are accounted for under a Customs-authorized inventory method other than specific identification, need not be marked with a unique Customs Form 214 number but must be adequately identified so Customs can conduct an inventory count. The operator shall submit the Custom Form 214 to Customs at the location specified by the port director.

      § 146.38   Certificate of arrival of merchandise.

#### § § 146.38

      Whenever a certificate prepared by Customs as to the arrival of any merchandise in a zone is required by a Federal agency, the port director shall issue the document certifying only that authorization to deliver the merchandise to a zone has been made. The operator shall issue a certificate of arrival of merchandise at a zone.

      § 146.39   Direct delivery procedures.

#### § § 146.39

      (a)  This procedure is for delivery of merchandise to a zone without prior application and approval on Customs Form 214.

      (b)  An operator, meeting the criteria of paragraph (c) of this section, shall file a written application with the port director at least 30 days before the special procedure is to become effective. The application will describe the merchandise to be handled or processed, and the kind of operation which it will undergo in the zone.

      (c)  The port director shall approve the application if the following criteria are met:

      (1) The merchandise is not restricted or of a type which requires Customs examination or documentation review before or upon its arrival at the zone;

      (2) The merchandise to be admitted to the zone, and the operations to be conducted therein, are known well in advance, are predictable and stable over the long term, and are relatively fixed in variety by the nature of the business conducted at the site; and

      (3) The operator is the owner or purchaser of the goods.

      (d)  The port director shall promptly notify the operator, in writing, of Customs decision on the application. If the application is denied, the port director shall specify the reason for denial in his reply. The port director's decision will constitute the final Customs administrative determination concerning the application.

      (e)  The port director may revoke the approval given under this section if it becomes necessary for Customs routinely to examine the merchandise or documentation before or upon admission to the zone.

      § 146.40   Operator responsibilities for direct delivery.

#### § § 146.40

      (a)  Upon arrival at a subzone or zone site of a conveyance containing foreign merchandise, the operator shall:

      (1) Collect in-bond or cartage documentation from the carrier;

      (2) Check the condition of any seal affixed to the conveyance, and if broken, missing or improperly affixed, notify the port director and receive instructions before unloading the merchandise;

      (3) Check each incoming in-bond and cartage shipment to determine if the manifested quantity or the quantity on the cartage document agrees with the quantity actually received;

      (4) Sign and date the in-bond or cartage documentation to accept responsibility for the merchandise under the Foreign Trade Zone Operator's Bond and to relieve the carrier of responsibility.

      (5) Forward the in-bond or cartage documentation so as to reach the port director within 2 working days after the date of arrival of the conveyance at the subzone or zone site;

      (6) Maintain a file of open in-bond manifests in chronological order of date of conveyance arrival to identify shipments that have arrived but the entire contents of which have not been admitted to the subzone or zone site; and

      (7) Notify the port director, by annotation on the Customs Form 214, when the entire contents of a shipment have been admitted.

      (b)  If merchandise is transported to a subzone or zone site by the foreign trade zone operator from a location in the district (see definition of “district” at § 112.1) in which the subzone or zone site is situated, the merchandise is deemed admitted at the time the foreign trade zone operator picks it up. At the time of pick-up, the operator is responsible for:

      (1) Receipting for the merchandise and recording on the appropriate document any discrepancies regarding quantity, condition or the status of the seals;

      (2) Transporting the merchandise to the zone or subzone; and

      (3) Ensuring that the zone records reflect that the merchandise is received in the zone.

      (c) —(1)  If the operator has an agreement with the Bureau of Census for direct transmittal of statistical information, he shall submit to the port director each business day a properly signed and uniquely numbered Customs Form 214 listing all merchandise except for domestic status merchandise admitted under § 146.43 recorded into the inventory control and recordkeeping system during the previous business day. The Customs Form 214 must contain a list of all in-bond (I.T.) numbers or the unique number of any cartage document, as well as the number of invoices for each I.T. or cartage document, pertaining to merchandise which has been entered into the system.

      (2)  If a cumulative Customs Form 214 is not submitted as provided in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the operator shall file with the port director each business day an individual Customs Form 214 and 214-A covering each shipment recorded into the inventory control and recordkeeping system during the previous business day. The forms shall be submitted within 10 days after the end of the month in which the merchandise was received in the zone, and no extension beyond that time will be approved by the port director.

      (3)  Merchandise not admitted into a subzone or zone site as provided in this section within 15 calendar days after its arrival there shall be disposed of in accordance with the applicable procedures in § 4.37 or § 122.50 or § 123.10 of this chapter.

      (4)  The operator shall establish and maintain a continuing input quality control program to ensure that information concerning merchandise in admission documents, verified or corrected by counts and checks, is accurately recorded in the inventory control and recordkeeping system. Quantities recorded in the system, after allowance by the port director for any discrepancies, will be the quantities of merchandise for which the operator shall be held liable under its bond for admission to the subzone or zone site. A discrepancy involving a within-case shortage (or overage) need not be reported on Customs Form 5931, if the operator is able to report that information in another manner so that the port director can determine whether there is liability for the discrepancy under the bond of any party to the importation.

#### § § 146.44

      (a)  Merchandise taken into a zone for the sole purpose of exportation, destruction (except destruction of distilled spirits, wines, and fermented malt liquors), or storage will be given zone-restricted status on proper application. That status may be requested at any time the merchandise is located in a zone, but cannot be abandoned once granted. Merchandise in zone-restricted status may not be removed to Customs territory for domestic consumption except where the Board determines the return to be in the public interest.

      (b)  Application for zone-restricted status will be made on Customs Form 214.

      (c) —(1)  If the applicant desires a zone-restricted status in order that the merchandise may be considered exported for the purpose of any Customs law, all pertinent Customs requirements relating to an actual exportation shall be complied with as though the admission of the merchandise into zone constituted a lading on an exporting carrier at a port of final exit from the U.S. Any declaration or form required for actual exportation will be modified to show the merchandise has been deposited in a zone in lieu of actual exportation, and a copy of the approved Customs Form 214 may be accepted in lieu of any proof of shipment required in cases of actual exportation.

      (2)  If the merchandise is to be considered exported for the purpose of any Federal law other than the Customs laws, the port director shall be satisfied that all pertinent laws, regulations, and rules administered by the Federal agency concerned have been complied with before the Customs Form 214 is approved.

      (d)  Merchandise entered for warehousing and transferred to a zone, other than temporarily for manipulation and return to Customs territory as provided for in § 146.33, will have the status of zone-restricted merchandise when admitted into the zone. The application on Customs Form 214 will state that zone-restricted status is desired for the merchandise.

    Subpart E—Handling of Merchandise in a Zone

      § 146.51   Customs control of merchandise.

#### § § 146.51

      No merchandise, other than domestic status merchandise provided for in § 146.43, will be manipulated, manufactured, exhibited, destroyed, or transferred from a zone in any manner or for any purpose, except under Customs permit as provided for in this part.

      § 146.52   Manipulation, manufacture, exhibition or destruction; Customs Form 216.

#### § § 146.52

      (a)  Prior to any action, the operator shall file with the port director an application (or blanket application) on Customs Form 216 for permission to manipulate, manufacture, exhibit, or destroy merchandise in a zone. After Customs approves the application (or blanket application), the operator will retain in his recordkeeping system the approved application.

      (b)  (1) The port director shall approve the application unless (i) the proposed operation would be in violation of law or regulation; (ii) the place designated for its performance is not suitable for preventing confusion of the identity or status of the merchandise, or for safeguarding the revenue; (iii) the port director is not satisfied that the destruction will be effective; or (iv) the Executive Secretary of the Board has not granted approval of a new manufacturing operation.

      (2) The port director is authorized to approve a blanket application for a period of up to one year for a continuous or repetitive operation. The port director may disapprove or revoke approval of any application, or may require the operator to file an individual application.

      (c)  If an approved application is subsequently rescinded by the port director for any reason, the applicant or grantee may appeal the adverse ruling pursuant to the hearing provisions of § 146.82(b)(2). The rescission shall remain in effect pending the decision on the appeal.

      (d) —(1)  The operator shall report on Customs Form 216 the results of an approved manipulation, manufacture, exhibition, or certification of destruction (other than by a blanket application), unless the port director chooses physically to supervise the operation.

      (2)  The operator shall maintain a record of an approved manipulation, manufacture, exhibition, or certification of destruction, in its inventory control and recordkeeping system so as to provide an accounting and audit trail of the merchandise through the approved operation.

      (e)  The port director may permit destruction to be done outside the zone, in whole or in part and at the risk and expense of the applicant, and under such conditions as are necessary to protect the revenue, if proper destruction cannot be accomplished within the zone. Any residue from the destruction within a zone, which is determined to be without commercial value, may be removed to Customs territory for disposal.

      § 146.53   Shortages and overages.

      (2) Merchandise not properly admitted to the zone; or

      (3) Shortage of one percent (1%) or more of the quantity of merchandise in a lot or covered by a unique identifier, if the missing merchandise would have been subject to duties and taxes of $100 or more upon entry into the Customs territory. The operator shall record upon identification all shortages and overages, whether or not they are required to be reported to the port director at that time, in its inventory control and recordkeeping system. The operator shall record all shortages and overages as required in the annual reconciliation report under § 146.25.

      (b)  Except in a case of theft or suspected theft, the operator need not file a report with the port director, or note in the annual reconciliation report, any shortage or overage concerning domestic status merchandise for which no permit is required.

      (c) —(1)  The operator is responsible under its Foreign Trade Zone Operator's Bond for any loss of merchandise or for any merchandise which cannot be located or otherwise accounted for (except domestic status merchandise for which no permit is required), unless the port director is satisfied that the merchandise was:

      (i) Never received in the zone;

      (ii) Removed from the zone under proper permit;

      (iii) Not removed from the zone; or

      (iv) Lost or destroyed in the zone through fire or other casualty, evaporation, spillage, leakage, absorption, or similar cause, and did not enter the commerce of the U.S.

      (2)  Upon demand of the port director, the operator shall make entry for and pay duties and taxes applicable to merchandise which is missing or otherwise not accounted for.

      (d)  The person with the right to make entry shall file, within 5 days after identification of an overage, an application for admission of the merchandise to the zone on Customs Form 214 or file a Customs entry for the merchandise. If a Customs Form 214 or a Customs entry is not timely filed, and the port director has not granted an extension of the time provided, the merchandise shall be sent to general order.

      (e)  The liability of the operator under its Foreign Trade Zone Operator's Bond may be adjusted for the loss of value resulting from damage to merchandise occurring in the zone. The operator shall segregate, mark, and otherwise secure damaged merchandise to preserve its identity as damaged merchandise.

    Subpart F—Transfer of Merchandise From a Zone

      § 146.61   Constructive transfer to Customs territory.

#### § § 146.61

      The port director shall accept receipt of any entry in proper form provided under this subpart, and the merchandise described therein will be considered to have been constructively transferred to Customs territory at that time, even though the merchandise remains physically in the zone. If the entry is thereafter rejected or cancelled, the merchandise will be considered at that time to be constructively transferred back into the zone in its previous zone status.

      § 146.62   Entry.

#### § § 146.62

      (a)  Entry for foreign merchandise that is to be transferred from a zone, or removed from a zone for exportation or transportation to another port, for consumption or warehouse, will be made by filing an in-bond application pursuant to part 18 of this chapter, CBP Form 3461, CBP Form 7501, or other applicable CBP forms. If entry is made on CBP Form 3461, the person making entry shall file an entry summary for all the merchandise covered by the CBP Form 3461 within 10 business days after the time of entry.

      (b)  (1) Customs Form 7501, or its electronic equivalent, or the entry summary will be accompanied by the entry documentation, including invoices as provided in parts 141 and 142 of this chapter. The person with the right to make entry shall submit any other supporting documents required by law or regulations that relate to the transferred merchandise and provide the information necessary to support the admissibility, the declared values, quantity, and classification of the merchandise. If the declared values are predicated on estimates or estimated costs, that information must be clearly stated in writing at the time an entry or entry summary is filed.

      (2) An in-bond application for merchandise to be transferred to another port or zone or for exportation must provide that the merchandise covered is foreign trade zone merchandise; give the number of the zone from which the merchandise was transferred; state the status of the merchandise; and, if applicable, bear the notation or endorsement provided for in § 146.64(c), § 146.66(b), or § 146.70(c).

      (c)  The port director may waive presentation of an invoice and supporting documentation required in paragraph (b) of this section with the entry or entry summary, if satisfied that presentation of those documents would be impractical, and the person making entry or the operator either files invoices and supporting documentation with the port director or maintains and makes those records available for examination by Customs.

      § 146.63   Entry for consumption.

#### § § 146.63

      (a)  Merchandise in foreign status or composed in part of merchandise in foreign status may be entered for consumption from a zone.

      (b)  Merchandise in a zone-restricted status may be entered for consumption only when the Board has ruled that merchandise can be entered for consumption.

      (c) —(1)  When merchandise is manufactured or otherwise changed in a zone (exclusive of packing) to its physical condition as entered within 24 hours before physical transfer from the zone for consumption, the port director may allow the person making entry to file an entry on Customs Form 3461, or its electronic equivalent, for the estimated removals of merchandise during the calendar week. The Customs Form 3461, or its electronic equivalent, must be accompanied by a  invoice or schedule showing the number of units of each type of merchandise to be removed during the week and their zone and dutiable values. Merchandise covered by an entry made under the provisions of this section will be considered to be entered and may be removed only when the port director has accepted the entry on Customs Form 3461, or its electronic equivalent. If the actual removals will exceed the estimate for the week, the person making entry shall file an additional Customs Form 3461, or its electronic equivalent, to cover the additional units before their removal from the zone. Notwithstanding that a weekly entry may be allowed, all merchandise will be dutiable as provided in § 146.65. When estimated removals exceed actual removals, that excess merchandise will not be considered to have been entered or constructively transferred to the Customs territory.

      (2)  After acceptance of the weekly entry, individual transfers of merchandise covered by the entry may be made from the zone.

      (d)  Subject to the existing statutory authority of the Board, textiles and textile products admitted into a zone, regardless of whether the merchandise has privileged or nonprivileged foreign status, which would have been subject to quota or visa or export license requirements in their condition at the time of importation (if entered for consumption rather than admitted to a zone), may not be subsequently transferred into Customs territory for consumption if, during the time the merchandise is in the zone, there has been a change by manipulation, manufacture, or other means:

      (1) In the country of origin of the merchandise as defined by § 102.21 or § 102.22 of this chapter, as applicable;

      (2) To exempt from quota or visa or export license requirements other than a change brought about by statute, treaty, executive order or Presidential proclamation; or

      (3) From one textile category to another textile category.

      § 146.64   Entry for warehouse.

#### § § 146.64

      (a)  Merchandise in privileged foreign status or composed in part of merchandise in privileged foreign status may not be entered for warehouse from a zone. Merchandise in nonprivileged foreign status containing no components in privileged foreign status may be entered for warehouse in the same or at a different port.

      (b)  Foreign merchandise in zone-restricted status may be entered for warehouse in the same or at a different port only for storage pending exportation, unless the Board has approved another disposition.

      (c)  Textiles and textile products which have been changed as provided for in § 146.63(d) may be entered for warehouse only if the entry is endorsed by the port director to show that the merchandise may not be withdrawn for consumption.

      (d)  Merchandise may neither be placed nor remain in a Customs bonded warehouse after 5 years from the date of importation of the merchandise.

      § 146.65   Classification, valuation, and liquidation.

#### § § 146.65

      (a) —(1)  Privileged foreign merchandise provided for in this section will be subject to tariff classification according to its character, condition and quantity, at the rate of duty and tax in force on the date of filing, in complete and proper form, the application for privileged status. _Classification_ of merchandise subject to a tariff-rate import quota will be made only at the higher non-quota duty rate in effect on the date privileged foreign status was granted. Notwithstanding the grant of privileged status, Customs may correct any misclassification of any such entered merchandise when it posts the bulletin notice of liquidation under § 159.9 of this chapter.

      (2)  Nonprivileged foreign merchandise provided for in this section will be subject to tariff classification in accordance with its character, condition and quantity as constructively transferred to Customs territory at the time the entry or entry summary is filed with Customs.

      (b) —(1)  The total zone value of merchandise provided for in this section will be determined in accordance with the principles of valuation contained in sections 402 and 500 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended by the Trade Agreements Act of 1979 (19 U.S.C. 1401a, 1500). The total zone value shall be that price actually paid or payable to the zone seller in the transaction that caused the merchandise to be transferred from the zone. Where there is no price paid or payable, the total zone value shall be the cost of all materials and zone processing costs related to the merchandise transferred from the zone.

      (2)  The dutiable value of merchandise provided for in this section shall be the price actually paid or payable for the merchandise in the transaction that caused the merchandise to be admitted into the zone, plus the statutory additions contained in section 402(b)(1) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended by the Trade Agreements Act of 1979 (19 U.S.C. 1401a(b)(1)), less, if included, international shipment and insurance costs and U.S. inland freight costs. If there is no such price actually paid or payable, or no reasonable representation of that cost or of the statutory additions, the dutiable value may be determined by excluding from the zone value any included zone costs of processing or fabrication, general expenses and profit and the international shipment and insurance costs and U.S. inland freight costs related to the merchandise transferred from the zone. The dutiable value of recoverable waste or scrap provided for in § 146.42(b) will be the price actually paid or payable to the zone seller in the transaction that caused the recoverable waste or scrap to be transferred from the zone.

      (3)  An allowance in the dutiable value of zone merchandise may be made by the Center director in accordance with the provisions of subparts B and C of part 158 of this chapter, for damage, deterioration, or casualty while the merchandise is in the zone.

      (c)  When the declared value or values of the merchandise are based on an estimate or estimates, the person making entry may request an extension of liquidation pending the presentation of updated or actual cost data. A request for an extension may be granted at the discretion of the Center director.

      (ii) A certification by the operator of the transferring zone that the statement in paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section is true and the information therein is contained in the inventory control and recordkeeping system of the zone.

      (5) The operator of the transferring zone shall transmit the historical documentation of the merchandise to the receiving zone within 10 working days after it has been delivered to the bonded carrier for transportation. The documentation will be referenced to the I.T. number covering the merchandise.

      (d)  Upon arrival of the merchandise at the destination zone, it will be admitted under the procedure provided for in § 146.32, except that no invoice or Customs examination will be required. When the historical documentation is received, the operator of the destination zone shall associate it with the CBP Form 214 for admission of the merchandise and incorporate that information into the zone inventory control and recordkeeping system.

      (e)  Merchandise produced or manufactured in a zone and exported without having been transferred to Customs territory other than for exportation or for transportation and exportation will be subject, on its return to Customs territory, to the duties and taxes applicable to like articles of wholly foreign origin, unless it is conclusively established that it was produced or manufactured exclusively with the use of domestic merchandise. The identity of the domestic merchandise must have been maintained in accordance with the provisions of this part, in which case that merchandise will be subject to the provisions of Chapter 98, Subchapter I, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (19 U.S.C. 1202).

The application will be made by filing an in-bond application pursuant to part 18 of this chapter. The in-bond application must provide invoice or schedule information like that required in § 146.63(c)(1). If actual transfers will exceed the estimate for the week, the person with the right to make entry must file a supplemental in-bond application to cover the additional merchandise to be transferred from the subzone or zone site. No merchandise covered by the weekly permit may be transferred from the zone before approval of the application by the port director.

      (b)  After approval of the application for a weekly permit by the port director, the person making entry will be authorized to file individual in-bond applications for exportation, transportation, or transportation and exportation of the merchandise covered by permit. Upon transfer of the merchandise, the carrier must update the in-bond record via a CBP-approved EDI system to ensure its assumption of liability under the carrier's or cartman's bond. CBP will consider the time of entry to be when the removing carrier updates the in-bond record.

      (c)  The person making entry for merchandise under an approved weekly permit must file with the port director, by the close of business on the second business day of the week following the week designated on the permit, a statement of the merchandise entered under that permit.

      (b)  When a transfer is not physically supervised by a Customs officer, the operator will be relieved of responsibility only for the merchandise in a zone in the condition and quantity as shown on the entry, withdrawal, or other appropriate form. The operator will be relieved of responsibility only if it receives the signed receipt on the document of the importer or the carrier named in that document. The responsibility of the operator may be adjusted by any discrepancy report made jointly by the operator and the bonded cartman, lighterman, or carrier, or the importer, and signed by the above or an authorized representative within 15 days after transfer of the merchandise from the zone. Any adjustment must be noted on the permit copy of the entry, withdrawal, or other appropriate form or document. A copy of any joint report of discrepancy must be submitted to the port director within 10 working days of signing by the parties.

      (c)  Except in the case of articles for use in a zone, merchandise for which a Customs permit for transfer to Customs territory has been issued must be physically removed from the zone within 5 working days of issuance of that permit. The port director, upon request of the operator, may extend that period for good cause. Merchandise awaiting removal within the required time limit will not be further manipulated or manufactured in the zone, but will be segregated or otherwise identified by the operator as merchandise that has been constructively transferred to Customs territory.

      (d)  (1) The port director shall cancel any entry for consumption where: (i) The merchandise is not removed from the zone within the period specified in paragraph (c) of this section, or (ii) the merchandise was removed from the zone but did not enter the commerce of the U.S. in Customs territory and was subsequently readmitted to a zone in domestic status. If the port director has reason to believe any new entry would be cancelled under the provisions of this paragraph, he may reject the entry or demand a written stipulation, as a condition of entry acceptance, that the merchandise will not be returned to a zone in domestic status. Merchandise covered by an entry which has been cancelled under this paragraph shall be restored to its last foreign status.

      (2) A component of merchandise which has been entered, but not physically removed from a zone, shall be restored to its last zone status, provided the port director determines that the component was included in the entry through clerical error, mistake of fact, or other inadvertence not amounting to an error in the construction of the law. Such an error, including that in appraisement of any entry or liquidation due to the above circumstances, may be corrected pursuant to section 520(c)(1), Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1520(c)(1)), in accordance with the procedures described in part 173 of this chapter. If the port director decides there has been no error, mistake, or inadvertence, or that the information was not timely provided, the component will be considered as an overage and subject to the provisions of § 146.53(d).

      (3) When merchandise which has been entered for consumption is subsequently returned to a zone for a reason other than that specified in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, it shall be admitted in domestic status.

    Subpart G—Penalties; Suspension; Revocation

      § 146.81   Penalties.

#### § § 146.81

      (a)  Upon violation of the Act, or any regulation issued under the Act, by the grantee, or any officer, agent, operator or employee thereof, the person responsible for or permitting the violation shall be subject to a fine of not more than $1,000. Each day during which a violation continues will constitute a separate offense. Liquidated damages, where applicable, will be imposed in addition to the fine (19 U.S.C. 81s).

      (b)  All fines assessed by the port director under this section will be reviewed by the Assistant Commissioner, Office of International Trade, or his designee, Headquarters, to determine whether further action against the grantee or operator, such as suspension or a recommendation for revocation of the grant, is warranted.

> [T.D. 86-16, 51 FR 5049, Feb. 11, 1986, as amended by T.D. 91-77, 56 FR 46115, Sept. 10, 1991]

      § 146.82   Suspension.

#### § § 146.82

      (a)  The port director may suspend for cause the activated status of a zone or zone site, or the privilege to admit, manufacture, manipulate, exhibit, destroy, transfer or remove merchandise at a zone or zone site for a period not to exceed 90 days. Upon order of the Board the suspension may be continued. If appropriate, the suspension may be limited to an individual user or users and not to the zone or zone site as a whole, or may be limited to a particular activity of an operator or user, such as suspension of the privilege to admit merchandise or the privilege to manufacture. An action to suspend will be taken in accordance with the procedure in paragraph (b) of this section if:

      (1) The approval of the application to activate the zone was obtained through fraud or the misstatement of a material fact;

      (2) The operator neglects or refuses to obey any proper order of a Customs officer or any Customs order, rule, or regulation relating to the operation or administration of a zone;

      (3) The operator, or any officer of a corporation which has been granted the right to operate a zone, is convicted of or has commited acts which would constitute a felony, or misdemeanor involving theft, smuggling, or a theft-connected crime. Any change in the employment status of the corporate officer (e.g., discharge, resignation, demotion, or promotion) prior to conviction of a felony or prior to conviction of a misdemeanor involving theft, smuggling, or a theft-connected crime, resulting from acts committed while a corporate officer, will not preclude application of this provision;

      (4) The operator fails to furnish a current list of names, addresses, or other information as required by § 146.7;

      (5) The operator does not provide a secure facility or properly safeguard merchandise within a zone;

      (6) [Reserved]

      (7) The operator, or any officer, agent, or employee of the operator, discloses to an unauthorized person proprietary information contained on a Customs form or in the inventory control and recordkeeping system; or

      (8) The inventory control and recordkeeping system is impaired to the point where the identity of merchandise in zone status has been lost and cannot be reestablished without a suspension of zone operations.

      (b) —(1)  The port director may, at any time, serve notice, in writing, upon an operator to show cause why its right to continue operation of a zone should not be suspended or why an individual user or activities of an individual user should not be suspended, as provided for in paragraph (a) of this section. The notice will advise the operator of the grounds for the proposed action and will afford the operator an opportunity to respond, in writing, within 15 days after receipt of the notice. Thereafter, the port director shall consider the allegations and any response made by the operator and issue a decision, unless the operator requests a hearing in the matter.

      (2)  If the operator requests a hearing, it will be held before a hearing officer designated by the Commissioner of Customs or his designee within 30 days following the operator's request. The operator may be represented by counsel at the hearing, and any evidence and testimony of witnesses in the proceeding, including substantiation of the allegations and the response thereto, will be presented. The right of cross-examination will be available to both parties. A stenographic record of the proceeding will be made and a copy will be delivered to the operator. At the conclusion of the hearing, the hearing officer shall transmit promptly all papers and the stenographic record of the hearing to the Assistant Commissioner, Office of Field Operations, or designee, together with a recommendation for final action.

      (3)  Within 10 calendar days after delivery to the operator of a copy of the stenographic record of the hearing, the operator may submit to the Assistant Commissioner, Office of Field Operations, or designee, in writing any additional views or arguments. The Assistant Commissioner, Office of Field Operations, or designee, shall then render a written decision stating his reasons therefor. That decision will be served on the operator and will be considered the final Customs administrative action in the case.

      (4)  If the grantee of the zone is not the operator, a copy of the notice to show cause will be served upon the grantee. The grantee, as a party-in-interest, may join the operator in any proceedings under this section.

      § 146.83   Revocation of zone grant.

#### § § 146.83

      (a)  The port director may at any time recommend to the Board that the privilege of establishing, operating, and maintaining a zone or subzone under CBP jurisdiction be revoked for willful and repeated violations of the Act (19 U.S.C. 81r). If the port director believes that a substantial question of law exists as to whether willful and repeated violations of the Act have occurred, that officer may request internal advice under the provisions of part 177 of this chapter from the Executive Director, Regulations and Rulings, Office of International Trade, Headquarters. A recommendation to the Board that a zone or subzone grant be revoked does not preclude, and may be in addition to, any liquidated damages, penalty, or suspension for cause.

      (b)  The procedure for revocation of a grant, the decision of the Board, and appeal is covered by the provisions of the Act and title 15, chapter IV, part 400, Code of Federal Regulations.

    Subpart H—Petroleum Refineries in Foreign-Trade Subzones

**Source:** Source: T.D. 95-35, 60 FR 20632, Apr. 27, 1995, unless otherwise noted.

      § 146.91   Applicability.

#### § § 146.91

      This subpart applies only to a petroleum refinery (as defined herein) engaged in refining petroleum in a foreign-trade zone or subzone. Further, the provisions relating to zones generally, which are set forth elsewhere in this part, including documentation and document retention requirements, and entry procedures, such as weekly entry, shall apply as well to a refinery subzone, insofar as applicable to and not inconsistent with the specific provisions of this subpart. It does not cover zone-to-zone transfers in which the fact of removal from one zone is ignored.

      § 146.92   Definitions.

#### § § 146.92

      (a)  “Attribution” means the association of a final product with its source material.

      (b)  “Feedstocks” means crude petroleum or intermediate product that is used in a petroleum refinery to make a final product.

      (c)  “Feedstock factor” means the relative value of final products utilizing T.D. 66-16 (see § 146.92(h)), and which takes into account any volumetric loss or gain.

      (d)  “Final product” means any petroleum product that is produced in a refinery subzone and thereafter removed therefrom or consumed within the zone.

      (e)  “Manufacturing period” means a period selected by the refiner which must be no more than a calendar month basis, for which attribution to a source feedstock must be made for every final product made, consumed in, or removed from the refinery subzone.

      (f)  “Petroleum refinery” means a facility that refines a feedstock listed on the top line of the tables set forth in T.D. 66-16 into a product listed in the left column of the tables set forth in T.D. 66-16.

      (g)  “Price of product” means the average per unit market value of each final product for a given manufacturing period or the published standard product value if updated each month.

      (h)  “Producibility” is a method of attributing products to feedstocks for petroleum manufacturing in accordance with the Industry Standards of Potential Production set forth in T.D. 66-16.

      (i)  “Relative value” means a value assigned to each final product attributed to the separation from a privileged foreign feedstock based on the ratio of the final product's value compared to the privileged foreign feedstock's duty.

      (j)  “Time of separation” means the manufacturing period in which a privileged foreign status feedstock is deemed to have been separated into two or more final products.

      (k)  “Weighted average” means the relative value of merchandise, which is determined by dividing the total value of shipments in a given period by the total quantity shipped in the same given period. See example in section VI of the appendix to this part.

      § 146.93   Inventory control and recordkeeping system.

#### § § 146.93

      (a)  All final products removed from or consumed within a petroleum refinery subzone must be attributed to feedstock admitted into said petroleum refinery subzone in the current or prior manufacturing period. Attribution must be based on records maintained by the operator. Attribution may be made by applying one of the authorized methods set forth in this section. Records must be maintained on a weight or volume basis.

      (1)  The producibility method of attribution requires that records be kept to attribute final products to feedstocks which are eligible for attribution as set forth in this section during the current or prior manufacturing period.

      (2)  An operator may use its actual production records as provided for under § 146.95(b) of this subpart.

      (3)  An operator may use the FIFO (first-in, first-out) method of accounting (see § 191.22(c) of this chapter). The use of this method is illustrated in the appendix to this part.

      (b)  Only a feedstock that has been admitted into the refinery subzone is eligible for attribution. For a given manufacturing period, the quantity of feedstock eligible for attribution may be computed as beginning inventory, plus receipts less shipments of feedstock out of the subzone, and less ending inventory.

      (c)  Each final product that is consumed in or removed from a refinery subzone must be attributed to a feedstock eligible for attribution during the current or a prior manufacturing period. Each final product attributed as being produced from the separation of a privileged foreign status feedstock must be assigned the proper relative value as set forth in paragraph (d) of this section.

      (d)  A relative value calculation is required when two or more final products are produced as the result of the separation of privileged foreign status feedstock. Ad valorem and compound rates of duty must be converted to specific rates of duty in order to make a relative value calculation.

      (e)  Nonprivileged status feedstock is eligible for privileged status only if the request shows to the satisfaction of the Customs Service that there was no manipulation or manufacture of the feedstock to change its tariff classification before the request is granted. The absence of such manipulation or manufacture can be shown by demonstrating that the feedstock was placed in an empty tank, in a tank that contained only feedstock with the same nominal specifications or providing a sample which shows there was no change in tariff status. The existence of negligible amounts of other feedstocks may be disregarded only in accordance with § 146.95(b). A request for after-admission privileged foreign status shall be denied unless the feedstock's tank records from admission to the time that the request is made accompany the request. A refiner who makes such a request shall not put any other feedstock having different nominal specifications into the tank until the request for privileged status is granted. The Customs Service will deny or revoke a post-admission request if a refiner fails to retain the integrity of the feedstock in the tank.

      (f)  The operator must use the selected method, measurement (weight or volume), and the price of product consistently (see § 146.92(g) of this subpart and paragraph (a) of this section).

      § 146.94   Records concerning establishment of manufacturing period.

#### § § 146.94

      (a)  The operator must maintain appropriate inventory records during the manufacturing period to substantiate the feedstock(s) eligible for attribution under § 146.93(b) and in accordance with the operator's selected attribution method.

      (b)  The operator must record the date and amount of each final product consumed in, or removed from the subzone.

      (c)  The consumption or removal of a final product during a week may be considered to have occurred on the last day of that week for purposes of attribution and relative value calculation instead of the actual day on which the removal or consumption occurred, unless the refiner elects to attribute using the FIFO method (see section II of the appendix to this part).

      (d)  A gain or loss that occurs during a manufacturing period must be taken into account in determining the attribution of a final product to a feedstock and the relative value calculation of privileged foreign feedstocks. Any gain in a final product attributed to a non-privileged foreign status feedstock is dutiable if entered for consumption unless otherwise exempt from duty.

      (e) —(1)  Volume measurements may be converted to weight measurements using American Petroleum Institute conversion factors to account for gain or loss.

      (2)  A feedstock factor may be calculated by dividing the value per barrel of production per product category by the quotient of the total value of production divided by all feedstock consumed. This factor would be applied to a finished product that has been attributed to a feedstock to account for volume gain.

      (3)  Volume difference may be determined by comparing the amount of feedstocks introduced for a given period with the amount of final products produced during the period, and then assigning the volume change to each final product proportionately.

      § 146.95   Methods of attribution.

#### § § 146.95

      (a) —(1)  A subzone operator must attribute the source of each final product. The operator is limited in this regard to feedstocks which were eligible for attribution during the current or prior manufacturing period. Attribution of final products is allowable to the extent that the quantity of such products could have been produced from such feedstocks, using the industry standards of potential production on a practical operating basis, as published in T.D. 66-16. Once attribution is made for a particular product, that attribution is binding. Subsequent attributions of feedstock to product must take prior attributions into account. Each refiner shall keep records showing each attribution.

      (2)  The industry standards of potential production on a practical operating basis necessary for the producibility attribution method are contained in tables published in T.D. 66-16. With these tables, a subzone operator may attribute final products consumed in, or removed from, the subzone to feedstocks during the current or a prior manufacturing period.

      (3)  (i) For purposes of attribution, where a final product or a feedstock is not listed in T.D. 66-16, the operator must submit a proposed attribution schedule, supported by a technical memorandum, to the appropriate port director. The port director shall refer the request to the Director, Office of Regulatory Audit (“ORA”), who will verify the refiner's records and will coordinate with the Director, Office of Laboratories and Scientific Services (“OLSS”). The Director, ORA, shall either approve or deny the request. If the request is approved, the Director, ORA, shall publish a modification of T.D. 66-16. If an operator elects to show attribution on a producibility basis, but fails to keep records on that basis, the operator shall use its actual operating records to determine attribution and any necessary relative value calculation upon the Customs Service demand and subject to verification.

      (ii) An operator may attribute a final product to a feedstock in excess of the amount allowed under T.D. 66-16, when authorized by Customs, without losing the ability to attribute under T.D. 66-16 for all other feedstock-final product combinations. The operator must use its actual production records for the requested feedstock-final product combination. The operator must agree in writing that it will not, and it will not enable any other person, to file a drawback claim under 19 U.S.C. 1313 inconsistent with those actual production records for that feedstock-final product combination. The operator shall file its request in accordance with paragraph (a)(3) of this section. The Director, ORA, and the Director, OLSS, must determine whether T.D. 66-16 needs to be modified and shall publish in the Customs Bulletin each approval granted under this paragraph and request public comments with each such approval.

      (4)  If a final product is attributed to the separation of a privileged foreign feedstock a relative value must be assigned (see section IV of the appendix to this part).

      (b)  An operator may use the actual refinery operating records to attribute the feedstocks used to the removed or consumed products. Customs shall accept the operator's operating conventions to the extent that the operator demonstrates that it actually uses these conventions in its refinery operations. Whatever conventions are elected by the operator, they must be used consistently in order to be acceptable to Customs. Additionally, Customs may use these records to test the validity of admissions into the subzone, consumption within and removals from the subzone.

      § 146.96   Approval of other recordkeeping systems.

#### § § 146.96

      (a)  An operator must seek prior approval of another recordkeeping procedure by submitting the following to the Director, Office of Regulatory Audit:

      (1) An explanation of the method describing how attribution will be made when a finished product is removed from or consumed in the subzone, and how and when the feedstocks will be decremented;

      (2) A mathematical example covering at least two months which shows the amounts attributed, all necessary relative value calculations, the dates of consumption and removal, and the amounts and dates that the transactions are reported to Customs.

      (b)  Requests received that fail to comply with paragraph (a) of this section will be returned to the requester with the defects noted by the Director, Office of Regulatory Audit.

      (c)  When the Director, Office of Regulatory Audit, determines that the recordkeeping procedures provide an acceptable basis for verifying the admissions and removals from or consumption in a refinery subzone, the Director will issue a written approval to the applicant.

    § 146.0   Scope.

#### § § 146.0

    Foreign trade zones are established under the Foreign Trade Zones Act and the general regulations and rules of procedure of the Foreign Trade Zones Board contained in 15 CFR part 400. This part 146 of the Customs Regulations governs the admission of merchandise into a foreign trade zone, manipulation, manufacture, or exhibition in a zone; exportation of the merchandise from a zone; and transfer of merchandise from a zone into Customs territory.

#### § § 148.1

      (a)  Any person, except a nonresident seaman, airman, or person engaged in similar employment, who intends to take effects of foreign origin abroad may register such articles before departure from the United States in order to facilitate their identification on return to the United States.

      (b)  Applicants for registration of articles of foreign origin shall present the articles, together with a completed, but unsigned, Customs Form 4457, or its electronic equivalent, which may be obtained in advance of departure, to a Customs officer. After the Customs officer has examined the articles and verified their description, he shall have the applicant sign the form. The Customs officer shall then sign the form and return it to the applicant for presentation on return of the articles. Customs form 4455, or its electronic equivalent, may be required in any case in which Customs form 4457, or its electronic equivalent, will not adequately serve the purpose of registration.

      (c)  The form shall be presented to the Customs officer when the registered articles are returned to the United States. The form shall be valid for reuse as long as the document is legible to identify the registered articles.

      (b)  If the port director is satisfied that an entry would serve no good purpose, none need be required, but evidence of ownership for Customs purposes, such as a carrier's certificate or properly endorsed bill of lading, shall be required with the declaration. Such exemption from entry may also be applied with respect to household effects or tools of trade entitled to free entry (see §§ 148.52 and 148.53 respectively) which are unaccompanied or forwarded in bond.

      (a)  A resident who enters the United States merely as an incident of foreign travel and who will continue his foreign travel before finally returning to the United States from a continuous trip must declare, but need not clear through CBP, any articles he has acquired or had repaired or altered while abroad. The incidental character of the arrival must be made known to the CBP officer.

      (b)  In order that a resident may claim the $800 or $1,600 exemption upon his final arrival in the United States from a continuous trip, articles accompanying him at the time of an incidental arrival may be exported directly from CBP custody or after transportation in bond, or the articles may be left in CBP custody if the resident upon his final return is to arrive at the CBP facility where the articles are deposited.

      (c)  If the traveler fails to advise the CBP officer of the incidental character of his arrival, or for other reason declares any articles for allowance of the $800 or $1,600 exemption, such declaration will mark the beginning of the respective period or periods during which a further exemption cannot be granted.

      § 148.18   Failure to declare.

#### § § 148.18

      (a)  Any article in the baggage of a passenger arriving from a foreign country which is not declared as required by this subpart shall be seized if it is available for seizure at the time the violation is detected, and the personal penalty prescribed by section 497, Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1497), shall be demanded from the passenger. If the article is not seized, a claim for the personal penalty shall be made against the person who imported the article without declaration. No duty shall be collected, because undeclared articles are treated as smuggled.

      (b)  When an article not declared as required by this subpart is found in the baggage of a person arriving in the United States, the personal penalty and forfeiture may be mitigated or remitted in accordance with the Guidelines for Disposition of Violations of 19 U.S.C. 1497 in the appendix to part 171 of this chapter.

#### § § 148.19

      A passenger who makes any false or fraudulent statement or engages in other conduct within the purview of section 592, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1592), whereby a Customs officer is or may be induced to pass an article free of duty or at less than the proper amount of duty, or to treat an article in some other manner in order to obtain a benefit, shall be deemed to have violated 19 U.S.C. 1592. In any such case the article involved shall be seized only if one or more of the conditions set forth in section 162.75 of this chapter are present, if it is available for seizure at the time the violation is detected, and if such seizure is otherwise practicable, unless the article is in the possession of an innocent holder for value who has full right to possession as against any party to the Customs violation. If seizure is not made, an amount equivalent to the maximum penalty which may be assessed in accordance with the passenger's degree of culpability as provided in 19 U.S.C. 1592(c) shall be demanded from the passenger. The amount demanded in lieu of seizure shall be determined in accordance with the guidelines contained in the appendix to part 171 of this chapter. In all cases, the estimated duties shall be demanded of the passenger as soon as possible after the discovery of the violation. Any applicable internal revenue tax shall also be demanded unless the merchandise is to be, or has been, forfeited.

Articles acquired elsewhere than in such insular possessions that do not accompany the returning resident are not entitled to the duty exemption.

      (b)  The $800 or $1,600 exemption will be applied to the aggregate fair retail value in the country of acquisition of the articles acquired abroad which are subject to the highest rates of duty. If an internal revenue tax is applicable, it will be combined with the duty in determining which rates are highest.

      (c)  An article acquired abroad by a returning resident and imported by him to be disposed of after importation as his bona fide gift is considered to be for the personal use of the returning resident and may be included in the exemption.

      (d)  Cigars, cigarettes, manufactured tobacco, and alcoholic beverages may be included in the exemption to which a returning resident is entitled, with the following limits:

      (1) No more than 200 cigarettes and 100 cigars may be included, except that in the case of American Samoa, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands and the Virgin Islands of the United States the cigarette limit is 1,000, not more than 200 of which shall have been acquired elsewhere than in such locations;

      (ii) An individual returning directly from a beneficiary country as defined in U.S. Note 4 to Chapter 98, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (19 U.S.C. 1202) may include in the exemption not more than 2 liters of alcoholic beverages if at least 1 liter is the product of one or more beneficiary countries.

      (e)  The exemption does not apply to articles intended for sale or acquired on commission, , for the account of another person, with or without compensation for the service rendered. Articles acquired on one journey and left in a foreign country cannot be allowed the exemption accruing upon the return of the resident from a subsequent journey.

      (f)  A returning resident who has received a total exemption of less than the $800 or $1,600 maximum in connection with his return from one journey is not entitled to apply the unused portion of that maximum amount to articles acquired abroad on a subsequent journey.

#### § § 148.34

      (a)  Each member of a family is entitled to the $800 or $1,600 exemption for articles acquired abroad, subject to the conditions prescribed in this subpart. When members of a family residing in one household travel together on their return to the United States, the $800 or $1,600 exemption to which the several members of the family may be entitled may be grouped and allowed without regard to which member of the family is the owner of the articles. However, a group exemption will not include an exemption for a family member not entitled to it in his own right, nor will a group exemption be applied to any property of such a member. The exemption of a family member who has not attained the age of 21 will not be applied under the group exemption to alcoholic beverages. No exemptions allowable to individuals employed by the household and accompanying the family but not related by blood, marriage, domestic relationship, or adoption will be included in the family grouping.

      (b)  “Members of a family residing in one household” includes all persons who:

      (1) Are related by blood, marriage, domestic relationship, or adoption;

      (2) Lived together in one household at their last permanent residence; and

      (3) Intend to live in one household after their arrival in the United States.

The $800 exemption may be allowed on articles acquired abroad by a returning resident arriving directly from Mexico without regard to the length of time the person has remained outside the territorial limits of the United States.

      (b)  The $1,600 exemption applicable in the case of the arrival of a returning resident directly or indirectly from the Virgin Islands of the United States may be allowed without regard to the length of time such person has remained outside the territorial limits of the United States.

      (c)  The 48-hour period a returning resident must have completed abroad to be entitled to an exemption will be computed exactly. For example, a resident leaving United States territory at 1:30 p.m. on June 1 would complete the 48-hour period at 1:30 p.m. on June 3.

      (a)  The $800 or $1,600 exemption for articles acquired abroad will not be granted to a returning resident who has taken advantage of such exemption within the 30-day period immediately preceding his return to the United States. The date of the returning resident's latest prior arrival on which he declared articles acquired abroad for allowance of the $800 or $1,600 exemption will be deemed the date he took advantage of the applicable exemption.

      (b)  The 30-day period immediately preceding the resident's return will be computed by excluding the day of arrival and counting backward 30 days. For example, in the case of an arrival on May 28, the resident would not be entitled to the $800 or $1,600 exemption if he had taken advantage of such exemption on or after the preceding April 28.

      (a)  An article furnished by a foreign supplier to replace a like article of comparable value previously exempted from duty under the $800 or $1,600 exemptions for articles acquired abroad will be allowed free entry if the original article is found by the importer to be unsatisfactory and the procedures provided by paragraph (b) of this section are followed. In any case in which the importer has failed to follow these procedures, the port director may allow free entry of the replacement article if he is satisfied that the unsatisfactory article was timely exported and that the failure to comply with the procedures of paragraph (b) of this section was due to inadvertence or lack of experience in customs matters and was without willful intent to avoid CBP supervision.

      (b)  Any article previously exempted from duty under the $800 or $1,600 exemptions found by the importer to be unsatisfactory must be returned to CBP custody and exported under CBP supervision at the expense of the importer within 60 days after its importation. A certificate of registration on CBP Form 4455, or its electronic equivalent, will be issued to the importer with instructions as to its use when the unsatisfactory article is exported for replacement under the provisions of subheading 9804.00.75, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States.

      (c)  The requirement that the original article be exported under CBP supervision does not apply when a duplicate article is furnished by a foreign supplier as a replacement for an article declared for entry under the $800 or $1,600 exemption and found by the CBP inspector or other examining officer to be so damaged as to constitute a nonimportation (§ 158.11 of this chapter). In such a case, CBP Form 4455, or its electronic equivalent, will be issued to the importer at the time the determination of nonimportation is made and the duplicate replacement will be considered to have been acquired abroad for the purposes of the $800 or $1,600 exemption provision, provided no charge is made to the importer for the duplicate replacement.

However, a nonresident crewmember shall not be treated as an arriving nonresident for this purpose when he departs a carrier for temporary leave but retains his employment with the carrier so that he will be going foreign again in the course of his continuing employment (see § 148.63).

      (b)  A nonresident crewmember, permanently leaving a carrier in a U.S. port to travel as a passenger on another carrier which will take him to a place outside the United States, who desires to take with him articles not exceeding $200 in aggregate value (including not more than 4 liters of alcoholic beverages) without the payment of duty or internal revenue tax as provided in item 812.40 (see § 148.41), may be accorded free entry of the articles under the following procedure:

      (1)  The nonresident crewmember shall itemize the articles on his declaration and entry, Customs Form 5129, required by § 148.62(b)(2), and shall state in writing in support of his declaration that:

      (i) He has been finally discharged from the carrier, with the date of discharge;

      (ii) He intends to depart from the same or another U.S. port as a passenger on another carrier for a place outside U.S. Customs territory; and

      (iii) The articles will be taken with him on such carrier and will not remain in the United States.

      (2)  The port director may require verification of the crewmember's discharge and a statement as to the accuracy of the second and third supporting statements of the crewmember from the person in charge of the carrier, the vessel agent, or the port captain. If the port director is satisfied that the crewmember's statements are correct, the articles may be passed free of duty and internal revenue tax under subheading 9808.00.40, HTSUS (19 U.S.C. 1202).

      (c)  A nonresident crewmember shall itemize on his baggage declaration and entry, Customs Form 5123 or 5129, required by § 148.62, all articles in his possession for which he seeks entry under subheading 9804.00.30, HTSUS (19 U.S.C. 1202), as bona fide gifts. The crewmember must be permanently leaving his employment on the international carrier for a stay in the United States of at least 72 hours before departing for a place outside the United States as a passenger.

      (b)  Any article landed without having been properly declared as provided in § 148.62 shall be considered as having been unladen without a permit and the penalties provided in 19 U.S.C. 1453 or 19 U.S.C. 1644 and 1644a shall be assessed as applicable.

      (c)  If the declaration does not include all the articles landed, the crewmember shall be subject to the penalties prescribed in section 497, Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1497), with respect to the articles omitted.

      (1) Any person in the service of the United States who returns to the United States upon the termination of assignment to extended duty at a post or station outside the Customs territory of the United States;

      (2) Members of his family who have resided with him at such post or station and are returning upon the termination of his assignment; or

      (3) Any person evacuated to the United States under Government orders or instructions.

      (b) The term “personal effects” as used in subheading 9805.00.50, HTSUS, is not confined to that class of articles described in subheading 9804.00.20, HTSUS, nor is any period of use, such as prescribed by subheading 9804.00.05, HTSUS, applicable to household effects entered under subheading 9805.00.50, HTSUS. The privilege of free entry under subheading 9805.00.50, HTSUS, does not apply to:

      (1) Articles imported for sale, or for the account of any person not specified in subheading 9805.00.50, HTSUS; or

      (2) Articles which have not been in the direct personal possession of the claimant, or a member of his household, while abroad.

      (c)  A total of not more than 4 liters of alcoholic beverages and not more than 100 cigars shall be accorded free entry under subheading 9805.00.50, HTSUS, subject to the conditions that:

      (d)  The requirement of subheading 9805.00.50, HTSUS that the person “returns to the United States upon the termination of assignment to extended duty” shall be considered met upon the necessary proof being submitted that any one of the following is applicable:

      (1) The person is returning upon the termination of a tour of duty outside the Customs territory of the United States of at least 140 days' duration.

      (2) The person is returning after the termination of an assignment under permanent change of station orders to duty at a post or station outside the Customs territory of the United States, regardless of the duration of the duty. A crewmember, including a member of a command, serving on a United States naval vessel when it departs from the United States on an intended deployment of 120 days or more outside the Customs territory of the United States and who continues to serve on the vessel until it returns to the United States may be considered as returning after the termination of an assignment of duty under permanent change of station orders.

      (3) The person is returning to the United States upon the termination of a tour of duty at any time after leaving the United States for duty of not less than 140 days outside the Customs territory of the United States.

      (4) The person, although not returning to the United States, is ordered by the Government agency involved from duty at a post or station outside the Customs territory of the United States to duty at another post or station outside the Customs territory of the United States necessitating the return to the United States of his personal and household effects.

      § 148.75   Persons ineligible for exemption on termination of assignment.

#### § § 148.75

      (a)  No person, or member of his family, shall be allowed free entry of personal and household effects under subheading 9805.00.50, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) (19 U.S.C. 1202), where the person returns to the United States pursuant to Government orders or instructions which authorized him initially to proceed to a foreign post or station and return to the United States upon termination of temporary duty, except as it may otherwise be deemed proper in accordance with the provisions of § 148.74(d) or § 148.76.

      (b)  A person returning on leave, other than on reemployment leave at the termination of assignment to extended duty as defined in § 148.74(d), or otherwise returning before the termination of an assignment to extended duty outside the Customs territory of the United States, with or without orders covering the return, is not eligible for an exemption under subheading 9805.00.50, HTSUS (19 U.S.C. 1202).

      (c)  A person returning to the United States under orders on temporary duty assignment at the termination of which he is returned to his duty station abroad to resume his regular duties is not regarded as returning to the United States at the termination of extended duty outside the Customs territory of the United States and is not eligible for an exemption under subheading 9805.00.50, HTSUS (19 U.S.C. 1202).

      § 148.76   Waiver of requirements or limitations.

#### § § 148.76

      In any case in which the limitation on the quantity of alcoholic beverages and tobacco products which may be exempted from duty and tax under § 148.74(c) or the failure of the person to meet the requirements that he be returning upon the termination of assignment to “extended duty,” as explained in § 148.74(d), will cause undue hardship to the person through no fault of his own, but rather because of the nature of his assignment or other hardship circumstances, the Commissioner of Customs, upon receipt of a request from the Government agency involved, may waive the limitation or the requirement, as the case may be, if he deems such waiver warranted by the facts.

      § 148.77   Entry of effects on termination of assignment to extended duty, or on evacuation.

#### § § 148.77

      (a)  All articles for which free entry is claimed under subheading 9805.00.50, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (19 U.S.C. 1202), shall be entered or withdrawn in accordance with the requirements prescribed by the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended. Port directors shall be satisfied in all cases that the articles for which free entry is claimed under subheading 9805.00.50, HTSUS, are personal and household effects of the importer entitled to the benefits of item 817.00, particularly in those cases where the quantity of effects imported may appear to be unreasonable for personal or household use. No invoice shall be required for articles accorded free entry under this provision.

      (b) —(1)  _Declaration and entry_ for articles claimed to be exempt from duty and tax under subheading 9805.00.50, HTSUS (19 U.S.C. 1202), may be made on Customs Form 3299, or its electronic equivalent or Department of Defense Form (DD) 1252 when entry is made in the name of the person who is entitled to the benefits of the exemption. The date of the person's last departure from the United States shall be indicated on the declaration and entry.

      (2)  Customs Form 3299, or its electronic equivalent, or Department of Defense Form 1252 executed on behalf of the owner of unaccompanied personal and household effects by either a United States Dispatch Agent or a designated responsible military official in his own name, may be accepted by the Customs officer as the declaration and entry if there is a valid reason evident from the owner's travel orders or information at hand why the United States Government agency concerned is unable to present Department of Defense Form (DD) 1252 or Customs Form 3299 executed by the owner. The date of the owner's last departure from the United States need not be indicated on the form. The following statement shall be added across the face or to the back of Customs Form 3299 or Department of Defense Form 1252.

      (c) —(1)  The declaration and entry shall be verified by the Customs officer by an inspection of the owner's travel orders. If the port director accepts an inspection of the owner's travel orders as evidence that the effects were brought into the United States within the requirements of subheading 9805.00.50, the owner's travel orders shall be identified on the entry, which shall be handled like a free baggage declaration.

      (2)  The declaration and entry may be verified by other evidence which satisfies the port director that the effects were brought into the United States in connection with:

      (i) The person's return to the United States upon the termination of assignment to extended duty, as explained in § 148.74(d);

      (ii) The return of members of his family who have resided with him at his post or station upon the termination of his assignment; or

      (iii) The evacuation of a person to the United States under Government orders or instructions.

However, this subpart is not applicable to the importation of unaccompanied articles in a manner prohibited by law or regulation (e.g., mail shipments of alcoholic beverages or alcoholic beverages shipped other than by mail in excess of quantities authorized by State laws or regulations).

      The following is a summary of the procedure to be followed to obtain the benefits of this subpart: A person purchasing articles in American Samoa, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, or the Virgin Islands of the United States would receive a sales slip, invoice, or other evidence of purchase which he would present to the Customs officer along with his baggage declaration, Customs Form 6059-B, and a Declaration of Unaccompanied Articles, Customs Form 255. The latter form is prepared in triplicate for each shipment to follow. The Customs officer would verify the information, indicate on the form whether the article or articles were free of duty, dutiable at the flat rate, or a combination of the foregoing, and validate the form. Two copies would be returned to the traveler, who would send one form to the vendor. Upon receipt of the form the vendor would place it in an envelope, affix it to the outside of the package, clearly mark the package “Unaccompanied Tourist Shipment,” and send the package to the traveler, generally via mail, although it could be sent by other means. If sent through the mail, the package would be examined by Customs and forwarded to the Postal Service for delivery. Any duties due would be collected by the mailman. If the shipment arrives other than through the mail, the traveler would be notified by the carrier when the article arrives. Entry would be made by the carrier or the traveler at the customhouse. Any duties due would be collected at that time.

#### § § 149.1

    (a)  For purposes of this part, Importer Security Filing (ISF) Importer means the party causing goods to arrive within the limits of a port in the United States by vessel. For shipments other than foreign cargo remaining on board (FROB), the ISF Importer will be the goods' owner, purchaser, consignee, or agent such as a licensed customs broker. For immediate exportation (IE) and transportation and exportation (T&E) in-bond shipments, and goods to be delivered to a Foreign Trade Zone (FTZ), the ISF Importer may also be the party filing the IE, T&E, or FTZ documentation. For FROB cargo, the ISF Importer will be the carrier or the non-vessel operating common carrier. For the purposes of this part the United States Postal Service is not an ISF Importer. Regulations related to the transmittal of advance electronic information for inbound international mail shipments are set forth in § 145.74 of this chapter.

    (b)  For purposes of this part, “importation” means the point at which cargo arrives within the limits of a port in the United States.

    (c)  For purposes of this part, “bulk cargo” is defined as homogeneous cargo that is stowed loose in the hold and is not enclosed in any container such as a box, bale, bag, cask, or the like. Such cargo is also described as bulk freight. Specifically, bulk cargo is composed of either:

    (1) Free flowing articles such as oil, grain, coal, ore, and the like, which can be pumped or run through a chute or handled by dumping; or

    (2) Articles that require mechanical handling such as bricks, pig iron, lumber, steel beams, and the like.

    (d)  For purposes of this part, “break bulk cargo” is defined as cargo that is not containerized, but which is otherwise packaged or bundled.

      (1) If the merchandise is tranferred directly to a CES by an importing carrier, the importing carrier shall remain liable under the terms of its international carrier bond for the proper safekeeping and delivery of the merchandise until it is receipted for by the CES operator.

      (2) If the merchandise is transferred directly from a bonded carrier's facility to a CES or is delivered directly to the CES by a bonded carrier, the bonded carrier shall remain liable under the terms of its custodial bond for the proper safekeeping and delivery of the merchandise until it is receipted for by the CES operator.

      (3) If containerized cargo, including excess loose cargo that is part of the containerized cargo, is transferred to a CES operator's own facility using his own vehicles, the CES operator shall be liable under the terms of his custodial bond for the proper safekeeping and delivery of the merchandise to the CES facility.

      (4) If the importer or his agent acting as importer of record transfers the merchandise to a CES, that importer or agent shall assume liability under his importation and entry bond (see § 151.7(d) of this part) for the proper transfer of the merchandise until it is receipted for by the CES operator.

      (c)  Port directors may institute an annual blanket transfer application procedure to facilitate any of the bonded movements described in paragraph (b) of this section.

      (d)  In the event the port director deems it necessary, he may direct the type of bonded movement to be used to transfer merchandise to a CES and may designate the CES at which examination must take place.

      § 151.16   Detention of merchandise.

#### § § 151.16

      (a)  The provisions of this section are not applicable to detentions effected by CBP on behalf of other agencies of the U.S. Government in whom the determination of admissibility is vested.

      (b)  Within five business days from the date on which merchandise is presented for CBP examination, CBP will decide whether to release or detain merchandise. Merchandise that is not released within the five business day period will be considered to be detained merchandise under 19 U.S.C. 1499(c)(1). For purposes of this section, merchandise will be considered to be presented for CBP examination when it is in a condition to be viewed and examined by a CBP officer. Mere presentation to the examining officer of a cargo van, container, or instrument of international traffic in which the merchandise to be examined is contained will not be considered to be presentation of merchandise for CBP examination for purposes of this section. Except when merchandise is examined at the public stores, the importer must pay all costs relating to the preparation and transportation of merchandise for CBP examination.

      (c)  If a decision to detain merchandise is made, or the merchandise is not released within the five business day period described in paragraph (b) of this section, CBP will issue a notice to the importer or other party having an interest in such merchandise within five business days from such decision or failure to release. Issuance of a notice of detention is not to be construed as a final determination as to admissibility of the merchandise. The notice will be prepared by the CBP officer detaining the merchandise and will advise the importer or other interested party of the:

      (1) Initiation of the detention, including the date the merchandise was presented for examination;

      (2) Specific reason for the detention;

      (3) Anticipated length of the detention;

      (4) Nature of the tests or inquiries to be conducted; and

      (5) Nature of any information which, if supplied to CBP, may accelerate the disposition of the detention.

      (d)  Upon written request by the importer or other party having an interest in detained merchandise, CBP will provide copies of the results of any testing conducted on the merchandise together with a description of the testing procedures and methodologies used (unless such procedures or methodologies are proprietary to the holder of a copyright or patent or were developed by CBP for enforcement purposes). The results and test description will be in sufficient detail to permit the duplication and analysis of the testing and the results.

      (e)  A final determination with respect to admissibility of detained merchandise will be made within 30 days from the date the merchandise is presented for CBP examination. Such a determination may be the subject of a protest.

      (f)  The failure by CBP to make a final determination with respect to the admissibility of detained merchandise within 30 days after the merchandise has been presented for CBP examination, or such longer period if specifically authorized by law, will be treated as a decision by CBP to exclude the merchandise for purposes of section 514(a)(4) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1514(a)(4)). Such a deemed exclusion may be the subject of a protest.

      (g)  If a protest which is filed as a result of a final determination or a deemed exclusion of detained merchandise is not allowed or denied in whole or in part before the 30th day after the day on which the protest was filed, it will be treated as having been denied on such 30th day for purposes of 28 U.S.C. 1581.

      (h)  CBP may at any time after a deemed denial of a protest as provided in paragraph (g) of this section, but before commencement of a court action as provided in paragraph (i) of this section, grant a protest and permit release of detained merchandise, or deny a protest in accordance with § 174.30 of this chapter.

      (i)  Once a court action respecting a detention is commenced, unless CBP establishes by a preponderance of the evidence that an admissibility decision has not been reached for good cause, the court will grant the appropriate relief which may include, but is not limited to, an order to cancel the detention and release the merchandise.

      (j)  If otherwise provided by law, detained merchandise may be seized and forfeited. In lieu of seizure and forfeiture, where authorized by law, CBP may deny entry and permit the merchandise to be exported, with the importer responsible for paying all expenses of exportation.

      (i) Customs-approved metering and sampling installations provided by the importer;

      (ii) Shore tank gauging; or

      (iii) Weighing for trucks and railroad cars.

      (2) Vessel ullages shall be taken in every case unless the port director determines that it is impracticable to do so for safety or technological reasons. Ullages may be taken for trucks and railroad cars if weighing or shore tank gauging is not available as a method of control. Vessel ullages will not be used to determine the quantity unladen unless none of the other methods provided for in this paragraph is available or adequate.

      (3) The metering and sampling installations described in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section are approved by Customs on a case-by-case basis. Importers seeking approval shall send a complete description of the installation to the port director who, with the concurrence of the Director, Laboratory & Scientific Services, or his designee, shall give approval or shall state, in writing, the reasons for disapproval. Approved installations are subject to periodic verification by Customs. Importers desiring to modify a Customs-approved installation shall obtain Customs approval beforehand.

      (d)  Upon receipt of a written request from the importer within 90 days after liquidation, the Center director shall provide a reasonable and concise written explanation of how the value of the imported merchandise was determined. The explanation will apply only to the imported merchandise being appraised and will not serve as authority with respect to the valuation of importations of any other merchandise at the same or a different port of entry. This procedure is for informational purposes only, and will not affect or replace the protest or administrative ruling procedures contained in parts 174 and 177, respectively, of this chapter, or any other Customs procedures. Under this procedure, Customs will not be required to release any information not otherwise subject to disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, as amended (5 U.S.C. 552), the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a), or any other statute (see part 103 of this chapter).

      (2) The applicability of a particular set of generally accepted accounting principles will depend upon the basis on which the value of the imported merchandise is sought to be established, and the relevant country for the point in contention.

      (3) Information submitted by an importer, buyer, or producer in regard to the appraisement of merchandise may not be rejected by Customs because of the accounting method by which that information was prepared, if the preparation was in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

      (d)  “Identical merchandise” means merchandise identical in all respects to, and produced in the same country and by the same person as, the merchandise being appraised. If identical merchandise cannot be found (or for purposes of related buyer and seller transactions (see § 152.103 (j)(2)(i)(A)) regardless of whether identical merchandise can be found), merchandise identical in all respects to, and produced in the same country as, but not produced by the same person as, the merchandise being appraised, may be treated as “identical merchandise”. “Identical merchandise” does not include merchandise that incorporates or reflects any engineering, development, artwork, design work, or plan or sketch supplied free or at reduced cost by the buyer of the merchandise for use in connection with the production or sale for export to the United States of the merchandise, and is not an assist because undertaken within the United States.

      (h)  “Merchandise of the same class or kind” means merchandise (including, but not limited to, identical merchandise and similar merchandise) within a group or range of merchandise produced by a particular industry or industry sector.

      (i)  “Similar merchandise” means merchandise produced in the same country and by the same person as the merchandise being appraised, like the merchandise being appraised in characteristics and component material, and commercially interchangeable with the merchandise being appraised. If similar merchandise cannot be found (or for purposes of related buyer and seller transactions (see § 152.103 (j)(2)(i)(A)) regardless of whether similar merchandise can be found), merchandise produced in the same country as, but not produced by the same person as, the merchandise being appraised, like the merchandise being appraised in characteristics and component material, and commercially interchangeable with the merchandise being appraised, may be treated as “similar merchandise”. “Similar merchandise” does not include merchandise that incorporates or reflects any engineering, development, artwork, design work, or plan or sketch supplied free or at reduced cost by the buyer of the merchandise for use in connection with the production or the sale for export to the United States of the merchandise, and is not an assist because undertaken within the United States.

      (1) Any amount:

      (i) Added under § 152.103(b) to the price actually paid or payable;

      (ii) Deducted under § 152.105(d) as profit or general expenses or value from further processing, or

      (iii) Added under § 152.106(b) as profit or general expenses; or

      (2) Any difference taken into account under § 152.103(j)(2)(ii); or

      (3) Any adjustment made under § 152.104(d).

      (k)  “Unit price at which merchandise is sold in the greatest aggregate quantity” means the unit price at which the “merchandise concerned” is sold to unrelated persons at the first commercial level after importation (in cases to which § 152.105(c)(1) and (2) apply), or after further processing (in cases to which § 152.105(c)(3) applies), at which the sales take place in a total volume greater than the total volume sold at any other unit price and sufficient to establish the unit price.

> [T.D. 81-7, 46 FR 2600, Jan. 12, 1981, as amended by T.D. 97-82, 62 FR 51771, Oct. 3, 1997]

      § 152.103   Transaction value.

#### § § 152.103

      (a) —(1)  In determining transaction value, the price actually paid or payable will be considered without regard to its method of derivation. It may be the result of discounts, increases, or negotiations, or may be arrived at by the application of a formula, such as the price in effect on the date of export in the London Commodity Market. The word “payable” refers to a situation in which the price has been agreed upon, but actual payment has not been made at the time of importation. Payment may be made by letters of credit or negotiable instruments and may be made directly or indirectly.

      (2)  An indirect payment would include the settlement by the buyer, in whole or in part, of a debt owed by the seller, or where the buyer receives a price reduction on a current importation as a means of settling a debt owed him by the seller. Activities such as advertising, undertaken by the buyer on his own account, other than those for which an adjustment is provided in § 152.103(b), will not be considered an indirect payment to the seller though they may benefit the seller. The costs of those activities will not be added to the price actually paid or payable in determining the customs value of the imported merchandise.

      (3)  The price actually paid or payable may represent an amount for the assembly of imported merchandise in which the seller has no interest other than as the assembler. The price actually paid or payable in that case will be calculated by the addition of the value of the components and required adjustments to form the basis for the transaction value.

      (4)  Any rebate of, or other decrease in, the price actually paid or payable made or otherwise effected between the buyer and seller after the date of importation of the merchandise will be disregarded in determining the transaction value under § 152.103(b).

      (5) —(i)  If the price actually paid or payable by the buyer to the seller for the imported merchandise does not include a charge for foreign inland freight and other charges for services incident to the international shipment of merchandise (an ex-factory price), those charges will not be added to the price.

      (ii)  As a general rule, in those situations where the price actually paid or payable for imported merchandise includes a charge for foreign inland freight, whether or not itemized separately on the invoices or other commercial documents, that charge will be part of the transaction value to the extent included in the price. However, charges for foreign inland freight and other services incident to the shipment of the merchandise to the United States may be considered incident to the international shipment of that merchandise within the meaning of § 152.102(f) if they are identified separately and they occur after the merchandise has been sold for export to the United States and placed with a carrier for through shipment to the United States.

      (iii)  A sale for export and placement for through shipment to the United States under paragraph (a)(5)(ii) of this section shall be established by means of a through bill of lading to be presented to CBP, either at the port of entry or electronically. Only in those situations where it clearly would be impossible to ship merchandise on a through bill of lading (e.g., shipments via the seller's own conveyance) will other documentation satisfactory to the Center director showing a sale for export to the United States and placement for through shipment to the United States be accepted in lieu of a through bill of lading.

      (iv)  This regulation shall not be construed as prohibiting Customs from making appropriate additions to the dutiable value of merchandise in instances where verification reveals that foreign inland freight charges or other charges for services incident to the international shipment of merchandise have been overstated.

      (b)  (1) The transaction value of imported merchandise is the price actually paid or payable for the merchandise when sold for exportation to the United States, plus amounts equal to:

      (i) The packing costs incurred by the buyer with respect to the imported merchandise;

      (ii) Any selling commission incurred by the buyer with respect to the imported merchandise;

      (iii) The value, apportioned as appropriate, of any assist;

      (iv) Any royalty or license fee related to the imported merchandise that the buyer is required to pay, directly or indirectly, as a condition of the sale of the imported merchandise for exportation to the United States; and

      (v) The proceeds of any subsequent resale, disposal, or use of the imported merchandise that accrue, directly or indirectly, to the seller.

      (2) The price actually paid or payable for imported merchandise will be increased by the amounts attributable to the items (and no others) described in paragraphs (b)(1) (i) through (v) of this section to the extent that each amount is not otherwise included within the price actually paid or payable, and is based on sufficient information. If sufficient information is not available, for any reason, with respect to any amount referred to in this section, the transaction value will be treated as one that cannot be determined.

      (3)  A royalty is paid on the basis of the price in a sale in the United States of a gallon of a particular product imported by the pound and transformed into a solution after importation. If the royalty is based partially on the imported merchandise and partially on other factors which have nothing to do with the imported merchandise (such as if the imported merchandise is mixed with domestic ingredients and is no longer separately identifiable, or if the royalty cannot be distinguished from special financial arrangements between the buyer and the seller), it would be inappropriate to attempt to make an addition for the royalty. However, if the amount of this royalty is based only on the imported merchandise and can be readily quantified, an addition to the price actually paid or payable will be made.

      (c)  Additions to the price actually paid or payable will be made only if there is sufficient information to establish the accuracy of the additions and the extent to which they are not included in the price.

      (d)  If the value of an assist is to be added to the price actually paid or payable, or to be used as a component of computed value, the Center director shall determine the value of the assist and apportion that value to the price of the imported merchandise in the following manner:

      (1) If the assist consist of materials, components, parts, or similar items incorporated in the imported merchandise, or items consumed in the production of the imported merchandise, acquired by the buyer from an unrelated seller, the value of the assist is the cost of its acquisition. If the assist were produced by the buyer or a person related to the buyer, its value would be the cost of its production. In either case, the value of the assist would include transportation costs to the place of production.

      (2) If the assist consists of tools, dies, molds, or similar items used in the production of the imported merchandise, acquired by the buyer from an unrelated seller,the value of the assist is the cost of its acquisition. If the assist were produced by the buyer or a person related to the buyer, its value would be cost of its production. If the assist has been used previously by the buyer, regardless of whether it had been acquired or produced by him, the original cost of acquisition or production would be adjusted downward to reflect its use before its value could be determined. If the assist were leased by the buyer from an unrelated seller, the value of the assist would be the cost of the lease. In either case, the value of the assist would include transportation costs to the place of production. Repairs or modifications to an assist may increase its value.

      (e)  (1) The apportionment of the value of assists to imported merchandise will be made in a reasonable manner appropriate to the circumstances and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The method of apportionment actually accepted by Customs will depend upon the documentation submitted by the importer. If the entire anticipated production using the assist is for exportation to the United States, the total value may be apportioned over (i) the first shipment, if the importer wishes to pay duty on the entire value at once, (ii) the number of units produced up to the time of the first shipment, or (iii) the entire anticipated production. In addition to these three methods, the importer may request some other method of apportionment in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. If the anticipated production is only partially for exportation to the United States, or if the assist is used in several countries, the method of apportionment will depend upon the documentation submitted by the importer.

      (2)  An importer provides the producer with a mold to be used in the production of the imported merchandise and contracts to buy 10,000 units. By the time of arrival of the first shipment of 1,000 units, the producer has already produced 4,000 units. The importer may request Customs to apportion the value of the mold over 1,000, 4,000, 10,000 units, or any other figure which is in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

      (f)  Royalties or license fees for patents covering processes to manufacture the imported merchandise generally will be dutiable. Royalties or license fees paid to third parties for use, in the United States, of copyrights and trademarks related to the imported merchandise generally will be considered selling expenses of the buyer and not dutiable. The dutiable status of royalties or license fees paid by the buyer will be determined in each case and will depend on (1) whether the buyer was required to pay them as a condition of sale of the merchandise for exportation to the United States, and (2) to whom and under what circumstances they were paid. Payments made by the buyer to a third party for the right to distribute or resell the imported merchandise will not be added to the price actually paid or payable for the imported merchandise if the payments are not a condition of the sale of the merchandise for exportation to the United States.

      (g)  Additions to the price actually paid or payable will be made for the value of any part of the proceeds of any subsequent resale, disposal, or use of the imported merchandise that accrues directly or indirectly to the seller. Dividends or other payments from the buyer to the seller which do not relate directly to the imported merchandise will not be added to the price actually paid or payable. Whether any addition would be made will depend on the facts of the particular case.

      (h)  Charges for the right to reproduce the imported merchandise in the United States will not be added to the price actually paid or payable. The right to reproduce denotes that an idea or an original work is incorporated in, or reflected by, the imported merchandise, and the right is reserved to reproduce that idea or work in other merchandise by using the imported merchandise. The concept of the right to reproduce relates only to the following classes of merchandise: originals or copies of artistic or scientific works; originals or copies of models and industrial drawings; model machines and prototypes; and plant and animal species.

      (i)  The transaction value of imported merchandise does not include any of the following, if identified separately from the price actually paid or payable and from any cost or other item referred to in paragraph (b) of this section:

      (1) Any reasonable cost or charge that is incurred for—

      (i) The construction, erection, assembly, or maintenance of, or the technical assistance provided with respect to, the merchandise after its importation into the United States; or

      (ii) The transportation of the merchandise after its importation.

      (2) The customs duties and other Federal taxes currently payable on the imported merchandise by reason of its importation, and any Federal excise tax on, or measured by the value of, the merchandise for which vendors in the United States ordinarily are liable.

      (j) —(1)  The transaction value of imported merchandise will be the appraised value only if:

      (i) There are no restrictions on the disposition or use of the imported merchandise by the buyer, other than restrictions which are imposed or required by law, limit the geographical area in which the merchandise may be resold, or do not affect substantially the value of the merchandise;

      (ii) The sale of, or the price actually paid or payable for, the imported merchandise is not subject to any condition or consideration for which a value cannot be determined;

      (iii) No part of the proceeds of any subsequent resale, disposal, or use of the imported merchandise by the buyer will accrue directly or indirectly to the seller, unless an appropriate adjustment can be made under paragraph (b)(1)(v) of this section; and

      (iv) The buyer and seller are not related, or the buyer and seller are related but the transaction value is acceptable.

      (2)  (i) The transaction value between a related buyer and seller is acceptable if an examination of the circumstances of sale indicates that their relationship did not influence the price actually paid or payable, or if the transaction value of the imported merchandise closely approximates:

      (A) The transaction value of identical merchandise; or of similar merchandise, in sales to unrelated buyers in the United States; or

      (B) The deductive value or computed value of identical merchandise, or of similar merchandise; and

      (C) Each value referred to in paragraph (j)(2)(i) (A) and (B) of this section that is used for comparison relates to merchandise that was exported to the United States at or about the same time as the imported merchandise.

      (ii) In applying the values used for comparison, differences with respect to the sales involved will be taken into account if based on sufficient information supplied by the buyer or otherwise available to Customs and if the differences relate to:

      (A) Commercial levels;

      (B) Quantity levels;

      (C) The costs, commissions, values, fees, and proceeds described in paragraph (b) of this section; and

      (D) The costs incurred by the seller in sales in which the seller and the buyer are not related that are not incurred by the seller in sales in which the seller and the buyer are related.

      (k)  (1) A restriction placed on the buyer of imported merchandise that does not affect substantially its value will not prevent transaction value from being accepted as the appraised value.

      (i)  A seller requires a buyer of automobiles not to sell or exhibit them before a fixed date that represents the beginning of a model year.

      (2) The transaction value will not be accepted as the appraised value if the sale of, or the price actually paid or payable for, the merchandise is subject to a condition or consideration for which a value cannot be determined.

      (i)  The seller establishes the price of the imported merchandise on condition that the buyer also will buy other merchandise in specified quantities.

      (ii)  The price of the imported merchandise is dependent upon the price or prices at which the buyer of the merchandise sells other merchandise to the seller of the merchandise.

      (iii)  The price of the imported merchandise is established on the basis of a form of payment extraneous to the merchandise, such as where the merchandise is to be further processed by the buyer, and has been provided by the seller on condition that he will receive a specified quantity of the finished merchandise.

      (l) —(1)  The Center director shall not disregard a transaction value solely because the buyer and seller are related. There will be related person transactions in which validation of the transaction value, using the procedures contained in § 152.103(j)(2), may not be necessary.

      (i)  Customs may have previously examined the relationship or may already have sufficient detailed information concerning the buyer and seller to be satisfied that the relationship did not influence the price actually paid or payable. In such case, if Customs has no doubts about the acceptability of the price, the price will be accepted without requesting further information from the importer. If Customs does have doubts about the acceptability of the price and is unable to accept the transaction value without further inquiry, the importer will be given an opportunity to supply such further detailed information as may be necessary to enable Customs to examine the circumstances of the sale. In this context, Customs will examine relevant aspects of the transaction, including the way in which the buyer and seller organize their commercial relations and the way in which the price in question was arrived at in order to determine whether the relationship influenced the price.

      (ii)  If it is shown that the buyer and seller, although related, buy from and sell to each other as if they were not related, this will demonstrate that the price has not been influenced by the relationship, and the transaction value will be accepted. If the price has been settled in a manner consistent with the normal pricing practices of the industry in question, or with the way the seller settles prices for sales to buyers who are not related to him, this will demonstrate that the price has not been influenced by the relationship.

      (iii)  If it is shown that the price is adequate to ensure recovery of all costs plus a profit which is equivalent to the firm's overall profit realized over a representative period of time (e.g., on an annual basis), in sales of merchandise of the same class or kind, this would demonstrate that the price has not been influenced.

      (2)  (i) The importer or the buyer may demonstrate that the transaction value in a related person transaction is acceptable by showing that the value “closely approximates” any one of the test values provided in § 152.103(j)(2)(i). The factors that will be examined to determine if the transaction value closely approximates a test value include:

      (A) The nature of the imported merchandise and the industry,

      (B) The season in which the merchandise is imported,

      (C) Whether the difference in value is commercially significant, and

      (D) Whether the difference in value is attributable to internal transport costs in the country of exportation.

      (ii) Because these factors may vary, Customs will not be able to apply a uniform standard, such as a fixed percentage, in each case. A small difference in value in a case involving one type of imported merchandise may be unacceptable, although a large difference in a case involving another type may be acceptable, in determining if the transaction value closely approximates any of the test values. Customs will be consistent in determining if one value “closely approximates” another value. The same approach will be taken if Customs considers a transaction value that is higher than any of the enumerated test values as will be taken if the transaction value is lower than any of the test values.

      (iii) If one of the test values provided in § 152.103(j)(2)(i) has been found to be appropriate, the Center director shall not seek to determine if the relationship between the buyer and seller influenced the price. If the Center director already has sufficient information to be satisfied, without further detailed inquiries, that one of the test values is appropriate, he shall not require the importer to demonstrate that the test value is appropriate.

      (m)  When CBP has grounds for rejecting the transaction value declared by an importer and that rejection increases the duty liability, the Center director shall inform the importer of the grounds for the rejection. The importer will be afforded 20 days to respond in writing to the Center director if in disagreement. This procedure will not affect or replace the administrative ruling procedures contained in part 177 of this chapter, or any other CBP procedures.

      § 152.104   Transaction value of identical merchandise and similar merchandise.

#### § § 152.104

      (a)  The transaction value of identical merchandise, or of similar merchandise, is the transaction value (acceptable as the appraised value under § 152.103 but adjusted under paragraph (e) of this section) of imported merchandise that is—

      (1) With respect to the merchandise being appraised, either identical merchandise, or similar merchandise; and

      (2) Exported to the United States at or about the time that the merchandise being appraised is exported to the United States.

      (b)  Minor differences in appearance will not preclude otherwise conforming merchandise from being considered “identical”. See § 152.102(d).

      (c)  The quality of the merchandise, its reputation, and the existence of a trademark will be factors considered to determine whether merchandise is “similar”. See § 152.102(i).

      (d)  Transaction values determined under this section will be based on sales of identical merchandise, or similar merchandise, at the same commercial level and in substantially the same quantity as the sales of the merchandise being appraised. If no such sale is found, sales of identical merchandise, or similar merchandise, at either a different commercial level or in different quantities, or both, will be used, but adjusted to take account of that difference. Any adjustment made under this section will be based on “sufficient information”. See § 152.102(j). If in applying this section to any merchandise, two or more transaction values for identical merchandise, or for similar merchandise, are determined, the merchandise will be appraised on the basis of the lower or lowest of those values.

      (e)  (1) Adjustments for identical merchandise, or similar merchandise, because of different commercial levels or quantities, or both, whether leading to an increase or decrease in the value, will be made only on the basis of sufficient information; e.g., valid price lists containing prices referring to different levels or quantities.

      (2)  If the imported merchandise being valued consists of a shipment of 10 units and the only identical imported merchandise for which a transaction value exists involved a sale of 500 units, and it is recognized that the seller grants quantity discounts, the required adjustment may be accomplished by resorting to the seller's price list and using that price applicable to a sale of 10 units. This does not require that a sale had to have been made in quantities of 10 as long as the price list has been established as being  through sales at other quantities. In the absence of such an objective measure, however, the determination of a customs value under the provisions for transaction value of identical or similar merchandise is not appropriate.

      § 152.105   Deductive value.

#### § § 152.105

      (a)  For the purposes of deductive value, “merchandise concerned” means the merchandise being appraised, identical merchandise, or similar merchandise.

      (b)  For the purposes of deductive value, “merchandise of the same class or kind” includes merchandise imported from the same country as well as other countries as the merchandise being appraised.

      (c)  The deductive value of the merchandise being appraised is whichever of the following prices (as adjusted under paragraph (d) of this section) is appropriate depending upon when and in what condition the merchandise concerned is sold in the United States:

      (1) If the merchandise concerned is sold in the condition as imported at or about the date of importation of the merchandise being appraised, the price is the unit price at which the merchandise concerned is sold in the greatest aggregate quantity at or about such date.

      (2) If the merchandise concerned is sold in the condition as imported but not sold at or about the date of importation of the merchandise being appraised, the price is the unit price at which the merchandise concerned is sold in the greatest aggregate quantity after the date of importation of the merchandise being appraised but before the close of the 90th day after the date of such importation.

      (3) If the merchandise concerned was not sold in the condition as imported and not sold before the close of the 90th day after the date of importation of the merchandise being appraised, the price is the unit price at which the merchandise being appraised, after further processing, is sold in the greatest aggregate quantity before the 180th day after the date of such importation. This provision will apply to appraisement of merchandise only if the importer so elects at the time of filing the entry summary.

      (d)  The price determined under paragraph (c) of this section will be reduced by an amount equal to:

      (1) Any commission usually paid or agreed to be paid, or the addition usually made for profit and general expenses, in connection with sales in the United States of imported merchandise that is of the same class or kind, regardless of the country of exportation, as the merchandise concerned;

      (2) The actual costs and associated costs of transportation and insurance incurred with respect to international shipments of the merchandise concerned from the country of exportation to the United States;

      (3) The usual costs and associated costs of transportation and insurance incurred with respect to shipments of the merchandise concerned from the place of importation to the place of delivery in the United States, if those costs are not included as a general expense under paragraph (d)(1) of this section;

      (4) The customs duties and other Federal taxes currently payable on the merchandise concerned by reason of its importation, and any Federal excise tax on, or measured by the value of, the merchandise for which vendors in the United States ordinarily are liable; and

      (5) But only in the case of price determined under paragraph (c)(3) of this section, the value added by the processing of the merchandise after importation to the extent that the value is based on sufficient information relating to the cost of that processing.

      (e)  (1) The deduction made for profit and general expenses (taken as a whole) will be based upon the importer's profit and general expenses, unless the profit and general expenses are inconsistent with those reflected in sales in the United States of imported merchandise of the same class or kind from all countries, in which case the deduction will be based on the usual profit and general expenses reflected in those sales, as determined from sufficient information. Any State or local tax imposed on the importer with respect to the sale of imported merchandise will be treated as a general expense.

      (2) In determining deductions for commissions and usual profit and general expenses, sales in the United States of the narrowest group or range of imported merchandise of the same class or kind, including the merchandise being appraised, for which sufficient information can be provided, will be examined.

      (f)  The price determined under paragraph (c) of this section will be increased, but only to the extent that the costs are not otherwise included, by an amount equal to the packing costs incurred by the importer or the buyer with respect to the merchandise concerned.

      (g)  For purposes of determining deductive value, any sale to a person who supplies any assist for use in connection with the production or sale for export of the merchandise concerned will be disregarded.

      (h)  The unit price will be established after a sufficient number of units have been sold to an unrelated person. The unit price to be used when the units have been sold in different quantities will be that at which the total volume sold is greater than the total volume sold at any other unit price.

      (1)  Merchandise is sold to an unrelated person from a price list which grants favorable unit prices for purchases made in larger quantities:

      (2)  Two sales to unrelated persons occur: in the first sale, 500 units are sold at a price of $95 each; in the second sale, 400 units are sold at a price of $90 each. In this example, the greatest number of units sold at a particular price is 500; therefore, the unit price in the greatest aggregate quantity is $95.

      (3)  Various quantities are sold to unrelated persons at various prices:

      (i) —(1)  If merchandise has undergone further processing after its importation into the United States and the importer elects the method specified in paragraph (c)(3) of this section, deductions made for the value added by that processing will be based on objective and quantifiable data relating to the cost of the work performed. Accepted industry formulas, recipes, methods of construction, and other industry practices would form the basis for the deduction. That deduction also will reflect amounts for spoilage, waste, or scrap derived from the further processing.

      (2)  If the imported merchandise loses its identity as a result of further processing, the method specified in paragraph (c)(3) of this section will not be applicable unless the value added by the processing can be determined accurately without unreasonable difficulty for either importers or Customs. If the imported merchandise maintains its identity but forms a minor element of the merchandise sold in the United States, the use of paragraph (c)(3) of this section will be unjustified. The Center director shall review each case involving these issues on its merits.

      § 152.106   Computed value.

#### § § 152.106

      (a)  The computed value of imported merchandise is the sum of:

      (1) The cost or value of the materials and the fabrication and other processing of any kind employed in the production of the imported merchandise;

      (2) An amount for profit and general expenses equal to that usually reflected in sales of merchandise of the same class or kind as the imported merchandise that are made by the producers in the country of exportation for export to the United States;

      (3) Any assist, if its value is not included under paragraph (a) (1) or (2) of this section; and

      (4) The packing costs.

      (b)  (1) The cost or value of materials under paragraph (a)(1) of this section will not include the amount of any internal tax imposed by the country of exportation that is directly applicable to the materials or their disposition if the tax is remitted or refunded upon the exportation of the merchandise in the production of which the materials were used.

      (2) The amount for profit and general expenses under paragraph (a)(2) of this section will be based upon the producer's profit and general expenses, unless the producer's profit and general expenses are inconsistent with those usually reflected in sales of merchandise of the same class or kind as the imported merchandise that are made by producers in the country of exportation for export to the United States. In that case, the amount under paragraph (a)(2) of this section will be based on the usual profit and general expenses of such producers in those sales, as determined from “sufficient information”. See § 152.102(j).

      (c)  The amount for profit and general expenses will be taken as a whole. If the producer's profit figure is low and general expenses high, those figures taken together nevertheless may be consistent with those usually reflected in sales of imported merchandise of the same class or kind.

      (1)  A product is introduced into the United States, and the producer accepts either no profit or a low profit to offset the high general expenses required to introduce the product into this market. If the producer can demonstrate that there is a low profit on sales of the imported merchandise because of peculiar commercial circumstances, the actual profit figures will be accepted provided the producer has valid commercial reasons to justify them and his pricing policy reflects the usual pricing policies in the industry.

      (2)  Producers have been forced to lower prices temporarily because of an unforseeable drop in demand, or they sell merchandise to complement a range of merchandise being produced in the United States and accept a low profit to maintain competitiveness. If the producer's own figures for profit and general expenses are not consistent with those usually reflected in sales of merchandise of the same class or kind as the merchandise being valued which are made in the country of exportation for export to the United States, the amount for profit and general expenses will be based upon reliable and quantifiable information other than that supplied by or on behalf of the producer of the merchandise.

      (d)  Computed value also will include an amount equal to the apportioned value of any assists used in the production of the imported merchandise and the packing costs for the imported merchandise. The value of any engineering, development, artwork, design work, and plans and sketches undertaken in the United States will be included in computed value only to the extent that their value has been charged to the producer. Depending on the producer's method of accounting, the value of assists may be included (duplicated) in the producer's cost of materials, fabrication, and other processing, or in the general expenses. If duplication occurs, a separate amount for the value of the assists will not be added to the other elements as it is not intended that any component of computed value be included twice.

      (e)  Sales for export to the United States of the narrowest group or range of imported merchandise, including the merchandise being appraised, will be examined to determine usual profit and general expenses. For the purpose of computed value, merchandise of the same class or kind must be from the same country as the merchandise being appraised.

      (f)  (1) It will be presumed that the computed value of the imported merchandise cannot be determined if:

      (i) The importer is unable to provide required computed value information within a reasonable time, and/or

      (ii) The foreign producer refuses to provide, or is legally prevented from providing, that information.

      (2) If information other than that supplied by or on behalf of the producer is used to determine computed value, the Center director shall inform the importer, upon written request, of:

      (i) The source of the information,

      (ii) The data used, and

      (iii) The calculation based upon the specified data,

      § 152.107   Value if other values cannot be determined or used.

#### § § 152.107

      (a)  If the value of imported merchandise cannot be determined or otherwise used for the purposes of this subpart, the imported merchandise will be appraised on the basis of a value derived from the methods set forth in §§ 152.103 through 152.106, reasonably adjusted to the extent necessary to arrive at a value. Only information available in the United States will be used.

      (b)  The requirement that identical merchandise, or similar merchandise, should be exported at or about the same time of exportation as the merchandise being appraised may be interpreted flexibly. Identical merchandise, or similar merchandise, produced in any country other than the country of exportation or production of the merchandise being appraised may be the basis for customs valuation. Customs values of identical merchandise, or similar merchandise, already determined on the basis of deductive value or computed value may be used.

      (c)  The “90 days” requirement for the sale of merchandise referred to in § 152.105(c) may be administered flexibly.

      § 152.108   Unacceptable bases of appraisement.

#### § § 152.108

      For the purposes of this subpart, imported merchandise may not be appraised on the basis of:

      (a) The selling price in the United States of merchandise produced in the United States;

      (b) A system that provides for the appraisement of imported merchandise at the higher of two alternative values;

      (c) The price of merchandise in the domestic market of the country of exportation;

      (d) A cost of production, other than a value determined under § 152.106 for merchandise that is identical merchandise, or similar merchandise, to the merchandise being appraised;

      (e) The price of merchandise for export to a country other than the United States;

      (f) Minimum values for appraisement;

      (g) Arbitrary or fictitious values.

      (a) These parties in interest, or their agents, make a joint determination of the quantities being delivered, or,

      (b) The carrier bringing the shipment to the port, at its option, independently declares the quantities available for delivery by filing with the port director, no later than the close of business on the next working day after a determination of quantities is made, a signed statement that:

      (1) An independent determination of quantities of merchandise available for delivery has been made, with the date of the determination shown;

      (2) At least 4 days have elapsed since the consignee or his agent was notified that Customs has authorized delivery; and,

      (3) The merchandise was and is available for delivery.

      § 158.2   Shortages in packages released under immediate delivery or entry.

#### § § 158.2

      An importer may file an entry summary for consumption or an entry summary for warehouse for less than the invoiced and manifested number of packages in a shipment “permitted” and delivered to him or deposited in a bonded warehouse under the immediate delivery procedure in § 142.21 of this chapter, or under the entry documentation in § 142.3(a), if he files with the entry summary a Customs Form 5931 in triplicate. The Customs Form 5931 shall be completed by the importer with attached copies of the dock receipt or other documents evidencing nonreceipt of the lost or missing packages.

      § 158.3   Allowance for lost or missing packages included in an entry summary.

#### § § 158.3

      Allowance shall be made in the assessment of duties for lost or missing packages of merchandise included in an entry summary whenever it is established to the satisfaction of the Center director before the liquidation of the entry summary becomes final that the merchandise claimed to be lost or missing was not “permitted.” A claim for such allowance shall be made on Customs Form 5931, in triplicate, executed by the importer and the importing carrier or bonded carrier, as appropriate. When the importing or bonded carrier refuses to execute the Customs Form 5931, a claim may be allowed if the importer properly executes the Customs Form 5931 and attaches copies of the dock receipt or other document evidencing nonreceipt of the lost or missing packages.

#### § § 158.4

      Upon a joint determination or independent determination of quantity as set forth in § 158.1 (a) or (b) resulting in the merchandise being “permitted,” the carrier shall be responsible only for any discrepancy between the manifested quantity and the “permitted” quantity. In the case of an importing carrier, when there is a difference between the quantity shown on the inward foreign manifest and the quantity “permitted,” liquidated damages or duties shall be assessed under the provisions of the carrier's bond or under the provisions of section 448, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1448), unless the carrier corrects his manifest (see § 4.12 of this chapter).

#### § § 158.6

      Allowance for deficiency in the contents of any examination package reported to the port director by a Customs officer shall be made in the liquidation of the entry. No Customs officer except one making an examination contemplated by section 499, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1499), shall report a supposed deficiency to the port director unless it is established to the satisfaction of the reporting officer that the merchandise was not imported.

#### § § 158.7

      Merchandise subject to ad valorem, specific, or compound rates of duty found at the time of importation to be reduced or diminished by a natural force, such as evaporation, or by leakage, shall be appraised in its condition as imported, with an allowance made in the value, weight, quantity, or measure to the extent of the reduction or loss, except when forbidden by law or regulation.

#### § § 158.11

      (a)  When a shipment of nonperishable merchandise, or any portion thereof which shall have been segregated from the remainder of the shipment under Customs supervision at the expense of the importer, is found by the port director to be entirely without commercial value at the time of importation by reason of damage or deterioration, an allowance in duties on such merchandise on the ground of nonimportation shall be made in the liquidation of the entry.

      (b)  In the case of perishable merchandise, an allowance in duties may be made under the following conditions:

      (1) An application for such allowance shall be filed with the port director on Customs Form 4315, or its electronic equivalent, in duplicate, within 96 hours after the unlading of the merchandise and before any of the shipment involved has been removed from the pier (or other area permitted under § 142.2(b)(2) of this chapter) pursuant to the entry permit.

      (2) Should an application filed in accordance with paragraph (b)(1) of this section be withdrawn, the merchandise involved shall thereafter be released upon presentation of an appropriate permit.

      (3) Allowance in duty shall be made in the liquidation of the entry on such of the merchandise covered by the application as is found by the port director to be entirely without commercial value by reason of damage or deterioration.

#### § § 158.12

      (a)  Merchandise which is subject to ad valorem or compound duties and found by the port director to be partially damaged at the time of importation shall be appraised in its condition as imported, with an allowance made in the value to the extent of the damage. However, no allowance shall be made when forbidden by law or regulation; for example, Chapter 72, Additional U.S. Note 3, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (19 U.S.C. 1202), provides that no allowance or reduction of duties for partial damage or loss in consequence of discoloration or rust occurring before importation shall be made upon iron or steel or upon any article of iron or steel.

      (b)  In the case of merchandise subject to specific or compound duties and found to be partially damaged at the time of importation, no allowance may be made in the specific duties or in the weight, quantity, or measure (except that an allowance for any excessive moisture or other impurities may be made in accordance with § 158.13).

The application shall be filed with the port director within 10 days of the port director's receipt of the gauging report or within 10 days of Customs acceptance of the entry's invoice gauge.

      (2)  An application for an allowance in duties under 19 U.S.C. 1507 for products other than petroleum or petroleum products for excessive moisture or other impurities not usually found in or upon such or similar merchandise shall be made by the importer on Customs Form 4315, or its electronic equivalent. The application shall be filed with the port director within 10 days after the report of weight or gauge has been received by the port director or within 10 days after the date upon which the entry or a related document was endorsed to show that invoice weight or gauge has been accepted by the Customs inspector or other Customs officer.

      (b)  If the port director is satisfied after any necessary investigation that the merchandise contains moisture or impurities as described in paragraph (a) of this section, the Center director will make allowance for the amount thereof in the liquidation of the entry.

The date of landing in the case of merchandise forwarded under an entry for immediate transportation is the date of arrival at the port of destination.

      (b)  If the port director is satisfied after any necessary investigation that the claim is valid, allowance in duties shall be made in the liquidation of the entry. Such allowance shall be limited to perishable goods condemned by the health officers or authorities in the original package, unless segregation of the merchandise was under constant Customs supervision at the importer's expense.

    Subpart C—Casualty, Loss, or Theft While in Customs Custody

      § 158.21   Allowance in duties for casualty, loss, or theft while in Customs custody.

#### § § 158.21

#### § § 158.25

      In the case of partial destruction or injury, no application shall be entertained unless the port director shall have had an opportunity to examine the merchandise or the remainder thereof for the purpose of fixing the percentage of injury or destruction. Whether the duty involved is ad valorem, specific, or compound, the percentage of injury for the purpose of the allowance shall be determined by comparing the market value of comparable sound merchandise with the net salvage value of the injured merchandise computed on the basis of the market value of comparable injured merchandise, such comparison to be made as of the time and place of examination.

      § 158.26   Loss or theft in public stores.

#### § § 158.26

      In the case of alleged loss or theft while the merchandise is in the public stores, there shall be filed a declaration of the importer, owner, or ultimate consignee that he did not receive the merchandise and that to the best of his knowledge and belief it was lost or stolen as alleged in the application. If the alleged loss or theft consisted of only a part of an examination package and was discovered after the release of the package from Customs custody, the following evidence shall be submitted:

      (a) A declaration of each cartman, lighterman, or other carrier handling the package between the public stores and the place of delivery, setting forth the condition of the package at the time of receipt and delivery by him and whether or not there was an abstraction of the merchandise while the package was in his possession.

      (1) The time, place, and nature of such casualty;

      (2) That the merchandise was on board the vessel or vehicle, in the warehouse, or otherwise in his charge, as the case may be, at the time of the casualty; and

      (3) That it was totally destroyed and there is no probability of recovering or saving any part thereof, or that it was injured as the result of the casualty.

The sum so advanced shall be placed in a special deposit account and expended to cover the cost of destruction or to meet any deficit should the merchandise be sold and the proceeds of sale be less than the expenses of such sale. After meeting such expenses or deficit, any balance remaining shall be refunded to the importer. However, the applicant may elect to destroy such merchandise under Customs supervision pursuant to the provisions of section 557(c), Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1557(c)).

**Source:** Source: T.D. 73-175, 38 FR 17482, July 2, 1973, unless otherwise noted.

    Subpart A—General Provisions

      § 159.1   Definition of liquidation.

#### § § 159.1

      means the final computation or ascertainment of duties on entries for consumption or drawback entries.

> [T.D. 01-24, 66 FR 16400, Mar. 26, 2001, as amended by CBP Dec. 11-02, 76 FR 2576, Jan. 14, 2011]

      § 159.2   Liquidation required.

#### § § 159.2

      All entries covering imported merchandise, except temporary importation bond entries and those for transportation in bond or for immediate exportation, shall be liquidated. Vessel repair entries are not subject to liquidation under this part (see § 4.14(i)(3) of this chapter).

> [T.D. 73-175, 38 FR 17482, July 2, 1973, as amended by T.D. 01-24, 66 FR 16400, Mar. 26, 2001]

      § 159.3   Rounding of fractions.

#### § § 159.3

      (a)  In the computation of duty on entries, ad valorem rates shall be applied to the values in even dollars, fractional parts of a dollar less than 50 cents being disregarded and 50 cents or more being considered as $1, with all merchandise in the same invoice subject to the same rate of duty to be treated as a unit. However, the total dutiable value of the invoice shall not be increased or decreased by more than the rounding of the total dutiable value to an even dollar. When necessary, fractional parts of a dollar, whether more or less than 50 cents, shall be dropped or taken up as whole dollars in order to avoid such an increase or decrease. If in such cases it is necessary to drop fractional parts of a dollar amounting to 50 cents or more, the lower fractions shall be dropped, and if it is necessary to take up as whole dollars fractional parts less than 50 cents, the larger fractions shall be taken. In the case of two equal fractions, the one subject to the lower rate of duty shall be dropped or taken up, as the case may be. In determining a rate of duty dependent upon value, fractional parts of a dollar shall be considered.

      (b)  Except in the case of alcoholic beverages treated under § 159.4, if a rate of duty is specific and $1 or less per unit, fractional quantities, if less than one-half, shall be disregarded, and if one-half or more shall be treated as a whole unit. Subject to the same exception, if a specific rate is more than $1 per unit, duty shall be assessed upon the exact quantity with any fractional part expressed in the form of a decimal extended to two places.

      § 159.4   Alcoholic beverages.

#### § § 159.4

      (a)  Customs duties and internal revenue taxes on alcoholic beverages provided for in headings 2207 and 2208, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS), (19 U.S.C. 1202), and subject to internal revenue taxes shall be collected only on the number of proof gallons and fractional parts thereof, entered or withdrawn for consumption. No internal revenue tax shall be collected on distilled spirits in bulk which have been transferred to Internal Revenue bonded premises in accordance with § 141.102(b) of this chapter. Customs duties and internal revenue taxes on alcoholic beverages other than subheadings 2206.00.30 and 2206.00.90, HTSUS, and distilled spirits provided for in headings 2207 and 2208, shall be collected only on the number of wine gallons and fractional parts thereof, entered or withdrawn for consumption.

      (b)  In the computation of Customs duties on alcoholic beverages provided for in headings 2207 and 2208 (19 U.S.C. 1202), which are also subject to internal revenue taxes, the methods prescribed for the computation of internal revenue taxes on such beverages shall be followed. The following methods apply to the specific beverages shown:

      (1)  The quantity of distilled spirits imported in barrels, kegs, or similar containers shall be ascertained in accordance with the regulations of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. Where distilled spirits are imported in bottles, jugs, or similar containers, Customs duties and taxes shall be collected on the exact quantity contained in each case or other outer container, fractional parts of a gallon being carried out to three decimal places utilizing the proof gallon method of computation.

      (2)  Customs duties and taxes on wines shall be on the basis of a wine gallon of liquid measure equivalent to 231 cubic inches and shall be paid proportionally on all fractional parts of a wine gallon. Fractions of less than one-tenth gallon shall be converted to the nearest one-tenth gallon, and five-hundredths gallon shall be converted to the next full one-tenth gallon.

      (3)  Customs duties and taxes on beer, ale, porter, stout, and other similar fermented beverages, including sake, of any name or description containing one-half of 1 percent or more of alcohol by volume, brewed or produced from malt, wholly or in part, or from any substitute therefor, shall be collected in accordance with section 5051(a), Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (26 U.S.C. 5051(a)).

#### § § 159.5

      The internal revenue taxes imposed on cigars, cigarettes, and cigarette papers and tubes under section 5701 or 7652, Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (26 U.S.C. 5701 or 7652), are determined in accordance with section 5703 of that Code (26 U.S.C. 5703) at the time of removal; that is, on the quantity removed from Customs custody under the entry or withdrawal for consumption. The Customs duties, unlike those on alcoholic beverages, do not necessarily apply only to such quantities.

      § 159.6   Difference between liquidated duties and estimated duties.

#### § § 159.6

      (a)  When there is a net difference of less than $20 between the total amount of duties, fees, taxes, and interest assessed in the liquidation of any entry (other than an informal, mail, or baggage entry) and the total amount of estimated duties, fees, and taxes deposited, including any supplemental deposit, the difference will be disregarded and the entry endorsed “as entered.” In the case of an informal, mail, or baggage entry, the amount of duties, fees, and taxes computed by a CBP officer when the entry is prepared by, or filed with, him will be considered the liquidated assessment.

      (b)  When there is a net difference of less than $20 between the total amount of duties, fees, taxes, and interest found due in the reliquidation of any entry and the total amount of duties, fees, taxes, and interest assessed in the prior liquidation of the entry, the difference will be disregarded except in the following cases:

      (1)  When reliquidation of any entry is made at the importer's request, such as reliquidation following the allowance of a protest under section 514, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1514), or, for entries made before December 18, 2004, a request for correction under section 520(c), Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1520(c)), any refund determined to be due will be refunded even if less than $20.

      (2)  Any refund or increase determined to be due as the result of the reliquidation of an entry in accordance with a court decision and judgment order will be refunded or collected as the case may be.

      (c)  If there is a difference of $20 or more between the duties, fees, taxes, and interest assessed in the liquidation of an entry and the total estimated duties, fees, and taxes deposited, or between the total duties, fees, taxes, and interest assessed in the reliquidation of an entry and those assessed in the prior liquidation, the entry will be endorsed to show the difference and bills or refund checks will be issued.

      (d)  The assessments of customs duties and fees and internal revenue taxes and interest will be separately stated on the entry at the time of liquidation, but the amounts of any differences will be netted when applying the $20 minimum for issuance of a bill or refund check.

#### § § 159.7

      The liquidation of the original warehouse entry shall be followed in determining the liability for duties on a rewarehouse entry, except in the following cases:

      (a)  When any of the following types of merchandise are withdrawn from warehouse for transportation to another port, they will be excluded from the liquidation of the original warehouse entry, and the liability for duties will be determined by a liquidation of the rewarehouse entry made at the port where the merchandise is withdrawn for consumption or for exportation:

      (1) Alcoholic beverages provided for in headings 2203 through 2208, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) (19 U.S.C. 1202), and subject to internal revenue taxes;

      (2) Cigars, cigarettes, and cigarette papers and tubes subject to internal revenue taxes;

      (3) Tariff-rate quota merchandise; and

      (4) Wool or hair subject to duty at a rate per clean kilogram under Chapter 51, HTSUS.

      (b)  When a rate of customs duty or tax is changed by an act of Congress or a proclamation of the President, any necessary reliquidation of customs duty or tax on merchandise covered by a rewarehouse entry which may be required by reason of the change in rate will be made by the Center director on the effective date of the change.

      (c)  In cases involving shortage, irregular delivery, or nondelivery under the original warehouse withdrawal for transportation, or in other cases when the Center director is of the opinion that circumstances make it inadvisable to follow the liquidation of the original warehouse entry, he will make an appropriate adjustment in the amount of duties to be assessed under the rewarehouse entry.

      (d) —(1)  If an extension has been granted because CBP needs more information and the Center director thereafter determines that more time is needed, he may extend the time for liquidation for an additional period not to exceed 1 year provided he issues the notice required by paragraph (b) of this section before termination of the prior extension period.

      (2)  If the statutory period has been extended for one year at the importer's request, and the importer thereafter determines that additional time is necessary, it may request another extension in writing before the original extension expires, giving reasons for its request. If the Center director finds that good cause (as defined in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section) exists, the official notice of extension extending the time for liquidation for an additional period not to exceed one year will be posted on  and CBP will provide courtesy notice of the extension to the entry filer or its agent and the surety on an entry through a CBP-authorized electronic data interchange system.

      (e)  The total time for which extensions may be granted by the Center director may not exceed 3 years.

      (f)  An entry not liquidated within four years from either the date of entry, or the date of final withdrawal of all the merchandise covered by a warehouse entry, will be deemed liquidated by operation of law at the rate of duty, value, quantity, and amount of duty asserted by the importer of record, unless liquidation continues to be suspended by statute or court order. CBP will endeavor to provide a courtesy notice of liquidation, in accordance with § 159.9(d), in addition to the notice specified in § 159.9(c)(2)(i).

#### § § 159.22

      (a)  The net weight of merchandise dutiable by net weight, or upon a value dependent upon net weight, shall be determined insofar as possible by obtaining the actual weight, or by deducting the actual or schedule tare from the gross weight. Actual tare may be determined on the basis of tests when the tares of the packages in a shipment are reasonably uniform.

      (b)  When the actual net weight or tare cannot reasonably be determined and no schedule tare is applicable, liquidation may be made on the basis of the invoice net weight or tare.

      (c)  The following tares, which, from experience, have proved to be the average for certain classes of merchandise shall be known as schedule tares and shall be applied, except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section:

      (d)  In the following circumstances, the actual tare shall be ascertained and in so doing the weigher shall empty and weigh as many casks, boxes, and other coverings as he may deem necessary:

      (1) If the importer is not satisfied with the invoice tare or with the schedule tare;

      (2) If the Center director is of the opinion that the invoice or schedule tare does not correctly represent the tare of the merchandise; or

      (3) If the weigher has reason to believe that the invoice or schedule tare is greater than the real tare.

      (e)  When it is impracticable to ascertain the actual tare, the weigher shall state in his report what, in his judgment, constitutes a fair tare allowance.

      (f)  In determining the total dutiable value of merchandise which is subject to ad valorem duty and appraised on the basis of weight, liquidation shall be made on the same basis as appraisement. For example, if appraisement is made on the basis of gross weight, the unit value shall be multiplied by the total gross weight in computing the total value even though net weight may be used for other purposes in liquidation, such as in determining total specific duties.

      § 159.61   General.

#### § § 159.61

      (a)  Under section 754 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended by Public Law 106-387, 114 Stat. 1549 (19 U.S.C. 1675c), known as the Continued Dumping and Subsidy Offset Act of 2000, assessed duties received on or after October 1, 2000 under a countervailing duty order, an antidumping duty order, or a finding under the Antidumping Act of 1921, will be distributed, as provided under this subpart, to affected domestic producers for certain qualifying expenditures that these affected domestic producers incur after the issuance of such an antidumping duty order or finding, or countervailing duty order. This distribution is called the continued dumping and subsidy offset.

      (b) —(1)  Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, an “affected domestic producer” under paragraph (a) of this section means any manufacturer, producer, farmer, rancher or worker representative (including any association of such persons) that remains in operation continuing to produce the product covered by the antidumping duty order or finding or countervailing duty order, and that was a petitioner or an interested party that supported a petition concerning an antidumping duty order, a finding under the Antidumping Act of 1921, or a countervailing duty order that was entered. It is the responsibility of the U.S. International Trade Commission (USITC) to ascertain and timely forward to Customs a list of the domestic producers potentially considered “affected domestic producers” eligible to receive a distribution in connection with each order or finding. In addition to the potential “affected domestic producers” set forth on the USITC list, the following parties also are potential “affected domestic producers”:

      (i)  In the case of a company that has succeeded to the operations of a predecessor company that appeared on the USITC list, the successor company may file a certification to claim an offset as an affected domestic producer on behalf of the predecessor company. In its certification, the company must name the predecessor company to which it has succeeded and it must describe in detail the duly authorized succession by which it is entitled to file the certification.

      (ii)  A member company of an association appearing on the USITC list for an order or finding may file a certification to claim an offset as an affected domestic producer, even though the member company does not itself appear on the USITC list, provided that the company also meets the other requirements of the statute. In its certification, the company must name the association of which it is a member and the company must specifically establish that it was a member of the association at the time the association filed the petition with the USITC.

      (2)  A party who is named on the USITC list is not an “affected domestic producer” under the following circumstances:

      (i)  A company, business or person that has ceased production of the product covered by the antidumping duty order or finding, or countervailing duty order,  did not manufacture that product at all during the fiscal year that is the subject of the disbursement, is not an affected domestic producer under this section.

      (ii) —(A)  A company, business or person is not an affected domestic producer if that company, business, or person has been acquired by another company or business that is related to a company that opposed the antidumping or countervailing duty investigation that led to the order or finding. For purposes of this paragraph, a company, business or person is related to another company, business or person if:

      () The company, business or person directly or indirectly controls or is controlled by the other company, business or person;

      () A third party directly or indirectly controls both companies, businesses or persons; or

      () Both companies, businesses or persons directly or indirectly control a third party and there is reason to believe that the relationship causes the first company, business or person to act differently than a nonrelated party.

      (B)  For purposes of paragraphs (b)(2)(ii)(A)() through (b)(2)(ii)(A)() of this section, one party would be considered to directly or indirectly control another party if the party was legally or operationally in a position to exercise restraint or direction over the other party.

      (c)  Qualifying expenditures which may be offset by a distribution of assessed antidumping and countervailing duties must fall within the categories described in paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(10) of this section. These expenditures must be incurred after the issuance, and prior to the termination, of the antidumping duty order or finding or countervailing duty order under which the distribution is sought. Further, these expenditures must be related to the production of the same product that is the subject of the related order or finding, with the exception of expenses incurred by associations which must relate to a specific case.

      (1) Manufacturing facilities;

      (2) Equipment;

      (3) Research and development;

      (4) Personnel training;

      (5) Acquisition of technology;

      (6) Health care benefits for employees paid for by the employer;

      (7) Pension benefits for employees paid for by the employer;

      (8) Environmental equipment, training, or technology;

      (9) Acquisition of raw materials and other inputs; and

      (10) Working capital or other funds needed to maintain production.

      § 159.62   Notice of distribution.

#### § § 159.62

      (a)  At least 90 days before the end of a fiscal year, Customs will publish in the  a notice of intention to distribute assessed duties received as the continued dumping and subsidy offset for that fiscal year. The notice will include the list of domestic producers, based upon the list supplied by the USITC (see § 159.61(b)(1)), that would be potentially eligible to receive the distribution.

      (b)  The notice of intention to distribute the offset will also contain the following:

      (1) The case name and number of the particular order or finding concerned, together with the dollar amount contained in the special account for that order or finding as of June 1 of the subject fiscal year (see § 159.64(a)(1)); and

The certification must enumerate the qualifying expenditures incurred by the domestic producer since the issuance of an order or finding for which a distribution has not previously been made, and it must demonstrate that the domestic producer is eligible to receive a distribution as an affected domestic producer.

      (b)  While there is no established format for a certification, the certification must identify the date of the  notice under which it is submitted, and the case name and the number of the particular order or finding cited in the  notice. The certification must be executed and dated by a party legally authorized to bind the domestic producer. The certification must also state that the information contained in the certification is true and accurate to the best of the certifier's knowledge and belief under penalty of law, and that the domestic producer has records to support the qualifying expenditures being claimed.

      (1)  The certification must include the following identifying information related to the domestic producer:

      (i) The name of the domestic producer and any name qualifier, if applicable (for example, any other name under which the domestic producer does business or is also known);

      (ii) The address of the domestic producer (if a post office box, the secondary street address must also be included);

      (iii) The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) number (with suffix) of the domestic producer, employer identification number, or social security number, as applicable;

      (iv) The specific business organization of the domestic producer (corporation, partnership, sole proprietorship); and

      (v) The name(s) of any individual(s) designated by the domestic producer as the contact person(s) concerning the certification, together with the phone number(s) and/or facsimile transmission number(s) and electronic mail (email) address(es) for the person(s).

      (2)  In calculating the amount of the distribution being claimed as an offset, the certification must enumerate the following:

      (i) The total amount of qualifying expenditures currently and previously certified by the domestic producer, and the amount certified by category (see § 159.61(c)(1) through (c)(10));

      (ii) The total amount of those expenditures which have been the subject of any prior distribution under section 754, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1675c); and

      (iii) The net amount for new and remaining qualifying expenditures being claimed in the current certification (the total amount currently and previously certified as noted in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section minus the total amount the subject of any prior distribution as noted in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section).

      (3)  The certification must contain a statement that the domestic producer desires to receive a distribution and is eligible to receive the distribution as an affected domestic producer (see § 159.61(b)(1) and (b)(2)).

      (i)  The affected domestic producer must affirm that the net amount certified for distribution does not encompass any qualifying expenditures for which distribution has previously been made (see paragraphs (b)(2)(ii) and (b)(2)(iii) of this section).

      (ii)  Where the domestic producer is listed as an affected domestic producer on more than one order or finding covering the same product and files a separate certification for each order or finding using the same qualifying expenditures as the basis for distribution in each case, each certification must list all the other orders or findings where the producer is claiming the same qualifying expenditures.

      (iii)  The statement must include information as to whether the domestic producer remains in operation and continues to produce the product covered by the particular order or finding under which the distribution is sought (see § _1_59.61(b)(2)(i)). In addition, the domestic producer must state whether it has been acquired by a company or business that is related to a company, within the meaning of § 159.61(b)(2)(ii)(A)() through (), that opposed the antidumping or countervailing duty investigation that resulted in the order or finding under which the distribution is sought.

      (c)  A certification that is submitted in response to a notice of distribution and received within 60 days after the date of publication of the notice in the  may be reviewed before acceptance to ensure that all informational requirements are complied with and that any amounts set forth in the certification for current and prior qualifying expenditures, including the amount claimed for distribution, appear to be correct (see paragraph (b)(2) of this section). A certification that is found to be materially incorrect or incomplete will be returned to the domestic producer within 15 days after the close of the 60-day filing period. Within 10 days of the date that Customs returns a certification as being materially incorrect or incomplete, Customs must receive a corrected certification from the affected domestic producer. Customs will make every effort to assist companies to perfect their certifications and will not return claims for minor errors or omissions. However, it remains the sole responsibility of the domestic producer to ensure that the certification is correct, complete and satisfactory so as to demonstrate the entitlement of the domestic producer to the distribution requested. Failure to ensure that the certification is correct, complete and satisfactory as provided in this paragraph will result in the domestic producer not receiving a distribution.

      (d)  Certifications are subject to verification. Parties, therefore, are required to maintain the accounting records used in developing their claims, for a period of five years after the filing of the certification. The records supporting certifications must be those that are normally kept in the ordinary course of business (see § 163.1(a)(1) and (a)(2)(vi) of this chapter). Parties must be able to demonstrate that their records specifically support each qualifying expenditure enumerated in a certification. In addition, the claimant must be able to support how qualifying expenditures are determined to be related to the production of the product covered by the order or finding.

      (e)  The name of the affected domestic producer, the total dollar amount claimed by that party on the certification, as well as the total dollar amount that Customs actually disburses to that company as an offset, will be available for disclosure to the public (see § 159.64(g)(1)). The submission of the certification will be construed as an understanding and acceptance on the part of the domestic producer that this information will be disclosed to the public. Alternatively, a statement in a certification that this information is proprietary and exempt from disclosure will result in Customs rejection of the certification.

      § 159.64   Distribution of offset.

#### § § 159.64

      (a) —(1)  As directed in the legislation (19 U.S.C. 1675c(e)), Customs will establish Special Accounts for each antidumping duty order or finding or countervailing duty order, into which funds will be transferred as set out in paragraph (b) of this section. All distributions to affected domestic producers will be made from the _Special Accounts._

      (2)  In order to properly manage and account for dumping and subsidy offsets, as well as any requisite refunds to importers, Customs will also establish _Clearing Accounts._ All estimated antidumping and countervailing duties received pursuant to an antidumping or countervailing order or finding in effect on January 1, 1999, or thereafter, will be deposited into a Clearing Account.

      (b) —(1)  (i) No later than 60 days after the end of a fiscal year, Customs will distribute the assessed duties transferred from the Clearing Accounts and received into the Special Accounts. The amount distributed shall be referred to as the dumping and subsidy offset;

      (ii) Transfers from the Clearing Accounts to the Special Accounts will be made by Customs throughout the fiscal year. Transfers will occur between a Clearing Account and a Special Fund Account when an entry upon which antidumping or countervailing duties are owed is properly liquidated pursuant to an order, finding or receipt of liquidation instructions;

      (iii) The amount transferred at liquidation to the Special Account will be dependent upon the amount actually collected on the entry and in the Clearing Account. Following liquidation, additional transfers will be made on the liquidated entry to the corresponding Special Account, as additional antidumping or countervailing duties are collected.

      (2)  If any of the underlying entries composing a prior distribution should reliquidate for a refund, such refund will be recovered from the corresponding Special Account. Similarly, refunds to importers resulting from any court action involving those entries will also be recovered from the corresponding Special Account. Refunds to importers will not be delayed pending the recovery of overpayments from domestic producers as set out in paragraph (b)(3) of this section.

      (3)  Overpayments to affected domestic producers resulting from subsequent reliquidations and/or court actions and determined by Customs to be not otherwise recoverable from the corresponding Special Account as set out in paragraph (b)(2) of this section will be collected from the affected domestic producers. The amount of each affected domestic producer's bill will be directly proportional to the total dumping and subsidy offset amounts that the affected domestic producer previously received under the related Special Account. All available collection methods will be used by Customs to collect outstanding bills, including but not limited to, administrative offset. Interest at the same rate set out at § 24.3a(c) of this chapter will begin to accrue on unpaid bills 30 days from the bill date.

      (c)  (1) If the total amount of the certified net claims filed by affected domestic producers does not exceed the amount of the offset available for distribution in the corresponding Special Account, the certified net claim for each affected domestic producer will be paid in full.

      (2) If the certified net claims exceed the dumping and subsidy offset amount available in the corresponding Special Account, such offset will be made on a pro rata basis based on each affected domestic producer's total certified claim.

      (3) In any case where the distribution is not for the entire certified qualifying expenditure submitted by an affected domestic producer, and if the affected domestic producer believes that the reduction was the result of clerical error or mistake by Customs, it must file a request for reconsideration within 30 calendar days to the address given in the notification. After considering the matter, the Customs Service will notify the party requesting reconsideration of its decision. However, any adjustments will be made only from funds remaining in the account for that case in the current or future fiscal years, and will be paid prior to any future distributions.

      (d)  (1) A Special Account will be terminated and a final distribution will occur when:

      (i) The order or finding with respect to which the account was established has terminated; and

      (ii) All entries relating to the order or finding are liquidated, all outstanding amounts collected or properly accounted for by Customs, all related protests, petitions, and court actions fully concluded, and all refunds due to importers on the underlying entries are paid in full.

      (2) Once the requirements set out in paragraph (d)(1) of this section have been met, notice of a final distribution will be issued pursuant to § 159.62.

      (3) Amounts not timely claimed under the notice of final distribution will be permanently deposited into the General Fund of the Treasury.

      (e)  In accordance with Federal appropriations law, and Treasury guidelines on Special Accounts, funds in such accounts are not interest-bearing unless specified by Congress. Likewise, funds being held in Clearing Accounts are not interest-bearing unless specified by Congress. Therefore, no interest will accrue in these accounts. However, statutory interest charged on antidumping and countervailing duties at liquidation will be transferred to the Special Account, when collected from the importer.

      (f)  Except as provided in paragraphs (b)(3) and (c)(3) of this section, any distribution made to an affected domestic producer under this section shall be final and conclusive on the affected domestic producer.

      (g)  Although it is not mandated in the law (19 U.S.C. 1675c), Customs will issue an annual report on the disbursements. This report will be available to the public via the Customs website. The annual report will address any initiatives that have been implemented to improve the liquidation and disbursement process. In addition, the annual report will include the information described in paragraphs (g)(1) and (g)(2) of this section.

      (1)  The annual report will include the following information concerning those parties that have submitted certifications for a distribution of the offset with respect to each order or finding as identified by its case number:

      (i) The name of the claimant;

      (ii) The total dollar amount claimed by that party on its certification; and

      (iii) The total dollar amount disbursed to that company by Customs.

      (2)  The annual report will include the following general information for each order or finding as identified by its case number:

      (i) The number of entries and dollar amounts in the clearing account at the beginning of each fiscal year;

      (ii) The number and amount of Customs re-liquidations during the fiscal year; and

      (iii) The dollar amounts remaining uncollected from Customs bills issued during the fiscal year.

    § 159.0   Scope.

#### § § 159.0

    This part sets forth general rules for the liquidation of entries. Certain specific procedures affecting liquidation appear in other parts of this chapter; e.g., part 158 of this chapter covers allowance for lost or damaged merchandise.

If, after the cargo has been discharged, passengers and their baggage landed, and the baggage of officers and crewmembers examined and passed, the port director or special agent in charge believes that sufficient grounds exist to justify the continuance of Customs supervision of the vessel, the commanding officer or master of the vessel shall be advised accordingly.

Any person who directs, assists financially or otherwise, or is in any way concerned in any such unlawful activity shall be liable to a penalty equal to the value of the article or articles involved.

      (c)  Unless specifically authorized by law, clearance of vessels within the common carrier exception of section 594, Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1594), shall not be refused for the purpose of collecting a fine imposed upon the master or owner, unless either of them was a party to the illegal act. The Government's remedy in such cases is limited to an action against the master or owner.

      (d)  (1) When a vessel owned or chartered under bareboat charter by the Maritime Administration and operated for its account becomes liable for the payment of a penalty incurred for violation of the Customs revenue or navigation laws, clearance of the vessel shall not be withheld nor shall any proceedings be taken against the vessel itself looking to the enforcement of such liability.

      (2) This exemption shall not in any way be considered to relieve the master of any such vessel or other person incurring such penalties from personal liability for payment.

The notice shall inform any interested party in a case involving forfeiture of seized property that unless the petitioner provides an express agreement to defer judicial or administrative forfeiture proceedings until completion of the administrative process, the case will be referred promptly to the U.S. attorney or the Department of Justice if the penalty was assessed under section 592, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1592), for institution of judicial proceedings, or summary forfeiture proceedings will be begun. For violations involving the possession of personal use quantities of a controlled substance, also see § 171.55.

      (b)  The notice shall contain the following:

      (1) The provisions of law alleged to have been violated;

      (2) A description of the specific acts or omissions forming the basis of the alleged violations;

      (c)  In the case of smuggled articles of small value, demand shall be made for immediate deposit of an amount equivalent to the domestic value of the articles on account of the liability to a penalty incurred as distinct from liability of the goods to forfeiture. Such sum shall be deposited whether or not a petition for relief is filed in accordance with part 171 of this chapter. A demand for deposit need not be made in connection with any liability incurred by the master of a vessel under the provisions of section 453, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1453).

In the case of property subject to forfeiture, the Fines, Penalties, and Forfeitures Officer, where appropriate, shall complete administrative forfeiture proceedings or shall refer the matter promptly to the U.S. attorney, or the Department of Justice if the case arose under section 592, in accordance with the provisions of subparagraph (c) below, unless the Commissioner of Customs expressly authorizes other action.

      (b)  Nothing in these regulations is intended to prevent the institution of forfeiture proceedings before completion of the administrative remission or mitigation procedures pursuant to section 618, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1618).

      (c)  If the seized property is not eligible for administrative forfeiture, and neither a petition for relief in accordance with part 171 of this chapter, nor an offer to pay the domestic value as provided for in § 162.44, is made within 30 days (unless additional time has been authorized under part 171 of this chapter), the Fines, Penalties, and Forfeitures Officer shall refer the case promptly to the U.S. attorney for the judicial district in which the seizure was made, or the Department of Justice if the penalty was assessed under section 592.

      If seizure is made under a statute which provides that the property may be seized and proceeded against by libel, the summary forfeiture procedures set forth in §§ 162.45, 162.46, and 162.47 do not apply. Such cases shall be referred to the U.S. attorney.

The term “domestic value” as used therein shall mean the price at which such or similar property is freely offered for sale at the time and place of appraisement, in the same quantity or quantities as seized, and in the ordinary course of trade. If there is no market for the seized property at the place of appraisement, such value in the principal market nearest to the place of appraisement shall be reported.

      (b)  The basis for a claim for forfeiture value or for an assessment of a penalty relating to the forfeiture value of property not under seizure is the domestic value as defined in paragraph (a) of this section, except that the value shall be fixed as of the date of the violation. In the case of entered merchandise, the date of the violation shall be the date of the entry, or the date of the filing of the document, or the commission of the act forming the basis of the claim, whichever is later.

      (ii) The Fines, Penalties, and Forfeitures Officer is satisfied that the claimant has, in fact, a substantial interest in the property; and

      (iii) Entry of the seized property into the commerce of the United States is not prohibited by law.

      (2)  The Fines, Penalties, and Forfeitures Officer shall refer to the Commissioner of Customs any offer where it appears that the claimant does not have a substantial interest in the seized property or where it appears it would not be in the best interest of the United States to accept.

      (c)  The Fines, Penalties, and Forfeitures Officer shall retain custody of the property pending payment of the amount of the offer when the application is approved.

      (1) Describe the property seized and in the case of motor vehicles, specify the motor and serial numbers;

      (2) State the time, cause, and place of seizure;

      (3) State that any person desiring to claim property must appear at a designated place and file with the Fines, Penalties, and Forfeitures Officer within 20 days from the date of first publication of the notice a claim to such property and a bond in the sum of $5,000 or 10% of the value of the claimed property, whichever is lower, but not less than $250, in default of which the property will be disposed of in accordance with the law; and

      (4) State the name and place of residence of the person to whom any vessel or merchandise seized for forfeiture under the navigation laws belongs or is consigned, if that information is known to the Fines, Penalties, and Forfeitures Officer.

      (b)  (1) If the appraised value of any property in one seizure from one person, other than Schedule I and Schedule II controlled substances (as defined in 21 U.S.C. 802(6) and 812), exceeds $5,000, the notice will be published by its posting on an official Government forfeiture Web site for at least 30 consecutive days. Information pertaining to the Government forfeiture Web site will be posted in a conspicuous place that is accessible to the public at all customhouses and all sector offices of the U.S. Border Patrol. In CBP's sole discretion, and as circumstances warrant, additional publication for at least three successive weeks in a print medium may be provided. All known parties-in-interest will be notified in writing of the Government Web site address and the date of Internet publication (and pertinent information regarding print publication, when appropriate).

      (2) In all other cases, except for Schedule I and Schedule II controlled substances (see § 162.45a), the notice will be published by its posting on an official Government forfeiture Web site for at least 30 consecutive days and by its posting for at least three successive weeks in a conspicuous place that is accessible to the public at the customhouse located nearest the place of seizure or the appropriate sector office of the U.S. Border Patrol. All known parties-in-interest will be notified in writing of the Government Web site address and the date of Internet publication (and pertinent information regarding print publication, when appropriate). The posting at the customhouse or sector office will contain the date of on-site posting. Articles of small value of the same class or kind included in two or more seizures will be advertised as one unit.

      (c)  Publication of the notice of seizure and intent to summarily forfeit and dispose of property eligible for such treatment may be delayed for a period not to exceed 30 days in those cases where the Fines, Penalties, and Forfeitures Officer has reason to believe that a petition for administrative relief in accord with part 171 of this chapter will be filed.

      § 162.45a   Summary forfeiture of Schedule I and Schedule II controlled substances.

#### § § 162.45a

      The Controlled Substances Act (84 Stat. 1242, 21 U.S.C. 801 ) provides that all controlled substances in Schedule I and Schedule II (as defined in 21 U.S.C. 802(6) and 812) that are possessed, transferred, sold or offered for sale in violation of the Act will be deemed contraband, seized and summarily forfeited to the United States (21 U.S.C. 881(f)). The Controlled Substances Import and Export Act (21 U.S.C. 951 ) incorporates by reference this contraband forfeiture provision of 21 U.S.C. 881. See 21 U.S.C. 965. Accordingly, in the case of a seizure of Schedule I or Schedule II controlled substances, the Fines, Penalties, and Forfeitures Officer or his designee will contact the appropriate Drug Enforcement Administration official responsible for issuing permits authorizing the importation of such substances (see 21 CFR part 1312). If upon inquiry the Fines, Penalties, and Forfeitures Officer or his designee is notified that no permit for lawful importation has been issued, he will declare the seized substances contraband and forfeited pursuant to 21 U.S.C. 881(f). Inasmuch as such substances are Schedule I and Schedule II controlled substances, the notice procedures set forth in § 162.45 are inapplicable. When seized controlled substances are required as evidence in a court proceeding, they will be preserved to the extent and in the quantities necessary for that purpose.

      (a)  If no petition for relief from the forfeiture is filed in accordance with the provision of part 171 of this chapter, or if a petition was filed and has been denied, and the property is not retained for official use, it shall be disposed of in accordance with section 609, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1609) or section 491(b), Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1491(b)).

      (b)  Before seized drugs, insecticides, seeds, plants, nursery stock, and other articles required to be inspected by other Government agencies are sold, they shall be inspected by a representative of such agency to ascertain whether or not they meet the requirements of the laws and regulations of that agency, and if found not to meet such requirements, they shall be destroyed forthwith.

      (c) —(1)  If the forfeited property is cleared for sale, it shall be sold in accordance with the applicable provisions of part 127 of this chapter. The Fines, Penalties, and Forfeitures Officer may postpone the sale of small seizures until he believes the proceeds of a consolidated sale will pay all expenses.

      (2)  Property shall be moved to and sold at such other Customs port as the Commissioner of Customs may direct pursuant to the provisions of section 611, Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1611), if:

      (i) The laws of a State in which property is seized and forfeited prohibit the sale of such property; or

      (ii) The Commissioner is of the opinion that the sale of forfeited property may be made more advantageously at another Customs port.

      (d)  If, after summary forfeiture of property is completed, it appears that the net proceeds of sale will not be sufficient to pay the costs of sale, the Fines, Penalties, and Forfeitures Officer may order destruction of the property. Any vessel or vehicle summarily forfeited for violation of any law respecting the Customs revenue may be destroyed in lieu of the sale thereof when such destruction is authorized by the Commissioner of Customs to protect the revenue.

      (e)  In addition to disposition by sale or destruction as provided for by this section, distilled spirits, wines, and malt liquor may be delivered:

      (1) To any Government agency the Commissioner of Customs or his designee determines has a need for these articles for medical, scientific, or mechanical purposes, or for any other official purpose for which appropriated funds may be expended by a Government agency, or

      (2) By gift to any charitable institution the Commissioner of Customs or his designee determines has a need for the articles for medical purposes.

      (b)  Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, the bond in the penal sum of $5,000 or 10% of the value of the claimed property, whichever is lower, but not less than $250, required by section 608, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, to be filed with a claim for seized property shall be on Customs Form 301, containing the bond conditions set forth in § 113.72 of this chapter.

      (c)  The filing of a claim and the giving of a bond, if required, pursuant to section 608, Tariff Act of 1930, shall not be construed to entitle the claimant to possession of the property. Such action only stops the summary forfeiture proceeding.

      (d)  When the claim and bond, if required, are filed within the 20-day period, the Fines, Penalties, and Forfeitures Officer shall report the case to the U.S. attorney for the institution of condemnation proceedings.

      (e)  Upon satisfactory proof of financial inability to post the bond, the Fines, Penalties, and Forfeitures Officer shall waive the bond requirement for any person who claims an interest in the seized property.

      § 162.48   Disposition of perishable and other seized property.

#### § § 162.48

      (a)  Seized property which is perishable or otherwise enumerated in section 612, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1612), and is covered by the provisions of section 607, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1607), shall be advertised for sale and sold at public auction at the earliest possible date. The Fines, Penalties, and Forfeitures Officer shall proceed to give notice by advertisement of the summary sale for such time as he considers reasonable. This notice shall be of sale only and not notice of seizure and intent to forfeit. The proceeds of the sale shall be held subject to the claims of parties in interest in the same manner as the seized property would have been subject to such claims.

      (b)  (1) If the expense of keeping any vessel, vehicle, aircraft, merchandise or baggage is disproportionate to the value thereof, destruction or other disposition of such property may be ordered by the appropriate Customs officer. Storage expenses are presumed to be disproportionate to the value of the property where the expense has reached or is anticipated to reach 50 percent of the value of the property. The right of a claimant to seized property which has been destroyed or otherwise disposed of shall not be extinguished.

      (2) Publication of a notice of the seizure, regardless of the disposition of the property, will be required pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 1607.

      § 162.74   Prior disclosure.

#### § § 162.74

      (a) —(1) A prior disclosure is made if the person concerned discloses the circumstances of a violation (as defined in paragraph (b) of this section) of 19 U.S.C. 1592 or 19 U.S.C. 1593a, either orally or in writing to a Customs officer before, or without knowledge of, the commencement of a formal investigation of that violation, and makes a tender of any actual loss of duties, taxes and fees or actual loss of revenue in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section. A Customs officer who receives such a tender in connection with a prior disclosure shall ensure that the tender is deposited with the concerned local Customs entry officer.

      (2) A person shall be accorded the full benefits of prior disclosure treatment if that person provides information orally or in writing to Customs with respect to a violation of 19 U.S.C. 1592 or 19 U.S.C. 1593a if the concerned Fines, Penalties, and Forfeitures Officer is satisfied the information was provided before, or without knowledge of, the commencement of a formal investigation, and the information provided includes substantially the information specified in paragraph (b) of this section. In the case of an oral disclosure, the disclosing party shall confirm the oral disclosure by providing a written record of the information conveyed to Customs in the oral disclosure to the concerned Fines, Penalties, and Forfeitures Officer within 10 days of the date of the oral disclosure. The concerned Fines, Penalties and Forfeiture Officer may, upon request of the disclosing party which establishes a showing of good cause, waive the oral disclosure written confirmation requirement. Failure to provide the written confirmation of the oral disclosure or obtain a waiver of the requirement may result in denial of the oral prior disclosure.

      (b)  The term “discloses the circumstances of a violation” means the act of providing to Customs a statement orally or in writing that:

      (1) Identifies the class or kind of merchandise involved in the violation;

      (2) Identifies the importation or drawback claim included in the disclosure by entry number, drawback claim number, or by indicating each concerned Customs port of entry and the approximate dates of entry or dates of drawback claims;

      (3) Specifies the material false statements, omissions or acts including an explanation as to how and when they occurred; and

      (4) Sets forth, to the best of the disclosing party's knowledge, the true and accurate information or data that should have been provided in the entry or drawback claim documents, and states that the disclosing party will provide any information or data unknown at the time of disclosure within 30 days of the initial disclosure date. Extensions of the 30-day period may be requested by the disclosing party from the concerned Fines, Penalties, and Forfeitures Officer to enable the party to obtain the information or data.

      (c)  A person who discloses the circumstances of the violation shall tender any actual loss of duties, taxes and fees or actual loss of revenue. The disclosing party may choose to make the tender either at the time of the claimed prior disclosure, or within 30 days after CBP notifies the person in writing of CBP calculation of the actual loss of duties, taxes and fees or actual loss of revenue. The Fines, Penalties, and Forfeitures Officer may extend the 30-day period if there is good cause to do so. The disclosing party may request that the basis for determining CBP asserted actual loss of duties, taxes or fees be reviewed by Headquarters, provided that the actual loss of duties, taxes or fees determined by CBP exceeds $100,000 and is deposited with CBP, more than 1 year remains under the statute of limitations involving the shipments covered by the claimed disclosure, and the disclosing party has complied with all other prior disclosure regulatory provisions. A grant of review is within the discretion of CBP Headquarters in consultation with the appropriate field office, and such Headquarters review shall be limited to determining issues of correct tariff classification, correct rate of duty, elements of dutiable value, and correct application of any special rules (GSP, CBI, HTS 9802, etc.). The concerned Fines, Penalties, and Forfeitures Officer shall forward appropriate review requests to the Chief, Penalties Branch, Office of International Trade. After Headquarters renders its decision, the concerned Fines, Penalties, and Forfeitures Officer will be notified and the concerned Center director will recalculate the loss, if necessary, and notify the disclosing party of any actual loss of duties, taxes or fees increases. Any increases must be deposited within 30 days, unless the local CBP office authorizes a longer period. Any reductions of the CBP calculated actual loss of duties, or and fees shall be refunded to the disclosing party. Such Headquarters review decisions are final and not subject to appeal. Further, disclosing parties requesting and obtaining such a review waive their right to contest either administratively or judicially the actual loss of duties, taxes and fees or actual loss of revenue finally calculated by CBP under this procedure. Failure to tender the actual loss of duties, taxes and fees or actual loss of revenue finally calculated by CBP shall result in denial of the prior disclosure.

      (d) —(1) If the documents that provide the disclosing information are sent by registered or certified mail, return-receipt requested, and are received by Customs, the disclosure shall be deemed to have been made at the time of mailing.

      (2) If the documents are sent by other methods, including in-person delivery, the disclosure shall be deemed to have been made at the time of receipt by Customs. If the documents are delivered in person, the person delivering the documents will, upon request, be furnished a receipt from Customs stating the time and date of receipt.

      (3) The provision of information that is not in writing but that qualifies for prior disclosure treatment pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section shall be deemed to have occurred at the time that Customs was provided with information that substantially complies with the requirements set forth in paragraph (b) of this section.

      (e) —(1) A written prior disclosure should be addressed to the Commissioner of Customs, have conspicuously printed on the face of the envelope the words “prior disclosure,” and be presented to a Customs officer at the Customs port of entry of the disclosed violation.

      (2) In the case of a prior disclosure involving violations at multiple ports of entry, the disclosing party may orally disclose or provide copies of the disclosure to all concerned Fines, Penalties, and Forfeitures Officers. In accordance with internal Customs procedures, the officers will then seek consolidation of the disposition and handling of the disclosure. In the event that the claimed “multi-port” disclosure is made to a Customs officer other than the concerned Fines, Penalties, and Forfeitures Officer, the disclosing party must identify all ports involved to enable the concerned Customs officer to refer the disclosure to the concerned Fines, Penalties, and Forfeitures Officer for consolidation of the proceedings.

      (f)  Upon receipt of a prior disclosure, the Customs officer shall notify Customs Office of Investigations of the disclosure. In the event the claimed prior disclosure is made to a Customs officer other than the concerned Fines, Penalties, and Forfeitures Officer, it is incumbent upon the Customs officer to provide a copy of the disclosure to the concerned Fines, Penalties, and Forfeitures Officer. The disclosing party may request, in the oral or written prior disclosure, that the concerned Fines, Penalties, and Forfeitures Officer request that the Office of Investigations withhold the initiation of disclosure verification proceedings until after the party has provided the information or data within the time limits specified in paragraph (b)(4) of this section. It is within the discretion of the concerned Fines, Penalties and Forfeitures Officer to grant or deny such requests.

      (g)  A formal investigation of a violation is considered to be commenced with regard to the disclosing party on the date recorded in writing by the Customs Service as the date on which facts and circumstances were discovered or information was received that caused the Customs Service to believe that a possibility of a violation existed. In the event that a party affirmatively asserts a prior disclosure (, identified or labeled as a prior disclosure) and is denied prior disclosure treatment on the basis that Customs had commenced a formal investigation of the disclosed violation, and Customs initiates a penalty action against the disclosing party involving the disclosed violation, a copy of a “writing” evidencing the commencement of a formal investigation of the disclosed violation shall be attached to any required prepenalty notice issued to the disclosing party pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 1592 or 19 U.S.C. 1593a.

      (h)  A formal investigation is deemed to have commenced as to additional violations not included or specified by the disclosing party in the party's original prior disclosure on the date recorded in writing by the Customs Service as the date on which facts and circumstances were discovered or information was received that caused the Customs Service to believe that a possibility of such additional violations existed. Additional violations not disclosed or covered within the scope of the party's prior disclosure that are discovered by Customs as a result of an investigation and/or verification of the prior disclosure shall not be entitled to treatment under the prior disclosure provisions.

      (i) —(1) A disclosing party who claims lack of knowledge of the commencement of a formal investigation has the burden to prove that lack of knowledge. A person shall be presumed to have had knowledge of the commencement of a formal investigation of a violation if before the claimed prior disclosure of the violation a formal investigation has been commenced and:

      (i) Customs, having reasonable cause to believe that there has been a violation of 19 U.S.C. 1592 or 19 U.S.C. 1593a, so informed the person of the type of or circumstances of the disclosed violation; or

      (ii) A Customs Special Agent, having properly identified himself or herself and the nature of his or her inquiry, had, either orally or in writing, made an inquiry of the person concerning the type of or circumstances of the disclosed violation; or

      (iii) A Customs Special Agent, having properly identified himself or herself and the nature of his or her inquiry, requested specific books and/or records of the person relating to the disclosed violation; or

      (iv) Customs issues a prepenalty or penalty notice to the disclosing party pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 1592 or 19 U.S.C. 1593a relating to the type of or circumstances of the disclosed violation; or

      (v) The merchandise that is the subject of the disclosure was seized; or

      (vi) In the case of violations involving merchandise accompanying persons entering the United States or commercial merchandise inspected in connection with entry, the person has received oral or written notification of Customs finding of a violation.

      (2) The presumption of knowledge may be rebutted by evidence that, notwithstanding the foregoing notice, inquiry or request, the person did not have knowledge that an investigation had commenced with respect to the disclosed information.

      (j)  (1) A private party may use statistical sampling to “disclose the circumstances of a violation” and for calculation of lost duties, taxes, and fees or lost revenue for purposes of prior disclosure, provided that the statistical sampling satisfies the criteria in 19 CFR 163.11(c)(3). The prior disclosure must include an explanation of the sampling plan and methodology that meets with CBP's approval. The time period, scope, and any sampling plan employed by the private party, as well as the execution and results of the self-review, are subject to CBP review and approval. In accordance with 19 CFR 163.11(c)(1), in circumstances where the private party and CBP have discussed and accepted the sampling plan and its methodology, or adjustments to it, the private party submitting a prior disclosure employing sampling under this paragraph may not contest the validity of the sampling plan or its methodology, and challenges of the sampling itself will be limited to computational and clerical errors after CBP conducts its review and makes a determination. This is not a waiver of the private party's right to later contest substantive issues it may properly raise under applicable regulations, as provided in 19 CFR 163.11(c)(1).

      (2) If a private party submits a prior disclosure claim employing sampling, CBP may review other transactions from the same time period and scope that are the subject of the prior disclosure.

In that event, the entry shall be liquidated within 90 days after removal of the suspension.

      (iii) The Center director promptly shall notify the importer or consignee concerned and any authorized agent and surety of the importer or consignee in writing of any extension or suspension of the liquidation period.

      (b) When merchandise not covered by an entry is subject to section 592, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1592), a demand shall be made on the importer for payment of the duty estimated to be due on such merchandise.

      (c) Any applicable internal revenue tax shall also be demanded unless the merchandise is to be, or has been, forfeited.

      (a)  In lieu of filing a petition for relief in accordance with part 171 of this chapter, any person claiming property seized by Customs in a non-judicial civil forfeiture proceeding may file a claim with the appropriate Fines, Penalties, and Forfeitures Officer.

      (b)  Unless the Fines, Penalties, and Forfeitures Officer provides additional time to the person filing a claim for seized property pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, the claim must be filed within 35 calendar days after the date the notice of seizure is mailed.

#### § § 162.95

      (a)  Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, a claimant to seized property under 18 U.S.C. 983(a) is entitled to immediate release of the property if:

      (1) The claimant has a possessory interest in the property;

      (2) The claimant has sufficient ties to the community to provide assurance that the property will be available at the time of trial;

      (3) The continued possession of the property by Customs pending the final disposition of forfeiture proceedings will cause substantial hardship to the claimant, such as preventing an individual from working, or leaving an individual homeless; and

      (4) The claimant's likely hardship from the continued possession by Customs of the seized property outweighs the risk that the property will be destroyed, damaged, lost, concealed, or transferred if it is returned to the claimant during the pendency of the proceedings.

      (b)  Immediate release of seized property under paragraph (a) of this section will not apply if the seized property:

      (1) Is contraband, currency or other monetary instrument, or electronic funds, unless, in the case of currency, other monetary instrument or electronic funds, such property comprises the assets of a legitimate business which has been seized;

      (2) Is to be used as evidence of a violation of the law;

      (3) By reason of design or other characteristic, is particularly suited for use in illegal activities; or

      (4) Is likely to be used to commit additional criminal acts if returned to the claimant.

      (c)  A claimant seeking release of property under this section must request possession of the property from the Fines, Penalties, and Forfeitures Officer who issued the notice of seizure. The request need not be made in any particular form, but must be in writing and set forth the basis on which the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section have been met. The request may be filed at any time during which the property remains under seizure.

      (d)  The Fines, Penalties, and Forfeitures Officer may release the property if it is determined to be appropriate under paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section.

      (e)  If the Fines, Penalties, and Forfeitures Officer denies the request for release or fails to make a decision on the request by the 15th calendar day after the date the request is received by Customs, the claimant may file a petition in the district court in which the complaint has been filed, or, if no complaint has been filed, in the U.S. district court in which the seizure warrant was issued or in the U.S. district court for the district in which the property was seized.

#### § § 162.96

      When a person elects to petition for relief before, or in lieu of, filing a claim under § 162.94, any seizure subject to forfeiture under this subpart may be remitted or mitigated pursuant to the provisions of 19 U.S.C. 1618 or 31 U.S.C. 5321(c), as applicable. Any person who accepts a remission or mitigation decision will not be considered to have substantially prevailed in a civil forfeiture proceeding for purposes of collection of any fees, costs or interest from the Government.

    (b) —(1)  Any of the persons listed in § 163.2 may maintain any records, other than records required to be maintained as original records under laws and regulations administered by other Federal government agencies, in an alternative format, provided that the person gives advance written notification of such alternative storage method to the Regulatory Audit, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, 2001 Cross Beam Dr., Charlotte, North Carolina 28217, and provided further that the Director of Regulatory Audit, Charlotte office does not instruct the person in writing as provided herein that certain described records may not be maintained in an alternative format. The written notice to the Director of Regulatory Audit, Charlotte office must be provided at least 30 calendar days before implementation of the alternative storage method, must identify the type of alternative storage method to be used, and must state that the alternative storage method complies with the standards set forth in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. If an alternative storage method covers records that pertain to goods under CBP seizure or detention or that relate to a matter that is currently the subject of an inquiry or investigation or administrative or court proceeding, the appropriate CBP office may instruct the person in writing that those records must be maintained as original records and therefore may not be converted to an alternative format until specific written authorization is received from that CBP office. A written instruction to a person under this paragraph may be issued during the 30-day advance notice period prescribed in this section or at any time thereafter, must describe the records in question with reasonable specificity but need not identify the underlying basis for the instruction, and shall not preclude application of the planned alternative storage method to other records not described therein.

    (2)  Methods commonly used in standard business practice for storage of records include, but are not limited to, machine readable data, CD ROM, and microfiche. Methods that are in compliance with generally accepted business standards will generally satisfy CBP requirements, provided that the method used allows for retrieval of records requested within a reasonable time after the request and provided that adequate provisions exist to prevent alteration, destruction, or deterioration of the records. The following standards must be applied by recordkeepers when using alternative storage methods:

    (i) Operational and written procedures are in place to ensure that the imaging and/or other media storage process preserves the integrity, readability, and security of the information contained in the original records. The procedures must include a standardized retrieval process for such records. Vendor specifications/documentation and benchmark data must be available for CBP review;

    (ii) There is an effective labeling, naming, filing, and indexing system;

    (iii) Except in the case of packing lists ( § 163.4(b)(2)), entry records must be maintained by the importer in their original formats for a period of 120 calendar days from the end of the release or conditional release period, whichever is later, or, if a demand for return to CBP custody has been issued, for a period of 120 calendar days either from the date the goods are redelivered or from the date specified in the demand as the latest redelivery date if redelivery has not taken place. Customs brokers who are not serving as the importer of record and who maintain separate electronic records are exempted from this requirement. This exemption does not apply to any document that is required by law to be maintained as a paper record.

    (iv) An internal testing of the system must be performed on a yearly basis;

    (v) The recordkeeper must have the capability to make, and must bear the cost of, hard-copy reproductions of alternatively stored records that are required by CBP for audit, inquiry, investigation, or inspection of such records; and

    (vi) The recordkeeper must retain and keep available one working copy and one back-up copy of the records stored in a secure location for the required periods as provided in § 163.4.

    (3)  No changes to alternative recordkeeping procedures may be made without first notifying the Director of Regulatory Audit, Office of International Trade, Customs and Border Protection, 2001 Cross Beam Drive, Charlotte, North Carolina 28217. The notification must be in writing and must be provided to the director at least 30 calendar days before implementation of the change.

    (4)  All persons listed in § 163.2 who use alternative storage methods for records and who fail to maintain or produce the records in accordance with this part are subject to penalties pursuant to § 163.6 for entry records or sanctions pursuant to §§ 163.9 and 163.10 for other records.

    (5)  If a person listed in § 163.2 uses an alternative storage method for records that is not in compliance with the conditions and requirements of this section, CBP may issue a written notice informing the person of the facts giving rise to the notice and directing that the alternative storage method must be discontinued in 30 calendar days unless the person provides written notice to the issuing CBP office within that time period that explains, to CBP's satisfaction, how compliance has been achieved. Failure to timely respond to CBP will result in CBP requiring discontinuance of the alternative storage method until a written statement explaining how compliance has been achieved has been received and accepted by CBP.

    § 163.6   Production and examination of entry and other records and witnesses; penalties.

#### § § 163.6

    (a)  Pursuant to written, oral, or electronic notice, any Customs officer may require the production of entry records by any person listed in § 163.2(a) who is required under this part to maintain such records, even if the entry records were required at the time of entry. Any oral demand for entry records shall be followed by a written or electronic demand. The entry records shall be produced within 30 calendar days of receipt of the demand or within any shorter period as Customs may prescribe when the entry records are required in connection with a determination regarding the admissibility or release of merchandise. Should any person from whom Customs has demanded entry records encounter a problem in timely complying with the demand, such person may submit a written or electronic request to Customs for approval of a specific additional period of time in which to produce the records; the request must be received by Customs before the applicable due date for production of the records and must include an explanation of the circumstances giving rise to the request. Customs will promptly advise the requesting person electronically or in writing either that the request is denied or that the requested additional time period, or such shorter period as Customs may deem appropriate, is approved. The mere fact that a request for additional time to produce demanded entry records was submitted under this section shall not by itself preclude the imposition of a monetary penalty or other sanction under this part for failure to timely produce the records, but no such penalty or other sanction will be imposed if the request is approved and the records are produced before expiration of that additional period of time.

    (b) —(1)  The following penalties may be imposed if a person fails to comply with a lawful demand for the production of an entry record and is not excused from a penalty pursuant to paragraph (b)(3) of this section:

    (i) If the failure to comply is a result of the willful failure of the person to maintain, store, or retrieve the demanded record, such person shall be subject to a penalty, for each release of merchandise, not to exceed $100,000, or an amount equal to 75 percent of the appraised value of the merchandise, whichever amount is less; or

    (ii) If the failure to comply is a result of negligence of the person in maintaining, storing, or retrieving the demanded record, such person shall be subject to a penalty, for each release of merchandise, not to exceed $10,000, or an amount equal to 40 percent of the appraised value of the merchandise, whichever amount is less.

    (2) —(i)  In addition to any penalty imposed under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, and except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, if the demanded entry record relates to the eligibility of merchandise for a column 1 special rate of duty in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS), the entry of such merchandise:

    (A) If unliquidated, shall be liquidated at the applicable HTSUS column 1 general rate of duty; or

    (B) If liquidated within the 2-year period preceding the date of the demand, shall be reliquidated, notwithstanding the time limitation in 19 U.S.C. 1514 or 1520, at the applicable HTSUS column 1 general rate of duty.

    (ii)  Any liquidation or reliquidation under paragraph (b)(2)(i)(A) or (b)(2)(i)(B) of this section shall be at the applicable HTSUS column 2 rate of duty if Customs demonstrates that the merchandise should be dutiable at such rate.

    (3)  No penalty may be assessed under paragraph (b)(1) of this section if the person who fails to comply with a lawful demand for entry records can show:

    (i) That the loss of the demanded record was the result of an act of God or other natural casualty or disaster beyond the fault of such person or an agent of the person;

    (ii) On the basis of other evidence satisfactory to Customs, that the demand was substantially complied with;

    (iii) That the record demanded was presented to and retained by Customs at the time of entry or submitted in response to an earlier demand; or

    (iv) That he has been certified as a participant in the Recordkeeping Compliance Program (see § 163.12), that he is generally in compliance with the appropriate procedures and requirements of that program, and that the violation in question is his first violation and was a non-willful violation.

    (4)  Any penalty imposed under paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall be in addition to any other penalty provided by law except for:

    (i) A penalty imposed under 19 U.S.C. 1592 for a material omission of any information contained in the demanded record; or

    (ii) Disciplinary action taken under 19 U.S.C. 1641.

    (5)  A penalty imposed under this section may be remitted or mitigated under 19 U.S.C. 1618.

    (6)  The assessment of a penalty under this section shall not limit or preclude the issuance or enforcement of a summons under this part.

    (c) —(1)  Customs may initiate an investigation, audit or other inquiry for the purpose of:

    (i) Ascertaining the correctness of any entry, determining the liability of any person for duties, taxes and fees due or duties, taxes and fees which may be due, or determining the liability of any person for fines, penalties and forfeitures; or

    (ii) Ensuring compliance with the laws and regulations administered or enforced by Customs.

    (2)  During the course of any investigation, audit or other inquiry, any Customs officer, during normal business hours, and to the extent possible at a time mutually convenient to the parties, may examine, or cause to be examined, any relevant entry or other records by providing the person responsible for such records with reasonable written, oral or electronic notice that describes the records with reasonable specificity. The examination of entry records shall be subject to the notice and production procedures set forth in paragraph (a) of this section, and a failure to produce entry records may result in the imposition of penalties or the taking of other action as provided in paragraph (b) of this section.

    (3)  In addition to, or in lieu of, issuance of an examination notice under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, Customs may issue a summons pursuant to § 163.7, and seek its enforcement pursuant to §§ 163.9 and 163.10, to compel the production of any records required to be maintained and produced under this chapter.

    § 163.7   Summons.

#### § § 163.7

    (a)  During the course of any investigation, audit or other inquiry initiated for the reasons set forth in § 163.6(c), the Commissioner of Customs or his designee, but no designee of the Commissioner below the rank of port director, Center director, field director of regulatory audit or special agent in charge, may issue a summons requiring a person within a reasonable period of time to appear before the appropriate Customs officer and to produce records or give relevant testimony under oath or both. Such a summons may be issued to any person who:

    (1) Imported, or knowingly caused to be imported, merchandise into the customs territory of the United States;

    (i) The name, title, and telephone number of the Customs officer before whom the appearance shall take place;

    (ii) The address within the customs territory of the United States where the person shall appear, not to exceed 100 miles from the place where the summons was served;

    (iii) The time of appearance; and

    (iv) The name, address, and telephone number of the Customs officer issuing the summons.

    (2)  If a summons issued under this section requires the production of records, the summons shall set forth the information specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section and shall also describe the records in question with reasonable specificity.

    (c) —(1)  Any Customs officer is authorized to serve a summons issued under this section if designated in the summons to serve it.

    (2) —(i)  Service upon a natural person shall be made by personal delivery.

    (ii)  Service shall be made upon a domestic or foreign corporation, or upon a partnership or other unincorporated association which is subject to suit under a common name, by delivery to an officer, managing or general agent, or any other agent authorized by appointment or law to receive service of process.

    (3)  On the hearing of an application for the enforcement of a summons, the certificate of service signed by the person serving the summons is prima facie evidence of the facts it states.

    (d)  Testimony of any person taken pursuant to a summons may be taken under oath and when so taken shall be transcribed or otherwise recorded. When testimony is transcribed or otherwise recorded, a copy shall be made available on request to the witness unless for good cause shown the issuing officer determines under 5 U.S.C. 555 that a copy should not be provided. In that event, the witness shall be limited to inspection of the official transcript of the testimony. The testimony or transcript may be in the form of a written statement under oath provided by the person examined at the request of the Customs officer.

    § 163.8   Third-party recordkeeper summons.

#### § § 163.8

    (a)  Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (f) of this section, if a summons issued under § 163.7 to a third-party recordkeeper requires the production of, or the giving of testimony relating to, records pertaining to transactions of any person, other than the person summoned, who is identified in the description of the records contained in the summons, then notice of the summons shall be provided to the person so identified in the summons.

    (b)  The notice of service of summons required by paragraph (a) of this section should be provided by the issuing officer immediately after service of summons is obtained under § 163.7(c), but in no event shall notice be given less than 10 business days before the date set in the summons for the production of records or the giving of testimony.

    (c)  The issuing officer shall ensure that any notice issued under this section includes a copy of the summons and provides the following information:

    (1) That compliance with the summons may be stayed if written direction not to comply with the summons is given by the person receiving notice to the person summoned;

    (2) That a copy of any such direction to not comply and a copy of the summons shall be sent by registered or certified mail to the person summoned and to the Customs officer who issued the summons; and

    (3) That the actions under paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section shall be accomplished not later than the day before the day fixed in the summons as the day upon which the records are to be examined or the testimony is to be given.

    (d)  The Customs officer who issues the summons shall serve the notice required by paragraph (a) of this section in the same manner as is prescribed in § 163.7(c)(2) for the service of a summons, or by certified or registered mail to the last known address of the person entitled to notice.

    (e)  If notice is required by this section, no record may be examined before the date fixed in the summons as the date to produce the records. If the person entitled to notice under paragraph (a) of this section issues a stay of compliance with the summons in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section, no examination of records shall take place except with the consent of the person staying compliance or pursuant to an order issued by a U.S. district court.

    (f) —(1)  The notice provisions of paragraph (a) of this section shall not apply to any summons served on the person, or on any officer or employee of the person, with respect to whose liability for duties, fees, or taxes the summons is issued.

    (2)  The notice provisions of paragraph (a) of this section shall not apply to any summons issued to determine whether or not records of transactions of an identified person have been made or kept.

    (3)  The notice provisions of paragraph (a) of this section and the stay of compliance provisions of paragraph (c) of this section shall not apply with respect to a summons described in paragraph (a) of this section if a U.S. district court determines, upon petition by the issuing Customs officer, that reasonable cause exists to believe that the giving of notice may lead to an attempt:

    (i) To conceal, destroy, or alter relevant records;

    (ii) To prevent the communication of information from other persons through intimidation, bribery, or collusion; or

    (iii) To flee to avoid prosecution, testifying, or production of records.

    § 163.9   Enforcement of summons.

#### § § 163.9

    Whenever a person does not comply with a Customs summons, the issuing officer may request the appropriate U.S. attorney to seek an order requiring compliance from the U.S. district court for the district in which the person is found or resides or is doing business. A person who is entitled to notice under § 163.8(a) shall have a right to intervene in any such enforcement proceeding.

    § 163.10   Failure to comply with court order; penalties.

#### § § 163.10

    (a)  The U.S. district court for any judicial district in which a person served with a Customs summons is found or resides or is doing business may order such person to comply with the summons. Upon the failure of a person to obey a court order to comply with a Customs summons, the court may find such person in contempt and may assess a monetary penalty.

    (b)  If a person fails to comply with a court order to comply with a Customs summons and is adjudged guilty of contempt, the Commissioner of Customs, with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, for so long as that person remains in contempt:

    (1) May prohibit importation of merchandise by that person, directly or indirectly, or for that person's account; and

    (2) May withhold delivery of merchandise imported by that person, directly or indirectly, or for that person's account.

    (c)  If any person remains in contempt for more than 1 year after the Commissioner issues instructions to withhold delivery under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the merchandise shall be considered abandoned and shall be sold at public auction or otherwise disposed of in accordance with subpart E of part 162 of this chapter.

    § 163.11   Audit procedures.

#### § § 163.11

    (a)  In conducting an audit under 19 U.S.C. 1509(b), the CBP auditors, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (f) of this section, will:

    (1) Provide notice, telephonically and in writing, to the person to be audited of CBP's intention to conduct an audit and a reasonable estimate of the time to be required for the audit;

    (2) Inform the person who is to be the subject of the audit, in writing and before commencement of the audit, of that person's right to an entrance conference, at which time the objectives and records requirements of the audit, and any sampling plan to be employed or offsetting that may apply, will be explained and the estimated termination date of the audit will be set. Where a decision on a sampling plan and methodology is not made at the time of the entrance conference, CBP will discuss these matters with the person being audited as soon as possible after the discovery of facts and circumstances that warrant the possible need to employ sampling;

    (3) Provide a further estimate of any additional time for the audit if, during the course of the audit, it becomes apparent that additional time will be required;

    (4) Schedule a closing conference upon completion of the audit on-site work to explain the preliminary results of the audit;

    (5) Complete a formal written audit report within 90 calendar days following the closing conference referred to in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, unless the Executive Director, Regulatory Audit, Office of International Trade, CBP Headquarters, provides written notice to the person audited of the reason for any delay and the anticipated completion date; and

    (6) After application of any disclosure exemptions contained in 5 U.S.C. 552, send a copy of the formal written audit report to the person audited within 30 calendar days following completion of the report.

    (b)  Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (f) of this section, if the estimated or actual termination date of the audit passes without a CBP auditor providing a closing conference to explain the results of the audit, the person audited may petition in writing for a closing conference to the Executive Director, Regulatory Audit, Office of International Trade, Customs and Border Protection, Washington, DC 20229. Upon receipt of the request, the director will provide for the closing conference to be held within 15 calendar days after the date of receipt.

    (c) —(1)  In conducting an audit under this section, regardless of the finality of liquidation under 19 U.S.C. 1514, CBP auditors have the sole discretion to determine the time period and scope of the audit and will examine a sufficient number of transactions, as determined solely by CBP. In addition to examining all transactions to identify loss of duties, taxes, and fees under 19 U.S.C. 1592 or loss of revenue under 19 U.S.C. 1593a, or to determine compliance with any other applicable customs laws or other laws enforced by CBP, CBP auditors, at their sole discretion, may use statistical sampling methods. During the audit, CBP auditors will explain the sampling plan and how the results of the sampling will be projected over the universe of transactions for purposes of calculating lost duties, taxes, and fees or lost revenue and, where appropriate, overpayments and over-declarations eligible for offsetting under paragraph (d) of this section. The person being audited and CBP will discuss the specifics of the sampling plan before audit work under the plan is commenced. Once the sampling plan is accepted, the audited person waives the ability to contest the validity of the sampling plan or its methodology at a later date and challenges of the sampling will be limited to challenging computational and clerical errors. CBP's authority to conduct the audit or employ statistical sampling is not dependent on the audited person's acceptance of the specifics of the sampling plan. An audited person's acceptance of the sampling plan and methodology must be in writing and signed by a management official with authority to bind the company in matters of trade, imports, and/or other affairs under the customs laws, CBP regulations, or other applicable laws. The audited person may submit the signed waiver to the CBP auditor. The appropriate field director, Regulatory Audit, will sign the waiver for CBP. Where the sampling plan or methodology is subsequently adjusted or modified, at CBP's discretion, acceptance of the adjustments or modifications also must be in writing and signed. This is not a waiver of the audited person's right to later contest substantive issues, such as misclassification, undervaluation, etc., that may properly be raised under applicable regulations, including in a request for CBP Headquarters advice under 19 CFR 171.14, a request for CBP Headquarters review under 19 CFR 162.74(c), a response to a prepenalty notice issued by CBP under 19 U.S.C. 1592(b)(1) or 19 U.S.C. 1593a(b)(1), a petition submitted in response to a penalty notice issued by CBP under 19 U.S.C. 1592(b)(2) or 19 U.S.C. 1593a(b)(2) (19 CFR part 171) and 19 U.S.C. 1618, a supplemental petition submitted under 19 CFR 171.61 and 171.62, or any action commenced in a court of proper jurisdiction.

    (2)  For purposes of this section, “projection” of sampling results over the universe of transactions is the process by which the results obtained from the sample entries actually examined are applied to the universe of entries set within the time period and scope of the sampling plan to yield a reliable assessment of that which is sought to be ascertained or measured in the audit, including, but not limited to, lost duties or revenue, or overpayments or over-declarations, as described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section.

    (3)  CBP auditors have the sole discretion to use statistical sampling techniques when:

    (i) Review of 100 percent of the transactions is impossible or impractical;

    (ii) The sampling plan is prepared in accordance with generally recognized sampling procedures; and

    (iii) The sampling procedure is executed in accordance with that plan.

    (4)  CBP may authorize a person being audited to conduct, under CBP supervision, self-testing of its own transactions within the time period and scope of the audit as originally set or later modified by CBP at its discretion. Audited persons permitted in advance by CBP to conduct self-testing of certain transactions under CBP supervision within the time period and scope of a CBP audit may use statistical sampling methods, provided that the criteria contained in paragraph (c)(3) of this section are satisfied. CBP will determine the time period and scope of the CBP-approved and supervised self-testing and will explain any sampling plan to be employed in accordance with paragraph (c)(1) of this section. The execution and results of the self-testing and the sampling plan are subject to CBP approval, and the audited person is subject to the waiver of paragraph (c)(1) of this section.

    (5)  A private party conducting an independent review of certain transactions and a calculation of lost duties, taxes, and fees or lost revenue for purposes of prior disclosure, in accordance with 19 CFR 162.74(j), may use statistical sampling, provided that the private party submits an explanation of the sampling plan and methodology employed and that the criteria in paragraph (c)(3) of this section are satisfied. Where the private party submits a prior disclosure employing statistical sampling, the time period, scope, and any sampling plan employed by the private party, as well as the execution and results of the self-review, are subject to CBP review and approval. Where CBP and the private party discuss and accept the sampling plan and methodology, or an adjustment to it, the waiver of paragraph (c)(1) of this section applies.

    (d) —(1)  In conducting any audit authorized under 19 U.S.C. 1509 and this section for the purpose of calculating the loss of duties, taxes, and fees or monetary penalty under any provision of 19 U.S.C. 1592, CBP auditors identifying overpayments of duties or fees or over-declarations of quantities or values that are within the time period and scope of the audit, as established solely by CBP, will treat the overpayments or over-declarations on finally liquidated entries as an offset to any underpayments or under-declarations also identified on finally liquidated entries, provided that:

    (i) The identified overpayments or over-declarations were not made by the person being audited for the purpose of violating any provision of law, including laws other than customs laws,

    (ii) The identified underpayments or under-declarations were not made knowingly and intentionally, and

    (iii) All other requirements of this paragraph (d) are met.

    (2)  Offsetting will apply to self-testing conducted by an audited person under CBP supervision (, during a CBP audit), provided that all requirements of this paragraph (d) are met, CBP approves the self-testing in advance and, upon review of the self-testing, CBP approves its execution and results.

    (3)  Offsetting will apply when a private party submits a prior disclosure, provided that the prior disclosure is in accordance with 19 CFR 162.74 and CBP approves the private party's self-review, including its execution and results. CBP's Office of International Trade, Regulatory Audit will review and evaluate all such prior disclosures and approve offsetting where it is satisfied that the requirements of 19 U.S.C. 1509(b)(6) and this paragraph (d) are met.

    (4)  In conducting an audit under paragraph (d)(1) of this section or authorizing an audited person's self-testing as described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, CBP will have the sole authority to determine the time period and scope of the audit. In conducting a review of a private party's prior disclosure as described in paragraph (d)(3) of this section, the time period and scope employed will be subject to CBP approval. In each of these circumstances, where statistical sampling is involved, CBP auditors will examine only the selected sample transactions. The results of the sample examination, with respect to properly identified overpayments and over-declarations and properly identified underpayments and under-declarations, will be projected over the universe of transactions to determine the total overpayments and over-declarations that are eligible for offsetting and to determine the total loss of duties, taxes, and fees.

    (5)  Offsetting may be permitted where the overpayments or over-declarations were not made by the same acts, statements, or omissions that caused the underpayments or under-declarations, and is not limited to the same entries that evidence the underpayments or under-declarations, provided that they are within the time period and scope of the audit as established by CBP and as described in paragraph (d)(4) of this section.

    (6)  Offsetting will not be allowed with respect to specific overpayments or over-declarations made for the purpose of violating any provision of law, including laws other than customs laws. Offsetting will not be allowed with respect to overpayments or over-declarations resulting from a failure to timely claim or establish a duty allowance or preference. Offsetting will be disallowed entirely where CBP determines that any underpayments or under-declarations identified for offsetting purposes were made knowingly and intentionally.

    (7)  Where overpayments or over-declarations have been identified in accordance with paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the audit report will state whether they have been made within the time period and scope of the audit.

    (8)  Any determination that offsets will be disallowed where overpayments/over-declarations were made for the purpose of violating any law, or where underpayments or under-declarations were made knowingly and intentionally, will be made by the appropriate Fines, Penalties, and Forfeitures (FP&F) office to which the issue was referred. CBP will notify the audited person of a determination whether to allow offsetting in whole or in part. The FP&F office will issue a notice of penalty under 19 U.S.C. 1592(b) and/or notice of liability for lost duties, taxes, and fees under 19 U.S.C. 1592(d) where it determines that such action is warranted. If the FP&F office issues a notice of penalty, the audited person may file a petition under 19 U.S.C. 1592(b)(2), 19 U.S.C. 1618, and 19 CFR part 171 to challenge the action.

    (9)  An overpayment of duties and fees will only be credited toward a refund if the circumstances of the overpayment meet the requirements of 19 U.S.C. 1520 or the requirements of 19 U.S.C. 1514(a) pertaining to clerical error, mistake of fact, or other inadvertence in any entry, liquidation, or reliquidation.

    (e)  The fact that entries were previously within the time period and scope of an audit conducted by CBP in which sampling was employed, in any circumstances described in this section, is not evidence of reasonable care by a violator in any subsequent action involving such entries.

    (f)  The provisions of paragraph (a) of this section may not apply when a private party submits a prior disclosure under paragraph (d)(3) of this section. Paragraphs (a)(5), (a)(6), (b), (d)(8), and (d)(9) of this section do not apply once CBP and/or ICE commences an investigation with respect to the issue(s) involved.

    § 163.12   Recordkeeping Compliance Program.

#### § § 163.12

    (a)  The Recordkeeping Compliance Program is a voluntary CBP program under which certified recordkeepers may be eligible for alternatives to penalties (see paragraph (d) of this section) that might be assessed under § 163.6 for failure to produce a demanded entry record. However, even where a certified recordkeeper is eligible for an alternative to a penalty, participation in the Recordkeeping Compliance Program has no limiting effect on the authority of CBP to use a summons, court order or other legal process to compel the production of records by that certified recordkeeper.

    (b) —(1)  Any person described in § 163.2(a) who is required to maintain and produce entry records under this part may apply to participate in the Recordkeeping Compliance Program.

    (2)  An application for certification to participate in the Recordkeeping Compliance Program must be submitted to the Regulatory Audit, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, 2001 Cross Beam Dr., Charlotte, North Carolina 28217. The application must be submitted in accordance with the guidelines contained in the CBP Recordkeeping Compliance Handbook which may be obtained by downloading it from CBP's Regulatory Audit Web site located at  or by writing to the Recordkeeping Compliance Program, Executive Director, Regulatory Audit, Office of International Trade, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, 1300 Pennsylvania Ave., NW., Washington, DC 20229.

    (3)  A recordkeeper may be certified as a participant in the Recordkeeping Compliance Program after meeting the general recordkeeping requirements established under this section or after negotiating an alternative program suited to the needs of the recordkeeper and CBP. To be certified, a recordkeeper must be in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. CBP will take into account the size and nature of the importing business and the volume of imports and CBP workload constraints prior to granting certification. In order to be certified, a recordkeeper must meet the applicable requirements set forth in the CBP Recordkeeping Compliance Handbook and must be able to demonstrate that it:

    (i) Understands the legal requirements for recordkeeping, including the nature of the records required to be maintained and produced and the time periods relating thereto;

    (ii) Has in place procedures to explain the recordkeeping requirements to those employees who are involved in the preparation, maintenance and production of required records;

    (iii) Has in place procedures regarding the preparation and maintenance of required records, and the production of such records to CBP;

    (iv) Has designated a dependable individual or individuals to be responsible for recordkeeping compliance under the program and whose duties include maintaining familiarity with the recordkeeping requirements of CBP;

    (v) Has a record maintenance procedure acceptable to CBP for original records or has an alternative records maintenance procedure adopted in accordance with § 163.5(b); and

    (vi) Has procedures for notifying CBP of any occurrence of a variance from, or violation of, the requirements of the Recordkeeping Compliance Program or negotiated alternative program, as well as procedures for taking corrective action when notified by CBP of violations or problems regarding such program. For purposes of this paragraph, the term “variance” means a deviation from the Recordkeeping Compliance Program that does not involve a failure to maintain or produce records or a failure to meet the requirements set forth in this section. For purposes of this paragraph, the term “violation” means a deviation from the Recordkeeping Compliance Program that involves a failure to maintain or produce records or a failure to meet the requirements set forth in this section.

    (c) —(1)  The Charlotte regulatory audit field office will process the application and will coordinate and consult, as may be necessary, with the appropriate CBP Headquarters and field officials. The Charlotte regulatory audit field office will review and verify the information contained in the application and may initiate an on-site verification prior to approval and certification. If an on-site visit is warranted, the Charlotte regulatory audit field office will inform the applicant. If additional information is necessary to process the application, the applicant will be notified. CBP requests for information not submitted with the application or for additional explanation of details will cause a delay in the application approval and certification of applicants and may result in the suspension of the application approval and certification process until the requested information is received by CBP.

    (2)  If, upon review, CBP determines that the application should be approved and that certification should be granted, the Director of the Charlotte regulatory audit field office will issue the certification with all the applicable conditions stated therein.

    (d) —(1)  If a certified participant in the Recordkeeping Compliance Program does not produce a demanded entry record for a specific release or provide the information contained in the demanded entry record by acceptable alternate means, CBP will, in lieu of a monetary penalty provided for in § 163.6(b), issue a written notice of violation to the person as described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, provided that the certified participant is generally in compliance with the procedures and requirements of the program and provided that the violation was not a willful violation and was not a repeat violation. A willful failure to produce demanded entry records or repeated failures to produce demanded entry records may result in the issuance of penalties under § 163.6(b) and removal of certification under the program (see § 163.13) until corrective action satisfactory to CBP is taken.

    (2)  A notice of violation issued to a participant in the Recordkeeping Compliance Program for failure to produce a demanded entry record or information contained therein must:

    (i) State that the recordkeeper has violated the recordkeeping requirements;

    (ii) Identify the record or information which was demanded and not produced;

    (iii) Warn the recordkeeper that future failures to produce demanded entry records or information contained therein may result in the imposition of monetary penalties and could result in the removal of the recordkeeper from the Recordkeeping Compliance Program.

    (3)  Within a reasonable time after receiving written notice under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the recordkeeper must notify CBP of the steps it has taken to prevent a recurrence of the violation.

    (2)  If the Director of the Miami regulatory audit field office determines that an application submitted under § 163.12 should not be approved and that certification for participation in the Recordkeeping Compliance Program should not be granted, the Director shall issue a written notice of denial to the applicant. The notice of denial shall set forth the reasons for the denial and shall advise the applicant of its right to file an appeal of the denial in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section.

Such notice shall inform the program participant of the grounds for the removal and shall advise the program participant of its right to file an appeal of the removal in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section.

    (3)  The removal of certification shall be effective immediately in cases of willfulness on the part of the program participant or when required by public health, interest, or safety. In all other cases, the removal of certification shall be effective when the program participant has received notice under paragraph (c)(2) of this section and either no appeal has been filed within the time limit prescribed in paragraph (d)(2) of this section or all appeal procedures thereunder have been concluded by a decision that upholds the removal action. Removal of certification may subject the affected person to penalties.

    (d) —(1)  A person may challenge a denial of an application for certification for participation in the Recordkeeping Compliance Program by filing a written appeal with the Executive Director, Regulatory Audit, Office of International Trade, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Washington, DC 20229. The appeal must be received by the Executive Director, Regulatory Audit, within 30 calendar days after issuance of the notice of denial.

      (b)  No power of attorney is required for an attorney at law to act as agent or attorney for the principal.

      (f)  If a party has not provided proof of execution of a power of attorney to CBP within five business days of an agent's first submission on behalf of an interested party pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section, or proof of authority to execute a power of attorney, if requested by CBP, pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section, CBP will reject the submission and will not consider or place such submission on the administrative record.

If the requirements of this section are satisfied and the information for which protection is sought consists of trade secrets and/or commercial or financial information obtained from any person, which is privileged or confidential in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4), CBP will grant business confidential treatment and issue an administrative protective order pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section. All documents and communications that are submitted to CBP after notice of initiation of an investigation must be served on all parties to the investigation by the submitting entity (for business confidential documents, a public version must be served as well, in accordance with paragraph (a)(2) of this section).

      (1)  An interested party submitting information must identify the information for which business confidential treatment is claimed by enclosing the claimed confidential information within single brackets. The first page of any submission containing business confidential information must clearly state that the submission contains business confidential information. The submitting interested party must also provide with the claimed business confidential information an explanation of why each item of bracketed information is entitled to business confidential treatment.

      (2)  An interested party filing a submission containing claimed business confidential information must also file a public version of the submission. The public version must be filed on the same date as the business confidential version and contain a summary of the bracketed information in sufficient detail to permit a reasonable understanding of the substance of the information. If the submitting interested party claims that summarization is not possible, the claim must be accompanied by a full explanation of the reasons supporting that claim. The public version must be clearly marked as a public version on the first page.

      (b)  CBP will reject a submission that includes a request for business confidential treatment but does not meet the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section and will not consider or place such submission on the administrative record unless the submitting interested party takes any of the actions in paragraph (b)(2) of this section within the timeframe specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.

      (1)  If CBP determines that the claim of confidentiality is nonconforming, it will treat the relevant portion of the submission as business confidential information until the appropriate corrective action is taken or the submission is rejected.

      (2)  The submitting interested party may take any of the following actions within two business days after receiving CBP's notice of rejection:

      (i) Correct the problems and resubmit the information by an email message or through any other method approved or designated by CBP;

      (ii) If CBP denies a request for business confidential treatment, agree to have the information in question treated as public information;

      (iii) Submit other material concerning the subject matter in lieu of the rejected information.

      (3)  If the submitting interested party does not take any of the actions in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section, CBP will not consider the rejected submission, not place such submission on the administrative record, and, if applicable, adverse inferences may be drawn pursuant to § 165.6.

      (c)  The following information provided by a party to the investigation in an allegation of evasion will not be protected as business confidential information and will be treated as public pursuant to the certification of informed consent referenced in § 165.11(c):

      (1) Name of the party to the investigation providing the information and identification of the agent filing on its behalf, if any, and email address for communication and service purposes;

      (2) Specification as to the basis upon which the party making the allegation qualifies as an interested party as defined in § 165.1;

      (3) Name and address of importer against whom the allegation is brought;

      (4) Description of covered merchandise; and

      (5) Applicable AD/CVD orders.

      (d)  In accordance with paragraph (a)(2) of this section, when providing a public version of their submissions, interested parties must certify that the information they are providing is either their own information (, information from their own business records and not business confidential information of another entity) or information that was publicly obtained or in the public domain.

      (e)  Any information that CBP places on the administrative record, when obtained other than from an interested party subject to the requirements of this section, will include a public summary of the business confidential information as described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, when applicable. If CBP places information on the record from parties who are not already subject to the requirements of this section, CBP will require these parties to conform to the requirements of this section and § 165.5 when filing submissions. Otherwise, such submissions may be treated as nonconforming submissions pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section and/or § 165.5(b)(4).

      (f)  In each investigation where CBP has granted a request by an interested party to treat any part of its submission as business confidential information, CBP will issue an administrative protective order which will contain terms to allow the representatives of parties to the investigation to access the business confidential information.

      § 165.5   Obtaining and submitting information.

#### § § 165.5

      (a)  In obtaining information necessary to carry out its functions and duties under this part, CBP may employ any means authorized by law. In general, CBP will obtain information from its own files, from other agencies of the United States Government, through questionnaires and correspondence, and through field work by its officials.

      (b)  The following requirements pertain to all parties who knowingly make submissions covered in this part:

      (1)  All submissions to CBP must be in writing in the English language or accompanied by an adequate English language translation as they will be part of the record for proceedings and determinations covered in this part. Oral discussions or communications with CBP will not be considered part of the record, unless they are memorialized in a written document that is placed on the record. All submissions must be made electronically to the designated email address specified by CBP for purposes of the investigation or through any other method approved or designated by CBP.

      (2)  Every written submission made to CBP by an interested party or requested by CBP from any other party pursuant to §§ 165.4 and 165.5 must be accompanied by the following certifications from the person making the submission:

      (i) “On behalf of the party making this submission, I certify that all statements in this submission (and any attachments) are accurate and true to the best of my knowledge and belief.”

      (ii) “On behalf of the party making this submission, I certify that any information for which I have not requested business confidential treatment pursuant to §165.4(a), may be released for public consumption.”

      (iii) “On behalf of the party making this submission, I certify that I will advise CBP promptly of any knowledge of or reason to suspect that the covered merchandise poses any health or safety risk to U.S. consumers pursuant to §165.7(a).”

      (3)  Any interested party that provides a material false statement or makes a material omission or otherwise attempts to conceal material facts at any point in the proceedings may be subject to adverse inferences ( § 165.6) and prosecution pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 1001.

      (4)  CBP will reject a submission that does not meet the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section and will not consider it or place it on the administrative record.

      (c) —(1)  CBP may, for good cause, extend any regulatory time limit, or any deadline for the submission of information requested by CBP, if a party requests an extension in a separate, stand-alone submission and states the reasons for the request. Such requests must be submitted no less than three business days before the time limit expires unless there are extraordinary circumstances. An extraordinary circumstance is an unexpected event that could not have been prevented even if reasonable measures had been taken by the requester. It is within CBP's reasonable discretion to determine what constitutes extraordinary circumstances, what constitutes good cause, and to grant or deny a request for an extension.

      (2)  If a submission is untimely filed, CBP will not consider it or place it on the administrative record and adverse inferences may be applied, if applicable.

      § 165.6   Adverse inferences.

#### § § 165.6

      (a)  If the party to the investigation that filed an allegation, the importer, or the foreign producer or exporter of the covered merchandise fails to cooperate and comply to the best of its ability with a request for information made by CBP, CBP may apply an inference adverse to the interests of that party in selecting from among the facts otherwise available to make the determination as to evasion pursuant to § 165.27 and subpart D of this part.

      (b)  An adverse inference used under paragraph (a) may include reliance on information derived from an allegation, a prior determination in another CBP investigation, proceeding, or action that involves evasion of AD/CVD orders, or any other available information on the administrative record.

      (c)  An adverse inference described in this section may be used with respect to the importer of the covered merchandise, or the foreign producer or exporter of the covered merchandise without regard to whether another party involved in the same transaction or transactions under examination has provided the information sought by CBP, such as import or export documentation.

      (b)  During the course of an investigation or administrative review of a determination as to evasion under this part, CBP will consider whether the covered merchandise may pose a health or safety risk to U.S. consumers and will take into account any notification received under paragraph (a) of this section. CBP will promptly transmit information to the appropriate Federal agencies for purposes of mitigating the risk and will exercise its administrative powers, as appropriate.

An allegation must be filed electronically through the appropriate portal on CBP's online e-Allegations system or through any other method approved or designated by CBP. Each allegation must be limited to one importer, but an interested party may file multiple allegations. An allegation must satisfy the requirements in paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section.

      (b)  An allegation of evasion must include, but is not limited to, the following information:

      (1) Name of the interested party making the allegation and identification of the agent filing on its behalf, if any, and the email address for communication and service purposes;

      (2) An explanation as to how the interested party qualifies as an interested party pursuant to § 165.1;

      (3) Name and address of importer against whom the allegation is brought;

      (4) Description of the covered merchandise;

      (5) Applicable AD/CVD orders; and

      (6) Information reasonably available to the interested party to support its allegation that the importer with respect to whom the allegation is filed is engaged in evasion.

      (c)  An allegation must also be accompanied by the certifications required under § 165.5(b) and the following statement of informed consent from the person making the submission: “I certify my understanding and consent that the information provided for in § 165.11(b)(1) through (5) may be released for public consumption.”

      (d)  The person signing the allegation on behalf of the interested party must include his or her name, position in the company or other affiliation, and provide contact information. Electronic submission of this information will be considered “signed” for purpose of filing the allegation.

      (e) —(1)  CBP will provide technical assistance and guidance for the preparation of an allegation of evasion and its submission to CBP, as described in this section.

      (i)  Small businesses are entitled to technical assistance upon request. In general, small businesses are eligible to make such requests if they have neither adequate internal resources nor financial ability to obtain qualified outside assistance in preparing and submitting for CBP's consideration allegations of evasion. Small businesses must satisfy the applicable standards set forth in 15 U.S.C. 632 and implemented in 13 CFR part 121.

      (ii)  Other parties may request technical assistance, which CBP may provide if resources are reasonably available.

      (2)  Requests for technical assistance may be made at any time via the email address designated on CBP's online e-Allegations system or through any other method approved or designated by CBP.

      (3)  The act of providing technical assistance is not part of the record for the investigation, nor does it compel a decision by CBP to initiate an investigation pursuant to § 165.15.

      § 165.12   Receipt of allegations.

#### § § 165.12

      (a)  The “date of receipt” of a properly filed allegation is the date on which CBP provides an acknowledgment of receipt of an allegation containing all the information and certifications required in § 165.11, together with a CBP-assigned control number, to the party that filed the allegation. CBP has 15 business days from the date of receipt to determine whether to initiate an investigation under the EAPA.

      (b)  An allegation may be withdrawn by the party that filed it if that party submits a request to withdraw the allegation to the designated email address specified by CBP or through any other method approved or designated by CBP.

      § 165.13   Consolidation of allegations.

#### § § 165.13

      (a)  Multiple allegations against one or more importers may be consolidated into a single investigation at CBP's discretion. Consolidations may be made at any point prior to the issuance of a determination as to evasion with respect to a particular importer. If multiple allegations are received and consolidated prior to the initiation of an investigation, then the date of receipt of the first properly filed allegation will start the time period for the deadline to initiate the investigation described in § 165.15 with respect to that allegation.

      (b)  CBP may consolidate multiple allegations if warranted based on the consideration of certain factors. The factors that CBP may consider include, but are not limited to, whether the multiple allegations involve:

      (1) Relationships between the importers;

      (2) Similarity of covered merchandise;

      (3) Similarity of AD/CVD orders; and

      (4) Overlap in time periods for entries of covered merchandise.

      (c)  Notice of consolidation will be promptly transmitted to all parties to the investigation if consolidation occurs at a point in the investigation after which they have already been notified of the ongoing investigation. Otherwise, parties will be notified no later than five business days after day 90 of the investigation.

      (d)  Upon notification of consolidation, parties to the consolidated investigation must serve on the newly added parties to the investigation, via an email message or through any other method approved or designated by CBP, public documents and the public versions of any documents that were previously served on parties to the unconsolidated investigation. Service must take place within five business days of the notice of consolidation.

      § 165.14   Other Federal agency requests for investigations.

#### § § 165.14

      (a)  Any other Federal agency, including but not limited to the Department of Commerce or the United States International Trade Commission, may request an investigation under this part. CBP will initiate an investigation if the Federal agency has provided information that reasonably suggests that an importer has entered covered merchandise into the customs territory of the United States through evasion, unless the agency submits a request to withdraw to the designated email address specified by CBP or through any other method approved or designated by CBP.

      (b)  The following information must be included in the request for an investigation:

      (1) Name of importer against whom the allegation is brought;

      (2) Description of the covered merchandise;

      (3) Applicable AD/CVD orders;

      (4) Information that reasonably suggests that an importer has entered covered merchandise into the customs territory of the United States through evasion;

      (5) Identification of a point of contact at the agency; and

      (6) Notification of any knowledge of or reason to suspect that the covered merchandise poses any health or safety risk to U.S. consumers.

      (c)  Requests for an investigation must be filed electronically via CBP's online e-Allegations system or through any other method approved or designated by CBP. The date of receipt is the date that CBP transmits notice of the assigned control number to the Federal agency that filed the request.

      (d) —(1)  CBP will treat the information required by paragraphs (b)(1) through (3) of this section as public information.

      (2)  CBP will create a public summary of the information required by paragraphs (b)(4) and (6) of this section.

      (e)  The Federal agency is not a party to the investigation. Therefore, it will neither receive official notice of developments after CBP's receipt of the request for an investigation nor will it receive service of any documents filed by interested parties. Only the parties to the investigation will be entitled to notice and service, as well as the related rights to administrative review and judicial review.

      (b)  CBP will initiate an investigation under subpart C of this part if the following criteria are satisfied:

      (1)  The covered merchandise described in the allegation or Federal agency request for an investigation is properly within the scope of an AD/CVD order.

      (1)  A clerical error, as defined in 19 U.S.C. 1517(a)(5)(B), is not evasion, although CBP will take appropriate actions to ensure that AD/CVD duties are assessed and collected.

      (2)  An allegation or a request for an investigation from another Federal agency may be withdrawn pursuant to the requirements of § 165.12(b) or § 165.14(a), as applicable.

      (d)  If CBP determines that it will not initiate an investigation, it will notify the interested party who filed the allegation within five business days of that determination. Otherwise, the parties to the investigation will be notified consistent with the following time limits:

      (1)  CBP will issue a notice of its decision to initiate an investigation to all parties to the investigation no later than five business days after day 90 of the investigation, and the actual date of initiation of the investigation will be specified therein.

      (b)  The referral may contain any necessary information available to CBP regarding whether the merchandise described in an allegation is subject to the relevant AD/CVD orders.

      (c)  TRLED will promptly notify the parties to the investigation of the date of the referral.

      (d)  The time period required for any referral and determination by the Department of Commerce will not be counted toward the deadlines for CBP to decide on whether to initiate an investigation under § 165.15, whether to take interim measures under § 165.24, or the deadline to issue a determination as to evasion under § 165.27.

      (e)  CBP will place the determination by the Department of Commerce on the administrative record of CBP's proceeding and will electronically notify the parties to the investigation.

#### § § 165.24

      (a)  No later than 90 calendar days after initiating an investigation under § 165.15, CBP will take interim measures if there is a reasonable suspicion that the importer entered covered merchandise into the customs territory of the United States through evasion.

#### § § 165.47

      CBP and other government agencies reserve the right to undertake additional investigations or enforcement actions in cases covered by these provisions. Nothing within this part prevents CBP from assessing penalties of any sort related to such cases or taking action under any other relevant laws.

    § 165.0   Scope.

#### § § 165.0

    This part relates to allegations by the public and requests from Federal agencies for an investigation regarding the evasion of antidumping (AD) and countervailing duty (CVD) orders and the procedures by which CBP investigates such claims consistent with the Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015 (TFTEA), which contains Title IV-Prevention of Evasion of Antidumping and Countervailing Duty Orders (short title “Enforce and Protect Act of 2015” or “EAPA”) (Pub. L. 114-125, 130 Stat. 122, 155, Feb. 24, 2016) (19 U.S.C. 4301 note). This part includes the requirements for the filing of allegations and requests for investigations, the investigation procedures, and administrative review of determinations as to evasion of AD/CVD orders under the EAPA. The procedures under this part are not the exclusive manner by which CBP may receive allegations or requests for an investigation from Federal agencies or investigate such allegations or requests with respect to the evasion of AD/CVD orders. An investigation as described in this part, if initiated by CBP, does not preclude CBP or any other government entity from initiating any other investigation or proceeding pursuant to any other provision of law, including proceedings initiated under 19 U.S.C. 1592.

      (b)  No petition for remission of forfeiture of a seized conveyance which has been forfeited and retained for official use will be considered unless it is filed before final disposition of the property is made. This does not affect petitions for restoration of proceeds of sale filed pursuant to the provisions of section 613 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1613).

      § 171.21   Written decisions.

#### § § 171.21

      If a petition for relief relates to a violation of sections 592, 593A or 641, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1592, 19 U.S.C. 1593a, or 19 U.S.C. 1641), the petitioner will be provided with a written statement setting forth the decision on the matter and the findings of fact and conclusions of law upon which the decision is based.

      § 171.22   Decisions effective for limited time.

#### § § 171.22

      A decision to mitigate a penalty or to remit a forfeiture upon condition that a stated amount is paid will be effective for not more than 60 days from the date of notice to the petitioner of such decision unless the decision itself prescribes a different effective period. If payment of the stated amount or arrangements for such payment are not made, or a supplemental petition is not filed in accordance with regulation, the full penalty or claim for forfeiture will be deemed applicable and will be enforced by promptly referring the matter, after required collection action, if appropriate, to the appropriate Office of the Chief Counsel for preparation for referral to the Department of Justice unless other action has been directed by the Commissioner of Customs.

      § 171.23   Decisions not protestable.

#### § § 171.23

      (a)  Any decision to remit a forfeiture or mitigate a penalty is not a protestable decision as defined under the provisions of 19 U.S.C. 1514. Any payment made in compliance with any decision to remit a forfeiture or mitigate a penalty is not a charge or exaction and therefore is not a protestable action as defined under the provisions of 19 U.S.C. 1514.

      (b)  Payment of a mitigated amount in compliance with an administrative decision on a petition or supplemental petition for relief will be considered an election of administrative proceedings and full disposition of the case. Payment of a mitigated amount will act as an accord and satisfaction of the Government claim. Payment of a mitigated amount will never serve as a bar to filing a supplemental petition for relief.

      § 171.24   Remission of forfeitures and payment of fees, costs or interest.

#### § § 171.24

      Any seizure subject to forfeiture may be remitted or mitigated pursuant to the provisions of 19 U.S.C. 1618 or 31 U.S.C. 5321, as applicable. Any person who accepts a remission or mitigation decision will not be considered to have substantially prevailed in a civil forfeiture proceeding for purposes of collection of any fees, costs or interest from the Government.

#### § § 171.43

      In addition to such other evidence as may be required under the provisions of subpart A of this part, the petition for restoration of proceeds of sale under section 613, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1613), must show the interest of the petitioner in the property. The petition must be supported by satisfactory proof that the petitioner did not know of the seizure prior to the declaration or decree of forfeiture and was in such circumstances as prevented him from knowing of it.

      § 171.44   Forfeited property authorized for official use.

#### § § 171.44

      If forfeited property which is the subject of a claim under section 613, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1613) has been authorized for official use, retention or delivery will be regarded as the sale thereof for the purposes of section 613. The appropriation available to the receiving agency for the purchase, hire, operation, maintenance and repair of property of the kind so received is available for the granting of relief to the claimant and for the satisfaction of liens for freight, charges and contributions in general average that may have been filed.

    Subpart F—Expedited Petitioning Procedures

      § 171.51   Application and definitions.

#### § § 171.51

      (a)  The following definitions, regulations, and criteria are designed to establish and implement procedures required by section 6079 of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988, Pub. L. 100-690, title VI (102 Stat. 4181). They are intended to supplement existing law and procedures relative to the forfeiture of property under the identified statutory authority. The provisions of these regulations do not affect the existing legal and equitable rights and remedies of those with an interest in property seized for forfeiture, nor do these provisions relieve interested parties from their existing obligations and responsibilities in pursuing their interests through such courses of action. These regulations are intended to reflect the intent of Congress to minimize the adverse impact occasioned by the prolonged detention of property subject to forfeiture due to violations of law involving possession of personal use quantities of controlled substances. The definition of personal use quantities of controlled substance as contained herein is intended to distinguish between those quantities small in amount which are generally considered to be possessed for personal consumption and not for distribution, and those larger quantities generally considered to be subject to distribution.

      (b)  As used in this subpart, the following terms shall have the meanings specified:

      (1)  “Appraised value” has the meaning given in § 162.43(a) of this chapter.

      (2)  “Commercial fishing industry vessel” means a vessel that:

      (i) Commercially engages in the catching, taking, or harvesting of fish or an activity that can reasonably be expected to result in the catching, taking, or harvesting of fish;

      (ii) Commercially prepares fish or fish products other than by gutting, decapitating, gilling, skinning, shucking, icing, freezing, or brine chilling; or

      (iii) Commercially supplies, stores, refrigerates, or transports fish, fish products, or materials directly related to fishing or the preparation of fish to or from a fishing, fish processing, or fish tender vessel or fish processing facility.

      (3)  “Controlled substance” has the meaning given in 21 U.S.C. 802.

      (4)  “Normal and customary manner” means that inquiry suggested by particular facts and circumstances which would customarily be undertaken by a reasonably prudent individual in a like or similar situation. Actual knowledge of such facts and circumstances is unnecessary, and implied, imputed, or constructive knowledge is sufficient. An established norm, standard, or custom is persuasive but not conclusive or controlling in determining whether a petitioner acted in a normal and customary manner to ascertain how property would be used by another legally in possession of the property.

      (5)  “Owner or interested party” means one having a legal and possessory interest in the property seized for foreiture or one who was in legal possession of the property at the time of seizure and is entitled to legal possession at the time of granting the petition for expedited procedure. This includes a lienholder, to the extent of his interest in the property, whose claim is in writing (except for a maritime lien which need not be in writing), unless the collateral is in the possession of the secured party. The agreement securing such a lien must create or provide for a security interest in the collateral, describe the collateral and be signed by the debtor.

      (6)  “Personal use quantities” means possession of controlled substances in circumstances where there is no evidence of intent to distribute, or to facilitate the manufacturing, compounding, processing, delivering, importing or exporting of any controlled substance. A quantity of a controlled substance is presumed to be for personal use if the amounts possessed do not exceed the quantities set forth in paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this section if there is no evidence of illicit drug trafficking or distribution such as, but not limited to the factors set forth in paragraph (b)(6)(ii) of this section. The possession of a narcotic, a depressant, a stimulant, a hallucinogin or a cannabis-controlled substance will be considered in excess of personal use quantities if the dosage unit amount possessed provides the same or greater equivalent efficacy as described in paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this section.

      (i)  (A) One gram of a mixture of substance containing a detectable amount of heroin;

      (B) One gram of a mixture of substance containing a detectable amount of—

      () Coca leaves, except coca leaves and extracts of coca leaves from which cocaine, ecgonine, and derivations of ecgonine or their salts have been removed;

      () Cocaine, its salts, optional and geometric isomers, and salts of isomers;

      () Ecgonine, its derivatives, their salts, isomers, and salts of isomers; or

      () Any compound, mixture, or preparation which contains any quantity of any of the substances referred to in paragraphs (b)(6)(i)(B) () through () of this section;

      (C)  th gram of a mixture of substances described in paragraph (b)(6)(i)(B) of this section which contains cocaine base;

      (D)  th gram of mixture of substance containing a detectable amount of phencyclidine (PCP);

      (E) 500 micrograms of a mixture of substance containing a detectable amount of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD);

      (F) One ounce of a mixture of substance containing a detectable amount of marihuana; or

      (G) One gram of methamphetamine, its salts, isomers, and salts of its isomers, or one gram of a mixture of substances containing a detectable amount of methamphetamine, its salts, isomers, or salts of its isomers.

      (ii)  Quantities shall not be considered to be for personal use if sweepings are present or there is other evidence of possession for other than personal use such as:

      (A) Evidence such as drug scales, drug distribution paraphernalia, drug records, drug packaging material, method of drug packaging, drug “cutting” agents and other equipment, that indicates an intent to process, package or distribute a controlled substance;

      (B) Information from reliable sources indicating possession of a controlled substance with intent to distribute;

      (C) The arrest and/or conviction record of the person or persons in actual or constructive possession of the controlled substance for offenses under Federal, State or local law that indicates an intent to distribute a controlled substance;

      (D) The controlled substance is related to large amounts of cash or any amount of prerecorded government funds;

      (E) The controlled substance is possessed under circumstances that indicate such a controlled substance is a sample intended for distribution in anticipation of a transaction involving large quantities, or is part of a larger delivery; or

      (F) Statements by the possessor, or otherwise attributable to the possessor, including statements of conspirators, that indicate possession with intent to distribute.

      (7)  “Property” means property subject to forfeiture under 19 U.S.C. 1595a.

      (8)  “Seizing agency” means the Federal agency which has seized the property or adopted the seizure of another agency, and has the responsibility for administratively forfeiting the property.

      (9)  “Sworn to” refers to the oath as provided by 28 U.S.C. 1746 or as notarized in accordance with state law.

      § 171.52   Petition for expedited procedures in an administrative forfeiture proceeding.

#### § § 171.52

      (a)  The usual procedures for petitions for relief when property is seized are set forth in subpart B of this part. However, where property is seized for administrative forfeiture pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 1595a due to violations involving controlled substances in personal use quantities, a petition may be filed pursuant to paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section to seek expedited procedures for release of the property. A petition filed pursuant to this subpart shall also serve as a petition for relief filed under subpart B of this part. The petition may be filed by an owner or interested party.

      (b)  Where a commercial fishing industry vessel proceeding to or from a fishing area or intermediate port of call or actually engaged in fishing operations is subject to seizure for administrative forfeiture for a violation of law involving controlled substances in personal use quantities, a summons to appear shall be issued in lieu of a physical seizure. The vessel shall report to the port designated in the summons no later than the date specified in the summons. When a commercial fishing industry vessel reports, the appropriate Customs officer shall, depending on the facts and circumstances, either issue another summons to appear at a time deemed appropriate, execute a constructive seizure agreement pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 1605, or take physical custody of the vessel. When a summons to appear has been issued, the seizing agency may be authorized to institute administrative forfeiture as if the vessel had been physically seized. When a summons to appear has been issued, the owner or interested party may file a petition for expedited procedures pursuant to subsection (a); the provisions of subsection (a) and other provisions in this subpart relating to a petition for expedited release shall apply as if the vessel had been physically seized.

      (c)  (1) The petition for expedited procedures shall establish that:

      (i) The petitioner has a valid, good faith interest in the seized property as owner or otherwise;

      (ii) The petitioner reasonably attempted to ascertain the use of the property in a normal and customary manner; and

      (iii) The petitioner did not know or consent to the illegal use of the property or, in the event that the petitioner knew or should have known of the illegal use, the petitioner did what reasonably could be expected to prevent the violation.

      (2) In addition, the petitioner may submit evidence to establish that he has statutory rights or defenses such that he would prevail in a judicial proceeding on the issue of forfeiture.

      (d)  A petition for expedited procedures must be filed in a timely manner to be considered by Customs. To be filed in a timely manner, the petition must be received by Customs within 20 days from the date the notice of seizure was mailed, or in the case of a commercial fishing industry vessel for which a summons to appear is issued, 20 days from the original date when the vessel is required to report. The petition must be sworn to by the petitioner and signed by the petitioner or his attorney at law. If the petitioner is a corporation, the petition may be sworn to by an officer or responsible supervisory employee thereof and signed by that individual or an attorney at law representing the corporation. Both the envelope and the request must be clearly marked “PETITION FOR EXPEDITED PROCEDURES.” The petition shall be addressed to the U.S. Customs Service and filed in triplicate with the Fines, Penalties, and Forfeitures Officer for the port where the property was seized, or for commercial fishing industry vessels, with the Fines, Penalties, and Forfeitures Officer for the port to which the vessel was required to report.

      (e)  The petition shall include the following:

      (1) A complete description of the property, including identification numbers, if any, and the date and place of the violation and seizure;

      (2) A description of the petitioner's interest in the property, supported by the documentation, bills of sale, contracts, mortgages, or other satisfactory documentary evidence; and

      (3) A statement of the facts and circumstances relied upon by the petitioner to justify expedited return of the seized property, supported by satisfactory evidence.

#### § § 171.53

      (a)  Upon receipt of a petition filed pursuant to § 171.52, Customs shall determine first whether a final administrative determination of the case can be made within 21 days of the seizure. If such a final administrative determination is made within 21 days, no further action need be taken under this subpart.

      (b)  If no such final administrative determination is made within 21 days of the seizure, Customs shall within 20 days after the receipt of the petition make a determination as follows:

      (1) If Customs determines that the factors listed in § 171.52(c) have been established, it shall terminate the administrative proceedings and release the property from seizure, or in the case of a commercial fishing industry vessel for which a summons has been issued, but not yet answered, dismiss the summons. The property shall not be returned if it is evidence of a violation of law.

      (2) If Customs determines that the factors listed in § 171.52(c) have not been established, it shall proceed with the administrative forfeiture.

#### § § 171.54

      (a)  Where property is seized for administrative forfeiture for a violation involving controlled substances in personal use quantities, the owner or interested party may offer to post an amount equal to the appraised value of the property (the res) to obtain release of the property. The offer, which may be tendered at any time subsequent to seizure and up until the completion of administrative forfeiture proceedings, must be in the form of cash, irrevocable letter of credit, certified funds such as a certified check, traveler's check(s), or money order made payable to U.S. Customs. Unless the property is evidence of a violation of law or has other characteristics that particularly suit it for use in illegal activities, it will be released to the owner or interested party subsequent to tender of the substitute res.

      (b)  If a substitute res is posted and it is determined that the property should be administratively forfeited, the res will be forfeited in lieu of the property.

      (b)  The notice as required by section 1607 of Title 19, United States Code and applicable regulations shall be made at the earliest practicable opportunity after determining ownership of, or interest in, the seized property and shall include a statement of the applicable law under which the property is seized and a statement of the circumstances of the seizure sufficiently precise to enable an owner or interested party to identify the date, place and use or acquisition which makes the property subject to forfeiture.

Such supplemental petition must be filed within 60 days from the date of notice to the petitioner of the decision from which further relief is requested or within 60 days following an administrative or judicial decision with respect to the entries involved in a penalty case which reduces the loss of duties upon which the mitigated penalty amount was based (whichever is later) unless another time to file such a supplemental petition is prescribed in the decision.

#### § § 171.62

      (a)  Supplemental petitions filed on cases where the original decision was made by the Fines, Penalties, and Forfeitures Officer, will be initially reviewed by that official. The Fines, Penalties, and Forfeitures Officer may choose to grant more relief and issue a decision indicating that additional relief to the petitioner. If the petitioner is dissatisfied with the further relief granted or if the Fines, Penalties, and Forfeitures Officer decides to grant no further relief, the supplemental petition will be forwarded to a designated Headquarters official assigned to a field location for review and decision, except that supplemental petitions filed in cases involving violations of 19 U.S.C. 1641 where the amount of the penalty assessed exceeds $10,000 will be forwarded to the Chief, Penalties Branch, Border Security and Trade Compliance Division, Regulations and Rulings, Office of International Trade.

#### § § 172.2

      (b)  The petition for remission or mitigation must be signed by the petitioner, his attorney-at-law or a Customs broker. If the petitioner is a corporation, the petition may be signed by an officer or responsible supervisory official of the corporation, or responsible employee representative of the corporation. Electronic signatures are acceptable. The deciding Customs officer may, in his or her discretion and with articulable cause, require proof of representation before consideration of any petition.

      (b)  Notwithstanding any other delegation of authority, the Fines, Penalties, and Forfeitures Officer is always empowered to cancel any case without payment of a mitigated or cancellation amount when he or she definitely determines that the act or omission forming the basis of any claim of penalty or claim for liquidated damages did not occur.

      § 172.13   Limitations on consideration of petitions.

#### § § 172.13

      (a)  No action will be taken on any petition if the civil liability has been referred to the Department of Justice for institution of legal proceedings. The petition will be forwarded to the Department of Justice.

#### § § 172.14

      The advice of the Director, Border Security and Trade Compliance Division, Regulations and Rulings, Office of International Trade, CBP Headquarters, may be sought in any case (except as provided in this section), without regard to delegated authority to act on a petition or offer, when a novel or complex issue concerning a ruling, policy, or procedure is presented concerning a CBP action(s) or potential CBP action(s) relating to penalties secured by bonds (including penalty-based determinations of duty except as provided in this section), claims for liquidated damages or mitigating any claim. This section does not apply to actual duty loss tenders determined by CBP pursuant to § 162.74(c) of this chapter relating to prior disclosure. The request for advice may be initiated by the bond principal, surety or any CBP officer, but must be submitted to the Fines, Penalties, and Forfeitures Officer. The Fines, Penalties, and Forfeitures Officer retains the authority to refuse to forward any request that fails to raise a qualifying issue and to seek legal advice from the appropriate Associate or Assistant Chief Counsel in any case.

    Subpart C—Disposition of Petitions

      § 172.21   Decisions effective for limited time.

#### § § 172.21

      A decision to mitigate a penalty or to cancel a claim for liquidated damages upon condition that a stated amount is paid will be effective for not more than 60 days from the date of notice to the petitioner of such decision unless the decision itself prescribes a different effective period. If payment of the stated amount is not made or a petition or a supplemental petition is not filed in accordance with regulation, the full penalty or claim for liquidated damages will be deemed applicable and will be enforced by promptly transmitting the matter, after required collection action, if appropriate, to the appropriate office of the Chief Counsel for preparation for referral to the Department of Justice unless other action has been directed by the Commissioner of Customs. Any such case may also be the basis for a sanction action commenced in accordance with regulations in this chapter.

      § 172.22   Decisions not protestable.

#### § § 172.22

      (a)  Any decision to remit or mitigate a penalty or cancel a claim for liquidated damages upon payment of a lesser amount is not a protestable decision as defined under the provisions of 19 U.S.C. 1514. Any payment made in compliance with any decision to remit or mitigate a penalty or cancel a claim for liquidated damages upon payment of a lesser amount is not a charge or exaction and therefore is not a protestable action as defined under the provisions of 19 U.S.C. 1514.

      (b)  Payment of a mitigated or cancellation amount in compliance with an administrative decision on a petition or supplemental petition for relief will be considered an election of administrative proceedings and full disposition of the case. Payment of a mitigated or cancellation amount will act as an accord and satisfaction of the Government claim. Payment of a mitigated or cancellation amount will never serve as a bar to filing a supplemental petition for relief.

    Subpart D—Offers in Compromise

      § 172.31   Form of offers.

#### § § 172.31

      Offers in compromise submitted pursuant to the provisions of section 617 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1617), must expressly state that they are being submitted in accordance with the provisions of that section. The amount of the offer must be deposited with Customs in accordance with the provisions of § 161.5 of this chapter.

      § 172.32   Authority to accept offers.

#### § § 172.32

      The authority to accept offers in compromise, subject to the recommendation of the General Counsel of the Treasury or his delegee, resides with the official having authority to decide a petition for relief, except that authority to accept offers in compromise submitted with regard to penalties secured by a bond or claims for liquidated damages which are the subject of a letter to show cause issued to a surety in anticipation of possible action involving nonacceptance of bonds authorized under the provisions of part 113 of this chapter will reside with the designated Headquarters official who issued the show cause letter.

      § 172.33   Acceptance of offers in compromise.

#### § § 172.33

      An offer in compromise will be considered accepted only when the offeror is so notified in writing. As a condition to accepting an offer in compromise, the offeror may be required to enter into any collateral agreement or to post any security which is deemed necessary for the protection of the interest of the United States.

    Subpart E—Supplemental Petitions for Relief

      § 172.41   Time and place of filing.

#### § § 172.41

      If the petitioner is not satisfied with a decision of the deciding official on an original petition for relief, a supplemental petition may be filed with the Fines, Penalties, and Forfeitures Officer having jurisdiction in the port where the violation occurred. The petitioner must file such a supplemental petition within 60 days from the date of notice to the petitioner of the decision from which further relief is requested or within 60 days following an administrative or judicial decision with respect to issues serving as the basis for the claim for liquidated damages (whichever is later) unless another time to file such a supplemental petition is prescribed in the decision. A supplemental petition may be filed whether or not the mitigated amount designated in the decision on the original petition is paid.

      § 172.42   Supplemental petition decision authority.

#### § § 172.42

      (a)  Supplemental petitions filed on cases where the original decision was made by the Fines, Penalties, and Forfeitures Officer, will be initially reviewed by that official. The Fines, Penalties, and Forfeitures Officer may choose to grant more relief and issue a decision indicating additional relief to the petitioner. If the petitioner is dissatisfied with the further relief granted or if the Fines, Penalties, and Forfeitures Officer decides to grant no further relief, the supplemental petition will be forwarded to a designated Headquarters official assigned to a field location for review and decision.

      (b)  Supplemental petitions filed on cases where the original decision was made by the Chief, Penalties Branch, Regulations and Rulings, Office of International Trade, CBP Headquarters, will be forwarded to the Director, Border Security and Trade Compliance Division, Regulations and Rulings, for review and decision.

      (c)  Any authority given to any Headquarters official by this part may also be exercised by the Executive Director, Regulations and Rulings, Office of International Trade, or his designee.

      § 172.43   Waiver of statute of limitations.

#### § § 172.43

      The deciding Customs official always reserves the right to require a waiver of the statute of limitations executed by the charged party or parties as a condition precedent before accepting a supplemental petition in any case in which less than one year remains before the statute will be available as a defense to all or part of that case.

    § 172.0   Scope.

#### § § 172.0

    This part contains provisions relating to petitions for relief from claims for liquidated damages arising under any Customs bond and penalties incurred which are secured by the conditions of the International Carrier Bond (see § 113.64 of this Chapter). This part does not relate to petitions on unsecured fines or penalties or seizures and forfeitures, nor does it relate to petitions for the restoration of proceeds of sale pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 1613.

    (2)  A clerical error, mistake of fact, or other inadvertence meeting the requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this section must be brought to the attention of the Center director or other appropriate CBP officer within 1 year after the date of liquidation or exaction. The party requesting reliquidation under this section must state, to the best of his or her knowledge, whether the entry for which correction is requested is the subject of a drawback claim, or whether the entry has been referenced on a certificate of delivery or certificate of manufacture and delivery so as to enable a party to make such entry the subject of drawback ( §§ 181.50(b) and 191.81(b) of this chapter).

    (b)  For merchandise entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after December 18, 2004, CBP does not have the authority, in situations where a valid protest has not been filed, to reliquidate an entry to correct a clerical error, mistake of fact, or other inadvertence.

    Subpart A—General Ruling Procedure

      § 177.1   General ruling practice and definitions.

#### § § 177.1

      (a) —(1)  It is in the interest of the sound administration of the Customs and related laws that persons engaging in any transaction affected by those laws fully understand the consequences of that transaction prior to its consummation. For this reason, the Customs Service will give full and careful consideration to written requests from importers and other interested parties for rulings or information setting forth, with respect to a specifically described transaction, a definitive interpretation of applicable law, or other appropriate information. Generally, a ruling may be requested under the provisions of this part only with respect to prospective transactions—that is, transactions which are not already pending before a Customs Service office by reason of arrival, entry, or otherwise.

      (2) —(i)  A question arising in connection with a Customs transaction already before a Customs Service office will normally be resolved by that office in accordance with the principles and precedents previously announced by the Headquarters Office. If such a question cannot be resolved on the basis of clearly established rules set forth in the Customs and related laws, or in the regulations thereunder, or in applicable Treasury Decisions, rulings, opinions, or court decisions published in the Customs Bulletin, that office may be requested to forward the question to the Headquarters Office for consideration, as more fully described in § 177.11.

      (ii)  A question arising in connection with an entry of merchandise which has been liquidated, or in connection with any other completed Customs transaction, may not be the subject of a ruling request.

      (b)  The Customs Service will not issue rulings in response to oral requests. Oral opinions or advice of Customs Service personnel are not binding on the Customs Service. However, oral inquiries may be made to Customs Service offices regarding existing rulings, the scope of such rulings, the types of transactions with respect to which the Customs Service will issue rulings, the scope of the rulings which may be issued, or the procedures to be followed in submitting ruling requests, as described in this part.

      (c)  Except as otherwise provided in subpart I of part 181 of this chapter, a ruling may be requested under this part by any person who, as an importer or exporter of merchandise, or otherwise, has a direct and demonstrable interest in the question or questions presented in the ruling request, or by the authorized agent of such person. A “person” in this context includes an individual, corporation, partnership, association, or other entity or group.

      (d)  (1) A “ruling” is a written statement issued by the Headquarters Office or the appropriate office of Customs as provided in this part that interprets and applies the provisions of the Customs and related laws to a specific set of facts. A “ruling letter” is a ruling issued in response to a written request therefor and set forth in a letter addressed to the person making the request or his designee. A “published ruling” is a ruling which has been published in the Customs Bulletin.

      (2) An “information letter” is a written statement issued by the Customs Service that does no more than call attention to a well-established interpretation or principle of Customs law, without applying it to a specific set of facts. An information letter may be issued in response to a request for a ruling when: (i) The request suggests that general information, rather than a ruling, is actually being sought, (ii) the request is incomplete or otherwise fails to meet the requirements set forth in this part, or (iii) the ruling requested cannot be issued for any other reason, and (iv) it is believed that general information may be of some benefit to the party making the request.

      (3) A “Customs transaction” is an act or activity to which the Customs and related laws apply. A “prospective” Customs transaction is one that is contemplated or is currently being undertaken and has not resulted in any arrival or the filing of any entry or other document, or in any other act to bring the transaction, or any part of it, under the jurisdiction of any Customs Service office. A “current” Customs transaction is one which is presently under consideration by a port office of the Customs Service. A “completed” Customs transaction is one which has been acted upon by a Customs Service field office and with respect to which that office has issued a determination which is final in nature, but is (or was) subject to appeal, petition, protest, or other review, as provided in the applicable Customs laws and regulations. In a series of identical, recurring transactions, each transaction shall be considered an individual transaction for purposes of this part.

      (4) An “authorized agent” is a person expressly authorized by a principal to act on his behalf. A ruling requested by an attorney or other person acting as an agent must include a statement describing the authority under which the request is made. With the exception of attorneys whose authority to represent is known, any person appearing before the Customs Service as an agent in connection with a ruling request may be required to present evidence of his authority to represent the principal. The foregoing requirements will not apply to an individual representing his full-time employer, or to a bona-fide officer, director, or other qualified representative of a corporation, association, or organized group.

      (5) The term “Customs and related laws,” as generally used in this part, includes any provision of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (including the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States), or the Customs Regulations, or any provision contained in other legislation (including the navigation laws), regulations, treaties, orders, proclamations, or other agreements administered by the Customs Service.

      (6) The term “Headquarters Office,” as used herein, means the Regulations and Rulings, Office of international Trade at Headquarters, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Washington, DC.

      § 177.2   Submission of ruling requests.

#### § § 177.2

      (a)  A request for a ruling should be in the form of a letter. Requests for Valuation and Carrier rulings should be addressed to the Commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, Attention: Regulations and Rulings, Office of International Trade, Washington, DC 20229. The Division and Branch in the Regulations and Rulings, Office of International Trade, to which the request should be directed may also be indicated, if known. Requests for tariff classification rulings should be addressed to the Director, National Commodity Specialist Division, Regulations and Rulings, Office of International Trade, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, 201 Varick Street, Suite 501, New York, New York 10014.

      (b) —(1)  Each request for a ruling must contain a complete statement of all relevant facts relating to the transaction. Such facts include the names, addresses, and other identifying information of all interested parties (if known); the name of the port or place at which any article involved in the transaction will arrive or be entered, or which will otherwise have jurisdiction with respect to the act or activity described in the transaction; and a description of the transaction itself, appropriate in detail to the type of ruling requested.

      (2) —(i)  The Customs transaction to which the ruling request relates must be described in sufficient detail to permit the proper application of relevant customs and related laws.

      (ii)  (A) If the transaction involves the importation of an article for which a ruling as to its proper classification under the provisions of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States is requested, the request for a ruling should include a full and complete description of the article and whenever germane to the proper classification of the article, information as to the article's chief use in the United States, its commercial, common, or technical designation, and, where the article is composed of two or more materials, the relative quantity (by weight and by volume) and value of each. The ruling request should also note, whenever germane, the purchase price of the article, and its approximate selling price in the United States. Individual requests for rulings submitted to service port offices will be limited to five (5) merchandise items, all of which must be of the same class or kind.

      (B) Rulings issued by the Director, National Commodity Specialist Division, or any service port office are limited to prospective transactions. Only the Headquarters Office will prepare final decisions under § 177.11 (Requests for Advice by Field Officers), or § 174.23 (Further Review of Protests), § 177.10 (Change of Practice), decisions under part 175 of this chapter (petitions under section 516, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended), decisions under § 177.13 (Inconsistent Customs decisions), and decisions under Policies and Procedures Manual Supplement 2126-01.

      (C) The requesting party may send the request directly to the Director, Commercial and Trade Facilitation Division, Regulations and Rulings, Office of International Trade, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Washington, DC 20229. The Headquarters Office retains authority to independently review all tariff classification ruling letters issued by the Director, National Commodity Specialist Division, and any service port office. If the importer or other person to whom a ruling letter is issued disagrees with the tariff classification set forth in a ruling issued by the Director, National Commodity Specialist Division, or any service port office, he may petition the Director, Commercial Rulings Division, U.S. Customs Service, Washington, DC 20229, for review of the ruling.

      (iii)  If the transaction involves the valuation of an article for Customs purposes, the request for a ruling should include all of the applicable information described in subpart C of part 152 of this chapter, and, insofar as is relevant, the information which would be required on an invoice as described in subpart F of part 141 of this chapter. The request should also describe the nature of the transaction (whether f.o.b./c.i.f., ex-factory, or some other arrangement), the relationship (if any) of the parties, whether the transaction was at arm's-length, whether there have been other sales of the same or similar merchandise in the country of exportation, whether an agency relationship exists, or any other information relevant to a determination under section 402 or 402a of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1401a, 1402).

      (iv)  If the transaction involves a vessel, the request for a ruling should include information relating to place of build and nationality of registration and, if to be used in waters under the jurisdiction of the United States, the exact place or places of intended use, if known. If the request for a ruling involves a determination as to whether or not the primary object of a contemplated voyage would be considered to be coastwise transportation in violation of 46 U.S.C. 289 (see § 4.80a of this chapter), the request should completely identify the voyage, including the proposed time of arrival at and departure from every port on the itinerary and any coordination of the voyage with special events at coastwise ports, and should be accompanied by samples, if available, of brochures, advertising, and other information that may be relevant to a determination of the primary object of the proposed voyage.

      (3)  Each request for a ruling regarding the status of an article under any Customs or related law affecting the importation or arrival of that article should be accompanied by photographs, drawings, or other pictorial representations of the article and, whenever possible, by a sample article, unless a precise description of the article is not essential to the ruling requested. Any article consisting of materials in chemical or physical combination for which a laboratory analysis has been prepared by or for the manufacturer should include a copy of that analysis. A sample submitted in connection with a request for a ruling becomes a part of the Customs Service file in the matter and will be retained until the ruling is issued or the ruling request is otherwise disposed of. If the return of the sample is desired, the ruling request should so state and should specify the desired means of return. A sample should only be submitted with the understanding that all or a part of it may be damaged or consumed in the course of examination, testing, analysis, or other actions undertaken in connection with the ruling request.

      (4)  If the question or questions presented in the ruling request directly relate to matters set forth in any invoice, contract, agreement, or other document, a copy of the document must be submitted with the request. (Original documents should not be submitted inasmuch as any documents or exhibits furnished with the ruling request become a part of the Customs Service file in the matter and cannot be returned.) The relevant facts reflected in any documents submitted, and an explanation of their bearing on the question or questions presented, must be expressly set forth in the ruling request.

      (5)  Each request for a ruling must state whether, to the knowledge of the person submitting the request, the same transaction, or one identical to it, has ever been considered, or is currently being considered by any Customs Service office or whether, to the knowledge of the person submitting the request, the issues involved have ever been considered, or are currently being considered, by the United States Court of International Trade, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, or any court of appeal therefrom. Where the transaction described in the ruling request is but one of a series of similar and related transactions, that fact must also be stated.

      (6)  If the request for a ruling asks that a particular determination or conclusion be reached in the ruling letter, a statement must be included in the request setting forth the basis for that determination or conclusion, together with a citation of all relevant supporting authority.

      (7)  Information which is claimed to constitute trade secrets or privileged or confidential commercial or financial information regarding the business transactions of private parties the disclosure of which would cause substantial harm to the competitive position of the person making the request (or of another interested party), must be identified clearly and the reasons such information should not be disclosed, including, where applicable, the reasons the disclosure of the information would prejudice the competitive position of the person making the request (or of another interested party) must be set forth.

      (c)  The request for a ruling must be signed by a person authorized to make the request, as described in § 177.1(c). A ruling requested by a principal or authorized agent may direct that the ruling letter be addressed to the other.

      (d)  The Customs Service will normally process requests for rulings in the order they are received and as expeditiously as possible. However, a request that a particular matter be given consideration ahead of its regular order, if made in writing at the time the request is submitted, or subsequent thereto, and showing a clear need for such treatment, will be given consideration as the particular circumstances warrant and permit. Requests for special consideration made by telegram will be treated in the same manner as requests made by letter, but rulings will not ordinarily be issued by telegram. In no event can any assurance be given that a particular request for a ruling will be acted upon by the time requested. However, upon request and where a clear need is shown for such action, a collect telephone call will be made to advise that the ruling letter has been issued and is being mailed.

      § 177.3   Nonconforming requests for rulings.

#### § § 177.3

      A person submitting a request for a ruling that does not comply with all of the provisions of this part will be so notified in writing, and the requirements that have not been met will be pointed out. Except in the case of ruling requests submitted to Area or District offices, such person will be given a period of thirty (30) days from the date of the notice (or such longer period as the notice may provide) to supply any additional information that is requested or otherwise conform the ruling request to the requirements referred to in the notice. The Customs Service file with respect to ruling requests which are not brought into compliance with the provisions of this part within the period of time allowed will be administratively closed and the request removed from active consideration until such time as the deficiencies cited in the notice are corrected. A request for a ruling that is removed from active consideration by reason of failing to comply with the provisions of this part may be treated as withdrawn. In the case of ruling requests made to Area or District offices, a failure to comply with the provisions of this part will result in the return of the ruling request with the notice specifying the deficiencies and such requests will not be considered as having been filed until such deficiencies are corrected.

      § 177.4   Oral discussion of issues.

#### § § 177.4

      (a)  A person submitting a request for a ruling and desiring an opportunity to orally discuss the issue or issues involved should indicate that desire in writing at the time the ruling request is filed. Such a discussion will only be scheduled when, in the opinion of the Customs personnel by whom the ruling request is under consideration, a conference will be helpful in deciding the issue or issues involved or when a determination or conclusion contrary to that advocated in the ruling request is contemplated. Conferences are scheduled for the purpose of affording the parties an opportunity to freely and openly discuss the matters set forth in the ruling request. Accordingly, the parties will not be bound by any argument or position advocated or agreed to, expressly or by implication, during the conference unless either party subsequently agrees to be so bound in writing. The conference will not conclude with the issuance of a ruling letter.

      (b)  If a request for a conference is granted, the person making the request will be notified of the time and place of the conference. No more than one conference with respect to the matters set forth in a ruling request will be scheduled, unless, in the opinion of the Customs personnel by whom the ruling request is under consideration, additional conferences are necessary.

      (c)  A person whose request for a conference has been granted may be accompanied at that conference by counsel or other representatives, or may designate such persons to attend the conference in his place.

      (d)  It will be the responsibility of the person submitting the request for a ruling to provide for inclusion in the Customs Service file in the matter a written record setting forth any and all additional information, documents, and exhibits introduced during the conference to the extent that person considers such material relevant to the consideration of the ruling request.

      § 177.5   Change in status of transaction.

#### § § 177.5

      Each person submitting a request for a ruling in connection with a Customs transaction shall immediately advise Customs in writing of any change in the status of that transaction, as defined in § 177.1(d)(3). In particular, the Customs Service office to which the request was made must be advised when any transaction described in the ruling request as prospective becomes current and under the jurisdiction of a Customs Service field office. In addition, any person engaged in a Customs transaction coming under the jurisdiction of a Customs Service field office and having previously requested a ruling with respect to that transaction shall advise the field office of that fact. The field office will normally withhold action with respect to any transaction for which a ruling has previously been requested pending the disposition of the ruling request.

      § 177.6   Withdrawal of ruling requests.

#### § § 177.6

      Any request for a ruling may be withdrawn by the person submitting it at any time before the issuance of a ruling letter or any other final disposition of the request. All correspondence, documents, and exhibits submitted in connection with the request will be retained in the Customs Service file and will not be returned. In addition, the Headquarters Office may forward to Customs Service field offices which have or may have jurisdiction over the transaction to which the ruling request relates, its views in regard to the transaction or the issues involved therein, as well as appropriate information derived from materials in the Customs Service file.

      § 177.7   Situations in which no ruling will be issued.

#### § § 177.7

      (a)  No ruling letter will be issued in response to a request for a ruling which fails to comply with the provisions of this part. Moreover, no ruling letter will be issued with regard to transactions or questions which are essentially hypothetical in nature or in any instance in which it appears contrary to the sound administration of the Customs and related laws to do so. No ruling letter will be issued in regard to a completed transaction.

      (b)  No ruling letter will be issued with respect to any issue which is pending before the United States Court of International Trade, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, or any court of appeal therefrom. Litigation before any other court will not preclude the issuance of a ruling letter, provided neither the Customs Service nor any of its officers or agents is named as a defendant.

      § 177.8   Issuance of rulings.

#### § § 177.8

      (a) —(1)  The Customs Service will endeavor to issue a ruling letter setting forth a determination with respect to a specifically described Customs transaction whenever a request for such a ruling is submitted in accordance with the provisions of this part and it is in the sound administration of the Customs and related laws to do so. Otherwise, a request for a ruling will be answered by an information letter or, in those situations in which general information is likely to be of little or no value, by a letter stating that no ruling can be issued.

      (2)  Any person engaging in a Customs transaction with respect to which a binding tariff classification ruling letter (including pre-entry classification decisions) has been issued under this part shall ascertain that a copy of the ruling letter is attached to the documents filed with the appropriate Customs Service office in connection with that transaction, or shall otherwise indicate with the information filed for that transaction that a ruling has been received. Any person receiving a ruling setting forth the tariff classification of merchandise shall set forth such classification in the documents or information filed in connection with any subsequent entry of that merchandise; the failure to do so may result in a rejection of the entry and the imposition of such penalties as may be appropriate. A ruling received after the filing of such documents or information shall immediately be brought to the attention of the appropriate Customs Service field office.

      (3)  The ruling letter shall be based on the information set forth in the ruling request. No part of the ruling letter, including names, addresses, or information relating to the business transactions of private parties, shall be deemed to constitute privileged or confidential commercial or financial information or trade secrets exempt from disclosure pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, as amended (5 U.S.C. 552), unless, as provided in § 177.2(b)(7), the information claimed to be exempt from disclosure is clearly identified and the reasons for the exemption are set forth. Before the issuance of the ruling letter, the person submitting the ruling request, will be notified of any decision adverse to his claim for exemption from disclosure and will, upon written request to Customs within 10 working days of the date of notification, be permitted to withdraw the ruling request. All ruling letters issued by the Customs Service will be available, upon written request, for inspection and copying by any person (with any portions determined to be exempt from disclosure deleted).

      (b)  The Headquarters Office may from time to time issue other rulings with respect to issues or transactions described or suggested by requests for rulings submitted under the provisions of this part, or with respect to issues or transactions otherwise brought to its attention. These rulings, which are statements of the official position of the Customs Service which are likely to be of widespread interest and application, are published in the Customs Bulletin, as described in § 177.10.

      § 177.9   Effect of ruling letters.

#### § § 177.9

      (a)  A ruling letter issued by the Customs Service under the provisions of this part represents the official position of the Customs Service with respect to the particular transaction or issue described therein and is binding on all Customs Service personnel in accordance with the provisions of this section until modified or revoked. In the absence of a change of practice or other modification or revocation which affects the principle of the ruling set forth in the ruling letter, that principle may be cited as authority in the disposition of transactions involving the same circumstances. Generally, a ruling letter is effective on the date it is issued and may be applied to all entries which are unliquidated, or other transactions with respect to which the Customs Service has not taken final action on that date. See, however, § 177.10(e) (changes of practice published in the ) and § 177.12 (rulings which modify or revoke previous rulings, decisions, or treatments).

      (b) —(1)  Each ruling letter is issued on the assumption that all of the information furnished in connection with the ruling request and incorporated in the ruling letter, either directly, by reference, or by implication, is accurate and complete in every material respect. The application of a ruling letter by a Customs Service field office to the transaction to which it is purported to relate is subject to the verification of the facts incorporated in the ruling letter, a comparison of the transaction described therein to the actual transaction, and the satisfaction of any conditions on which the ruling was based. If, in the opinion of any Customs Service field office by whom the transaction is under consideration or review, the ruling letter should be modified or revoked, the findings and recommendations of that office will be forwarded to the Headquarters Office for consideration, as provided in § 177.11(b)(1)(i), prior to any final disposition with respect to the transaction by that office. Otherwise, if the transaction described in the ruling letter and the actual transaction are the same, and any and all conditions set forth in the ruling letter have been satisfied, the ruling will be applied to the transaction.

      (2)  Each ruling letter setting forth the proper classification of an article under the provisions of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States will be applied only with respect to transactions involving articles identical to the sample submitted with the ruling request or to articles whose description is identical to the description set forth in the ruling letter.

      (3)  Each ruling letter setting forth the proper valuation of an article under the provisions of section 402 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1401a), will be applied only with respect to transactions involving the same merchandise and like facts.

      (4)  Each ruling letter setting forth the applicability of the navigation laws to a vessel will be applied only with respect to transactions involving operations identical to those set forth in the ruling letter. Each ruling letter setting forth a determination as to whether or not the primary object of a contemplated voyage is coastwise transportation in violation of 46 U.S.C. 289 will be binding on the United States Customs Service with respect to any transaction identical to the facts and circumstances described in the ruling request and undertaken in reliance on the ruling letter.

      (c)  Except when public notice and comment procedures apply under § 177.12, a ruling letter is subject to modification or revocation by CBP without notice to any person other than the person to whom the ruling letter was addressed. Accordingly, no other person should rely on the ruling letter or assume that the principles of that ruling will be applied in connection with any transaction other than the one described in the letter. However, any person eligible to request a ruling under § 177.1(c) may request information as to whether a previously-issued ruling letter has been modified or revoked by writing the Commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, Attention: Regulations and Rulings, Office of International Trade, Washington, DC 20229, and either enclosing a copy of the ruling letter or furnishing other information sufficient to permit the ruling letter in question to be identified.

      § 177.10   Publication of decisions.

#### § § 177.10

      (a)  Within 90 days after issuing any interpretive decision under the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, relating to any Customs transaction (prospective, current, or completed), the Customs Service shall publish the decision in the Customs Bulletin or otherwise make it available for public inspection. For purposes of this paragraph an interpretive decision includes any ruling letter, internal advice memorandum, or protest review decision. Disclosure is governed by 31 CFR part 1, 19 CFR part 103, and 19 CFR 177.8(a)(3).

      (b) [Reserved]

      (c)  Before the publication of a ruling which has the effect of changing an established and uniform practice and which results in the assessment of a higher rate of duty within the meaning of 19 U.S.C. 1315(d), notice that the practice (or prior ruling on which that practice was based) is under review will be published in the  and interested parties will be given an opportunity to make written submissions with respect to the correctness of the contemplated change.

      (d)  A published ruling may limit the application of a court decision to the specific article under litigation, or to an article of a specific class or kind of such merchandise, or to the particular circumstances or entries which were the subject of the litigation.

      (e)  Except as otherwise provided in § 177.12(e) or in the ruling itself, all rulings published under the provisions of this part will be applied immediately. If the ruling involves merchandise, it will be applicable to all unliquidated entries, except that a change of practice resulting in the assessment of a higher rate of duty or increased duties shall be effective only as to merchandise entered for consumption or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption on or after the 90th day after publication of the change in the

      § 177.11   Requests for advice by field offices.

#### § § 177.11

      (a)  Advice or guidance as to the interpretation or proper application of the Customs and related laws with respect to a specific Customs transaction may be requested by Customs Service field offices from the Headquarters Office at any time, whether the transaction is prospective, current, or completed. Advice as to the proper application of the Customs and related laws to a current transaction will be sought by a Customs Service field office whenever that office is requested to do so, pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, by an importer or other person having an interest in the transaction. Advice or guidance will be furnished by the Headquarters Office as a means of assisting Customs personnel in the orderly processing of Customs transactions under consideration by them and to insure the consistent application of the Customs and related laws in the several Customs districts. Requests for advice received by the Headquarters Office will be processed as expeditiously as possible.

      (b) —(1) —(i)  If any Customs Service office has issued a ruling letter with respect to a particular Customs transaction and the Customs Service field office having jurisdiction over that transaction believes that the ruling should be modified or revoked, the field office will forward to the Headquarters Office, pursuant to § 177.9(b)(1), a request that the ruling be reconsidered. The field office will notify the importer or other person to whom the ruling letter was issued, in writing, that it has requested the Headquarters Office to reconsider the ruling.

      (ii)  If the importer or other person to whom a ruling letter is issued disagrees with the Customs Service field office having jurisdiction over the transaction to which the ruling relates as to the proper application of the ruling to the transaction, the field office will, upon receipt of a written request submitted in accordance with the procedure set forth in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, request advice from the Headquarters Office as to the proper application of the ruling to the transaction. Such advice may not be requested for the purpose of seeking reconsideration of a ruling with which the importer or other person to whom the ruling letter was issued disagrees.

      (2)  Internal advice will be sought by a Customs Service field office with respect to a current transaction for which no ruling was requested or issued under the provisions of this part whenever a difference of opinion exists as to the interpretation or proper application of the Customs and related laws to the transaction, and the field office is requested to seek such advice by an importer or other person who would have been entitled, under § 177.1(c), to request a ruling with respect to the transaction, while prospective. The request must be submitted to the field office in writing and in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (b)(3) of this section.

      (3)  An importer or other person requesting that a Customs Service field office seek advice from the Headquarters Office must make such a request, in writing, to the field office having jurisdiction over the transaction in question. The request shall contain a complete statement setting forth a description of the transaction, the specific questions presented, the applicable law, and an argument for the conclusions advocated. The statement must also specify whether, to the knowledge of the person submitting the statement, the same transaction, or one identical to it, has ever been considered, or is currently being considered, by any Customs Service office. In addition, the statement should indicate at which port or ports of entry identical or substantially identical merchandise has been entered.

      (4)  All requests submitted by importers and other persons under paragraph (b)(3) of this section, will be reviewed by the field office to which they are submitted. In the event a difference of opinion exists as to the description of the transaction or as to the point or points at issue, the person submitting the request will be so advised in writing. If agreement cannot be reached, both the statements of the person submitting the request and the field office will be forwarded to the Headquarters Office for consideration.

      (5)  The Headquarters Office may refuse to consider the questions presented to it in the form of a request for internal advice whenever (i) the Headquarters Office determines that the period of time necessary to give adequate consideration to the questions presented would result in a withholding of action with respect to the transaction, or in any other situation, that is inconsistent with the sound administration of the Customs and related laws, and (ii) the questions presented can subsequently be raised by the importer or other interested party in the form of a protest filed in accordance with the provisions of part 174 of this chapter.

      (6)  Advice furnished by the Headquarters Office in response to a request therefor represents the official position of the Customs Service as to the application of the Customs laws to the facts of a specific transaction. If the field office believes that the advice furnished by the Headquarters Office should be reconsidered, it shall promptly request such reconsideration. Otherwise, the advice furnished by the Headquarters Office will be applied by the field office in its disposition of the Customs transaction in question.

      (7)  Within 90 days after issuing an internal advice memorandum, the Customs Service shall publish the decision in the Customs Bulletin or otherwise make it available for public inspection. Disclosure is governed by 31 CFR part 1 and 19 CFR part 103.

      (8)  A refusal by the Headquarters Office to consider the questions raised by an importer in the form of a request for internal advice may be appealed to the Court of International Trade if the importer demonstrates to the Court that he would be irreparably harmed unless given an opportunity to obtain judicial review prior to the importation of the merchandise.

      § 177.12   Modification or revocation of interpretive rulings, protest review decisions, and previous treatment of substantially identical transactions.

#### § § 177.12

      (a)  An interpretive ruling, which includes an internal advice decision, issued under this part, or a holding or principle covered by a protest review decision issued under part 174 of this chapter, if found to be in error or not in accord with the current views of Customs, may be modified or revoked by an interpretive ruling issued under this section. In addition, an interpretive ruling issued under this section may have the effect of modifying or revoking the treatment previously accorded by Customs to substantially identical transactions. A modification or revocation under this section must be carried out in accordance with the notice procedures set forth in paragraph (b) or paragraph (c) of this section except as otherwise provided in paragraph (d) of this section, and the modification or revocation will take effect as provided in paragraph (e) of this section.

      (b)  Customs may modify or revoke an interpretive ruling or holding or principle covered by a protest review decision that has been in effect for less than 60 calendar days by simply giving written notice of the modification or revocation to the person to whom the original ruling was issued or whose current transaction was the subject of the internal advice decision or, in the case of a protest review decision, to the person identified on the Customs Form 19 as the protestant or to any other person designated to receive notice of denial of a protest under § 174.30(b) of this chapter. However, when Customs contemplates the issuance of an interpretive ruling that would modify or revoke an interpretive ruling or holding or principle covered by a protest review decision which has been in effect for 60 or more calendar days, the following procedures will apply:

      (1)  A notice proposing the modification or revocation and inviting public comment on the proposal will be published in the  The notice will refer to all previously issued interpretive rulings or protest review decisions that Customs has identified as being the subject of the proposed action and will invite any member of the public who has received another interpretive ruling or protest review decision involving the issue that is the subject of the proposed action to advise Customs of that fact. Interested parties will have 30 calendar days from the date of publication of the notice to submit written comments on the proposed modification or revocation and to advise Customs in writing that they are recipients of an affected interpretive ruling or protest review decision that was not identified in the notice.

      (2)  In the absence of extraordinary circumstances, within 30 calendar days after the close of the public comment period, any submitted comments will be considered and a final modifying or revoking notice or notice of other appropriate final action on the proposed modification or revocation will be published in the  In addition, a written decision will be issued to the person to whom, or on whose transaction, the original interpretive ruling was issued or, in the case of a protest review decision, to the person identified on the Customs Form 19 as the protestant or to any other person designated to receive notice of denial of a protest under § 174.30(b) of this chapter. Publication of a final modifying or revoking notice in the  will have the effect of modifying or revoking any interpretive ruling or holding or principle covered by a protest review decision that involves merchandise or an issue that is substantially identical in all material respects to the merchandise or issue that is the subject of the modification or revocation, including an interpretive ruling or holding or principle covered by a protest review decision that is not specifically identified in the final modifying or revoking notice.

      (c) —(1)  The issuance of an interpretive ruling that has the effect of modifying or revoking the treatment previously accorded by Customs to substantially identical transactions must be in accordance with the procedures set forth in paragraph (c)(2) of this section. The following rules will apply for purposes of determining under this section whether a treatment was previously accorded by Customs to substantially identical transactions of a person:

      (i) There must be evidence to establish that:

      (A) There was an actual determination by a Customs officer regarding the facts and issues involved in the claimed treatment;

      (B) The Customs officer making the actual determination was responsible for the subject matter on which the determination was made; and

      (C) Over a 2-year period immediately preceding the claim of treatment, Customs consistently applied that determination on a national basis as reflected in liquidations of entries or reconciliations or other Customs actions with respect to all or substantially all of that person's Customs transactions involving materially identical facts and issues;

      (ii) The determination of whether the requisite treatment occurred will be made by Customs on a case-by-case basis and will involve an assessment of all relevant factors. In particular, Customs will focus on the past transactions to determine whether there was an examination of the merchandise (where applicable) by Customs or the extent to which those transactions were otherwise reviewed by Customs to determine the proper application of the Customs laws and regulations. For purposes of establishing whether the requisite treatment occurred, Customs will give diminished weight to transactions involving small quantities or values, and Customs will give no weight whatsoever to informal entries and to other entries or transactions which Customs, in the interest of commercial facilitation and accommodation, processes expeditiously and without examination or Customs officer review;

      (iii) Customs will not find that a treatment was accorded to a person's transactions if:

      (A) The person's own transactions were not accorded the treatment in question over the 2-year period immediately preceding the claim of treatment;

      (B) The issue in question involves the admissibility of merchandise;

      (C) The person made a material false statement or material omission in connection with a Customs transaction or in connection with the review of a Customs transaction and that statement or omission affected the determination on which the treatment claim is based; or

      (D) Customs advised the person regarding the manner in which the transactions should be presented to Customs and the person failed to follow that advice; and

      (iv) The evidentiary burden as regards the existence of the previous treatment is on the person claiming that treatment. The evidence of previous treatment by Customs must include a list of all materially identical transactions by entry number (or other Customs assigned number), the quantity and value of merchandise covered by each transaction (where applicable), the ports of entry, the dates of final action by Customs, and, if known, the name and location of the Customs officer who made the determination on which the claimed treatment is based. In addition, in cases in which an entry is liquidated without any Customs review (for example, the entry is liquidated automatically as entered), the person claiming a previous treatment must be prepared to submit to Customs written or other appropriate evidence of the earlier actual determination of a Customs officer that the person relied on in preparing the entry and that is consistent with the liquidation of the entry.

      (2) —(i) When Customs has reason to believe that a contemplated interpretive ruling would have the effect of modifying or revoking the treatment previously accorded by Customs to substantially identical transactions, notice of the intent to modify or revoke that treatment will be published in the  either as a separate action or in connection with a proposed modification or revocation of an interpretive ruling or holding or principle covered by a protest review decision under paragraph (b)(1) of this section. The notice will give interested parties 30 calendar days from the date of publication of the notice to submit written comments on the proposed modification or revocation and will invite any member of the public whose substantially identical transactions have been accorded the same treatment to advise Customs in writing of that fact, supported by appropriate details regarding those transactions, within that 30-day period. Within 30 calendar days after the close of the public comment period, any submitted comments will be considered, notice of the final interpretive ruling or other final action on the proposed modification or revocation will be published in the  Written confirmation of the applicability of a final modification or revocation will be sent to each person identified as having had substantially identical transactions that were accorded the same treatment.

      (ii) If Customs is not aware prior to issuance that a contemplated interpretive ruling would have the effect of modifying or revoking the treatment previously accorded by Customs to substantially identical transactions, the interpretive ruling will be issued and generally will be effective as provided in § 177.9. However, Customs will, upon written application by a person claiming that the interpretive ruling has the effect of modifying or revoking the treatment previously accorded by Customs to his substantially identical transactions, consider delaying the effective date of the interpretive ruling with respect to that person, and continue the treatment previously accorded the substantially identical transactions, pending completion of the procedures set forth in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section.

      (d) —(1)  The publication and issuance requirements set forth in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section are inapplicable in circumstances in which a Customs position is modified, revoked or otherwise materially affected by operation of law or by publication pursuant to other legal authority or by other appropriate action taken by Customs in furtherance of an order, instruction or other policy decision of another governmental agency or entity pursuant to statutory or delegated authority. Such circumstances include, but are not limited to, the following:

      (i) Adoption or amendment of a statutory provision, including any change to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States;

      (ii) Promulgation of a treaty or other international agreement under the foreign affairs function of the United States;

      (iii) Issuance of a Presidential Proclamation or Executive Order, or issuance of a decision or policy determination pursuant to authority delegated by the President;

      (iv) Subject to the provisions of § 152.16 of this chapter, the rendering of a judicial decision which has the effect of overturning the Customs position;

      (v) Publication of a decision in the  as a result of a petition by a domestic interested party pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 1516 (see part 175 of this chapter);

      (vi) Publication of an interim or final rule in the  in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553;

      (vii) Publication of a final interpretative rule in the  in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553 following public notice and comment procedures; and

      (viii) Publication of a final ruling in the  in accordance with 19 U.S.C. 1315(d) and § 177.10(c) relating to change of established and uniform practice.

      (2)  In the following circumstances a final modifying or revoking ruling will be issued to the person entitled to it under paragraph (b) or (c) of this section but  publication under paragraph (b) or (c) of this section is not required:

      (i) The modifying ruling corrects a clerical error; or

      (ii) The modifying or revoking ruling is directed to a ruling issued under subpart I of part 181 of this chapter relating to advance rulings under the North American Free Trade Agreement.

      (e) —(1)  If an interpretive ruling or holding or principle covered by a protest review decision that is modified or revoked under this section had been in effect for less than 60 calendar days, the modifying or revoking interpretive ruling:

      (i) Will be effective on its date of issuance with respect to the specific transaction covered by the modifying or revoking interpretive ruling: and

      (ii) Will be applicable to merchandise entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on and after its date of issuance.

      (2)  If an interpretive ruling or holding or principle covered by a protest review decision that is modified or revoked under this section had been in effect for 60 or more calendar days, the modifying or revoking notice will, provided that liquidation of the entry in question has not become final, apply to merchandise entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption:

      (i) Sixty calendar days after the date of publication of the final modifying or revoking notice in the  under paragraph (b)(2) of this section; or

      (ii) At the option of any person with regard to that person's transaction, on and after the date of publication of the final modifying or revoking notice in the  under paragraph (b)(2) of this section.

      (3)  A final notice that modifies or revokes the treatment previously accorded by Customs to substantially identical transactions:

      (i) Will be effective with respect to transactions that are substantially identical to the transaction described in the modifying or revoking notice 60 calendar days after the date of publication of the final modifying or revoking notice in the  under paragraph (b)(2) or paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section; and

      (ii) Provided that liquidation of the entry in question has not become final, will apply to merchandise entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption:

      (A) Sixty calendar days after the date of publication of the final modifying or revoking notice in the  under paragraph (b)(2) or paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section; or

      (B) At the option of a person who makes a valid claim regarding previous treatment, on and after the date of publication of the final modifying or revoking notice in the  under paragraph (b)(2) or paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section.

      § 177.13   Inconsistent CBP decisions.

#### § § 177.13

      (a)  Certain decisions made by CBP officials at one field location which are inconsistent with decisions being made by CBP officials at another location may be brought to the attention of CBP Headquarters for resolution by a petition filed by an interested party. The types of decisions which may be the subject of such a petition, a description of the parties who qualify as interested parties, and the period of time in which the petition may be filed are set forth below.

      (1)  The decisions which may be the subject of a petition include:

      (i) Decisions described in section 514(a) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1514(a)), made with respect to the same, or substantially similar, merchandise; and

      (ii) Repeated decisions to conduct intensified inspections or examinations of merchandise at ports of entry.

      (2)  The following parties will be considered interested parties entitled to file a petition under this section:

      (i) Parties described in section 514(c)(1) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1514(c)(2)), as eligible to file a protest under section 514;

      (ii) A port authority; and

      (iii) An “interested party,” as described in section 516(a)(2) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1516(a)(2)).

      (3)  In the case of decisions described in section 514(a) of the Tariff Act, the petition must be filed within the time prescribed by section 514(c)(2), for filing a protest with respect to the later (or latest) of the decisions which are the subject of the petition. In the case of repeated decisions to conduct intensified inspections or examinations of merchandise at ports of entry, the petition must be filed within ninety (90) days of the later (or latest) such decision.

      (b) —(1)  The petition must be in the form of a letter addressed to the Regulations and Rulings, Office of International Trade, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Washington, DC 20229-0001. Three copies of the petition should be submitted, if possible.

      (2)  The petition should contain a complete description of the inconsistent decisions complained of, including the ports of entry (or other CBP office) where the decisions were made, entry numbers, and the dates (or approximate dates) such decisions were made. The information set forth in the petition must be sufficient to demonstrate the inconsistency of the decisions described and that the merchandise, or circumstances in which the allegedly inconsistent decisions were made, were substantially similar. In the case of repeated decisions regarding the inspection or examination of merchandise, the decisions must be sufficient in number to demonstrate a pattern of inconsistency not attributable to random selection. Any information which the petitioner considers to be confidential business information should be so noted pursuant to § 177.2(b)(7) of this subpart and a sanitized version of his petition should be submitted as well as the three copies requested in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. Petitions which do not contain information sufficient to permit the CBP to verify that the decisions described have occurred will not be considered properly filed and will be returned to the petitioner for additional information. Only one petition will be accepted by the CBP with respect to the decisions alleged to be inconsistent.

      (i)  In the case of decisions involving the tariff classification of merchandise, the petition should also include, with respect to each of the decisions described, the information requested in § 177.2 (b)(1) and (b)(2)(ii) of this subpart, including a sample (see § 177.2(b)(3)).

      (ii)  In the case of other decisions involving subjects which could be addressed under the administrative rulings procedure provided for in §§ 177.1 through 177.10 of this subpart, the information contained in § 177.2 (b)(1), (b)(2)(iii) and/or (b)(2)(iv), as applicable, should be also furnished for each of the decisions addressed by the petition.

      (c)  Upon receipt of a properly filed petition, notice will be published in the  announcing the receipt of the petition and describing the decisions alleged to be inconsistent. Public comment on the petition will be permitted for a period of fifteen (15) days after publication. Public comment regarding the proper disposition of the petition will be limited to that submitted in writing, either with the petition or in response to the  solicitation of public comment.

      (d)  Within fifteen (15) days after the close of the period for public comment referred to in paragraph (c) of this section, CBP will issue a decision to the petitioner addressing the inconsistency complained of. That decision will either conform the inconsistent decisions to the current views of CBP as to the proper tariff classification or other disposition of the subject of those decisions or explain why no inconsistency exists. Copies of the decisions to the petitioner will be transmitted directly to all ports (or other CBP offices) identified in the petition and will be distributed through the Customs Information Exchange or by other means to such other ports or offices as may be necessary to correct any inconsistency identified. A summary of the decision will also be published in the  and the weekly Customs Bulletin.

      (e)  Unless otherwise specified in the decision, a decision issued in response to a petition filed under this section will be effective immediately and, where applicable, applied to all entries for which liquidation is not final.

      (f)  The filing of a petition under this procedure will not preclude the petitioner or any other person entitled to do so from filing a protest or a domestic interested party petition regarding the same matter under the procedures set forth in sections 514, 515 and 516 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended and parts 174 and 175 of this chapter, provided the applicable requirements set forth therein are complied with. However, the decision issued in response to the petition may serve as the basis for the disposition of any protest so filed, or as an information letter setting forth the position of the CBP pursuant to subpart A of part 175 of this chapter. The decision issued in response to a petition filed under this section is not itself a decision subject to protest under sections 514-515 of the Tariff Act and part 174 of this chapter.

      § 177.21   Applicability.

#### § § 177.21

      This subpart applies to the issuance of country-of-origin advisory rulings and final determinations relating to Government procurement under Title III, “Trade Agreements Act of 1979,” Pub. L. 96-39, 93 Stat. 144, for the purpose of granting waivers of certain “Buy American” restrictions in U.S. law or practice for products for eligible countries. This subpart is intended to be applied consistent with the Federal Acquisition Regulations (48 CFR chapter 1) and the Defense Acquisition Regulation (48 CFR chapter 2).

> [T.D. 83-13, 48 FR 1189, Jan. 11, 1983, as amended by CBP Dec. 08-25, 73 FR 40727, July 16, 2008]

      § 177.22   Definitions.

#### § § 177.22

      (a)  For the purpose of this subpart, an article is a product of a country or instrumentality only if (1) it is wholly the growth, product, or manufacture of that country or instrumentality, or (2) in the case of an article which consists in whole or in part of materials from another country or instrumentality, it has been substantially transformed into a new and different article of commerce with a name, character, or use distinct from that of the article or articles from which it was so transformed. The term “instrumentality” shall not be construed to include any agency or division of the government of a country, but may be construed to include such arrangements as the European Economic Community.

      (b)  An advisory ruling is a non-binding, non-reviewable written statement issued by the Director, Commercial and Trade Facilitation Division, Regulations and Rulings, Headquarters, U.S. Customs and Border protection, which does no more than call attention to a well established interpretation or principal of law relating to the country of origin, without applying it to a particular set of facts. CBP will issue an advisory ruling in response to a request for a final determination if:

      (1) The request suggests that general information, rather than a final determination, is actually being sought,

      (2) The request is incomplete or otherwise fails to meet the requirements set forth in § 177.25(a), or

      (3) The ruling requested cannot be issued for any other reason, and CBP believes that the general information supplied by an advisory ruling may be of some benefit to the party making the request. An advisory ruling is not a ruling issued prior to importation under 28 U.S.C. 1581(h).

      (c)  A final determination is a binding judicially reviewable statement issued by the Executive Director, Regulations and Rulings, Office of International Trade, Headquarters, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, in response to a written request submitted under the provisions of this subpart that interprets and applies the provisions of law and regulation relating to the country of origin to a specific set of facts. A final determination may be issued to a party-at-interest prior to actual entry of the merchandise.

      (d)  For purposes of this subpart the term party-at-interest means:

      (1) A foreign manufacturer, producer, or exporter, or a United States importer of merchandise which is the subject of a final determination under this subpart,

      (2) A manufacturer, producer, or wholesaler in the United States of a like product,

      (3) United States members of a labor organization or other association of workers whose members are employed in the manufacture, production, or wholesale in the United States of a like product, and

      (4) A trade or business association a majority of whose members manufacture, produce, or wholesale a like product in the United States.

      (b) A request for a final determination shall be in writing and shall contain the following information:

      (1) The name of the requester, the requester's principal place of business, and a statement that the requester is authorized to file the request under the provisions of § 177.24;

If the request does not meet the requirements of this subpart Customs may decline to issue a final determination or may issue instead an advisory ruling.

      (c) Requests for final determinations which include the information set forth in § 177.25(b)(5) (relating to a specific procurement) will be considered by Customs before all other requests (advisory rulings and final determinations).

#### § § 177.0

    This part relates to the issuance of rulings to importers and other interested persons by the CBP, other than advance rulings under Article 509 of the North American Free Trade Agreement (see subpart I of part 181 of this chapter). It describes the situations in which a ruling may be requested, the procedures to be followed in requesting a ruling, the conditions under which a ruling will be issued, the effect of a ruling when it is issued, and the publication of rulings in the Customs Bulletin. The rulings issued under the provisions of this part will usually be prospective in application and, consequently, will usually not relate to specific matters or situations presently or previously under consideration by any CBP field office. Accordingly, the rulings requested under the provisions of this part should be distinguished from the administrative rulings, determinations, or decisions which may be requested under procedures set forth elsewhere in this chapter, including, but not limited to, those set forth in part 12 (relating to submissions of proof of admissibility of articles detained under section 307 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1307)), part 103 (relating to disclosure of information in Customs files), subpart C of part 152 (relating to determinations concerning the dutiable value of merchandise by Customs field officers), part 153 (relating to enforcement of the Antidumping Act, 1921, as amended), part 159 (insofar as it relates to countervailing duties), part 171 (relating to fines, penalties, and forfeitures), part 172 (relating to liquidated damages), part 174 (relating to protests), and part 175 (relating to petitions filed by American manufacturers, producers, or wholesalers pursuant to section 516 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended). Nor do the provisions of part 177 apply to requests for decisions of an operational, administrative, or investigative nature which are properly within the cognizance of a CBP Headquarters Office other than Regulations and Rulings, Office of International Trade.

      § 181.12   Maintenance and availability of records.

#### § § 181.12

      (a) —(1)  An exporter or producer in the United States who completes and signs a Certificate of Origin shall maintain in the United States, for five years after the date on which the Certificate was signed, the Certificate (or copy thereof) and all other records relating to the origin of a good for which preferential tariff treatment may be claimed in Canada or Mexico, including records associated with:

      (i) The purchase of, cost of, value of, and payment for, the good that is exported from the United States;

      (ii) The purchase of, cost of, value of, and payment for, all materials, including indirect materials, used in the production of the good that is exported from the United States; and

      (iii) The production of the good in the form in which the good is exported from the United States.

      (2)  The records referred to in paragraph (a) of this section shall be maintained in accordance with the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles applied in the United States and may be maintained in hard-copy form, on microfilm or microfiche or in automated record storage devices (for example, magnetic discs and tapes) if associated computer programs are available to facilitate retrieval of the data in a usable form.

If a U.S. exporter or producer fails to maintain records or make records available to the Canadian or Mexican customs administration in accordance with the provisions of this section, or if a U.S. producer fails to conform its records to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles as provided in this paragraph, the Canadian or Mexican customs administration may deny preferential tariff treatment to the good that is the subject of the verification visit.

#### § § 181.21

      (a)  In connection with a claim for preferential tariff treatment, or for the exemption from the merchandise processing fee, for a good under the NAFTA, the U.S. importer must make a formal declaration that the good qualifies for such treatment. The declaration may be made by including on the entry summary, or equivalent documentation, including electronic submissions, the symbol “CA” for a good of Canada, or the symbol “MX” for a good of Mexico, as a prefix to the subheading of the HTSUS under which each qualifying good is classified. Except as otherwise provided in 19 CFR 181.22 and except in the case of a good to which Appendix 6.B to Annex 300-B of the NAFTA applies (see also 19 CFR 102.25), the declaration must be based on a complete and properly executed original Certificate of Origin, or copy thereof, which is in the possession of the importer and which covers the good being imported.

      (b)  If, after making the declaration required under paragraph (a) of this section or under § 181.32(b)(2) of this part, the U.S. importer has reason to believe that a Certificate of Origin on which a declaration was based contains information that is not correct, the importer shall within 30 calendar days after the date of discovery of the error make a corrected declaration and pay any duties that may be due. A corrected declaration shall be effected by submission of a letter or other written statement to the CBP office where the original declaration was filed.

      § 181.22   Maintenance of records and submission of Certificate by importer.

#### § § 181.22

      (a)  Each importer claiming preferential tariff treatment for a good imported into the United States shall maintain in the United States, for five years after the date of entry of the good, all documentation relating to the importation of the good. Such documentation shall include a copy of the Certificate of Origin and any other relevant records as specified in § 163.1(a) of this chapter.

      (b)  An importer who claims preferential tariff treatment on a good under § 181.21 of this part shall provide, at the request of the Center director, a copy of each Certificate of Origin pertaining to the good which is in the possession of the importer. A Certificate of Origin submitted to CBP under this paragraph or under § 181.32(b)(3) of this part:

      (1) Shall be on CBP Form 434, or its electronic equivalent including privately-printed copies thereof, or on such other form as approved by the Canadian or Mexican customs administration, or, as an alternative to CBP Form 434 or such other approved form, in an approved computerized format or such other medium or format as is approved by the Office of International Trade, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Washington, DC 20229. An alternative format must contain the same information and certification set forth on CBP Form 434;

      (2) Shall be signed by the exporter or by the exporter's authorized agent having knowledge of the relevant facts;

      (3) Shall be completed either in the English language or in the language of the country from which the good is exported. If the Certificate is completed in a language other than English, the importer shall also provide to the Center director, upon request, a written English translation thereof;

      (4) Shall be accepted by CBP for four years after the date on which the Certificate was signed by the exporter or producer; and

      (5) May be applicable to:

      (i) A single importation of a good into the United States, including a single shipment that results in the filing of one or more entries and a series of shipments that results in the filing of one entry; or

      (ii) Multiple importations of identical goods into the United States that occur within a specified period, not exceeding 12 months, set out therein by the exporter or producer.

      (c)  A Certificate of Origin shall be accepted by the Center director as valid for the purpose set forth in § 181.11(a) of this part, provided that the Certificate is completed, signed and dated in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section. If the Center director determines that a Certificate is illegible or defective or has not been completed in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, the importer shall be given a period of not less than five working days to submit a corrected Certificate. Acceptance of a Certificate will result in the granting of preferential tariff treatment to the imported good unless, in connection with an origin verification initiated under subpart G of this part or based on a pattern of conduct within the meaning of § 181.76(c) of this part, the Center director determines that the imported good does not qualify as an originating good or should not be accorded such treatment for any other reason as specifically provided for elsewhere in this part. A Certificate shall not be accepted in connection with subsequent importations during a period referred to in paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section if, based on an origin verification under subpart G of this part, the Center director determined that a previously imported identical good covered by the Certificate did not qualify as an originating good.

      (d) —(1)  Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, an importer shall not be required to have a Certificate of Origin in his possession for:

      (i) An importation of a good for which the port director or Center director before January 19, 2017, or the Center director on or after January 19, 2017, has in writing waived the requirement for a Certificate of Origin because the port director or Center director is otherwise satisfied that the good qualifies for preferential tariff treatment under the NAFTA;

      (ii) A non-commercial importation of a good; or

      (iii) A commercial importation for which the total value of originating goods does not exceed US$2,500, provided that, unless waived by the Center director, the producer, exporter, importer or authorized agent includes on, or attaches to, the invoice or other document accompanying the shipment the following signed statement:

      (2)  If the Center director determines that an importation described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section forms part of a series of importations that may reasonably be considered to have been undertaken or arranged for the purpose of avoiding a certification requirement set forth in this part, the Center director shall notify the importer in writing that for that importation the importer must have in his possession a valid Certificate of Origin to support the claim for preferential tariff treatment. The importer shall have 30 calendar days from the date of the written notice to obtain a valid Certificate, and a failure to timely obtain the Certificate will result in denial of the claim for preferential tariff treatment. For purposes of paragraph (d)(2) of this section, a “series of importations” means two or more entries covering goods arriving on the same day from the same exporter and consigned to the same person.

      § 181.23   Effect of noncompliance; failure to provide documentation regarding transshipment.

#### § § 181.23

      (a)  If the importer fails to comply with any requirement under this part, including submission of a Certificate of Origin under § 181.22(b) or submission of a corrected Certificate under § 181.22(c), the Center director may deny preferential tariff treatment to the imported good.

      (b)  Where the requirements for preferential tariff treatment set forth elsewhere in this part are met, the Center director nevertheless may deny preferential tariff treatment to an originating good if the good is shipped through or transshipped in a country other than the United States, Canada or Mexico and the importer of the good does not provide, at the request of the Center director, copies of the customs control documents that indicate to the satisfaction of the Center director that the good remained under customs control while in such other country.

    Subpart D—Post-Importation Duty Refund Claims

      § 181.31   Right to make post-importation claim and refund duties.

#### § § 181.31

      Notwithstanding any other available remedy, including the right to amend an entry so long as liquidation of the entry has not become final, where a good would have qualified as an originating good when it was imported into the United States but no claim for preferential tariff treatment on that originating good was made at that time under § 181.21(a) of this part, the importer of that good may file a claim for a refund of any excess duties at any time within one year after the date of importation of the good in accordance with the procedures set forth in § 181.32 of this part. Subject to the provisions of § 181.23 of this part, Customs may refund any excess duties by liquidation or reliquidation of the entry covering the good in accordance with § 181.33(c) of this part.

      § 181.32   Filing procedures.

#### § § 181.32

      (a)  A post-importation claim for a refund under § 181.31 of this part shall be filed with CBP, either at the port of entry or electronically.

      (b)  A post-importation claim for a refund shall be filed by presentation of the following:

      (2) Subject to § 181.22(d) of this part, a copy of each Certificate of Origin (see § 181.11 of this part) pertaining to the good;

      (3) A written statement indicating whether or not the importer of the good provided a copy of the entry summary or equivalent documentation to any other person. If such documentation was so provided, the statement shall identify each recipient by name, Customs identification number and address and shall specify the date on which the documentation was provided;

      (4) A written statement indicating whether or not the importer of the good is aware of any claim for refund, waiver or reduction of duties relating to the good within the meaning of Article 303 of the NAFTA (see subpart E of this part). If the importer is aware of any such claim, the statement shall identify each claim by number and date and shall identify the person who made the claim by name, Customs identification number and address; and

      (5) A written statement indicating whether or not any person has filed a protest or a petition or request for reliquidation relating to the good under any provision of law, and if any such protest or petition or request for reliquidation has been filed, the statement shall identify the protest, petition or request by number and date.

      § 181.33   Customs processing procedures.

#### § § 181.33

      (a)  After receipt of a post-importation claim under § 181.32 of this part, the Center director shall determine whether the entry covering the good has been liquidated and, if liquidation has taken place, whether the liquidation has become final.

      (b)  If the Center director determines that any protest or any petition or request for reliquidation relating to the good has not been finally decided, the Center director shall suspend action on the claim filed under this subpart until the decision on the protest, petition or request becomes final. If a summons involving the tariff classification or dutiability of the good is filed in the Court of International Trade, the Center director shall suspend action on the claim filed under this subpart until judicial review has been completed.

      (c) —(1)  If the Center director determines that a claim for a refund filed under this subpart should be allowed and the entry covering the good has not been liquidated, the Center director shall take into account the claim for refund under this subpart in connection with the liquidation of the entry.

      (2)  If the Center director determines that a claim for a refund filed under this subpart should be allowed and the entry covering the good has been liquidated, whether or not the liquidation has become final, the entry must be reliquidated in order to effect a refund of duties pursuant to this subpart. If the entry is otherwise to be reliquidated based on administrative review of a protest or petition for reliquidation or as a result of judicial review, the Center director shall reliquidate the entry taking into account the claim for refund under this subpart.

      (3)  If any information is provided to Customs pursuant to § 181.32(b) (4) or (5) of this part, that information, together with notice of the allowance of the claim and the amount of duty refunded pursuant to this subpart, shall be provided by the Center director to the customs administration of the country from which the good was exported.

      (d) —(1)  The Center director may deny a claim for a refund filed under this subpart if the claim was not filed timely, if the importer has not complied with the requirements of this subpart, if the Certificate of Origin submitted under § 181.32(b)(2) of this part cannot be accepted as valid (see § 181.22(c) of this part), or if, following initiation of an origin verification under § 181.72(a) of this part, the Center director determines either that the imported good did not qualify as an originating good at the time of importation or that a basis exists upon which preferential tariff treatment may be denied under § 181.72(d), § 181.74(c) or § 181.76(c) of this part.

      (2)  If the Center director determines that a claim for a refund filed under this subpart should be denied and the entry covering the good has not been liquidated, the Center director shall deny the claim in connection with the liquidation of the entry, and written notice of the denial and the reason therefor shall be given to the importer and, in the case of a denial on the merits, to any person who completed and signed a Certificate of Origin relating to the good. Each notice of denial given to a person who completed and signed a Certificate of Origin shall also include a statement regarding the right to file a protest against the denial under part 174 of this chapter.

      (3)  If the Center director determines that a claim for a refund filed under this subpart should be denied and the entry covering the good has been liquidated, whether or not the liquidation has become final, the claim may be denied without reliquidation of the entry. If the entry is otherwise to be reliquidated based on administrative review of a protest or petition for reliquidation or as a result of judicial review, such reliquidation may include denial of the claim filed under this subpart. In either case, the Center director shall give written notice of the denial and the reason therefor to the importer and, in the case of a denial on the merits, to any person who completed and signed a Certificate of Origin relating to the good.

      (a) Antidumping and countervailing duties;

      (b) A premium offered or collected on a good with respect to quantitative import restrictions, tariff rate quotas or tariff preference levels;

      (c) Fees applied under section 22 of the U.S. Agricultural Adjustment Act; and

      § 181.43   Eligible goods subject to drawback.

#### § § 181.43

      Except as otherwise provided in this subpart, drawback is authorized for an imported good that is entered for consumption and is:

      (a) Subsequently exported to Canada or Mexico (see 19 U.S.C. 1313(j)(1));

      (b) Used as a material in the production of another good that is subsequently exported to Canada or Mexico (see 19 U.S.C. 1313(a)); or

      (c) Substituted by a good of the same kind and quality as defined in § 181.44(c) of this subpart and used as a material in the production of another good that is subsequently exported to Canada or Mexico (see 19 U.S.C. 1313(b)).

      § 181.44   Calculation of drawback.

#### § § 181.44

      (a)  Except in the case of goods specified in § 181.45 of this part, drawback of the duties previously paid upon importation of a good into the United States may be granted by the United States, upon presentation of a NAFTA drawback claim under this subpart, on the lower amount of:

      (1) The total duties paid or owed on the good in the United States; or

      (2) The total amount of duties paid on the exported good upon subsequent importation into Canada or Mexico.

      (b)  For purposes of this section, relative value shall be determined, and the comparison between the duties referred to in paragraph (a)(1) of this section and the duties referred to in paragraph (a)(2) of this section shall be made, separately with reference to each individual exported good, including where two components or materials are used to produce one exported good or one component or material is divided among multiple exported goods.

      (c)  Upon presentation of the NAFTA drawback claim under 19 U.S.C. 1313(a), in which the amount of drawback payable is based on the lesser amount of the customs duties paid on the good either to the United States or to Canada or Mexico, the amount of drawback refunded shall not exceed 99 percent of the duty paid on such imported merchandise into the United States.

      (d)  Upon presentation of a NAFTA drawback claim under 19 U.S.C. 1313(b), on which the amount of drawback payable is based on the lesser amount of the customs duties paid on the good either to the United States or to Canada or Mexico, the amount of drawback is the same as that which would have been allowed had the substituted merchandise used in manufacture been itself imported. For purposes of drawback under this subpart, the term “same kind and quality” used in § 1313(b) (see § 191.2(x)(1) of this chapter) shall have the same meaning as the term “identical or similar good” used in Article 303 of the NAFTA except that there shall be no requirement that the good be manufactured in the same country.

      (a)  A claim for drawback will be granted, upon the submission of appropriate documentation to substantiate compliance with the drawback laws and regulations of the United States, evidence of exportation to Canada or Mexico, and satisfactory evidence of the payment of duties to Canada or Mexico. Unless otherwise provided in this subpart, the documentation, filing procedures, time and place requirements and other applicable procedures required to determine whether a good qualifies for drawback must be in accordance with the provisions of part 190 or 191 of this chapter, as appropriate; however, a drawback claim subject to the provisions of this subpart must be filed separately from any part 191 drawback claim (that is, a claim that involves goods exported to countries other than Canada or Mexico). Claims inappropriately filed or otherwise not completed within the 3-year period specified in § 181.46 of this part will be considered abandoned.

      (b) —(1)  A complete drawback claim under this subpart must consist of the filing of the appropriate completed drawback entry form, evidence of exportation (a copy of the Canadian or Mexican customs entry showing the amount of duty paid to Canada or Mexico) and its supporting documents, certificate(s) of delivery, when necessary, or certificate(s) of manufacture and delivery, and a certification from the Canadian or Mexican importer as to the amount of duties paid. Each drawback entry form filed under this subpart must be conspicuously marked at the top with the word “NAFTA”.

      (2)  The following documentation, for the drawback claims specified below, must be submitted to CBP in order for a drawback claim to be processed under this subpart. Missing documentation or incorrect or incomplete information on required customs forms or supporting documentation will result in an incomplete drawback claim.

      (F) An affidavit of the party claiming drawback stating that no other drawback claim has been made on the designated goods, that such party has not provided an exporter's Certificate of Origin pertaining to the exported goods to another party except as stated on the drawback claim, and that the party agrees to notify CBP if he subsequently provides such an exporter's Certificate of Origin to any person.

      (ii)  The following must be submitted in connection with a drawback claim covering a good in the same condition:

This is required if the drawback claimant is not the original importer of the merchandise which is the subject of a same condition claim;

      (E) In-bond application submitted pursuant to part 18 of this chapter, if applicable. This is required for merchandise which is examined at one port but exported through border points outside of that port. Such goods must travel in bond from the location where they were examined to the point of the border crossing (exportation). If examination is waived, in-bond transportation is not required;

      (F) Notification of intent to export or waiver of prior notice;

      (G)  Acceptable documentary evidence of exportation of goods to Canada or Mexico may include originals or copies of any of the following documents that are issued by the exporting carrier: bill of lading, air waybill, freight waybill, export ocean bill of lading, Canadian customs manifest, and cargo manifest. Supporting documentary evidence must establish fully the time and fact of exportation, the identity of the exporter, and the identity and location of the ultimate consignee of the exported goods;

      (H) Waiver of right to drawback. If the party exporting to Canada or Mexico was not the importer, a written waiver from the importer and from each intermediate person to whom the goods were transferred is required in order for the claim to be considered complete; and

      (I) An affidavit of the party claiming drawback stating that no other drawback claim has been made on the designated goods.

In the case of nonconforming goods, such documentation may include a copy of a purchase order and any related documents such as a specification sheet, catalogue or advertising brochure from the supplier, the basis for which the order was placed, and copy of a letter or telex or credit memo from the supplier indicating acceptance of the returned merchandise. This documentation is necessary to establish that the goods are, in fact, being returned to the party from which they were procured or that they are being sent to the supplier's other customer directly;

      (D) CBP Form 7512, if applicable; and

      (E) Evidence of exportation, as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(G) of this section.

      (v)  The provisions of paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section relating to direct identification manufacturing drawback will apply to claims for drawback on foreign-built jet aircraft engines repaired or reconditioned in the United States filed under this subpart insofar as applicable to and not inconsistent with the provisions of this subpart and the provisions of subpart N of part 191 of this chapter.

      (c)  For purposes of this subpart, evidence of exportation and satisfactory evidence of payment of duties in Canada or Mexico must consist of one of the following types of documentation, provided that, for purposes of evidence of duties paid, such documentation includes the import entry number, the date of importation, the tariff classification number, the rate of duty and the amount of duties paid:

      (1) In the case of Canada, the Canadian entry document, referred to as the Canada Customs Invoice or B-3, presented with either the K-84 Statement or the Detailed Coding Statement. A Canadian customs document that is not accompanied by a valid receipt is not adequate evidence of exportation and payment of duty in Canada;

      (2) In the case of Mexico, the Mexican entry document (the “pedimento”);

      (3) The final customs duty determination of Canada or Mexico, or a copy thereof, respecting the relevant entry; or

      (4) An affidavit, from the person claiming drawback, which is based on information received from the importer of the good in Canada or Mexico.

      (a)  The person named as exporter on the notice of exportation or on the bill of lading, air waybill, freight waybill, Canadian or Mexican customs manifest, cargo manifest, or certified copies of these documents, shall be considered the exporter and entitled to manufacturing drawback, unless the manufacturer or producer shall reserve the right to claim drawback. The manufacturer or producer who reserves this right may claim drawback, and he shall receive payment upon production of satisfactory evidence that the reservation was made with the knowledge and consent of the exporter. Drawback also may be granted to the agent of the manufacturer, producer, or exporter, or to the person the manufacturer, producer, exporter, or agent directs in writing to receive the drawback of duties.

#### § § 181.50

      (a)  When the drawback claim has been fully completed by the filing of all required documents, and exportation of the articles has been established and the amount of duties paid to Canada or Mexico has been established, the entry will be liquidated to determine the proper amount of drawback due either in accordance with the limitation on drawback set forth in § 181.44 of this part or in accordance with the regular drawback calculation.

      (b)  A drawback claim shall not be liquidated until either a written waiver of the right to protest under 19 U.S.C. 1514 is filed with Customs or the liquidation of the import entry has become final under U.S. law. In addition, except in the case of goods covered by § 181.45 of this part, a drawback claim shall not be liquidated for a period of 3 years after the date of entry of the goods in Canada or Mexico.

      (c)  Accelerated drawback payment procedures shall apply as set forth in § 190.92 or § 191.92 of this chapter, as appropriate. However, a person who receives drawback of duties under this procedure shall repay the duties paid if a NAFTA drawback claim is adversely affected thereafter by administrative or court action.

#### § § 181.53

      (a) —(1)  The following definitions shall apply for purposes of this section:

      (i)  “Date of exportation” means the date of importation into Canada or Mexico as reflected on the applicable Canadian or Mexican entry document (see § 181.47(c) (1) and (2)).

      (ii)  A “duty-deferral program” means any measure which postpones duty payment upon arrival of a good in the United States until withdrawn or removed for exportation to Canada or Mexico or for entry into a Canadian or Mexican duty-deferral program. Such measures govern manipulation warehouses, manufacturing warehouses, smelting and refining warehouses, foreign trade zones, and those temporary importations under bond that are specified in paragraph (b)(5) of this section.

      (2) —(i)  (A) Where a good is imported into the United States pursuant to a duty-deferral program and is subsequently withdrawn from the duty-deferral program for exportation to Canada or Mexico or is used as a material in the production of another good that is subsequently withdrawn from the duty-deferral program for exportation to Canada or Mexico, and provided that the good is a “good subject to NAFTA drawback” within the meaning of 19 U.S.C. 3333 and is not described in § 181.45 of this part, the documentation required to be filed under this section in connection with the exportation of the good shall, for purposes of this chapter, constitute an entry or withdrawal for consumption and the exported good shall be subject to duty which shall be assessed in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.

      (C) Any assessment of duty under this section shall include the duties and fees referred to in § 181.42 (a) through (c) and the fees provided for in § 24.23 of this chapter; these inclusions shall not be subject to refund, waiver, reduction or drawback.

      (ii)  The provisions of § 142.4 of this chapter shall apply to each withdrawal and exportation transaction described in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section. However, in applying the provisions of § 142.4 of this chapter in the context of this section, any reference to release from Customs custody in § 142.4 of this chapter shall be taken to mean exportation to Canada or Mexico.

      (iii) —(A)  In the circumstances described in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section, the documentation described in paragraph (a)(2)(iii)(B) of this section must be filed by one of the following persons:

      () In the case of a withdrawal from a foreign trade zone, the person who has the right to make entry. However, if a zone operator is not the person with the right to make entry of the good, the zone operator shall be responsible for the payment of any duty due in the event the zone operator permits such other person to remove the goods from the zone and such other person fails to comply with §§ 146.67 and 146.68 of this chapter.

      (B)  The person required to file shall file Customs Form 7501, or its electronic equivalent, no later than 10 working days after the date of exportation to Canada or Mexico or 10 working days after being entered into a duty-deferral program in Canada or Mexico. Except where the context otherwise requires and except as otherwise specifically provided in this paragraph, the procedures for completing and filing Customs Form 7501 in connection with the entry of merchandise under this chapter shall apply for purposes of this paragraph. For purposes of completing Customs Form 7501 under this paragraph, any reference on the form to the entry date shall be taken to refer to the date of exportation of the good or the date the goods are entered into a duty-deferral program in Canada or Mexico. The Customs Form 7501 required under this paragraph may be transmitted electronically.

      (C)  The duty estimated to be due under paragraph (b) of this section shall be deposited with Customs 60 calendar days after the date of exportation of the good. If a good is entered into a duty-deferral program in Canada or Mexico, the duty estimated to be due under paragraph (b) of this section, but without any waiver or reduction provided for in that paragraph, shall be deposited with Customs 60 calendar days after the date the good is entered into such duty-deferral program. Nothing shall preclude the deposit of such estimated duty at the time of filing the Customs Form 7501, or its electronic equivalent, under paragraph (a)(2)(iii)(B) of this section or at any other time within the 60-day period prescribed in this paragraph. However, any interest calculation shall run from the date the duties are required to be deposited.

      (3) —(i)  Except in the case of duties and fees referred to in §§ 181.42(a) through (c) and fees provided for in § 24.23 of this chapter, Customs shall waive or reduce the duties paid or owed under paragraph (a)(2) of this section by the person who is required to file the Customs Form 7501, or its electronic equivalent, (see paragraph (a)(2)(iii)(A) of this section) in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, provided that a claim for waiver or reduction of the duties is filed with Customs within the appropriate 60-day time frame. The claim shall be based on evidence of exportation or entry into a Canadian or Mexican duty-deferral program and satisfactory evidence of duties paid in Canada or Mexico (see § 181.47(c)).

      (ii)  A claim for a waiver or reduction of duties under paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section shall be made on Customs Form 7501, or its electronic equivalent, which shall set forth, in addition to the information required under paragraph (a)(2)(iii)(B) of this section, a description of the good exported to Canada or Mexico and the Canadian or Mexican import entry number, date of importation, tariff classification number, rate of duty and amount of duty paid. If a claim for reduction of duties is filed under this paragraph, the reduced duties shall be deposited with Customs when the claim is filed.

      (iii)  After goods in a duty-deferral program in the United States which have been sent from the United States and entered into a duty-deferral program in Canada or Mexico are then withdrawn from that Canadian or Mexican duty-deferral program either for entry into Canada or Mexico or for export to a non-NAFTA country, the person who filed the Customs Form 7501, or its electronic equivalent, (see paragraph (a)(2)(iii)(A) of this section) may file a claim for drawback if the goods are withdrawn within 5 years from the date of the original importation of the good into the United States. If the goods are entered for consumption in Canada or Mexico, drawback will be calculated in accordance with § 181.44 of this part.

      (4) —(i)  If no claim for a waiver or reduction of duties is filed in accordance with paragraph (a)(3) of this section, Customs shall determine the final duties due under paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section and shall post a bulletin notice of liquidation of the entry filed under this section in accordance with § 159.9 of this chapter. Where no claim was filed in accordance with this section and Customs fails to liquidate, or extend liquidation of, the entry filed under this section within 1 year from the date of the entry, upon the date of expiration of that 1-year period the entry shall be deemed liquidated by operation of law in the amount asserted by the exporter on the Customs Form 7501, or its electronic equivalent, filed under paragraph (a)(2)(iii)(A) of this section. A protest under section 514, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1514), and part 174 of this chapter shall be filed within 90 days from the date of posting of the notice of liquidation under this section.

      (ii)  If a claim for a waiver or reduction of duties is filed in accordance with paragraph (a)(3) of this section, an extension of liquidation of the entry filed under this section shall take effect for a period not to exceed 3 years from the date the entry was filed. Before the close of the extension period, Customs shall liquidate the entry filed under this section and shall post a bulletin notice of liquidation in accordance with § 159.9 of this chapter. If Customs fails to liquidate the entry filed under this section within 4 years from the date of the entry, upon the date of expiration of that 4-year period the entry shall be deemed liquidated by operation of law in the amount asserted by the exporter on the Customs Form 7501, or its electronic equivalent, filed under paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section. A protest under section 514, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1514), and part 174 of this chapter shall be filed within 90 days from the date of posting of the notice of liquidation under this section.

      (b) —(1)  Where a good subject to NAFTA drawback under this subpart is withdrawn from a bonded warehouse (19 U.S.C. 1562) after manipulation for exportation to Canada or Mexico or for entry into a duty-deferral program in Canada or Mexico, duty shall be assessed on the good in its condition and quantity, and at its weight, at the time of such withdrawal from the warehouse and with such additions to, or deductions from, the final appraised value as may be necessary by reason of its change in condition. Such duty shall be paid no later than 60 calendar days after the date of exportation or of entry into the duty-deferral program of Canada or Mexico, except that, upon filing of a proper claim under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, the duty shall be waived or reduced in an amount that does not exceed the lesser of the total amount of duty payable on the good under this section or the total amount of customs duties paid to Canada or Mexico.

      (2)  Where a good is manufactured in a bonded warehouse (19 U.S.C. 1311) with imported materials and is then withdrawn for exportation to Canada or Mexico or for entry into a duty-deferral program in Canada or Mexico, duty shall be assessed on the materials in their condition and quantity, and at their weight, at the time of their importation into the United States. Such duty shall be paid no later than 60 calendar days after either the date of exportation or of entry into a duty-deferral program of Canada or Mexico, except that, upon filing of a proper claim under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, the duty shall be waived or reduced in an amount that does not exceed the lesser of the total amount of duty payable on the materials under this section or the total amount of customs duties paid to Canada or Mexico.

      (3)  For any qualifying imported metal-bearing materials (19 U.S.C. 1312), duty shall be assessed on the imported materials and the charges against the bond canceled no later than 60 calendar days after either the date of exportation of the treated materials to Canada or Mexico or the date of entry of the treated materials into a duty-deferral program of Canada or Mexico, either from the bonded smelting or refining warehouse or from such other customs bonded warehouse after the transfer of the same quantity of material from a bonded smelting or refining warehouse. However, upon filing of a proper claim under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, the duty on the imported materials shall be waived or reduced in an amount that does not exceed the lesser of the total amount of duty payable on the imported materials under this section or the total amount of customs duties paid to Canada or Mexico.

      (4)  For a good that is manufactured or otherwise changed in condition in a foreign trade zone (19 U.S.C. 81c(a)) and then withdrawn from the zone for exportation to Canada or Mexico or for entry into a Canadian or Mexican duty-deferral program, the duty assessed, as calculated under paragraph (b)(4)(i) or (b)(4)(ii) of this section, shall be paid no later than 60 calendar days after either the date of exportation of the good to Canada or Mexico or the date of entry of the good into a duty-deferral program of Canada or Mexico, except that, upon filing of a proper claim under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, the duty shall be waived or reduced in an amount that does not exceed the lesser of the total amount of duty payable on the good under this section or the total amount of customs duties paid to Canada or Mexico.

      (i)  In the case of a nonprivileged foreign status good, duty is assessed on the good in its condition and quantity, and at its weight, at the time of its exportation from the zone to Canada or Mexico or its entry into a duty-deferral program of Canada or Mexico.

      (ii)  In the case of a privileged foreign status good, duty is assessed on the good in its condition and quantity, and at its weight, at the time privileged status is granted in the zone.

      (5)  Except in the case of a good imported from Canada or Mexico for repair or alteration, where a good, regardless of its origin, was imported temporarily free of duty for repair, alteration or processing (subheading 9813.00.05, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States) and is subsequently exported to Canada or Mexico, duty shall be assessed on the good on the basis of its condition at the time of its importation into the United States. Such duty shall be paid no later than 60 calendar days after either the date of exportation or the date of entry into a duty-deferral program of Canada or Mexico, except that, upon filing of a proper claim under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, the duty shall be waived or reduced in an amount that does not exceed the lesser of the total amount of duty payable on the good under this section or the total amount of customs duties paid to Canada or Mexico.

      (c)  If a person intends to claim a waiver or reduction of duty on goods under this section, that person shall maintain records concerning the value of all involved goods or materials at the time of their importation into the United States and concerning the value of the goods at the time of their exportation to Canada or Mexico or entry into a duty-deferral program of Canada or Mexico, and if a person files a claim under this section for a waiver or reduction of duty on goods exported to Canada or Mexico or entered into a Canadian or Mexican duty-deferral program, that person shall maintain evidence of exportation or entry into a Canadian or Mexican duty-deferral program and satisfactory evidence of the amount of any customs duties paid to Canada or Mexico on the good (see § 181.47(c)). Failure to maintain adequate records will result in denial of the claim for waiver or reduction of duty.

      (d)  If the person identified in paragraph (a)(2)(iii)(A) of this section fails to file a proper claim within the 60-day period specified in this section, that person, or the FTZ operator pursuant to paragraph (a)(2)(iii)(A)() of this section, will be liable for payment of the full duties assessed under this section and without any waiver or reduction thereof.

      (e)  If a claim for a refund of duties is allowed by the Canadian or Mexican customs administration under Article 502(3) of the NAFTA or under any other circumstance after duties have been waived or reduced under this section, Customs may reliquidate the entry filed under this section pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 1508(b)(2)(B)(iii) even after liquidation of the entry has become final.

      § 181.54   Verification of claim for drawback, waiver or reduction of duties.

#### § § 181.54

      The allowance of a claim for drawback, waiver or reduction of duties submitted under this subpart shall be subject to such verification, including verification with the Canadian or Mexican customs administration of any documentation obtained in Canada or Mexico and submitted in connection with the claim, as Customs may deem necessary.

    Subpart F—Commercial Samples and Goods Returned After Repair or Alteration

      § 181.61   Applicability.

#### § § 181.61

      This subpart sets forth the rules which apply for purposes of duty-free entry of commercial samples of negligible value as provided for in Article 306 of the NAFTA and for purposes of the re-entry of goods after repair or alteration in Canada or Mexico as provided for in Article 307 of the NAFTA.

      § 181.62   Commercial samples of negligible value.

#### § § 181.62

      (a)  Commercial samples of negligible value imported from Canada or Mexico may qualify for duty-free entry under subheading 9811.00.60, HTSUS. For purposes of this section, “commercial samples of negligible value” means commercial samples which have a value, individually or in the aggregate as shipped, of not more than US$1, or the equivalent amount in the currency of Canada or Mexico, or which are so marked, torn, perforated, or otherwise treated that they are unsuitable for sale or for use except as commercial samples.

      (b)  Commercial samples of negligible value imported from Canada or Mexico will qualify for duty-free entry under subheading 9811.00.60, HTSUS, only if:

      (1) The samples are imported solely for the purpose of soliciting orders for foreign goods; and

      (2) If valued over US$1, the samples are properly marked, torn, perforated or otherwise treated prior to arrival in the United States so that they are unsuitable for sale or for use except as commercial samples.

      § 181.63   [Reserved]

#### § § 181.63

      § 181.64   Goods re-entered after repair or alteration in Canada or Mexico.

#### § § 181.64

      (a)  This section sets forth the rules which apply for purposes of obtaining duty-free or reduced-duty treatment on goods returned after repair or alteration in Canada or Mexico as provided for in subheadings 9802.00.40 and 9802.00.50, HTSUS. Goods returned after having been repaired or altered in Mexico, whether or not pursuant to a warranty, and goods returned after having been repaired or altered in Canada pursuant to a warranty, are eligible for duty-free treatment, provided that the requirements of this section are met. Goods returned after having been repaired or altered in Canada other than pursuant to a warranty are subject to duty upon the value of the repairs or alterations using the applicable duty rate under the United States-Canada Free-Trade Agreement (see § 10.301 of this chapter), provided that the requirements of this section are met. For purposes of this section, “repairs or alterations” means restoration, addition, renovation, redyeing, cleaning, resterilizing, or other treatment which does not destroy the essential characteristics of, or create a new or commercially different good from, the good exported from the United States.

      (b)  The duty-free or reduced-duty treatment referred to in paragraph (a) of this section shall not apply to goods which, in their condition as exported from the United States to Canada or Mexico, are incomplete for their intended use and for which the processing operation performed in Canada or Mexico constitutes an operation that is performed as a matter of course in the preparation or manufacture of finished goods.

      (c) —(1)  Except as otherwise provided in this section, the following declarations shall be filed in connection with the entry of goods which are returned from Canada or Mexico after having been exported for repairs or alterations and which are claimed to be duty free or subject to duty only on the value of the repairs or alterations performed abroad:

      (i) A declaration from the person who performed such repairs or alterations, in substantially the following form:

      (ii) A declaration by the owner, importer, consignee, or agent having knowledge of the pertinent facts in substantially the following form:

      (2)  The Center director may require such additional documentation as is deemed necessary to prove actual exportation of the goods from the United States for repairs or alterations, such as a foreign customs entry, a foreign customs invoice, a foreign landing certificate, bill of lading, or airway bill.

      (3)  If the Center director concerned is satisfied, because of the nature of the goods or production of other evidence, that the goods are imported under circumstances meeting the requirements of this section, he may waive submission of the declarations provided for in paragraph (c)(1) of this section.

      (4)  For goods returned after having been repaired or altered in Canada other than pursuant to a warranty, the Center director shall require a deposit of estimated duties based upon the full cost or value of the repairs or alterations. The cost or value of the repairs or alterations performed in Canada other than pursuant to a warranty, which is to be set forth in the invoice and entry papers as the basis for the assessment of duty for such goods, shall be limited to the cost or value of the repairs or alterations actually performed in Canada, which shall include all domestic and foreign articles furnished for the repairs or alterations but shall not include any of the expenses incurred in the United States whether by way of engineering costs, preparation of plans or specifications, furnishing of tools or equipment for doing the repairs or alterations in Canada, or otherwise.

    Subpart G—Origin Verifications and Determinations

      § 181.71   Denial of preferential tariff treatment dependent on origin verification and determination.

#### § § 181.71

      Except where a Certificate of Origin either is not submitted when requested under § 181.22(b) of this part or is not acceptable and a corrected Certificate is not submitted or accepted as provided in § 181.22(c) of this part and except as otherwise provided in § 181.23 of this part and except in the case of a pattern of conduct provided for in § 181.76(c) of this part, Customs shall deny preferential tariff treatment on an imported good, or shall deny a post-importation claim for a refund filed under subpart D of this part, only after initiation of an origin verification under § 181.72(a) of this part which results in a determination that the imported good does not qualify as an originating good or should not be accorded such treatment for any other reason as specifically provided for elsewhere in this part.

      § 181.72   Verification scope and method.

#### § § 181.72

      (a)  Subject to paragraph (e) of this section, Customs may initiate a verification in order to determine whether a good imported into the United States qualifies as an originating good for purposes of preferential tariff treatment under the NAFTA as stated on the Certificate of Origin pertaining to the good. Such a verification:

      (1) May also involve a verification of the origin of a material that is used in the production of a good that is the subject of a verification under this section;

      (2) May include verification of the applicable rate of duty applied to an originating good in accordance with Annex 302.2 of the NAFTA and may include a determination of whether a good is a qualifying good for purposes of Annex 703.2 of the NAFTA; and

      (3) Shall be conducted only by means of one or more of the following:

      (i) A verification letter which requests information from a Canadian or Mexican exporter or producer, including a Canadian or Mexican producer of a material, and which identifies the good or material that is the subject of the verification. The verification letter may be on Customs Form 28, or its electronic equivalent, or other appropriate format and may be sent:

      (A) By certified or registered mail, or by any other method that produces a confirmation of receipt by the exporter or producer; or

      (B) By any other method, regardless of whether it produces proof of receipt by the exporter or producer;

      (ii) A written questionnaire sent to an exporter or a producer, including a producer of a material, in Canada or Mexico. The questionnaire:

      (A) May be sent by certified or registered mail, or by any other method that produces a confirmation of receipt by the exporter or producer; or

      (B) May be sent by any other method, regardless of whether it produces proof of receipt by the exporter or producer; and

      (C) May be completed by the Canadian or Mexican exporter or producer either in the English language or in the language of the country in which that exporter or producer is located;

      (iii) Visits to the premises of an exporter or a producer, including a producer of a material, in Canada or Mexico to review the types of records referred to in § 181.12 of this part and observe the facilities used in the production of the good or material; and

      (iv) Any other method which results in information from a Canadian or Mexican exporter or producer, including a Canadian or Mexican producer of a material, that is relevant to the origin determination. The information so obtained may form a basis for a negative determination regarding a good (see § 181.75(b) of this part) only if the information is in writing and is signed by the exporter or producer.

      (b)  When conducting a verification of origin to which Generally Accepted Accounting Principles may be relevant, Customs will apply and accept the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles applicable in the country in which the good is produced or in which the exporter is located.

      (c)  Nothing in paragraph (a) of this section shall preclude Customs from directing inquiries or requests to a U.S. importer for documents or other information regarding the imported good. If such an inquiry or request involves requesting the importer to obtain and provide written information from the exporter or producer of the good or from the producer of a material that is used in the production of the good, such information shall be requested by the importer and provided to the importer by the exporter or producer only on a voluntary basis, and a failure or refusal on the part of the importer to obtain and provide such information shall not be considered a failure of the exporter or producer to provide the information and shall not constitute a ground for denying preferential tariff treatment on the good.

      (d) —(1)  If the exporter or producer, including a producer of a material, fails to respond to a verification letter or questionnaire sent under paragraph (a)(2)(i) or (a)(2)(ii) of this section within 30 calendar days from the date on which the letter or questionnaire was sent, or such longer period as may be specified in the letter or questionnaire, Customs shall send a follow-up verification letter or questionnaire to that exporter or producer. The follow-up letter or questionnaire:

      (i) Except where the verification letter or questionnaire only involved the origin of a material used in the production of a good and was sent to the producer of the material, may include the written determination referred to in § 181.75 of this part, provided that the information specified in paragraph (b) of that section is also included; and

      (ii) Shall be sent:

      (A) By certified or registered mail, or by any other method that produces a confirmation of receipt by the exporter or producer, if so requested by the customs administration of Canada or Mexico from which the good was exported; or

      (B) By any method, if no request under paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(A) of this section has been made by the Canadian or Mexican customs administration.

      (2) —(i)  If a producer of a material fails to respond to a follow-up verification letter or questionnaire sent under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, Customs may consider the material to be non-originating for purposes of determining whether the good to which that material relates is an originating good.

      (ii)  If the exporter or producer of a good fails to respond to a follow-up verification letter or questionnaire sent under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, Customs may consider the good to be non-originating and consequently may deny preferential tariff treatment on the good as follows:

      (A) If the follow-up letter or questionnaire included a written determination as provided for in paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section and the exporter or producer fails to respond to the follow-up letter or questionnaire within 30 calendar days or such longer period as specified therein:

      () From the date on which the follow-up letter or questionnaire and written determination were received by the exporter or producer, if sent pursuant to paragraph (d)(_1_)(ii)(A) of this section; or

      () From the date on which the follow-up letter or questionnaire and written determination were either received by the exporter or producer or sent by Customs, if sent in accordance with paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(B) of this section; or

      (B) Provided that the procedures set forth in §§ 181.75 and 181.76 of this part are followed, if the follow-up letter or questionnaire does not include a written determination as provided for in paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section and the exporter or producer fails to respond to the follow-up letter or questionnaire within 30 calendar days or such longer period as specified in the letter or questionnaire:

      () From the date on which the follow-up letter or questionnaire was received by the exporter or producer, if sent pursuant to paragraph (d)(_1_)(ii)(A) of this section; or

      () From the date on which the follow-up letter or questionnaire was either received by the exporter or producer or sent by Customs, if sent in accordance with paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(B) of this section.

      (e) —(1)  Where a Canadian or Mexican producer of a good elects to calculate the regional value content of a good under the net cost method as set forth in General Note 12, HTSUS, and in the appendix to this part, Customs may not, during the time period over which that net cost is calculated, conduct a verification under § 181.72(a) of this part with respect to the regional value content of that good.

      (2)  Where, pursuant to General Note 12, HTSUS, and the appendix to this part, a Canadian or Mexican producer of a light duty vehicle or heavy duty vehicle, as defined in the appendix to this part, elects to average its regional value content calculation over its fiscal year, Customs may request, in writing, that the producer provide a cost submission reflecting the actual costs incurred in the production of the category of motor vehicles for which the election was made. Such a written request shall constitute a verification letter under paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section, and the requested cost submission shall be submitted to Customs within 180 calendar days after the close of the producer's fiscal year or within 60 days from the date on which the request was made, whichever is later.

      § 181.73   Notification of verification visit.

#### § § 181.73

      (a)  Prior to conducting a verification visit in Canada or Mexico pursuant to § 181.72(a)(2)(iii) of this part, Customs shall give written notification of the intention to conduct the visit. Such notification shall be delivered:

      (1) By certified or registered mail, or by any other method that produces a confirmation of receipt, to the address of the Canadian or Mexican exporter or producer whose premises are to be visited;

      (2) To the customs administration of the country in which the visit is to occur; and

      (3) If requested by the country in which the visit is to occur, to the embassy of that country located in the United States.

      (b)  The notification referred to in paragraph (a) of this section shall include:

      (1) The identity of the Customs office and officer issuing the notification;

      (2) The name of the Canadian or Mexican exporter or producer of the good, or producer of the material, whose premises are to be visited;

      (3) The date and place of the proposed verification visit;

      (4) The object and scope of the proposed verification visit, including specific reference to the good or material that is the subject of the verification;

      (5) The names and titles of the Customs officers performing the proposed verification visit;

      (6) The legal authority for the proposed verification visit; and

      (7) A request that the Canadian or Mexican exporter or producer of the good, or producer of the material, provide its written consent for the proposed verification visit.

      § 181.74   Verification visit procedures.

#### § § 181.74

      (a)  Prior to conducting a verification visit in Canada or Mexico pursuant to § 181.72(a)(3)(iii) of this part, CBP shall obtain the written consent of the Canadian or Mexican exporter or producer of the good or producer of the material whose premises are to be visited.

      (b)  The written consent provided for in paragraph (a) of this section shall be delivered by certified or registered mail, or by any other method that generates a reliable receipt, to the CBP officer who gave the notification provided for in § 181.73 of this part.

      (c)  Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (d) of this section, where a Canadian or Mexican exporter or producer of a good, or a Canadian or Mexican producer of a material, has not given its written consent to a proposed verification visit within 30 calendar days of receipt of notification pursuant to § 181.73 of this part, CBP may deny preferential tariff treatment to that good, or for purposes of determining whether a good is an originating good may consider as non-originating that material, that would have been the subject of the visit, provided that, as regards the good, notice of intent to deny such treatment is given to that exporter or producer of the good and to the U.S. importer thereof prior to taking such action. A failure on the part of the Canadian or Mexican exporter or producer of a good, or on the part of the Canadian or Mexican producer of a material, to maintain records or provide access to such records or otherwise cooperate during the verification visit shall mean that the verification visit never took place and may be treated by CBP in the same manner as a failure to give written consent to a verification visit. However, in the case of a Canadian or Mexican producer of a good who is found during a verification visit to have not maintained records in accordance with the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles applied in the producer's country, CBP may deny preferential tariff treatment on the good based solely on a failure to so maintain those records only if the producer does not conform the records to those Principles within 60 calendar days after CBP informs the producer in writing of that failure.

      (d)  Following receipt of the notification provided for in § 181.73 of this part, the Canadian or Mexican customs administration may, within 15 calendar days of receipt of the notification, postpone the proposed verification visit for a period not exceeding 60 calendar days from the date of such receipt by providing written notice of the postponement to the CBP officer who issued the notification of the verification visit, unless a longer period is requested and agreed to by CBP. Such a postponement shall not constitute a failure to provide written consent within the meaning of paragraph (c) of this section and shall not otherwise by itself constitute a valid basis upon which CBP may:

      (1) Consider a material that is used in the production of a good to be a non-originating material; or

      (2) Deny preferential tariff treatment to a good.

      (e) —(1)  When the Canadian or Mexican customs administration intends to conduct a verification visit in the United States, notification of such intent will be given, and consent will be required, as provided for under Article 506 of the NAFTA. For purposes of the required notification to CBP, such notification shall be sent to U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Office of International Trade, Commercial Targeting and Enforcement, 1300 Pennsylvania Ave., NW., Washington, DC 20229.

      (2)  Following receipt of notification from the Canadian or Mexican customs administration of its intention to conduct a verification visit in the United States, CBP may, within 15 calendar days of receipt of the notification, postpone the proposed verification visit for a period not exceeding 60 calendar days from the date of such receipt by providing written notice of the postponement to the Canadian or Mexican customs administration.

      (3)  A U.S. exporter or producer, including a producer of a material, whose good or material is the subject of a verification visit by the Canadian or Mexican customs administration shall be allowed to designate two observers to be present during the visit, subject to the following conditions:

      (i) The U.S. exporter or producer shall not be required to designate observers;

      (ii) There shall be no restriction on the class of persons that may be designated as observers by the U.S. exporter or producer;

      (iii) The observers to be present are designated in the written consent to the proposed visit or subsequent thereto;

      (iv) The observers do not participate in the verification visit in a manner other than as passive observers;

      (v) The presence of observers shall in no way affect the right to have legal counsel or other advisors present during the visit;

      (vi) There shall be no obligation on the part of the United States government or on the part of the Canadian or Mexican government to designate observers from its staff, even when the U.S. exporter or producer fails to, or specifically declines to, designate observers; and

      (vii) The failure of the U.S. exporter or producer to designate observers shall not result in the postponement of the visit.

      § 181.75   Issuance of origin determination.

#### § § 181.75

      (a)  Except in the case of a pattern of conduct within the meaning of § 181.76(c) of this part, following receipt and analysis of the results of an origin verification initiated under § 181.72(a) of this part in regard to a good imported into the United States and prior to denying preferential tariff treatment on the import transaction which gave rise to the origin verification, Customs shall provide the exporter or producer whose good is the subject of the verification with a written determination of whether the good qualifies as an originating good. Subject to paragraph (b) of this section, the written origin determination shall be sent within 60 calendar days after conclusion of the origin verification process, unless circumstances require additional time, and shall set forth:

      (1) A description of the good that was the subject of the verification together with the identifying numbers and dates of the export and import documents pertaining to the good;

      (2) Subject to the provisions of § 181.131 of this part and except in the case of a negative origin determination where specific findings of fact cannot be made because of a failure to respond to a follow-up verification letter or questionnaire sent under § 181.72 of this part, a statement setting forth the findings of fact made in connection with the verification and upon which the determination is based; and

      (3) With specific reference to the rules applicable to originating goods as set forth in General Note 12, HTSUS, and in the appendix to this part, the legal basis for the determination.

      (b)  If Customs determines, as a result of an origin verification initiated under § 181.72(a) of this part, that the good which is the subject of the verification does not qualify as an originating good, the written determination required under paragraph (a) of this section:

      (1) Shall be sent by certified or registered mail, or by any other method that produces a confirmation of receipt by the exporter or producer, if so requested by the customs administration of Canada or Mexico from which the good was exported; and

      (2) Shall, in addition to the information specified in paragraph (a) of this section, set forth the following:

      (i) A notice of intent to deny preferential tariff treatment on the good which is the subject of the determination;

      (ii) The specific date after which preferential tariff treatment will be denied, as established in accordance with § 181.76(a)(1) of this part;

      (iii) The period, established in accordance with § 181.76(a)(1) of this part, during which the exporter or producer of the good may provide written comments or additional information regarding the determination; and

      (iv) A statement advising the exporter or producer of the right to file a protest under 19 U.S.C. 1514 and part 174 of this chapter:

      (A) Within 90 days after notice of liquidation is provided pursuant to part 159 of this chapter; or

      (B) In cases where the negative origin determination does not result in a liquidation, within 90 days after the date of issuance of the written determination.

      § 181.76   Application of origin determinations.

#### § § 181.76

      (a)  Except as otherwise provided in this section, an origin determination may be applied upon issuance of the determination under § 181.75 of this part.

      (b)  In the case of a negative origin determination issued under § 181.75(b) of this part:

      (1) The date on which preferential tariff treatment may be denied shall be no earlier than 30 calendar days from the date on which:

      (i) Receipt of the written determination by the exporter or producer is confirmed, if a request under § 181.75(b)(1) of this part has been made; or

      (ii) The written determination is sent by Customs, if no request under § 181.75(b)(1) of this part has been made; and

      (2) Before denying preferential tariff treatment, Customs shall take into account any comments or additional information provided by the exporter or producer during the period established in accordance with paragraph (b)(1) of this section.

      (c)  Where multiple origin verifications initiated under § 181.72(a) of this part indicate a pattern of conduct by an exporter or producer involving false or unsupported representations on Certificates of Origin that a good imported into the United States qualifies as an originating good, Customs may deny subsequent claims for preferential tariff treatment on identical goods exported or produced by such person until that person establishes compliance with the rules applicable to originating goods as set forth in General Note 12, HTSUS, and in this part, provided that advance written notice of the intent to deny such claims is given to the importer. For purposes of this paragraph, a “pattern of conduct” means repeated instances of false or unsupported representations by an exporter or producer as established by Customs on the basis of not fewer than two origin verifications of two or more importations of the good that result in the issuance of not fewer than two written determinations issued to that exporter or producer pursuant to § 181.75 of this part which conclude, as a finding of fact, that Certificates of Origin completed and signed by that exporter or producer with respect to identical goods contain false or unsupported representations.

      (d)  Where Customs determines, either as a result of an origin verification initiated under § 181.72(a) of this part or under any other circumstance, that a certain good imported into the United States does not qualify as an originating good based on a tariff classification or a value applied in the United States to one or more materials used in the production of the good, including a material used in the production of another material that is used in the production of the good, which differs from the tariff classification or value applied to the materials by the country from which the good was exported, the Customs determination shall not become effective until Customs provides written notification thereof both to the U.S. importer of the good and to the person who completed and signed the Certificate of Origin upon which the claim for preferential tariff treatment for the good was based.

      (e)  Customs shall not apply a determination made under paragraph (d) of this section to an importation made before the effective date of the determination if, prior to notification of the determination, the customs administration of the country from which the good was exported either issued an advance ruling under Article 509 of the NAFTA or any other ruling on the tariff classification or on the value of such materials, or gave consistent treatment to the entry of the materials under the tariff classification or value at issue, on which a person is entitled to rely and on which that person did in fact rely. For purposes of this paragraph, the person who received notification of the determination shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of Customs, in writing within 30 calendar days of receipt of the notification, that the conditions set forth herein have been met. For purposes of this paragraph:

      (1) A “ruling” on which a person is entitled to rely in the case of Canada must be issued pursuant to section 43.1(1) of the Customs Act (Advance Rulings) or in accordance with Departmental Memorandum 11-11-1 (National Customs Rulings) and in the case of Mexico must be issued pursuant to Article 34 of the Codigo Fiscal de la Federacion and pursuant to Article 30 of the Ley Aduanera or the applicable provision of Mexican law related to advance rulings under Article 509 of the NAFTA; and

      (2) “Consistent treatment” means the established application by the Canadian or Mexican customs administration that can be substantiated by the continued acceptance by the customs administration of the tariff classification or value of identical materials on importations of the materials into Canada or Mexico by the same importer over a period of not less than two years immediately prior to the date of signature of the Certificate of Origin for the good that is the subject of the determination referred to in paragraph (d) of this section, provided that with regard to those importations:

      (i) The tariff classification or value of the materials was not the subject of a verification, review or appeal by that customs administration on the date of the determination under paragraph (d) of this section; and

      (ii) The materials had not been accorded a different tariff classification or value by one or more district, regional or local offices of that customs administration on the date of the determination under paragraph (d) of this section.

      (f)  If Customs proposes to deny preferential tariff treatment to a good pursuant to a determination made under paragraph (d) of this section, Customs shall postpone the application of the determination for a period not exceeding 90 calendar days from the date of issuance of the determination where the U.S. importer of the good, or the person who completed and signed the Certificate of Origin upon which the claim for preferential tariff treatment for the good was based, demonstrates to the satisfaction of Customs that it has relied in good faith to its detriment on the tariff classification or value applied to such materials by the customs administration of the country from which the good was exported.

    Subpart H—Penalties

      § 181.81   Applicability to NAFTA transactions.

#### § § 181.81

      Except as otherwise provided in § 181.82 of this part, all criminal, civil or administrative penalties which may be imposed on U.S. importers, exporters and producers for violations of the Customs and related laws and regulations shall also apply to U.S. importers, exporters and producers for violations of the laws and regulations relating to the NAFTA.

      § 181.82   Exceptions to application of penalties.

#### § § 181.82

      (a)  A U.S. importer who makes a corrected declaration under § 181.21(b) of this part shall not be subject to civil or administrative penalties for having made an incorrect declaration, provided that the corrected declaration was voluntarily made. In addition, civil or administrative penalties provided for under the U.S. Customs laws and regulations shall not be imposed on an exporter or producer in the United States who voluntarily provides written notification pursuant to § 181.11(d) of this part with respect to the making of an incorrect certification.

      (b) —(1)  For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, the making of a corrected declaration or the providing of written notification of an incorrect certification will be deemed to have been done voluntarily if:

      (i) Done before the commencement of a formal investigation;

      (ii) Done before any of the events specified in § 162.74(i) of this chapter have occurred;

      (iii) Done within 30 calendar days after either the U.S. importer with respect to a declaration that an imported good qualified as an originating good, or the U.S. exporter or producer with respect to a certification pertaining to a good exported to Canada or Mexico, had reason to believe that the declaration or certification was not correct;

      (iv) Accompanied by a written statement setting forth the information specified in paragraph (b)(3) of this section; and

      (v) In the case of a corrected declaration, accompanied or followed by a tender of any actual loss of duties in accordance with paragraph (b)(5) of this section.

      (2)  Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(1) of this section, a person who acted by means of fraud in making an incorrect declaration or certification may not make a voluntary correction thereof. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(2), the term “fraud” shall have the meaning set forth in paragraph (B)(3) of appendix B to part 171 of this chapter.

      (3)  For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, each corrected declaration or notification of an incorrect certification shall be accompanied by a written statement which:

      (i) Identifies the class or kind of good to which the incorrect declaration or certification relates;

      (ii) Identifies each import or export transaction affected by the incorrect declaration or certification with reference to each port of importation or exportation and the approximate date of each importation or exportation. A U.S. producer who provides written notification that certain information in a Certificate of Origin is incorrect and who is unable to identify the specific export transactions under this paragraph shall provide as much information concerning those transactions as the producer, by the exercise of good faith and due diligence, is able to obtain;

      (iii) Specifies the nature of the incorrect statements or omissions regarding the declaration or certification; and

      (iv) Sets forth, to the best of the person's knowledge, the true and accurate information or data which should have been covered by or provided in the declaration or certification, and states that the person will provide any additional information or data which is unknown at the time of making the corrected declaration or certification within 30 calendar days or within any extension of that 30-day period as Customs may permit in order for the person to obtain the information or data.

      (4)  For purposes of this section, a person shall be deemed to have voluntarily corrected a declaration or certification even though that person provides corrected information in a manner which does not conform to the requirements of the written statement specified in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, provided that:

      (i) Customs is satisfied that the information was provided before the commencement of a formal investigation; and

      (ii) The information provided includes, orally or in writing, substantially the same information as that specified in paragraph (b)(3) of this section.

      (5)  A U.S. importer who makes a corrected declaration shall tender any actual loss of duties at the time of making the corrected declaration, or within 30 calendar days thereafter, or within any extension of that 30-day period as Customs may allow in order for the importer to obtain the information or data necessary to calculate the duties owed.

      (6)  Where a person fails to meet the requirements of this section because the correction of the declaration or the written notification of an incorrect certification is not considered to be done voluntarily as provided in this section, that person may nevertheless qualify for prior disclosure treatment under 19 U.S.C. 1592(c)(4) and the regulations issued thereunder.

> [T.D. 95-68, 60 FR 46364, Sept. 6, 1995, as amended by T.D. 99-64, 64 FR 43267, Aug. 10, 1999]

    Subpart I—Advance Ruling Procedures

      § 181.91   Applicability.

#### § § 181.91

      This subpart sets forth the rules which govern the issuance and application of advance rulings under Article 509 of the NAFTA and the procedures which apply for purposes of review of advance rulings under Article 510 of the NAFTA. Importers in the United States and exporters and producers located in Canada or Mexico may request and obtain an advance ruling on a NAFTA transaction only in accordance with the provisions of this subpart whenever the requested ruling involves a subject matter specified in § 181.92(b)(6) of this part. Accordingly, the provisions of this subpart shall apply in lieu of the administrative ruling provisions contained in subpart A of part 177 of this chapter except where the request for a ruling involves a subject matter not specified in § 181.92(b)(6).

      § 181.92   Definitions and general NAFTA advance ruling practice.

#### § § 181.92

      (a)  For purposes of this subpart:

      (1) An  is a written statement issued by the Headquarters Office or the National Commodity Specialist Division or by such other office as designated by the Commissioner of Customs that interprets and applies the provisions of NAFTA to a specific set of facts involving any subject matter specified in § 181.92(b)(6) of this part. An “_advance ruling_ letter” is an advance ruling issued in response to a written request and set forth in a letter addressed to the person making the request or his designee. A “published advance ruling” is an advance ruling which has been published in full text in the Customs Bulletin.

      (2) An  is a person expressly authorized by a principal to act on his or her behalf. An advance ruling requested by an attorney or other person acting as an agent must include a statement describing the authority under which the request is made. With the exception of attorneys whose authority to represent is known, any person appearing before Customs as an agent in connection with an advance ruling request may be required to present evidence of his or her authority to represent the principal. The foregoing requirements will not apply to an individual representing his or her full-time employer or to a bona-fide officer, director or other qualified representative of a corporation, association, or organized group.

      (3) The term  means the Regulations and Rulings, Office of International Trade at Headquarters, U. S. Customs and Border Protection, Washington, DC.

      (4) An  is a written statement issued by the Headquarters Office or the National Commodity Specialist Division or by such other office as designated by the Commissioner of Customs that does no more than call attention to a well-established interpretation of principles under the NAFTA, without applying it to a specific set of facts. If Customs believes that general information may be of some benefit to the person making the request, an _information letter_ may be issued in response to a request for an advance ruling when:

      (i) The request suggests that general information, rather than an advance ruling, is actually being sought;

      (ii) The request is incomplete or otherwise fails to meet the requirements set forth in this subpart; or

      (iii) The requested advance ruling cannot be issued for any other reason.

      (5) A  is an act or activity to which the NAFTA provisions apply. A “prospective” _NAFTA transaction_ is one that is merely contemplated or is currently being undertaken but has not resulted in any arrival or in the filing of any entry or entry summary or other document or in any other act so as to bring the transaction, or any part of it, under the jurisdiction of any Customs office. A “current” NAFTA transaction is one which is presently under consideration by a field office of Customs. A “completed” NAFTA transaction is one which has been acted upon by a Customs field office and with respect to which that office has issued a determination which is final in nature, but is (or was) subject to appeal, petition, protest or other review as provided in the applicable Customs laws and regulations. An “ongoing” NAFTA transaction is a series of identical, recurring transactions, consisting of current and completed transactions where future transactions are contemplated.

      (6) The term  means the _National Commodity Specialist Division_, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, New York, New York.

      (b)  An advance ruling may be requested under the provisions of this subpart with respect to prospective NAFTA transactions. An advance ruling will be based on the facts and circumstances presented by the requester.

      (1)  It is in the interest of the sound administration of the NAFTA that persons engaging in any transaction affected by NAFTA fully understand the consequences of that transaction prior to its consummation. For this reason, Customs will give full and careful consideration to written requests from importers in the United States and exporters or producers in Canada or Mexico for advance rulings or information setting forth, with respect to a specifically described transaction, a definitive interpretation of applicable law or other appropriate information.

      (2)  A question arising in connection with a NAFTA transaction already before a Customs field office by reason of arrival, entry or otherwise will be resolved by that office in accordance with the principles and precedents previously announced by the Headquarters Office. If such a question cannot be resolved on the basis of clearly established rules set forth in the NAFTA or the regulations thereunder, or in applicable Treasury Decisions, rulings, opinions, or court decisions published in the Customs Bulletin, that field office may, if it believes it appropriate, forward the question to the Headquarters Office for consideration.

      (3)  A question arising in connection with an entry of merchandise which has been liquidated, or in connection with any other completed NAFTA transaction, may not be the subject of an advance ruling request under this subpart.

      (4)  Customs will not issue an advance ruling in response to an oral request. Oral opinions or advice of Customs personnel are not binding on Customs. However, oral inquiries may be made to Customs offices regarding existing advance rulings, the scope of such advance rulings, the types of transactions with respect to which Customs will issue advance rulings, the scope of the advance rulings which may be issued, or the procedures to be followed in submitting advance ruling requests, as prescribed in this subpart.

      (5)  An advance ruling may be requested by any of the following persons (individuals, corporations, partnerships, associations, or other entities or groups) having a direct and demonstrable interest in the question or questions presented in the advance ruling request, or by the authorized agent of any such person:

      (i) An importer in the United States;

      (ii) An exporter or a producer of a good in Canada or Mexico; or

      (iii) A Canadian or Mexican producer of a material that is used in the production of a good imported into the United States, but only with regard to that material and only in regard to a matter described in paragraphs (b)(6)(i) through (v) and (vii) of this section.

      (6)  Customs shall issue advance rulings under this subpart concerning the following:

      (i) Whether materials imported from a country other than the United States, Canada or Mexico and used in the production of a good undergo an applicable change in tariff classification set forth in General Note 12, HTSUS, as a result of production occurring entirely in the United States, Canada and/or Mexico;

      (ii) Whether a good satisfies a regional value-content requirement under the transaction value method or under the net cost method as provided for in General Note 12, HTSUS, and in this part;

      (iii) For purposes of determining whether a good satisfies a regional value-content requirement under General Note 12, HTSUS, and under this part, the appropriate basis or method for value to be applied by an exporter or a producer in Canada or Mexico, in accordance with the principles set forth in the appendix to this part, for calculating the transaction value of the good or of the materials used in the production of the good;

      (iv) For purposes of determining whether a good satisfies a regional value-content requirement under General Note 12, HTSUS, and under this part, the appropriate basis or method for reasonably allocating costs, in accordance with the allocation methods set forth in the appendix to this part, for calculating the net cost of the good or the value of an intermediate material;

      (v) Whether a good qualifies as an originating good under General Note 12, HTSUS, and under the appendix to this part;

      (vi) Whether a good that re-enters the United States after having been exported from the United States to Canada or Mexico for repair or alteration qualifies for duty-free treatment in accordance with § 181.64 of this part;

      (vii) Whether the proposed or actual marking of a good satisfies country of origin marking requirements under part 134 of this chapter and under the Marking Rules set forth in part 102 of this chapter;

      (viii) Whether an originating good qualifies as a good of Canada or Mexico under Annex 300-B, Annex 302.2 and Chapter Seven of the NAFTA; and

      (ix) Whether a good is a qualifying good under Chapter Seven of the NAFTA.

      § 181.93   Submission of advance ruling requests.

#### § § 181.93

      (a)  A request for an advance ruling should be written in the English language and in the form of a letter. For any subject matter specified in § 181.92(b)(6)(i), (v), (vi), (vii), (viii), or (ix) of this part, the request may be directed either to the Commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, Attention: Regulations and Rulings, Office of International Trade, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, 1300 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW. (Mint Annex), Washington, DC 20229, or to the National Commodity Specialist Division, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, One Penn Plaza, 10th Floor, New York, NY 10119. For any subject matter specified in § 181.92(b)(6)(ii), (iii), or (iv) of this part, the request must be directed to the Commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, Attention: Regulations and Rulings, Office of International Trade, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, 1300 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW. (Mint Annex), Washington, DC 20229.

      (b) —(1)  Each request for an advance ruling must identify the specific subject matter under § 181.92(b)(6) of this part to which the request relates, must contain a complete statement of all relevant facts relating to the NAFTA transaction and must state that the information presented is accurate and complete. The following facts must be included: the names, addresses, and other identifying information of all interested parties (if known); the name of the port or place at which any good involved in the transaction will be imported or which will otherwise have jurisdiction with respect to the act or activity described in the transaction; and a description of the transaction itself, appropriate in detail to the subject matter of the requested advance ruling. Where the request for an advance ruling is submitted by or on behalf of the importer of the good involved in the transaction, the request must include the name and address of the exporter and, if known, producer of the good. Where the request for an advance ruling is submitted by or on behalf of the exporter of the good involved in the transaction, the request must include the name and address of the producer and importer of the good, if known. Where the request for an advance ruling is submitted by or on behalf of the producer of the good involved in the transaction, the request must include the name and address of the exporter and importer of the good, if known. In addition, where relevant to the issue that is the subject of the request for an advance ruling, and regardless of the specific nature of the advance ruling requested, the request must include:

      (i) A copy of any advance ruling or other ruling with respect to the tariff classification of the good that has been issued by CBP to the person submitting the request; or

      (ii) Sufficient information to enable CBP to classify the good where no advance ruling or other ruling with respect to the tariff classification of the good has been issued by CBP to the person submitting the request. Such information includes a full description of the good, including, where relevant, the composition of the good, a description of the process by which the good is manufactured, a description of the packaging in which the good is contained, the anticipated use of the good and its commercial, common or technical designation, and product literature, drawings, photographs or schematics.

      (2) —(i)  The prospective Customs transaction to which the advance ruling request relates must be described in sufficient detail to permit proper application of the relevant NAFTA provisions.

      (ii) —(A)  If the transaction involves the importation of a good or material for which a ruling is requested as to whether a change in tariff classification has occurred, the request should set forth: The principal or chief use of the good or material in the United States and the commercial, common, or technical designation of the good or material; if the good or material is composed of two or more substances, the relative quantity (by both weight and by volume) and value of each substance; any applicable special invoicing requirements set forth in part 141 of this chapter (if known); and any other information which may assist in determining the appropriate tariff classification of the good or material. The advance ruling request should also note, whenever germane, the purchase price of the good or material, and its approximate selling price in the United States. Each individual request for an advance ruling must be limited to five merchandise items, all of which must be of the same class or kind. Only NAFTA tariff change rulings will be issued under this subpart. Tariff classification rulings which do not involve the application of the NAFTA shall be issued under part 177 of this chapter.

      (B)  Where the request for the advance ruling involves the application of a rule of origin that requires an assessment of whether materials used in the production of an imported good undergo an applicable change in tariff classification, the request must list each material used in the production of the good and must:

      () Identify each material which is claimed to be an originating material and provide a complete description of each such material, including the basis for the claim as to originating status;

      () Identify each material which is a non-originating material, or for which the origin is unknown, and provide a complete description of each such material, including its tariff classification if known; and

      () Describe all processing operations employed in the production of the good, the location of each operation and the sequence in which the operations occur.

      (iii)  NAFTA advance ruling requests, if involving the issue of whether a good satisfies a regional value content requirement under the transaction value method or under the net cost method, or under both methods, as provided for in General Note 12, HTSUS, and in the appendix to this part, must specify each method under which eligibility is sought. Where the transaction value method is specified, the advance ruling request must include: information sufficient to calculate the transaction value of the good in accordance with schedule II of the appendix to this part with respect to the transaction of the producer of the good, adjusted to an F.O.B. basis; information sufficient to calculate the value of each non-originating material, or material the origin of which is unknown, that is used by the producer in the production of the good in accordance with the provisions of section 7 and, where applicable, section 6(10) of the appendix to this part; a complete description of each material that is claimed to be an originating material and that is used in the production of the good, including the basis for the claim as to originating status; information sufficient to permit an examination of the factors enumerated in schedule III or VIII of the appendix to this part where the advance ruling request involves an issue of whether, with respect to the good or material under the applicable schedule, the transaction value is acceptable; and information sufficient for any other circumstance to make any determination relevant to the application of the regional value content requirement to the good. Where the net cost method is specified, the advance ruling request must include: a list of all product, period and other costs relevant to determining the total cost of the good as defined in the appendix to this part; a list of all excluded costs to be subtracted from the total cost of the good as provided in the appendix to this part; information sufficient to calculate the value of each non-originating material, or material the origin of which is unknown, that is used in the production of the good, in accordance with section 7 of the appendix to this part; the basis for any allocation of costs in accordance with schedule VII of the appendix to this part; the period over which the net cost calculation is to be made; and any other information relevant to determining the appropriate value of any cost under this part. Where the advance ruling request concerns only the calculation of an element of a regional value content formula, and with regard to the information specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(5) of this section, the request need only contain the following: the information in paragraph (b)(1), other than the information specified in paragraph (b)(1)(i) or (b)(1)(ii); the information in paragraph (b)(5); and any information in this paragraph (b)(2)(iii) which is relevant to the issue that is the subject of the request.

      (iv)  here the advance ruling request involves an issue with respect to an intermediate material under Article 402(10) of the NAFTA (see section 7(4) of the appendix to this part), the request must contain sufficient information to determine the origin and value of the material in accordance with Article 402(11) of the NAFTA (see section 7(6) of the appendix to this part). Where the advance ruling request is submitted by a Canadian or Mexican producer of a material under § 181.92(b)(5)(iii) of this part and concerns only the origin of such material, and with regard to the information specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(5) of this section, the request need only include the following: the information in paragraph (b)(1), including any information specified in paragraph (b)(1)(i) or (b)(1)(ii) which is relevant to the issue that is the subject of the request; any information in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(B) which is relevant to the issue that is the subject of the request; a sample as provided for in paragraph (b)(3) if relevant to the issue that is the subject of the request; and the information in paragraph (b)(5).

      (3)  Each request for an advance ruling should be accompanied by photographs, drawings, or other pictorial representations of the good and, whenever possible, by a sample of the good unless a precise description of the good is not essential to the advance ruling requested. Any good consisting of materials in chemical or physical combination for which a laboratory analysis has been prepared by or for the manufacturer should include a copy of that analysis, flow charts, CAS number, and related information. A sample submitted in connection with a request for an advance ruling becomes a part of the CBP file in the matter and will be retained until the advance ruling is issued or the advance ruling request is otherwise disposed of. A sample should only be submitted with the understanding that all or a part of it may be damaged or consumed in the course of examination, testing, analysis, or other actions undertaken in connection with the advance ruling request.

      (4)  If the question or questions presented in the advance ruling request directly relate to matters set forth in any invoice, contract, agreement, or other document, a copy of the document must be submitted with the request. (Original documents should not be submitted inasmuch as any documents or exhibits furnished with the advance ruling request become a part of the CBP file in the matter and cannot be returned.) The relevant facts reflected in any documents submitted, and an explanation of their bearing on the question or questions presented, must be expressly set forth in the advance ruling request.

      (5)  Each request for an advance ruling must state:

      (A) Whether, to the knowledge of the person submitting the request, the same transaction or issue, or one identical to it, has ever been considered, or is currently being considered by any CBP office;

      (B) Whether, to the knowledge of the person submitting the request, the issue involved has ever been, or is currently, the subject of:

      () Review by the United States Court of International Trade, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, or any court of appeal therefrom, or review by a judicial or quasi-judicial body in Canada or Mexico;

      () A verification of origin performed in the United States, Canada or Mexico;

      () An administrative appeal in the United States, Canada or Mexico; or

      () A request for an advance ruling under this subpart, or a request for an advance ruling in Canada or Mexico under an appropriate authority referred to in § 181.76(e)(1) of this part;

      (C) The status or disposition of any matter on which an affirmative statement is made under paragraph (b)(5)(i)(B) of this section; and

      (D) Whether the transaction described in the advance ruling request is but one of a series of similar and related transactions.

      (ii)  If a prospective transaction which is the subject of an advance ruling request becomes a current transaction, the person who submitted the request shall so notify the office processing the request.

      (6)  If the request for an advance ruling asks that a particular determination or conclusion be reached in the advance ruling letter, a statement must be included in the request setting forth the basis for that determination or conclusion, together with a citation of all relevant supporting authority.

      (7)  Information which is claimed to constitute trade secrets or privileged or confidential commercial or financial information regarding the business transactions of private parties the disclosure of which would cause substantial harm to the competitive position of the person making the request (or of another interested party) must be identified clearly, and the reasons such information should not be disclosed, including, where applicable, the reasons the disclosure of the information would prejudice the competitive position of the person making the request (or of another interested party), must be set forth. An advance ruling will not be issued until all trade secret, privilege or confidentiality issues are resolved (see § 181.99(a)(3) of this part).

      (c)  The request for an advance ruling must be signed by a person authorized to make the request, as described in § 181.92(b)(5) of this part. An advance ruling requested by a principal or authorized agent may direct that the advance ruling letter be addressed to the other.

      (d)  CBP will normally process requests for advance rulings in the order they are received and as expeditiously as possible, as specified in § 181.99 of this part. However, a request that a particular matter be given consideration ahead of its regular order, if made in writing at the time the request is submitted, or subsequent thereto, and showing a clear need for such treatment, will be given consideration as the particular circumstances warrant and permit. Requests for special consideration made by telegram or electronic transmission will be treated in the same manner as requests made by letter, but advance rulings will not be issued by telegram or electronic transmission. A telegram or electronic transmission must be followed up with a signed original within 14 calendar days of the submission of the telegram or electronic transmission. In no event can any assurance be given that a particular request for an advance ruling will be acted upon by the time requested.

      § 181.94   Nonconforming requests for advance rulings.

#### § § 181.94

      A person submitting a request for an advance ruling that does not comply with all of the provisions of this subpart will be so notified in writing, and the requirements that have not been met will be pointed out. Such person will be given a period of 30 calendar days from the date of the notice (or such longer period as the notice may provide) to supply any additional information that is requested or otherwise conform the advance ruling request to the requirements referred to in the notice. The Customs file with respect to advance ruling requests which are not brought into compliance with the provisions of this subpart within the period of time allowed will be administratively closed and the request removed from active consideration. A request for an advance ruling that is removed from active consideration by reason of failure to comply with the provisions of this subpart may be treated as withdrawn. A failure to comply with the provisions of this subpart will result in the rejection of the advance ruling request with the notice specifying the deficiencies.

      § 181.95   Oral discussion of issues.

#### § § 181.95

      (a)  A person submitting a request for an advance ruling and desiring an opportunity to orally discuss the issue or issues involved should indicate that desire in writing at the time the advance ruling request is filed. Such a discussion will only be scheduled when, in the opinion of the Customs personnel by whom the advance ruling request is under consideration, a conference will be helpful in deciding the issue or issues involved or when a determination or conclusion contrary to that advocated in the advance ruling request is contemplated. Conferences are scheduled for the purpose of affording the parties an opportunity to freely and openly discuss the matters set forth in the advance ruling request. Accordingly, the parties will not be bound by any argument or position advocated or agreed to, expressly or by implication, during the conference unless either party subsequently agrees to be so bound in writing. The conference will not conclude with the issuance of an advance ruling letter.

      (b)  If a request for a conference is granted, the person making the request will be notified of the time and place of the conference. No more than one conference with respect to the matters set forth in an advance ruling request will be scheduled, unless, in the opinion of the Customs personnel by whom the advance ruling request is under consideration, additional conferences are necessary.

      (c)  A person whose request for a conference has been granted may be accompanied at that conference by counsel or other representatives, or may designate such persons to attend the conference in his or her place.

      (d)  It will be the responsibility of the person submitting the request for an advance ruling to provide for inclusion in the Customs file in the matter a written record setting forth any and all additional information, documents, and exhibits introduced during the conference to the extent that person considers such material relevant to the consideration of the advance ruling request. Such information, documents and exhibits shall be given consideration only if received by Customs within 30 calendar days following the conference.

      § 181.96   Change in status of transaction.

#### § § 181.96

      Each person submitting a request for an advance ruling in connection with a NAFTA transaction must immediately advise Customs in writing of any change in the status of that transaction upon becoming aware of the change. In particular, Customs must be advised when any transaction described in the advance ruling request as prospective becomes current and under the jurisdiction of a Customs field office. In addition, any person engaged in a NAFTA transaction coming under the jurisdiction of a Customs field office who has previously requested a NAFTA advance ruling with respect to that transaction must advise the field office of that fact.

      § 181.97   Withdrawal of NAFTA advance ruling requests.

#### § § 181.97

      Any request for an advance ruling may be withdrawn by the person submitting it at any time before the issuance of an advance ruling letter or any other final disposition of the request. All correspondence, documents, and exhibits submitted in connection with the request will be retained in the Customs file and will not be returned. In addition, the Headquarters Office may forward, to Customs field offices which have or may have jurisdiction over the transaction to which the advance ruling request relates, its views in regard to the transaction or the issues involved therein, as well as appropriate information derived from materials in the Customs file.

      § 181.98   Situations in which no NAFTA advance ruling may be issued.

#### § § 181.98

      (a)  No advance ruling letter will be issued in response to a request therefor which fails to comply with the provisions of this subpart. No advance ruling letter will be issued in regard to a completed transaction.

      (b)  Where a request for an advance ruling involves an issue that is under review in connection with an origin verification under subpart G of this part or that is the subject of an administrative review procedure provided for in subpart J of this part or in part 174 of this chapter, Customs may decline to issue the requested advance ruling. In addition, no NAFTA advance ruling letter will be issued with respect to any issue which is pending before the United States Court of International Trade, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, or any court of appeal therefrom. Litigation before any other court will not preclude the issuance of an advance ruling letter, provided neither Customs nor any of its officers or agents is named as a party to the action.

      § 181.99   Issuance of NAFTA advance rulings or other advice.

#### § § 181.99

      (a) —(1)  Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, Customs will, within 120 calendar days of receipt of a request, including any required information supplemental thereto, issue an advance ruling letter in the English language setting forth the position of Customs and the reasons therefor with respect to a specifically described Customs transaction whenever a request for such an advance ruling is submitted in accordance with the provisions of this subpart and it is in the sound administration of the NAFTA provisions to do so. Otherwise, a request for an advance ruling will be answered by an information letter or, in those situations in which general information is likely to be of little or no value, by a letter stating that no advance ruling can be issued. In the course of evaluating the advance ruling request Customs may solicit supplemental information from the person requesting the advance ruling. The submission of supplemental information will extend the time for response. The time for response will also be extended if it is necessary to obtain information from other government agencies or in the form of a laboratory analysis.

      (2)  Any importer engaging in a NAFTA transaction with respect to which an advance ruling letter has been issued under this subpart either must ensure that a copy of the advance ruling letter is attached to the documents filed with the appropriate Customs office in connection with that transaction or must otherwise indicate with the information filed for that transaction that an advance ruling has been received. Any person receiving an advance ruling stating Customs determination must set forth such determination in the documents or information filed in connection with any subsequent entry of that merchandise; failure to do so may result in a rejection of the entry and the imposition of such penalties as may be appropriate. An advance ruling received after the filing of such documents or information must immediately be brought to the attention of the appropriate Customs field office.

      (3)  No part of the advance ruling letter, including names, addresses, or information relating to the business transactions of private parties, shall be deemed to constitute privileged or confidential commercial or financial information or trade secrets exempt from disclosure pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, as amended (5 U.S.C. 552), and part 103 of this chapter, or shall be deemed to be subject to the confidentiality principle set forth in § 181.121 of this part, unless, as provided in § 181.93(b)(7) of this part, the information claimed to be exempt from disclosure is clearly identified and a valid basis for nondisclosure is set forth. Before the issuance of the advance ruling letter, the person submitting the advance ruling request will be notified of any decision adverse to his request for nondisclosure and will, upon written request to Customs within 10 working days of the date of notification, be permitted to withdraw the advance ruling request. If in the opinion of Customs an impasse exists on the issue of confidentiality and the person who submitted the advance ruling request does not withdraw the request, Customs will decline to issue the advance ruling. All advance ruling letters issued by Customs will be available, upon written request, for inspection and copying by any person (with any portions determined to be exempt from disclosure deleted).

      (4)  If Customs determines that an issued advance ruling was based on incorrect information, the person to whom the advance ruling was issued may be subject to appropriate penalties unless that person demonstrates that he used reasonable care and acted in good faith in presenting the facts and circumstances on which the advance ruling was based. In addition, Customs may apply such measures as the circumstances may warrant in a case where a person to whom an advance ruling was issued has failed to act in accordance with the terms and conditions of the advance ruling.

      (b)  The Headquarters Office may on its own initiative from time to time issue other external advice and guidance with respect to issues or transactions arising under the NAFTA which come to its attention. Such NAFTA advice and guidance, which represent the official position of Customs and which are likely to be of widespread interest and application, are published in the Customs Bulletin, as described in § 181.101 of this part. Nothing in this subpart shall preclude Customs from issuing advice and guidance to its field offices concerning the application of the NAFTA.

      § 181.100   Effect of NAFTA advance ruling letters; modification and revocation.

#### § § 181.100

      (a) —(1)  An advance ruling letter issued by Customs under the provisions of this subpart represents the official position of Customs with respect to the particular transaction or issue described therein and is binding on all Customs personnel in accordance with the provisions of this subpart until modified or revoked. In the absence of a change of practice or other modification or revocation which affects the principle of the advance ruling set forth in the advance ruling letter, that principle may be cited as authority in the disposition of transactions involving the same circumstances. An advance ruling letter is generally effective on the date it is issued or such later date as may be specified in the advance ruling and, commencing on its effective date, may be applied to entries for consumption and warehouse withdrawals for consumption which are unliquidated, or to other transactions with respect to which Customs has not taken final action on that date. See, however, paragraph (b) of this section (ruling letters which modify previous advance ruling letters) and § 181.101 of this part (advance ruling letters published in the Customs Bulletin).

      (2) —(i)  Each NAFTA ruling letter is issued on the assumption that all of the information furnished in connection with the ruling request and incorporated in the ruling letter, either directly, by reference, or by implication, is accurate and complete in every material respect. The application of an advance ruling letter by a Customs field office to the transaction to which it is purported to relate is subject to the verification of the facts incorporated in the advance ruling letter, a comparison of the transaction described therein to the actual transaction, and the satisfaction of any conditions on which the advance ruling was based, and if the facts are materially different or a condition has not been satisfied, the treatment specified in the advance ruling will not be applied to the actual transaction. If, in the opinion of any Customs field office by whom the transaction is under consideration or review, the advance ruling letter should be modified or revoked, the findings and recommendations of that office will be forwarded to the Headquarters Office for consideration, prior to any final disposition with respect to the transaction by that office. If the transaction described in the NAFTA advance ruling letter and the actual transaction are the same, and any and all conditions set forth in the advance ruling letter have been satisfied, the advance ruling will be applied to the transaction.

      (ii)  Each advance ruling letter concerning whether a change in tariff classification has occurred will be applied only with respect to transactions involving either articles which are identical to the sample submitted with the advance ruling request and reflect the same processing or articles which conform to the description set forth in the advance ruling letter.

      (iii)  Each advance ruling letter concerning the application of a regional value content requirement will be applied only with respect to transactions involving the same merchandise and identical facts.

      (3)  An advance ruling letter is subject to modification or revocation without notice to any person other than the person to whom the letter was addressed. Accordingly, no other person may rely on the advance ruling letter or assume that the principles of that advance ruling will be applied in connection with any transaction other than the one described in the letter. However, any person eligible to request an advance ruling under § 181.92(b)(5) of this part may request information as to whether a previously-issued advance ruling letter has been modified or revoked by writing the Commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, Attention: Regulations and Rulings, Office of International Trade, Washington, DC 20229, and either enclosing a copy of the advance ruling letter or furnishing other information sufficient to permit the advance ruling letter in question to be identified.

      (b) —(1)  Any NAFTA advance ruling letter may be modified or revoked by Customs Headquarters in any of the following circumstances or for any of the following purposes, provided that written notice of the modification or revocation is given to the person to whom the advance ruling letter was addressed:

      (i) If the ruling letter reflects or is based on an error:

      (A) Of fact;

      (B) In the tariff classification of a good or material that is the subject of the ruling;

      (C) In the application of a regional value-content requirement under General Note 12, HTSUS, and under this part;

      (D) In the application of the rules for determining whether a good qualifies as a good of Canada or Mexico under Annex 300-B, Annex 302.2 or Chapter Seven of the NAFTA;

      (E) In the application of the rules for determining whether a good is a qualifying good under Chapter Seven of the NAFTA; or

      (F) In the application of the rules for determining whether a good qualifies for duty-free treatment under § 181.64 of this part when the good re-enters the United States after having been exported to Canada or Mexico for repair or alteration;

      (ii) If the ruling letter is not in accordance with an interpretation agreed on by the United States, Canada and Mexico regarding Chapter Three or Chapter Four of the NAFTA;

      (iii) If there is a change in the material facts or circumstances on which the ruling is based;

      (iv) To conform to a modification of Chapter Three, Four, Five or Seven of the NAFTA, or of the Marking Rules, or of the regulations set forth in this part; or

      (v) To conform to a judicial decision or change in domestic law.

      (2)  The modification or revocation of a NAFTA advance ruling letter will not be applied to entries or warehouse withdrawals for consumption which were made prior to the effective date of such modification or revocation, except where the person to whom the advance ruling was issued has not acted in accordance with its terms and conditions.

      (3)  Generally, a NAFTA letter modifying or revoking an earlier advance ruling will be effective on the date it is issued. However, Customs may, upon request or on its own initiative, delay the effective date of such a modification or revocation for a period of up to 90 calendar days from the date of issuance. Such a delay may be granted at the request of the party to whom the ruling letter was issued, provided such party can demonstrate to the satisfaction of Customs that it relied on the earlier advance ruling in good faith and to its detriment. The evidence of such reliance must cover the period from the date of the letter modifying or revoking the advance ruling back to the date of that advance ruling and must list all transactions claimed to be covered by the modified or revoked advance ruling by entry number (or other Customs assigned number), the quantity and value of merchandise covered by each such transaction (where applicable), the ports of entry, and the dates of final action by Customs. Such evidence must also include contracts, purchase orders, or other materials tending to establish that future transactions were arranged based on the earlier advance ruling. The request for delay must specifically identify the prior ruling on which reliance is claimed. All persons requesting a delay will be issued a separate letter setting forth the period, if any, of the delay to be provided. In appropriate circumstances, Customs may decide to make its decision, with respect to a delay, applicable to all persons, irrespective of demonstrated reliance; in this event, a notice announcing the delay will be published in the  and individual ruling letters will not be issued.

      § 181.101   Publication of decisions.

#### § § 181.101

      Within 90 days after issuing any precedential decision relating to any NAFTA transaction, Customs shall publish the decision in the  or otherwise make it available for public inspection. Disclosure is governed by 31 CFR part 1, part 103 of this chapter, and § 181.99(a)(3) of this part.

      § 181.102   Administrative and judicial review of advance rulings.

#### § § 181.102

      (a) —(1)  Any person who received an advance ruling issued under this subpart, or an authorized agent of such person, may request administrative review, at CBP Headquarters, of that advance ruling, including any modification or revocation thereof, by letter addressed to the Executive Director, Regulations and Rulings, Office of International Trade, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Washington, DC 20229. Such request shall be filed within 30 calendar days after issuance of the advance ruling and shall set forth the following information:

      (i) The name and address of the person seeking review and the name and address of his authorized agent if the request is signed by such an agent;

      (ii) The Customs identification number or employer identification number in the case of a U.S. importer and authorized agent thereof, the employer number or importer/exporter number assigned by Revenue Canada in the case of a Canadian exporter or producer and authorized agent thereof, and the federal taxpayer registry number (RFC) in the case of a Mexican exporter or producer and authorized agent thereof;

      (iii) The number and date of the advance ruling at issue;

      (iv) The numbers and dates of any involved entries for consumption or warehouse withdrawals for consumption;

      (v) The nature of, and justification for, the objection to the advance ruling set forth distinctly and specifically with respect to each aspect of the advance ruling for which administrative review is sought; and

      (vi) Whether an oral discussion of the issues, as provided in § 181.95 of this part, is desired.

      (2)  Customs will normally issue a written decision within 120 days of receipt of the request for administrative review submitted under this section. However, Customs will, upon a reasonable showing of business necessity, issue a written decision within 60 days of receipt of the request for administrative review. For purposes of this paragraph, the date of receipt of the request for administrative review shall be the date on which all information necessary to process the request, including any information provided after submission of the request in connection with a conference, is filed with Customs.

      (b)  Any person whose claims with regard to a request for administrative review of an advance ruling have been denied in whole or in part under this section may seek judicial review by filing a civil action in the United States Court of International Trade in accordance with 28 U.S.C. 2632 within 180 days after the date of mailing of notice of the denial.

    Subpart J—Review and Appeal of Adverse Marking Decisions

      § 181.111   Applicability.

#### § § 181.111

      This subpart sets forth the circumstances and procedures under which exporters and producers of merchandise imported into the United States may obtain information about, and administrative and judicial review of, an adverse marking decision, as provided for in Article 510 of the NAFTA. This subpart does not apply to the review of advance rulings issued under Article 509 of the NAFTA (see subpart I of this part) or to the review of determinations that a good is not an originating good under General Note 12, HTSUS, and the appendix to this part (see part 174 of this chapter).

      § 181.112   Definitions.

#### § § 181.112

      For purposes of this subpart, the following words and phrases have the meanings indicated:

      (a)  means a decision made by the port director or Center director before January 19, 2017, or the Center director on or after January 19, 2017, which an exporter or producer of merchandise believes to be contrary to the provisions of Annex 311 of the NAFTA and which may be protested by the importer pursuant to § 514, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1514), and part 174 of this chapter. Notification of an adverse marking decision is given to an importer in the form of a CBP Form 4647, or its electronic equivalent, (Notice to Mark and/or Notice to Redeliver) and/or by assessing marking duties on improperly marked merchandise. Examples of adverse marking decisions include determinations by the port director or Center director before December 20, 2016, or the Center director on or after January 19, 2017: That an imported article is not a good of a NAFTA country, as determined under the Marking Rules, and that it therefore cannot be marked “Canada” or “Mexico”; that a good of a NAFTA country is not marked in a manner which is sufficiently permanent; and that a good of a NAFTA country does not qualify for an exception from marking specified in Annex 311 of the NAFTA. _Adverse marking decision_s do not include: Decisions issued in response to requests for advance rulings under subpart I of this part or for internal advice under part 177 of this chapter; decisions on protests under part 174 of this chapter; and determinations that an article does not qualify as an originating good under General Note 12, HTSUS, and the appendix to this part.

      (b) An  of merchandise is an _exporter_ located in Canada or Mexico who must maintain records in that country relating to the transaction to which the adverse marking decision relates. The records must be sufficient to enable Customs to evaluate the merits of the exporter's claim(s) regarding the adverse marking decision.

      (c) A  of merchandise is a person who grows, mines, harvests, fishes, traps, hunts, manufactures, processes or assembles such merchandise in Canada or Mexico.

> [T.D. 95-68, 60 FR 46364, Sept. 6, 1995, as amended by CBP Dec. 15-14, 80 FR 61292, Oct. 13, 2015; CBP Dec. No. 16-26, 81 FR 93026, Dec. 20, 2016]

      § 181.113   Request for basis of adverse marking decision.

#### § § 181.113

      (a)  The exporter or producer of the merchandise which is the subject of an adverse marking decision may request a statement concerning the basis for the decision by filing a typewritten request, in English, with CBP, either at the port of entry or electronically. The request should be on letterhead paper in the form of a letter and clearly designated as a “Request for Basis of Adverse Marking Decision” and shall be signed by the exporter, producer or his authorized agent. The provisions of § 174.3 of this chapter shall apply for purposes of signature by a person other than the principal.

      (b)  The Request for Basis of Adverse Marking Decision letter shall set forth the following information:

      (1) The name and address of the exporter or producer of the merchandise and the name and address of any authorized agent filing the request on behalf of such principal;

      (2) A statement that the inquirer is the exporter or producer of the merchandise that was the subject of the adverse marking decision;

      (3) In the case of a Canadian exporter or producer, the employer number assigned by Revenue Canada, Customs and Excise; in the case of a Mexican exporter or producer, the Federal taxpayer registry number (RFC); and the Customs identification number of an authorized agent filing the request on behalf of such principal;

      (4) The number and date of each entry involved in the request;

      (5) A specific description of the merchandise which is the subject of the adverse marking decision; and

      (6) A complete statement of all relevant facts relating to the adverse marking decision and the transaction to which it relates, including the date of the decision.

      § 181.114   Customs response to request.

#### § § 181.114

      (a)  The Center director will issue a written response to the requestor within 30 days of receipt of a request containing the information specified in § 181.113 of this part. If the request is incomplete, such that the transaction in question cannot be identified, the Center director will notify the requestor in writing within 30 days of receipt of the request regarding what information is needed.

      (b)  The response by the Center director shall include the following:

      (1) A statement concerning the basis for the adverse marking decision;

      (2) A copy of the relevant Customs Form 4647 (Notice to Mark and/or Notice to Redeliver), if one was issued to the importer and is available. If the basis for the adverse marking decision is indicated on the Customs Form 4647, or its electronic equivalent, no statement under paragraph (b)(1) of this section is required;

      § 181.115   Intervention in importer's protest.

#### § § 181.115

      (a)  An exporter or producer of merchandise does not have an independent right to protest an adverse marking decision. However, if an importer protests the adverse marking decision in accordance with section 514, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1514), and part 174 of this chapter, the exporter or producer of the merchandise which is the subject of the adverse marking decision may intervene in the importer's protest. Such intervention shall not affect any time limits applicable to the protest or delay action on the protest.

      (b)  In order to intervene in an importer's protest, as provided for in paragraph (a) of this section, the exporter or producer of the merchandise shall file, in triplicate, a typewritten statement of intervention, in English, with the Center director. The statement should be on letterhead paper in the form of a letter and should be clearly designated “NAFTA Exporter or Producer Intervention in Protest”. The statement shall be signed by the exporter, producer or his authorized agent. The provisions of § 174.3 of this chapter shall apply for purposes of signature by a person other than the principal.

      (c)  The NAFTA Exporter or Producer Intervention in Protest letter shall include the following:

      (1) The name and address of the exporter or producer of the merchandise and the name and address of any authorized agent filing the request on behalf of such principal;

      (2) In the case of a Canadian exporter or producer, the employer number assigned by Revenue Canada, Customs and Excise; in the case of a Mexican exporter or producer, the Federal taxpayer registry number (RFC); and the Customs identification number of an authorized agent filing the request on behalf of such principal;

      (3) The number and date of each entry involved in the adverse marking decision;

      (4) A specific description of the merchandise which is the subject of the adverse marking decision;

      (5) A complete statement of all relevant facts relating to the adverse marking decision and the transaction to which it relates, including the date of the decision;

      (6) A detailed statement of position regarding why the exporter or producer believes the adverse marking decision is contrary to the provision of Annex 311 of the NAFTA;

      (7) A statement as to whether a Request for Basis of Adverse Marking Decision was filed under § 181.113 of this part, and if so, the date of such Request and of any Customs response thereto issued under § 181.114 of this part. Copies of the Request and the Customs response shall be submitted, if available;

      (8) The number assigned to the importer's protest;

      (9) A statement that the intervenor is the exporter or producer of the merchandise that was the subject of the adverse marking decision being protested by the importer and, if the intervenor is the exporter, a statement that it maintains sufficient records to enable Customs to evaluate the merits of its claim(s) regarding the adverse marking decision; and

      (10) If the intervenor prefers that the principle of confidentiality set forth in § 181.121 of this part be applied to the information submitted under this section, a statement to that effect. If no such statement is included in the letter, the intervention and information submitted in connection therewith shall be subject to the same treatment as that provided in the case of requests by all interested parties for consolidation of protests as set forth in § 174.15(b)(1) of this chapter.

      (d)  The rights of the intervenor under this section are subordinate to the importer's protest rights. Accordingly, intervention by an exporter or producer of merchandise will not affect the procedures under part 174 of this chapter, and the importer's elections concerning accelerated disposition and application for further review of the protest will govern how the protest is handled and how the intervention is considered. If the importer withdraws or settles the protest, the exporter or producer has no right to continue the intervention action.

      (e)  If final administrative action has already been taken with respect to the importer's protest at the time the intervention is filed, the Center director shall so advise the exporter or producer and, if the importer has filed a civil action in the Court of International Trade as a result of a denial of the protest, the Center director shall advise the exporter or producer of that filing and of the exporter's or producer's right to seek to intervene in such judicial proceeding. If final administrative action has not been taken on the protest, the Center director shall forward the intervention letter to the Customs office which has the importer's protest under review for consideration in connection with the protest.

      (f)  The intervenor shall be notified in writing of the final disposition of the protest. If the protest is denied in whole or in part, the intervenor shall be furnished a copy of the notice given to the importer under § 174.29.

      § 181.116   Petition regarding adverse marking decision.

#### § § 181.116

      (a)  If the importer does not protest an adverse marking decision in accordance with section 514, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1514), and part 174 of this chapter, the exporter or producer of the merchandise which was the subject of the adverse marking decision may file a petition with Customs requesting reconsideration of the decision. The petition may not be filed until after the importer's time to protest the adverse marking decision has expired (see § 174.12(e) of this chapter for the time limits for filing protests). If the importer filed a protest upon which final administrative action has been taken, the exporter or producer may file a petition under this section, provided that the exporter or producer was not given notice of the pending protest pursuant to § 181.114 of this part. If the importer filed a protest on which final administrative action has not been taken and notice of the pending protest was not provided to the exporter or producer under § 181.114 of this part, a petition filed under this section shall be treated by the Center director as an intervention under § 181.115 of this part.

      (b)  A petition under this section shall be typewritten, in English, and shall be filed, in triplicate, with the port of entry or filed electronically with CBP. The petition under this subpart should be on letterhead paper in the form of a letter, clearly designated as a “Petition for NAFTA Review of Adverse Marking Decision” and shall be signed by the exporter, producer or his authorized agent. The provisions of § 174.3 of this chapter shall apply for purposes of signature by a person other than the principal.

      (c)  The Petition for NAFTA Review of Adverse Marking Decision letter shall contain all the information specified § 181.115 of this part, except for the protest number. It shall also include a statement that petitioner was not notified by Customs in writing of a pending protest.

      (d) —(1)  Within 60 days of the date of receipt of the petition, the Center director shall determine if the petition is to be granted or denied, in whole or in part. If, after reviewing the petition, the Center director agrees with all of the petitioner's claims and determines that the initial adverse marking decision was not correct, a written notice granting the petition shall be issued to the petitioner. A description of the merchandise, a brief summary of the issue(s) and the Center director's findings shall be forwarded to the Director, Tariff Classification Appeals Division, Customs Headquarters, for publication in the Customs Bulletin. If, after reviewing the petition, the Center director determines that the initial adverse marking decision was correct in its entirety, a written notice shall be issued to the petitioner advising that the matter has been forwarded to the Director, Tariff Classification Appeals Division, Customs Headquarters, for further review and decision. All relevant background information, including available samples, a description of the adverse marking decision and the reasons for the decision, and the Center director's recommendation shall be furnished to Headquarters.

      (2)  Within 120 days of the date the petition and background information are received at Customs Headquarters, the Director, Tariff Classification Appeals Division, shall determine if the petition is to be granted or denied, in whole or in part, and the petitioner shall be notified in writing of the determination. If the petition is granted in whole or in part, a description of the merchandise, a brief summary of the issue(s) and the director's findings will be published in the Customs Bulletin.

      (3)  The decision on the petition, if contrary to the initial adverse marking decision, will be implemented with respect to merchandise entered or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption after 30 days from the date on which the notice of determination is published in the Customs Bulletin.

      (e)  No decision on a petition will be issued under this section with respect to any issue which is pending before the United States Court of International Trade, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, or any court of appeal therefrom. Litigation before any other court will not preclude the issuance of a decision on a petition under this section, provided neither Customs nor any of its officers or agents is named as a party to the action.

      (f)  Any person whose petition under this section has been denied, in whole or in part, may contest the denial by filing a civil action in the United States Court of International Trade within 30 days after the date of mailing of the notice of denial.

#### § § 182.33

      (a)  After receipt of a post-importation claim made pursuant to § 182.32, CBP will determine whether the entry covering the good has been liquidated and, if liquidation has taken place, whether the liquidation has become final.

If a summons involving the tariff classification or dutiability of the good is filed in the Court of International Trade, CBP will suspend action on the claim filed under § 182.32 until judicial review has been completed.

      (c) —(1)  If CBP determines that a claim for a refund filed under § 182.32 should be allowed and the entry covering the good has not been liquidated, CBP will take into account the claim for refund in connection with the liquidation of the entry.

      (d) —(1)  CBP may deny a claim for a refund filed under § 182.32 if the claim was not filed timely, if the importer has not complied with the requirements of § 182.32 or the other applicable requirements in this part, or if, following an origin verification, CBP determines either that the imported good was not an originating good at the time of importation or that a basis exists upon which preferential tariff treatment may be denied.

      (2)  If CBP determines that a claim for a refund filed under § 182.32 should be denied and the entry covering the good has not been liquidated, CBP will deny the claim in connection with the liquidation of the entry, and notice of the denial and the reason for the denial will be provided to the importer in writing or via a CBP-authorized electronic data interchange system.

      (3)  If CBP determines that a claim for a refund filed under § 182.32 should be denied and the entry covering the good has been liquidated, whether or not the liquidation has become final, the claim may be denied without reliquidation of the entry. If the entry is otherwise to be reliquidated based on administrative review of a protest, petition, or request for reliquidation or as a result of judicial review, such reliquidation may include denial of the claim filed under this subpart. In either case, CBP will provide notice of the denial and the reason for the denial to the importer in writing or via a CBP-authorized electronic data interchange system.

#### § § 182.50

      (a)  When the drawback claim has been fully completed by the filing of all required documents, and exportation of the articles has been established and the amount of duties paid to Canada or Mexico has been established, the entry will be liquidated to determine the proper amount of drawback due either in accordance with the limitation on drawback set forth in § 182.44 of this subpart or in accordance with the regular drawback calculation. The liquidation procedures of subpart H of part 190 of this chapter, as appropriate, will control for purposes of this subpart.

      (b) [Reserved]

      (c)  Accelerated drawback payment procedures will apply as set forth in § 190.92 of this chapter, as appropriate.

      § 182.72   Verification of claim for preferential tariff treatment.

#### § § 182.72

      (a)  A claim for preferential tariff treatment made under § 182.11(b) or 182.32, including any statements or other information submitted to CBP in support of the claim, will be subject to such verification as CBP deems necessary. CBP may initiate the verification of goods imported into the United States under the USMCA with the importer, or with the exporter or producer who completed the certification of origin. A verification of a claim for preferential tariff treatment under the USMCA may be conducted by means of one or more of the following:

      (1) Requests for information or questionnaires, including a request for documents, to the importer, exporter, or producer;

      (2) Verification visits to the premises of the exporter or producer in Mexico or Canada in order to request information, including documents, and to observe production processes and facilities; and

      (3) Any other procedure to which the USMCA countries may agree.

      (b)  When conducting a verification of a good imported into the United States, CBP may conduct a verification of the material that is used in the production of that good. A verification of a material producer may be conducted pursuant to any of the verification means set forth in paragraph (a) of this section. With the exception of §§ 182.73(c) and 182.75, the provisions in this subpart also apply to the verification of a material and references to the term “producer” apply to a producer of a good or to a material producer.

      (c)  During a verification, CBP will accept information, including documents, directly from an importer, exporter, or producer.

      (d)  When conducting a verification to which Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or an otherwise accepted inventory method may be relevant, CBP will apply and accept the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles applicable in the USMCA country in which the production is performed or from which the good is exported, as appropriate, or an otherwise accepted inventory management method as provided for in Appendix A of this part. If information, including documents, books and records, were not maintained accordingly, CBP will provide the importer, exporter or producer 30 days to record costs in accordance with Appendix A of this part.

      § 182.73   Notification and response procedures.

#### § § 182.73

      (a)  When conducting a verification through a request for information or a questionnaire as provided for in § 182.72(a)(1), CBP will send the importer, exporter or producer a written request for information, a written questionnaire, or its electronic equivalent, including a request for specific documentation to support the claim for preferential tariff treatment.

      (1)  The written request for information, written questionnaire, or its electronic equivalent will contain the following:

      (i) The objective and scope of the verification, including the specific issue that the verification is seeking to resolve; and

      (ii) Sufficient information to identify the good or material that is the subject of the verification.

      (2) —(i)  The importer, exporter, or producer must make the records, which are required to be maintained to demonstrate that the good qualifies for preferential tariff treatment under the USMCA, available for inspection by a CBP official conducting a verification. CBP may deny the claim for preferential tariff treatment of the good for failure to maintain the required records or if a CBP official is denied access to the records.

      (ii)  During the verification of a material, any records in the material producer's possession demonstrating that the material qualifies as originating must be made available for inspection by a CBP official conducting a verification. CBP may consider the material that is used in the production of the good and is the subject of the verification to be non-originating material if a CBP official is denied access to these records.

      (b)  Prior to conducting a verification visit in Canada or Mexico, CBP will provide the exporter or producer, using one of the communication means specified in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, with a notification stating the intent to conduct a verification visit and containing the following:

      (1) The objective and scope of the verification, including the specific issue that the verification is seeking to resolve;

      (2) Sufficient information to identify the good or material that is the subject of the verification;

      (3) A request for the written consent of the exporter or producer whose premises are going to be visited;

      (4) The legal authority for the visit;

      (5) The proposed date and location of the visit;

      (6) The specific purpose of the visit; and

      (7) The names and titles of the U.S. officials conducting the visit.

      (c)  When CBP initiates a verification by sending a request for information or questionnaire under paragraph (a) of this section to an exporter or producer or by sending a notification of a verification visit under paragraph (b) of this section, CBP will notify the importer claiming preferential tariff treatment of the good that CBP has initiated a verification of that good, subject to the confidentiality provisions in § 182.2.

      (d)  (1) For purposes of a verification, it is sufficient for CBP to use the contact information provided in the certification of origin for any communication sent to the importer, exporter, or producer.

      (2) For purposes of a verification, CBP will send all communication to the exporter or producer by any means that can produce a confirmation of receipt including:

      (i) Electronic mail;

      (ii) International courier services;

      (iii) Certified or registered mail services; or

      (iv) A CBP-authorized electronic data interchange system.

      (e)  Any time periods specified in this subpart begin from the date of confirmation of receipt, provided for in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, when sending communication to the exporter or producer, and begin from the date the communication is sent when sending communication to the importer.

      (f) —(1)  When CBP sends a request for information or a questionnaire, the importer, exporter, or producer will have 30 days from the date specified in paragraph (e) of this section to respond and provide the requested documentation. CBP may deny the claim for preferential tariff treatment of the good, or consider the material that is used in the production of the good to be non-originating material, for failure to respond to the request for information subject to the conditions in § 182.75(c)(1), or for failure to respond to the questionnaire.

      (2)  When CBP sends a notification of a verification visit, the exporter or producer will have 30 days from the date specified in paragraph (e) of this section to consent to or deny the verification visit. CBP may deny the claim for preferential tariff treatment of the good, or consider the material that is used in the production of the good to be non-originating material, for failure to provide consent for a verification visit within the 30-day response period, unless a postponement is requested in accordance with § 182.74(b).

      § 182.74   Verification visit procedures.

#### § § 182.74

      (a)  Prior to conducting a verification visit in Canada or Mexico, CBP must obtain the written consent of the exporter or producer whose premises are to be visited. The exporter or producer must submit this written consent, requested in the notification of a verification visit under § 182.73(b)(3), to CBP through one of the communication means specified in § 182.73(d)(2), within the time period provided in § 182.73(f)(2), unless a postponement is requested in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.

      (b) —(1)  Within 15 days of confirmed receipt of the notification of a verification visit, the exporter or producer may, on a single occasion, using one of the communication means specified in § 182.73(d)(2), request the postponement of the verification visit for a period not to exceed 30 days from the proposed date of the visit.

      (2)  CBP will notify the exporter or producer when a postponement request under paragraph (b)(1) of this section is received and will provide the new date of the verification visit. The Mexican or Canadian customs administration where the verification visit will occur may also, within 15 days of confirmed receipt of the notification of a verification visit, postpone the verification visit for a period not to exceed 60 days from the proposed date of the visit or for a longer period as CBP and the Mexican or Canadian customs administration may decide. CBP will notify the exporter or producer if the verification visit is postponed at the request of the Mexican or Canadian customs administration.

      (c) —(1)  The exporter or producer must make the records, which are required to be maintained to demonstrate that the good qualifies for preferential tariff treatment under the USMCA, available for inspection by a CBP official conducting a verification and provide facilities for that inspection during the verification visit. CBP may deny the claim for preferential tariff treatment of the good for failure to maintain these records or if a CBP official is denied access to these records.

      (2)  During the verification of a material, any records in the material producer's possession demonstrating that the material qualifies as originating must be made available for inspection by a CBP official conducting a verification. CBP may consider the material that is the used in the production of the good and is the subject of the verification visit to be non-originating material if a CBP official is denied access to these records.

      (d)  The exporter or producer may designate up to two observers to be present during the verification visit, if the exporter or producer chooses, provided that:

      (1) The observers do not participate in a manner other than as observers;

      (2) The failure of the exporter or producer to designate observers does not result in the postponement of the visit; and

      (3) The exporter or producer identifies to CBP any observers designated to be present during the visit.

      (2) A statement setting forth the findings of facts made in connection with the verification and upon which the determination is based; and

      (3) The legal basis for the determination.

      (b)  CBP will issue the determination of origin to the importer, and to the exporter or producer who is subject to the verification and either completed the certification of origin or provided information directly to CBP during the verification, subject to the confidentiality provisions in § 182.2, within 120 days (or in exceptional cases and upon notification to the parties, within 210 days) after CBP has determined that it has received all the information necessary to issue a determination of origin, including any information necessary from the exporter or producer.

      (c) —(1)  If a claim for preferential tariff treatment is based on a certification of origin completed by the exporter or producer, and, in response to a request for information, the importer does not provide CBP with sufficient information to verify or substantiate the claim, CBP will send a written request for information or its electronic equivalent to the exporter or producer that completed the certification of origin, subject to the confidentiality provisions in § 182.2, prior to issuing a negative determination.

      (2)  CBP may deny the claim for preferential tariff treatment if:

      (i) The certification of origin is not submitted to CBP upon request as required pursuant to § 182.12(a);

      (ii) The claim or certification of origin is invalid or based on inaccurate information and is not corrected within the required time period pursuant to § 182.11(c);

      (iii) CBP determines that the importer, exporter, or producer failed to provide sufficient information to substantiate the claim;

      (iv) CBP determines that the good does not qualify for preferential tariff treatment, including failing to meet the rules of origin requirements in General Note 11, HTSUS, and Appendix A to this part;

      (v) The importer, exporter, or producer fails to respond to the request for information pursuant to § 182.73(f)(1) subject to the conditions in § 182.75(c)(1);

      (vi) The importer, exporter, or producer fails to respond to the questionnaire pursuant to § 182.73(f)(1);

      (x) The exporter or producer denies access to records or documentation that are in its possession or required to be maintained, or to facilities during a verification visit as required pursuant to this part;

      (xi) CBP finds a pattern of conduct pursuant to § 182.76; or

      (xii) CBP determines that any other reason to deny a claim for preferential tariff treatment as set forth in this part applies

      (3)  Prior to issuing a negative determination, CBP will inform the importer, and the exporter or producer who is subject to the verification and either completed the certification of origin or provided information directly to CBP during the verification, of CBP's intent to deny preferential tariff treatment, subject to the confidentiality provisions in § 182.2. This intent to deny will contain the preliminary results of the verification, the effective date of the denial of preferential tariff treatment, and a notice to the importer, exporter, or producer that CBP will provide 30 days to submit additional information, including documents, related to the preferential tariff treatment of the good.

      (4)  CBP will issue a negative determination of origin to the parties specified in paragraph (b) of this section if CBP determines, at least 30 days after receipt by the importer, exporter, or producer of the intent to deny issued pursuant to paragraph (c)(3) of this section, that one or more of the reasons for denial of preferential tariff treatment under paragraph (c)(2) of this section continues to apply. In addition to the contents of the determination set forth in paragraph (a) of this section, unless CBP determines that there is a pattern of conduct of false or unsupported representations pursuant to § 182.76, a negative determination of origin will provide the exporter or producer with the information necessary to file a protest as provided for in 19 U.S.C. 1514(e) and part 174 of this chapter.

      § 182.111   Commercial samples of negligible value.

#### § § 182.111

      (a)  Commercial samples of negligible value imported from Canada or Mexico may qualify for duty-free entry under subheading 9811.00.60, HTSUS. For purposes of this section, “commercial samples of negligible value” means commercial samples which have a value, individually or in the aggregate as shipped, of not more than one U.S. dollar, or the equivalent amount in the currency of Canada or Mexico, or which are so marked, torn, perforated, or otherwise treated that they are unsuitable for sale or for use except as commercial samples.

      (b)  Commercial samples of negligible value imported from Canada or Mexico will qualify for duty-free entry under subheading 9811.00.60, HTSUS, only if:

      (1) The samples are imported solely for the purpose of soliciting orders for foreign goods or services; and

      (2) If valued over one U.S. dollar, the samples are properly marked, torn, perforated or otherwise treated prior to arrival in the United States so that they are unsuitable for sale or for use except as commercial samples.

      (a)  This section sets forth the rules that apply for purposes of obtaining duty-free treatment on goods returned after repair or alteration in Canada or Mexico as provided for in subheadings 9802.00.40 and 9802.00.50, HTSUS. Goods returned after having been repaired or altered in Canada or Mexico, regardless of whether the repair or alteration could be performed in the United States or has increased the value of the good and regardless of their origin, are eligible for duty-free treatment, provided that the requirements of this section are met. For purposes of this section, “repairs or alterations” means restoration, addition, renovation, re-dyeing, cleaning, re-sterilizing, or other treatment that does not destroy the essential characteristics of, or create a new or commercially different good from, the good exported from the United States.

      (b)  The duty-free treatment referred to in paragraph (a) of this section will not apply to goods that:

      (1) In their condition, as exported from the United States to Canada or Mexico, are incomplete for their intended use and for which the processing operation performed in Canada or Mexico constitutes an operation that is performed as a matter of course in the preparation or manufacture of finished goods; or

      (2) Are imported under a duty-deferral program that are exported for repair or alteration and are not re-imported under a duty-deferral program.

      (c)  The provisions of § 10.8(a), (b), and (c) of this chapter, relating to the documentary requirements for goods entered under subheading 9802.00.40 or 9802.00.50, HTSUS, will apply in connection with the entry of goods which are returned from Canada or Mexico after having been exported for repairs or alterations and which are claimed to be duty-free.

      § 182.124   Framework for correcting claims or certifications of origin.

#### § § 182.124

      (a) “ Except as provided for in paragraph (b) of this section, for purposes of this part, the making of a corrected claim or certification of origin by an importer or the providing of written notification of an incorrect certification of origin by an exporter or producer will be deemed to have been done promptly and voluntarily if:

      (1)(i) Done before the commencement of a formal investigation, within the meaning of § 162.74(g) of this chapter; or

      (ii) Done before any of the events specified in § 162.74(i) of this chapter has occurred; or

      (iii) Done within 30 days after the importer, exporter, or producer initially becomes aware that the claim or certification is incorrect; and

      (2) Accompanied by a statement setting forth the information specified in paragraph (c) of this section; and

      (3) In the case of a corrected claim or certification of origin by an importer, accompanied or followed by a tender of any actual loss of duties and merchandise processing fees, if applicable, in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section.

      (b) —(1)  Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, a person who acted fraudulently in making an incorrect claim or certification of origin may not make a voluntary correction of that claim or certification of origin. For purposes of this paragraph, the term “fraud” will have the meaning set forth in paragraph (C)(3) of Appendix B to part 171 of this chapter.

      (2)  An importer who makes one or more incorrect claims after becoming aware that a claim involving the same merchandise and circumstances is invalid may not make a voluntary correction of the subsequent claims pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section.

      (c)  For purposes of this part, each corrected claim or certification of origin must be accompanied by a statement, submitted in writing or via a CBP-authorized electronic data interchange system, which:

      (1) Identifies the class or kind of good to which the incorrect claim or certification of origin relates;

      (2) In the case of a corrected claim or certification of origin by an importer, identifies each affected import transaction, including each port of importation and the approximate date of each importation;

      (3) In the case of a written notification of an incorrect certification of origin by an exporter or producer, identifies each affected export transaction, including each port of exportation and the approximate date of each exportation. A producer who provides written notification that certain information in a certification of origin is incorrect and who is unable to identify the specific export transactions under this paragraph must provide as much information concerning those transactions as the producer, by the exercise of good faith and due diligence, is able to obtain;

      (4) Specifies the nature of the incorrect statements or omissions regarding the claim or certification of origin; and

      (5) Sets forth, to the best of the person's knowledge, the true and accurate information or data which should have been covered by or provided in the claim or certification of origin, and states that the person will provide any additional information or data which is unknown at the time of making the corrected claim or certification of origin within 30 days or within any extension of that 30-day period as CBP may permit in order for the person to obtain the information or data.

      (d)  A U.S. importer who makes a corrected claim must tender any actual loss of duties at the time of making the corrected claim, or within 30 days thereafter, or within any extension of that 30-day period as CBP may allow in order for the importer to obtain the information or data necessary to calculate the duties owed.

      (h)  Subject to 19 U.S.C. 1625 and part 177 of this chapter, a specific manufacturing drawback ruling under this section will remain in effect indefinitely unless:

      (1) No drawback claim is filed under the ruling for a period of 5 years and notice of termination is published in the Customs Bulletin; or

      (2) The manufacturer or producer to whom approval of the ruling was issued files a request to terminate the ruling, in writing, with CBP Headquarters (Attention: Entry Process and Duty Refunds Branch, Regulations and Rulings, Office of Trade).

      § 190.9   Agency.

#### § § 190.9

      (a)  An owner of the identified merchandise, the designated imported merchandise and/or the substituted merchandise that is used to produce the exported articles may employ another person to do part, or all, of the manufacture or production under 19 U.S.C. 1313(a) or (b) and as defined in § 190.2. For purposes of this section, such owner is the principal and such other person is the agent. Under 19 U.S.C. 1313(b), the principal will be treated as the manufacturer or producer of merchandise used in manufacture or production by the agent. The principal must be able to establish by its manufacturing records, the manufacturing records of its agent(s), or the manufacturing records of both (or all) parties, compliance with all requirements of this part ( in particular, § 190.26).

      (b) —(1)  The manufacturer must establish that it is the principal in a contract between it and its agent who actually does the work on either the designated or substituted merchandise, or both, for the principal. The contract must include:

      (i) Terms of compensation to show that the relationship is an agency rather than a sale;

      (ii) How transfers of merchandise and articles will be recorded by the principal and its agent;

      (iii) The work to be performed on the merchandise by the agent for the principal;

      (iv) The degree of control that is to be exercised by the principal over the agent's performance of work;

      (v) The party who is to bear the risk of loss on the merchandise while it is in the agent's custody; and

      (vi) The period that the contract is in effect.

      (2)  The records of the principal and/or the agent must establish that the principal had legal and equitable title to the merchandise before receipt by the agent. The right of the agent to assert a lien on the merchandise for work performed does not derogate the principal's ownership interest under this section.

      (3)  The relationship between the principal and agent must not be that of a seller and buyer. If the parties' records show that, with respect to the merchandise that is the subject of the principal-agent contract, the merchandise is sold to the agent by the principal, or the articles manufactured by the agent are sold to the principal by the agent, those records are inadequate to establish existence of a principal-agency relationship under this section.

      (c) —(1)  An owner who intends to operate under the principal-agent procedures of this section must state that intent in any letter of notification of intent to operate under a general manufacturing drawback ruling filed under § 190.7 or in any application for a specific manufacturing drawback ruling filed under § 190.8.

      (2)  Each agent operating under this section must have filed a letter of notification of intent to operate under a general manufacturing drawback ruling ( § 190.7), for an agent, covering the articles manufactured or produced, or have obtained a specific manufacturing drawback ruling ( § 190.8), as appropriate.

      (d) —(1)  The principal for whom processing is conducted under this section must file, with any drawback claim, a certificate, subject to the recordkeeping requirements of §§ 190.15 and 190.26, certifying that upon request by CBP it can establish the following:

      (i) Quantity of merchandise transferred from the principal to the agent;

      (ii) Date of transfer of the merchandise from the principal to the agent;

      (iii) Date of manufacturing or production operations performed by the agent;

      (iv) Total quantity, description, and 10-digit HTSUS classification of merchandise appearing in or used in manufacturing or production operations performed by the agent;

      (v) Total quantity, description, and 10-digit HTSUS classification of articles produced in manufacturing or production operations performed by the agent;

      (vi) Quantity and 10-digit HTSUS classification of articles transferred from the agent to the principal; and

      (vii) Date of transfer of the articles from the agent to the principal.

      (2)  The certificate required under paragraph (d)(1) of this section may be a blanket certificate for a stated period.

      § 190.10   Transfer of merchandise.

#### § § 190.10

      (a)  (1) A party may transfer drawback eligible merchandise or articles to another party, provided that the transferring party:

      (i) Imports and pays duties, taxes, and/or fees on such imported merchandise;

      (ii) Receives such imported merchandise;

      (iii) In the case of 19 U.S.C. 1313(j)(2), receives such imported merchandise, substituted merchandise, or any combination of such imported and substituted merchandise; or

      (iv) Receives an article manufactured or produced under 19 U.S.C. 1313(a) and/or (b).

      (2) The transferring party must maintain records that:

      (i) Document the transfer of that merchandise or article;

      (ii) Identify such merchandise or article as being that to which a potential right to drawback exists; and

      (iii) Assign such right to the transferee ( § 190.82).

      (b)  The records that support the transfer must include the following information:

      (1) The party to whom the merchandise or articles are delivered;

      (2) Date of physical delivery;

      (3) Import entry number and entry line item number;

      (4) Quantity delivered and, for substitution claims, total quantity attributable to the relevant import entry line item number;

      (5) Total duties, taxes, and fees paid on, or attributable to, the delivered merchandise, and, for substitution claims, total duties, taxes, and fees paid on, or attributable to, the relevant import entry line item number;

      (6) Date of importation;

      (7) Port where import entry filed;

      (8) Person from whom received;

      (9) Description of the merchandise delivered;

      (10) The 10-digit HTSUS classification for the designated imported merchandise (such HTSUS number must be from the entry summary line item and other entry documentation for the merchandise); and

      (11) If the merchandise transferred is substituted for the designated imported merchandise under 19 U.S.C. 1313(j)(2), the 10-digit HTSUS classification of the substituted merchandise (as if it had been imported).

      (c)  Regardless of any agreement between the transferor and the transferee, the method used for the first filed claim relating to merchandise reported on that entry summary line item will be the exclusive basis for the calculation of refunds (either using per unit averaging or not) for any subsequent claims for any other merchandise reported on that same entry summary line item.  § 190.51(a)(3).

      (d)  The records listed in paragraph (b) of this section must be retained by the issuing party for 3 years from the date of liquidation of the related claim or longer period if required by law ( 19 U.S.C. 1508(c)(3)).

      (e)  If the records required under paragraph (b) of this section or additional records requested by CBP are not provided by the claimant upon request by CBP, the part of the drawback claim dependent on those records will be denied.

      (f)  The person in whose name merchandise is withdrawn from a bonded warehouse will be considered the importer for drawback purposes. No records are required to document prior transfers of merchandise while in a bonded warehouse.

      § 190.11   Valuation of merchandise.

#### § § 190.11

      The values declared to CBP as part of a complete drawback claim pursuant to § 190.51 must be established as provided below. If the drawback eligible merchandise or articles are destroyed, then the value of the imported merchandise and any substituted merchandise must be reduced by the value of materials recovered during destruction in accordance with 19 U.S.C. 1313(x).

      (a)  The value of the imported merchandise is determined as follows:

      (1)  The value of the imported merchandise is the customs value of the imported merchandise upon entry into the United States (see subpart E of part 152 of this chapter); or, if the merchandise is identified pursuant to an approved accounting method, then the value of the imported merchandise is the customs value that is properly attributable to the imported merchandise as identified by the appropriate recordkeeping (see § 190.14, varies by accounting method).

      (2)  The value of the designated imported merchandise is the per unit average value, which is the entered value for the applicable entry summary line item apportioned equally over each unit covered by the line item.

      (b)  The value of the exported merchandise or articles eligible for drawback is the selling price as declared for the Electronic Export Information (EEI), including any adjustments and exclusions required by 15 CFR 30.6(a). If there is no selling price for the EEI, then the value is the other value as declared for the EEI including any adjustments and exclusions required by 15 CFR 30.6(a) (e.g., the market price, if the goods are shipped on consignment). (For special types of transactions where certain unusual conditions are involved, the value for the EEI is determined pursuant to 15 CFR part 30 subpart C.) If no EEI is required ( 15 CFR part 30 subpart D for a complete list of exemptions), then the claimant must provide the value that would have been set forth on the EEI when the exportation took place, but for the exemption from the requirement for an EEI.

      (c)  The value of the destroyed merchandise or articles eligible for drawback is the value at the time of destruction, determined as if the merchandise had been exported in its condition at the time of its destruction and an EEI had been required.

      (d)  The value of the substituted merchandise for manufacturing drawback claims pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 1313(b) is the cost of acquisition or production for the manufacturer or producer who used the substituted merchandise in manufacturing or production. These costs must be based on records kept in the ordinary course of business and may be determined on the basis of any of the inventory accounting methods recognized in the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Any inventory management method which is used by a manufacturer or producer for valuation of the substituted merchandise for manufacturing drawback claims under 19 U.S.C. 1313(b) must be used without variation with other methods for a period of at least 1 year.

      § 190.12   Claim filed under incorrect provision.

#### § § 190.12

      A drawback claim filed under this part and pursuant to any provision of section 313 of the Act, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1313), may be deemed filed pursuant to any other provision thereof should the drawback office determine that drawback is not allowable under the provision as originally filed, but that it is allowable under such other provision. To be allowable under such other provision, the claim must meet each of the requirements of such provision. The claimant may raise alternative provisions prior to liquidation and by protest ( part 174 of this chapter).

      § 190.13   Packaging materials.

#### § § 190.13

      (a)  Drawback is provided for in section 313(q)(1) of the Act, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1313(q)(1)), on imported packaging material used to package or repackage merchandise or articles exported or destroyed pursuant to section 313(a), (b), (c), or (j) of the Act, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1313(a), (b), (c), or (j)). The amount of drawback payable on the packaging material is determined pursuant to the particular drawback provision to which the packaged goods themselves are subject. The packaging material must be separately identified on the claim, and all other information and documents required for the particular drawback provision under which the claim is made must be provided for the packaging material.

      (b)  Drawback is provided for in section 313(q)(2) of the Act, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1313(q)(2)), on packaging material that is manufactured or produced in the United States from imported materials and used to package or repackage articles that are exported or destroyed under section 313(a) or (b) of the Act, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1313(a) or (b)). The packaging material and the imported merchandise used in the manufacture or production of the packaging material must be separately identified on the claim, and all other information and documents required for the particular drawback provision under which the claim is made must be provided for the packaging material as well as the imported merchandise used in its manufacture or production, for purposes of determining the applicable drawback payable. Drawback under 19 U.S.C. 1313(q)(2) is allowed, regardless of whether or not any of the articles or merchandise the packaging contains are actually eligible for drawback.

      § 190.14   Identification of merchandise or articles by accounting method.

#### § § 190.14

      (a)  This section provides for the identification of merchandise or articles for drawback purposes by the use of accounting methods. This section applies to identification of merchandise or articles in inventory or storage, as well as identification of merchandise used in manufacture or production, as defined in § 190.2. This section is not applicable to situations in which the drawback law authorizes substitution (substitution is allowed in specified situations under 19 U.S.C. 1313(b), 1313(j)(2), 1313(k), and 1313(p); this section does apply to situations in these subsections in which substitution is not allowed, as well as to the subsections of the drawback law under which no substitution is allowed). When substitution is authorized, merchandise or articles may be substituted without reference to this section, under the criteria and conditions specifically authorized in the statutory and regulatory provisions providing for the substitution.

      (b)  Manufacturers, producers, claimants, or other appropriate persons may identify for drawback purposes lots of merchandise or articles under this section, subject to each of the following conditions and criteria:

      (1) The lots of merchandise or articles to be so identified must be fungible as defined in § 190.2;

      (2) The person using the identification method must be able to establish that inventory records (for example, material control records), prepared and used in the ordinary course of business, account for the lots of merchandise or articles to be identified as being received into and withdrawn from the same inventory. Even if merchandise or articles are received or withdrawn at different geographical locations, if such inventory records treat receipts or withdrawals as being from the same inventory, those inventory records may be used to identify the merchandise or articles under this section, subject to the conditions of this section. If any such inventory records (that is, inventory records prepared and used in the ordinary course of business) treat receipts and withdrawals as being from different inventories, those inventory records must be used and receipts into or withdrawals from the different inventories may not be accounted for together. If units of merchandise or articles can be specifically identified (for example, by serial number), the merchandise or articles must be specifically identified and may not be identified by accounting method, unless it is established that inventory records, prepared and used in the ordinary course of business, treat the merchandise or articles to be identified as being received into and withdrawn from the same inventory (subject to the above conditions);

      (3) Unless otherwise provided in this section or specifically approved by CBP (by a binding ruling under part 177 of this chapter), all receipts (or inputs) into and all withdrawals from the inventory must be recorded in the accounting record;

      (4) The records which support any identification method under this section are subject to verification by CBP ( § 190.61). If CBP requests such verification, the person using the identification method must be able to demonstrate how, under generally accepted accounting procedures, the records which support the identification method used account for all merchandise or articles in, and all receipts into and withdrawals from, the inventory, and the drawback per unit for each receipt and withdrawal; and

      (5) Any accounting method which is used by a person for drawback purposes under this section must be used exclusively, without using other methods for a period of at least 1 year, unless approval is given by CBP for a shorter period.

      (c)  The following accounting methods are approved for use in the identification of merchandise or articles for drawback purposes under this section. If a claim is eligible for the use of any accounting method, the claimant must indicate on the drawback entry whether an accounting method was used, and if so, which accounting method was used, to identify the merchandise as part of the complete claim (see § 190.51).

      (1)  ()—(i)  The _FIFO_ method is the method by which fungible merchandise or articles are identified by recordkeeping on the basis of the first merchandise or articles received into the inventory. Under this method, withdrawals are from the oldest (first-in) merchandise or articles in the inventory at the time of withdrawal.

      (ii)  If the beginning inventory is zero, 100 units with $1 drawback attributable per unit are received in inventory on the 2nd of the month, 50 units with no drawback attributable per unit are received into inventory on the 5th of the month, 75 units are withdrawn for domestic (non-export) shipment on the 10th of the month, 75 units with $2 drawback attributable per unit are received in inventory on the 15th of the month, 100 units are withdrawn for export on the 20th of the month, and no other receipts or withdrawals occurred in the month, the drawback attributable to the 100 units withdrawn for export on the 20th is a total of $75 (25 units from the receipt on the 2nd with $1 drawback attributable per unit, 50 units from the receipt on the 5th with no drawback attributable per unit, and 25 units from the receipt on the 15th with $2 drawback attributable per unit). The basis of the foregoing and the effects on the inventory of the receipts and withdrawals, and balance in the inventory thereafter are as follows: On the 2nd of the month the receipt of 100 units ($1 drawback/unit) results in a balance of that amount; the receipt of 50 units ($0 drawback/unit) on the 5th results in a balance of 150 units (100 with $1 drawback/unit and 50 with $0 drawback/unit); the withdrawal on the 10th of 75 units ($1 drawback/unit) results in a balance of 75 units (25 with $1 drawback/unit and 50 with $0 drawback/unit); the receipt of 75 units ($2 drawback/unit) on the 15th results in a balance of 150 units (25 with $1 drawback/unit, 50 with $0 drawback/unit, and 75 with $2 drawback/unit); the withdrawal on the 20th of 100 units (25 with $1 drawback/unit, 50 with $0 drawback/unit, and 25 with $2 drawback unit) results in a balance of 50 units (all 50 with $2 drawback/unit).

      (2)  ()—(i)  The _LIFO_ method is the method by which fungible merchandise or articles are identified by recordkeeping on the basis of the last merchandise or articles received into the inventory. Under this method, withdrawals are from the newest (last-in) merchandise or articles in the inventory at the time of withdrawal.

      (ii)  In the example in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, the drawback attributable to the 100 units withdrawn for export on the 20th is a total of $175 (75 units from the receipt on the 15th with $2 drawback attributable per unit and 25 units from the receipt on the 2nd with $1 drawback attributable per unit). The basis of the foregoing and the effects on the inventory of the receipts and withdrawals, and balance in the inventory thereafter are as follows: On the 2nd of the month the receipt of 100 units ($1 drawback/unit) results in a balance of that amount; the receipt of 50 units ($0 drawback/unit) on the 5th results in a balance of 150 units (100 with $1 drawback/unit and 50 with $0 drawback/unit); the withdrawal on the 10th of 75 units (50 with $0 drawback/unit and 25 with $1 drawback/unit) results in a balance of 75 units (all with $1 drawback/unit); the receipt of 75 units ($2 drawback/unit) on the 15th results in a balance of 150 units (75 with $1 drawback/unit and 75 with $2 drawback/unit); the withdrawal on the 20th of 100 units (75 with $2 drawback/unit and 25 with $1 drawback/unit) results in a balance of 50 units (all 50 with $1 drawback/unit).

      (3) —(i)  The low-to-high method is the method by which fungible merchandise or articles are identified by recordkeeping on the basis of the lowest drawback amount per unit of the merchandise or articles in inventory. Merchandise or articles with no drawback attributable to them (for example, domestic merchandise or duty-free merchandise) must be accounted for and are treated as having the lowest drawback attributable to them. Under this method, withdrawals are from the merchandise or articles with the least amount of drawback attributable to them, then those with the next higher amount, and so forth. If the same amount of drawback is attributable to more than one lot of merchandise or articles, withdrawals are from the oldest (first-in) merchandise or articles among those lots with the same amount of drawback attributable. Drawback requirements are applicable to withdrawn merchandise or articles as identified (for example, if the merchandise or articles identified were attributable to an import more than 5 years before the claimed export, no drawback could be granted).

      (ii) —(A)  Under the ordinary low-to-high method, all receipts into and all withdrawals from the inventory are recorded in the accounting record and accounted for so that each withdrawal, whether for export or domestic shipment, is identified by recordkeeping on the basis of the lowest drawback amount per unit of the merchandise or articles available in the inventory.

      (B)  In this example, the beginning inventory is zero, and receipts into and withdrawals from the inventory are as follows:

      (iii) —(A)  Under the low-to-high method with established average inventory turn-over period, all receipts into and all withdrawals for export are recorded in the accounting record and accounted for so that each withdrawal is identified by recordkeeping on the basis of the lowest drawback amount per available unit of the merchandise or articles received into the inventory in the established average inventory turn-over period preceding the withdrawal.

      (B)  (). Under the low-to-high method with established average inventory turn-over period, domestic withdrawals (withdrawals for domestic shipment) are not accounted for and do not affect the available units of merchandise or articles. All withdrawals for export must be accounted for whether or not drawback is available or claimed on the withdrawals. Once a withdrawal for export is made and accounted for under this method, the merchandise or articles withdrawn are no longer available for identification.

      (C)  For purposes of the low-to-high method with established average inventory turn-over period, the average inventory turn-over period is based on the rate of withdrawal from inventory and represents the time in which all of the merchandise or articles in the inventory at a given time must have been withdrawn based on that rate. To establish an average of this time, at least 1 year, or 3 turn-over periods (if inventory turns over fewer than 3 times per year), must be averaged. The inventory turn-over period must be that for the merchandise or articles to be identified, except that if the person using the method has more than one kind of merchandise or articles with different inventory turn-over periods, the longest average turn-over period established under this section may be used (instead of using a different inventory turn-over period for each kind of merchandise or article).

      (D)  In the example in paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(B) of this section (but, as required for this method, without accounting for domestic withdrawals, and with an established average inventory turn-over period of 30 days), the drawback attributable to the January 15 withdrawal for export is zero (the available receipt in the preceding 30 days with the lowest amount of drawback is the January 2 receipt, of which 50 units will remain after the withdrawal), the drawback attributable to the February 5 withdrawal for export is $101.50 (the January 20 and January 25 receipts), the drawback attributable to the February 15 withdrawal for export is $47.50 (the February 10 receipt), the drawback attributable to the February 28 withdrawal for export is $51.50 (the February 20 and January 31 receipts), the drawback attributable to the March 15 withdrawal for export is $42.50 (the March 10 receipt), and the drawback attributable to the March 31 withdrawal for export is $98.00 (the March 25 and March 5 receipts). No drawback may be claimed on the basis of the January 5 receipt or the February 25 receipt because in the case of each, there were insufficient withdrawals for export within the established average inventory turn-over period; the 50 units remaining from the January 2 receipt after the January 15 withdrawal are not identified for a withdrawal for export because there is no other withdrawal for export (other than the January 15 withdrawal) within the established average inventory turn-over period; the March 20 receipt (50 units at $1.08) is not yet attributed to withdrawals for export. Total drawback attributable to withdrawals for export in this example would be $341.00.

      (iv) —(A)  Under the low-to-high blanket method, all receipts into and all withdrawals for export are recorded in the accounting record and accounted for. Each withdrawal is identified on the basis of the lowest drawback amount per available unit of the merchandise or articles received into inventory in the applicable statutory period for export preceding the withdrawal (e.g., 180 days under 19 U.S.C. 1313(p) and 5 years for other types of drawback claims pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 1313(r)). Drawback requirements are applicable to withdrawn merchandise or articles as identified (for example, no drawback could be granted generally if the merchandise or articles identified were attributable to an import made more than 5 years before the claimed export; and, for claims pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 1313(p), no drawback could be granted if the merchandise or articles identified were attributable to an import that was entered more than 180 days after the date of the claimed export or if the claimed export was more than 180 days after the close of the manufacturing period attributable to an import).

      (B)  (). Under the low-to-high blanket method, domestic withdrawals (withdrawals for domestic shipment) are not accounted for and do not affect the available units of merchandise or articles. All withdrawals for export must be accounted for whether or not drawback is available or claimed on the withdrawals. Once a withdrawal for export is made and accounted for under this method, the merchandise or articles withdrawn are no longer available for identification.

      (C)  In the example in paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(B) of this section (but, as required for this method, without accounting for domestic withdrawals), the drawback attributable to the January 15 withdrawal for export is zero (the available receipt in the inventory with the lowest amount of drawback is the January 2 receipt, of which 50 units will remain after the withdrawal), the drawback attributable to the February 5 withdrawal for export is $50.00 (the remainder of the January 2 receipt and the January 5 receipt), the drawback attributable to the February 15 withdrawal for export is $47.50 (the February 10 receipt), the drawback attributable to the February 28 withdrawal for export is $50.50 (the February 20 and January 20 receipts), the drawback attributable to the March 15 withdrawal for export is $42.50 (the March 10 receipt), and the drawback attributable to the March 31 withdrawal for export is $96.00 (the March 25 and January 25 receipts). Receipts not attributed to withdrawals for export are the January 31 (50 units at $1.03), February 25 (50 units at $1.05), March 5 (50 units at $1.06), and March 20 (50 units at $1.08) receipts. Total drawback attributable to withdrawals for export in this example would be $286.50.

      (4) —(i)  The average method is the method by which fungible merchandise or articles are identified on the basis of the calculation by recordkeeping of the amount of drawback that may be attributed to each unit of merchandise or articles in the inventory. In this method, the ratio of:

      (A) The total units of a particular receipt of the fungible merchandise in the inventory at the time of a withdrawal to;

      (B) The total units of all receipts of the fungible merchandise (including each receipt into inventory) at the time of the withdrawal;

      (C) Is applied to the withdrawal, so that the withdrawal consists of a proportionate quantity of units from each particular receipt and each receipt is correspondingly decreased. Withdrawals and corresponding decreases to receipts are rounded to the nearest whole number.

      (ii)  In the example in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, the drawback attributable to the 100 units withdrawn for export on the 20th is a total of $133 (50 units from the receipt on the 15th with $2 drawback attributable per unit, 33 units from the receipt on the 2nd with $1 drawback attributable per unit, and 17 units from the receipt on the 5th with $0 drawback attributable per unit). The basis of the foregoing and the effects on the inventory of the receipts and withdrawals, and balance in the inventory thereafter are as follows: On the 2nd of the month the receipt of 100 units ($1 drawback/unit) results in a balance of that amount; the receipt of 50 units ($0 drawback/unit) on the 5th results in a balance of 150 units (100 with $1 drawback/unit and 50 with $0 drawback/unit); the withdrawal on the 10th of 75 units (50 with $1 drawback/unit (applying the ratio of 100 units from the receipt on the 2nd to the total of 150 units at the time of withdrawal) and 25 with $0 drawback/unit (applying the ratio of 50 units from the receipt on the 5th to the total of 150 units at the time of withdrawal)) results in a balance of 75 units (with 50 with $1 drawback/unit and 25 with $0 drawback/unit, on the basis of the same ratios); the receipt of 75 units ($2 drawback/unit) on the 15th results in a balance of 150 units (50 with $1 drawback/unit, 25 with $0 drawback/unit, and 75 with $2 drawback/unit); the withdrawal on the 20th of 100 units (50 with $2 drawback/unit (applying the ratio of the 75 units from the receipt on the 15th to the total of 150 units at the time of withdrawal), 33 with $1 drawback/unit (applying the ratio of the 50 units remaining from the receipt on the 2nd to the total of 150 units at the time of withdrawal, and 17 with $0 drawback/unit (applying the ratio of the 25 units remaining from the receipt on the 5th to the total of 150 units at the time of withdrawal)) results in a balance of 50 units (25 with $2 drawback/unit, 17 with $1 drawback/unit, and 8 with $0 drawback/unit, on the basis of the same ratios).

      (5)  A properly established average inventory turn-over period, as provided for in paragraph (c)(3)(iii)(C) of this section, may be used to determine:

      (i) The fact and date(s) of use in manufacture or production of the designated imported merchandise and other (substituted) merchandise ( 19 U.S.C. 1313(b)); or

      (ii) The fact and date(s) of manufacture or production of the exported or destroyed articles ( 19 U.S.C. 1313(a) and (b)).

      (d)  (1) Persons proposing to use an accounting method for identification of merchandise or articles for drawback purposes which has not been previously approved for such use ( paragraph (c) of this section), or which includes modifications from the methods listed in paragraph (c) of this section, may __see__k approval by CBP of the proposed accounting method under the provisions for obtaining an administrative ruling ( part 177 of this chapter). The conditions applied and the criteria used by CBP in approving such an alternative accounting method, or a modification of one of the approved accounting methods, will be the criteria in paragraph (b) of this section, as well as those in paragraph (d)(2) of this section.

      (2) In order for a proposed accounting method to be approved by CBP for purposes of this section, it must meet the following criteria:

    Subpart B—Manufacturing Drawback

      § 190.21   Direct identification manufacturing drawback.

#### § § 190.21

      Section 313(a) of the Act, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1313(a)), provides for drawback upon the exportation, or destruction under CBP supervision, of articles manufactured or produced in the United States with the use of imported merchandise, provided that those articles have not been used in the United States prior to such exportation or destruction. The amount of drawback allowable will not exceed 99 percent of the amount of duties, taxes, and fees paid with respect to the imported merchandise. However, duties may not be refunded upon the exportation or destruction of flour or by-products produced from imported wheat. Where two or more products result, drawback must be distributed among the products in accordance with their relative values, as defined in § 190.2, at the time of separation. Merchandise may be identified for drawback purposes under 19 U.S.C. 1313(a) in the manner provided for and prescribed in § 190.14.

      § 190.22   Substitution drawback.

#### § § 190.22

      (a)(1) —(i)  If imported, duty-paid merchandise or merchandise classifiable under the same 8-digit HTSUS subheading number as the imported merchandise is used in the manufacture or production of articles within a period not to exceed 5 years from the date of importation of such imported merchandise, then upon the exportation, or destruction under CBP supervision, of any such articles, without their having been used in the United States prior to such exportation or destruction, drawback is provided for in section 313(b) of the Act, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1313(b)). Drawback is allowable even though none of the imported, duty-paid merchandise may actually have been used in the manufacture or production of the exported or destroyed articles. The amount of duties, taxes, and fees eligible for drawback is determined by per unit averaging, as defined in § 190.2, for any drawback claim based on 19 U.S.C. 1313(b).

      (ii) —(A)  In the case of an article that is exported, the amount of drawback allowable will not exceed 99 percent of the lesser of:

      () The amount of duties, taxes, and fees paid with respect to the imported merchandise; or

      () The amount of duties, taxes, and fees that would apply to the substituted merchandise if the substituted merchandise were imported (after the value of the imported merchandise has been reduced by the value of materials recovered during destruction as provided in 19 U.S.C. 1313(x)).

      (C)  For purposes of drawback of internal revenue tax imposed under Chapters 32, 38 (with the exception of Subchapter A of Chapter 38), 51, and 52 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (IRC), drawback granted on the export or destruction of substituted merchandise will be limited to the amount of taxes paid (and not returned by refund, credit, or drawback) on the substituted merchandise.

      (2) —(i)  A sought chemical element, as defined in § 190.2, may be considered imported merchandise, or merchandise classifiable under the same 8-digit HTSUS subheading number as such imported merchandise, used in the manufacture or production of an article as described in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section, and it may be substituted for source material containing that sought chemical element, without regard to whether the sought chemical element and the source material are classifiable under the same 8-digit HTSUS subheading number, and apportioned quantitatively, as appropriate ( § 190.26(b)(4)).

      (ii)  The amount of drawback allowable will be determined in accordance with paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section. The value of the substituted source material must be determined based on the quantity of the sought chemical element present in the source material, as calculated per § 190.26(b)(4).

      (b)  Duty-paid merchandise or drawback products used at one factory of a manufacturer or producer within 5 years after the date on which the material was imported may be designated as the basis for drawback on articles manufactured or produced in accordance with these regulations at other factories of the same manufacturer or producer.

      (c)  A manufacturer or producer may designate any eligible imported merchandise or drawback product which it has used in manufacture or production.

      (d) —(1)  Upon compliance with the requirements in this section and under 19 U.S.C. 1313(s), a drawback successor as defined in paragraph (d)(2) of this section may designate merchandise or drawback product used by a predecessor before the date of succession as the basis for drawback on articles manufactured or produced by the successor after the date of succession.

      (2)  A “drawback successor” is a manufacturer or producer to whom another entity (predecessor) has transferred, by written agreement, merger, or corporate resolution:

      (i) All or substantially all of the rights, privileges, immunities, powers, duties, and liabilities of the predecessor; or

      (ii) The assets and other business interests of a division, plant, or other business unit of such predecessor, but only if in such transfer the value of the transferred realty, personalty, and intangibles (other than drawback rights, inchoate or otherwise) exceeds the value of all transferred drawback rights, inchoate or otherwise.

      (3) —(i)  The predecessor or successor must certify that the successor is in possession of the predecessor's records which are necessary to establish the right to drawback under the law and regulations with respect to the merchandise or drawback product.

      (ii)  The predecessor or successor must certify that the predecessor has not designated and will not designate, nor enable any other person to designate, such merchandise or product as the basis for drawback.

      (iii)  In instances in which assets and other business interests of a division, plant, or other business unit of a predecessor are transferred, the predecessor or successor must specify, and maintain supporting records to establish, the value of the drawback rights and the value of all other transferred property.

      (iv)  The written agreement, merger, or corporate resolution, provided for in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, and the records and evidence provided for in paragraph (d)(3)(i) through (iii) of this section, must be retained by the appropriate party(s) for 3 years from the date of liquidation of the related claim and are subject to review by CBP upon request.

      (e) —(1)  Where two or more products are produced concurrently in a substitution manufacturing operation, drawback will be distributed to each product in accordance with its relative value ( § 190.2) at the time of separation.

      (2)  Where the claim covers a manufacturing period rather than a manufacturing lot, the entire period covered by the claim is the time of separation of the products and the value per unit of product is the market value for the period (as provided for in the definition of relative value in § 190.2). Manufacturing periods in excess of one month may not be used without specific approval of CBP.

      (3)  Records must be maintained showing the relative value of each product at the time of separation.

      § 190.23   Methods and requirements for claiming drawback.

#### § § 190.23

      Claims must be based on one or more of the methods specified in paragraph (a) of this section and comply with all other requirements specified in this section.

      (a) —(1)  Drawback may be paid based on the amount of the imported or substituted merchandise used in the manufacture of the exported article, where there is no waste or the waste is valueless or unrecoverable. This method must be used when multiple products also necessarily and concurrently result from the manufacturing process, and there is no valuable waste ( paragraph (a)(2) of this section).

      (2)  Drawback is allowable under this method based on the quantity of merchandise or drawback products used to manufacture the exported or destroyed article, reduced by an amount equal to the quantity of this merchandise that the value of the waste would replace. This method must be used when multiple products also necessarily and concurrently result from the manufacturing process, and there is valuable waste.

      (3)  Drawback is also allowable under this method when two or more products result from manufacturing or production. The relative value method must be used when multiple products also necessarily and concurrently result from the manufacturing process, and drawback must be distributed among the products in accordance with their relative values (as defined in § 190.2) at the time of separation.

      (4)  Drawback is allowable under this method based only on the amount of imported or substituted merchandise that appears in (is contained in) the exported articles. The appearing in method may not be used if there are multiple products also necessarily and concurrently resulting from the manufacturing process.

      (b)  A drawback claimant may use either the abstract or schedule method to show the quantity of material used or appearing in the exported or destroyed article. An abstract is the summary of records which shows the total quantity used in or appearing in all articles produced during the period covered by the abstract. A schedule shows the quantity of material actually used in producing, or appearing in, each unit of product. Manufacturers or producers submitting letters of notification of intent to operate under a general manufacturing drawback ruling ( § 190.7) and applicants for approval of specific manufacturing drawback rulings ( § 190.8) must state whether the abstract or schedule method is used; if no such statement is made, drawback claims must be based upon the abstract method.

      (c) —(1)  When the waste has a value and the drawback claim is not limited to the quantity of imported or substituted merchandise or drawback products appearing in the exported or destroyed articles claimed for drawback, the manufacturer or producer must keep records to show the market value of the merchandise or drawback products used to manufacture or produce the exported or destroyed articles, as well as the market value of the resulting waste, under the used in less valuable waste method (as provided for in the definition of relative value in § 190.2).

      (2)  If claim for waste is waived, only the “appearing in” basis may be used ( paragraph (a)(4) of this section). Waste records need not be kept unless required to establish the quantity of imported duty-paid merchandise or drawback products appearing in the exported or destroyed articles claimed for drawback.

      § 190.24   Transfer of merchandise.

#### § § 190.24

      Evidence of any transfers of merchandise ( § 190.10) must be evidenced by records, as defined in § 190.2.

      § 190.25   Destruction under CBP supervision.

#### § § 190.25

      A claimant may destroy merchandise and obtain drawback by complying with the procedures set forth in § 190.71 relating to destruction.

      § 190.26   Recordkeeping.

#### § § 190.26

      (a)  (1)  Each manufacturer or producer under 19 U.S.C. 1313(a) must keep records to allow the verifying CBP official to trace all articles manufactured or produced for exportation or destruction with drawback, from importation, through manufacture or production, to exportation or destruction. To this end, these records must specifically establish:

      (i) The date or inclusive dates of manufacture or production;

      (ii) The quantity, identity, and 8-digit HTSUS subheading number(s) of the imported duty-paid merchandise or drawback products used in or appearing in ( § 190.23) the articles manufactured or produced;

      (iii) The quantity, if any, of the non-drawback merchandise used, when these records are necessary to determine the quantity of imported duty-paid merchandise or drawback product used in the manufacture or production of the exported or destroyed articles or appearing in them;

      (iv) The quantity and description of the articles manufactured or produced;

      (v) The quantity of waste incurred, if applicable; and

      (vi) That the articles on which drawback is claimed were exported or destroyed within 5 years after the importation of the duty-paid merchandise, without having been used in the United States prior to such exportation or destruction. (If the articles were commingled after manufacture or production, their identity may be maintained in the manner prescribed in § 190.14.)

      (2)  The merchandise and articles to be exported or destroyed will be accounted for in a manner which will enable the manufacturer, producer, or claimant:

      (i) To determine, and the CBP official to verify, the applicable import entry and any transfers of the merchandise associated with the claim; and

      (ii) To identify with respect to that import entry, and any transfers of the merchandise, the imported merchandise or drawback products used in manufacture or production.

      (b)  The records of the manufacturer or producer of articles manufactured or produced in accordance with 19 U.S.C. 1313(b) must establish the facts in paragraph (a)(1)(i), (iv) through (vi) of this section, and:

      (1) The quantity, identity, and specifications of the merchandise designated (imported duty-paid, or drawback product);

      (2) The quantity, identity, and specifications of the substituted merchandise before its use to manufacture or produce (or appearing in) the exported or destroyed articles;

      (3) That, within 5 years after the date of importation of the imported duty-paid merchandise, the manufacturer or producer used the designated merchandise in manufacturing or production and that during the same5-year period it manufactured or produced the exported or destroyed articles; and

      (4) If the designated merchandise is a sought chemical element, as defined in § 190.2, that was contained in imported material and a substitution drawback claim is made based on that chemical element:

      (i) The duties, taxes, and fees paid on the imported material must be apportioned among its constituent components. The claim on the chemical element that is the designated merchandise must be limited to the duty apportioned to that element on a unit-for-unit attribution using the unit of measure set forth in the HTSUS that is applicable to the imported material. If the material is a compound with other constituents, including impurities, and the purity of the compound in the imported material is shown by satisfactory analysis, that purity, converted to a decimal equivalent of the percentage, is multiplied against the entered amount of the material to establish the amount of pure compound. The amount of the element in the pure compound is to be determined by use of the atomic weights of the constituent elements and converting to the decimal equivalent of their respective percentages and multiplying that decimal equivalent against the above-determined amount of pure compound.

      (ii) The amount claimed as drawback based on the sought chemical element must be deducted from the amounts paid on the imported material that may be claimed on any other drawback claim.

      Synthetic rutile that is shown by appropriate analysis in the entry papers to be 91.7% pure titanium dioxide is imported and dutiable at a 5% ad valorem duty rate. The amount of imported synthetic rutile is 30,000 pounds with an entered value of $12,000. The total duty paid is $600. Titanium in the synthetic rutile is designated as the basis for a drawback claim under 19 U.S.C. 1313(b). The amount of titanium dioxide in the synthetic rutile is determined by converting the purity percentage (91.7%) to its decimal equivalent (.917) and multiplying the entered amount of synthetic rutile (30,000 pounds) by that decimal equivalent (.917 × 30,000 = 27,510 pounds of titanium dioxide contained in the 30,000 pounds of imported synthetic rutile). The titanium, based on atomic weight, represents 59.93% of the constituents in titanium dioxide. Multiplying that percentage, converted to its decimal equivalent, by the amount of titanium dioxide determines the titanium content of the imported synthetic rutile (.5993 × 27,510 pounds of titanium dioxide = 16,486.7 pounds of titanium contained in the imported synthetic rutile). Therefore, up to 16,486.7 pounds of titanium is available to be designated as the basis for drawback. As the per unit duty paid on the synthetic rutile is calculated by dividing the duty paid ($600) by the amount of imported synthetic rutile (30,000 pounds), the per unit duty is two cents of duty per pound of the imported synthetic rutile ($600 ÷ 30,000 = $0.02). The duty on the titanium is calculated by multiplying the amount of titanium contained in the imported synthetic rutile by two cents of duty per pound (16,486.7 × $0.02 = $329.73 duty apportioned to the titanium). The product is then multiplied by 99% to determine the maximum amount of drawback available ($329.73 × .99 = $326.44). If an exported titanium alloy ingot weighs 17,000 pounds, in which 16,000 pounds of titanium was used to make the ingot, drawback is determined by multiplying the duty per pound ($0.02) by the weight of the titanium contained in the ingot (16,000 pounds) to calculate the duty available for drawback ($0.02 × 16,000 = $320.00). Because only 99% of the duty can be claimed, drawback is determined by multiplying this available duty amount by 99% (.99 × $320.00 = $316.80). As the oxygen content of the titanium dioxide is 45% of the synthetic rutile, if oxygen is the designated merchandise on another drawback claim, 45% of the duty claimed on the synthetic rutile would be available for drawback based on the substitution of oxygen.

      (c)  When waste has a value and the manufacturer, producer, or claimant, has not limited the claims based on the quantity of imported or substituted merchandise appearing in the articles exported or destroyed, the manufacturer or producer must keep records to show the market value of the merchandise used to manufacture or produce the exported or destroyed article, as well as the quantity and market value of the waste incurred (as provided for in the definition of relative value in § 190.2). In such records, the quantity of merchandise identified or designated for drawback, under 19 U.S.C. 1313(a) or 1313(b), respectively, must be based on the quantity of merchandise actually used to manufacture or produce the exported or destroyed articles. The waste replacement reduction will be determined by reducing from the quantity of merchandise actually used by the amount of merchandise which the value of the waste would replace.

      (d)  Where the claimant purchases articles from the manufacturer or producer and exports or destroys them, the claimant must maintain records to document the transfer of articles received.

      (e) —(1)  _Multiple claimants_ may file for drawback with respect to the same export or destruction (for example, if an automobile is exported, where different parts of the automobile have been produced by different manufacturers under drawback conditions and the exporter waives the right to claim drawback and assigns such right to the manufacturers under § 190.82).

      (2) —(i)  Each drawback claimant must file a separate letter, as part of the claim, describing the component article to which each claim will relate. Each letter must show the name of the claimant and bear a statement that the claim will be limited to its respective component article. The exporter or destroyer must endorse the letters, as required, to show the respective interests of the claimants.

      (ii)  Exporters may waive and assign their drawback rights for all, or any portion, of their exportations with respect to a particular commodity for a given period to a drawback claimant.

      (f)  Pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 1508(c)(3), all records required to be kept by the manufacturer, producer, or claimant with respect to drawback claims, and records kept by others to complement the records of the manufacturer, producer, or claimant with respect to drawback claims must be retained for 3 years after the date of liquidation of the related claims (under 19 U.S.C. 1508, the same records may be subject to a different retention period for different purposes).

      § 190.27   Time limitations for manufacturing drawback.

#### § § 190.27

      (a)  Drawback will be allowed on imported merchandise used to manufacture or produce articles that are exported or destroyed under CBP supervision within 5 years after importation of the merchandise identified to support the claim.

      § 190.28   Person entitled to claim manufacturing drawback.

#### § § 190.28

      The exporter (or destroyer) will be entitled to claim drawback, unless the exporter (or destroyer), by means of a certification, assigns the right to claim drawback to the manufacturer, producer, importer, or intermediate party. Such certification must accompany each claim and also affirm that the exporter (or destroyer) has not claimed and will not itself claim drawback or assign the right to claim drawback on the particular exportation or destruction to any other party. The certification provided for under this section may be a blanket certification for a stated period. Drawback is paid to the claimant, who may be the manufacturer, producer, intermediate party, importer, or exporter (or destroyer).

      § 190.29   Certification of bill of materials or formula.

#### § § 190.29

      (3)  Merchandise on a specific line on an entry summary may be designated for either direct identification or substitution claims but a single line on an entry summary may not be split for purposes of claiming drawback under both direct identification and substitution claims. The first complete drawback claim accepted by CBP which designates merchandise on a line on an entry summary establishes this designation for any remaining merchandise on that same line.

      (4)  Claimants filing substitution drawback claims under part 190 for imported merchandise associated with a line item on an entry summary if any other merchandise covered on that entry summary has been designated as the basis of a claim under part 191 must provide additional information enabling CBP to verify the availability of drawback for the indicated merchandise and associated line item within 30 days of claim submission. The information to be provided will include, but is not limited to: summary document specifying the lines used and unused on the import entry; the import entry summary, corresponding commercial invoices, and copies of all drawback claims that previously designated the import entry summary; and post summary/liquidation changes (for imports or drawback claims, if applicable).

      (b) —(1)  Drawback claimants are required to correctly calculate the amount of drawback due. The amount of drawback requested on the drawback entry is generally to be 99 percent of the duties, taxes, and fees eligible for drawback. (For example, if $1,000 in import duties are eligible for drawback less 1 percent ($10), the amount claimed on the drawback entry should be for $990.) Claims exceeding 99 percent (or 100% when 100% of the duty is available for drawback) will not be paid until the calculations have been corrected by the claimant. Claims for less than 99 percent (or 100% when 100% of the duty is available for drawback) will be paid as filed, unless the claimant amends the claim in accordance with § 190.52(c). The amount of duties, taxes, and fees eligible for drawback is determined by whether a claim is based upon direct identification or substitution, as provided for below:

      (i)  The amounts eligible for drawback for a unit of merchandise consists of those duties, taxes, and fees that were paid for that unit of the designated imported merchandise. This may be the amount of duties, taxes, and fees actually tendered on that unit or those attributable to that unit, if identified pursuant to an approved accounting method ( 19 CFR 190.14).

      (ii)  The amount of duties, taxes, and fees eligible for drawback pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 1313(b) or 19 U.S.C. 1313(j)(2) is determined by per unit averaging, as defined in § 190.2. The amount that may be refunded is also subject to the limitations set forth in § 190.22(a)(1)(ii) (manufacturing claims) and § 190.32(b) (unused merchandise claims), as applicable.

      (2)  Where a drawback claimant requests a refund of a merchandise processing fee paid pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 58c(a)(9)(A), the claimant is required to correctly apportion the fee to that imported merchandise for which drawback is claimed when calculating the amount of drawback requested on the drawback entry. This is determined as follows:

      (i) Relative value ratio for each line item. The value of each line item of entered merchandise subject to a merchandise processing fee is calculated (to four decimal places) by dividing the value of the line item subject to the fee by the total value of entered merchandise subject to the fee. The result is the relative value ratio.

      (ii) Merchandise processing fee apportioned to each line item. To apportion the merchandise processing fee to each line item, the relative value ratio for each line item is multiplied by the merchandise processing fee paid.

      (iii) Amount of merchandise processing fee eligible for drawback per line item. The amount of merchandise processing fee apportioned to each line item is multiplied by 99 percent to calculate that portion of the fee attributable to each line item that is eligible for drawback.

      (iv) Amount of merchandise processing fee eligible for drawback per unit of merchandise. To calculate the amount of a merchandise processing fee eligible for drawback per unit of merchandise, the line item amount that is eligible for drawback is divided by the number of units covered by that line item (to two decimal places).

      (v) Limitation on amount of merchandise processing fee eligible for drawback for substitution claims. The amount of a merchandise processing fee eligible for drawback per unit of merchandise for drawback claims based upon substitution is subject to the limitations set forth in §§ 190.22(a)(1)(ii) (manufacturing claims) and 190.32(b) (unused merchandise claims), as applicable.

      (3) —(i)  Where a drawback claimant requests a refund of any other duties, taxes, and fees allowable in accordance with § 190.3, the claimant is required to accurately calculate (including apportionment using per unit averaging or inventory management methods, as appropriate) the duties, taxes, and fees attributable to the designated imported merchandise for which drawback is being claimed when calculating the amount of drawback requested on the drawback entry (generally 99% of the duties, taxes, and fees paid on the imported merchandise).

      (ii)  As illustrated in the examples in this paragraph, in the case of customs duties, the type of calculation required to determine the amount of duties available for refund (generally 99% of the duties paid on the imported merchandise) will vary depending on whether the duty involved is ad valorem, specific, or compound.

      (4)  The amount of duties, taxes, and fees eligible for drawback per unit of merchandise for drawback claims based upon substituted merchandise is subject to the limitations set forth in § 190.22(a)(1)(ii) (manufacturing claims) and § 190.32(b) (unused merchandise claims), as applicable.

      (c) (—(1)  Drawback claimants are required to provide, on all drawback claims they submit, the 10-digit HTSUS classification or the Schedule B commodity number(_s)_, for the following:

      (i)  For imported merchandise designated on drawback claims, the HTSUS classification applicable at the time of entry (e.g., as required to be reported on the applicable entry summary(s) and other entry documentation).

      (ii)  For merchandise substituted on manufacturing drawback claims, and consistent with the applicable general manufacturing drawback ruling or the specific manufacturing drawback ruling, the applicable HTSUS classification numbers must be the same as either—

      (A) If the substituted merchandise was imported, the HTSUS classification applicable at the time of entry (e.g., as required to be reported on the applicable entry summary(s) and other entry documentation); or,

      (B) If the substituted merchandise was not imported, the HTSUS classification that would have been reported to CBP for the applicable entry summary(s) and other entry documentation, for the domestically produced substituted merchandise, at the time of entry of the designated imported merchandise.

      (iii)  For exported merchandise or articles, the HTSUS classification or Schedule B commodity number(s) must be from the Electronic Export Information (EEI), when required. If no EEI is required ( 15 CFR part 30 subpart D for a complete list of exemptions), then the claimant must provide the Schedule B commodity number(s) or HTSUS number(s) that the exporter would have set forth on the EEI when the exportation took place, but for the exemption from the requirement for an EEI.

      (iv)  For destroyed merchandise or articles, the HTSUS classification or Schedule B commodity number(s) must be reported, subject to the following:

      (A) if the HTSUS classification is reported, then it must be the HTSUS classification that would have been applicable to the destroyed merchandise or articles if they had been entered for consumption at the time of destruction; or

      (B) if the Schedule B commodity number is reported, then it must be the Schedule B commodity number that would have been reported for the destroyed merchandise or articles if the EEI had been required for an exportation at the time of destruction.

      (2)  If the 10-digit HTSUS classification or the Schedule B commodity number(s) reported to CBP for the drawback claim are determined to be incorrect or otherwise in controversy after the filing of the drawback entry, then the claimant must notify the drawback office where the drawback claim was filed of the correct HTSUS classification or Schedule B commodity number or the nature of the controversy before the liquidation of the drawback entry.

      (d)  All drawback claims must be submitted through a CBP-authorized system.

      (e) —(1)  A complete drawback claim is timely filed if it is successfully transmitted not later than 5 years after the date on which the merchandise designated as the basis for the drawback claim was imported and in compliance with all other applicable deadlines under this part.

      (i)  The official date of filing is the date upon which CBP receives a complete claim, as provided in paragraph (a) of this section, via transmission through a CBP-authorized system, including the uploading of all required supporting documentation.

      (ii)  Claims not completed within the 5-year period after the date on which the merchandise designated as the basis for the drawback claim was imported will be considered abandoned. Except as provided in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, no extension will be granted unless it is established that CBP was responsible for the untimely filing.

      (iii)  For substitution claims, the exportation or destruction of merchandise shall not have preceded the date of importation of the designated imported merchandise, and/or the exportation or destruction of merchandise shall not otherwise be outside of the timeframes specified in 19 U.S.C. 1313(c)(2)(C) and 19 U.S.C. 1313(p)(2), if applicable.

      (2)  The 5-year period for filing a complete drawback claim provided for in paragraph (e)(1) of this section may be extended for a period not to exceed 18 months if:

      (i) The claimant establishes to the satisfaction of CBP that the claimant was unable to file the drawback claim because of an event declared by the President to be a major disaster, within the meaning given to that term in 42 U.S.C. 5122(2), on or after January 1, 1994; and

      (ii) The claimant files a request for such extension with CBP no later than 1 year from the last day of the 5-year period referred to in paragraph (e)(1) of this section.

      (3)  If an extension is granted with respect to a request filed under paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section, the periods of time for retaining records under 19 U.S.C. 1508(c)(3) will be extended for an additional 18 months.

      § 190.52   Rejecting, perfecting or amending claims.

#### § § 190.52

      (a)  Upon review of a drawback claim when transmitted in ACE, if the claim is determined to be incomplete ( § 190.51(a)(1)) or untimely ( § 190.51(e)), the claim will be rejected and CBP will notify the filer. The filer will then have the opportunity to complete the claim subject to the requirement for filing a complete claim within 5 years of the date of importation of the merchandise designated as the basis for the drawback claim (or within 3 years after the date of exportation of the articles upon which drawback is claimed for drawback pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 1313(d)). If it is later determined by CBP, subsequent to acceptance of the claim and upon further review, that the claim was incomplete or untimely, then it may be denied.

      (b)  If CBP determines that the claim is complete according to the requirements of § 190.51(a)(1), but that additional evidence or information is required, CBP will notify the filer. The claimant must furnish, or have the appropriate party furnish, the evidence or information requested within 30 days of the date of notification by CBP. CBP may extend this 30-day period if the claimant files a written request for such extension within the 30-day period and provides good cause. The evidence or information required under this paragraph may be filed more than 5 years after the date of importation of the merchandise designated as the basis for the drawback claim (or within 3 years after the date of exportation of the articles upon which drawback is claimed for drawback pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 1313(d)). Such additional evidence or information may include, but is not limited to:

      (1) Records or other documentary evidence of exportation, as provided for in § 190.72, which shows that the articles were shipped by the person filing the drawback entry, or a letter of endorsement from the exporter which must be attached to such records or other documentary evidence, showing that the party filing the entry is authorized to claim drawback and receive payment (the claimant must have on file and make available to CBP upon request, the endorsement from the exporter assigning the right to claim drawback);

      (2) A copy of the import entry and invoice annotated for the merchandise identified or designated;

      (3) A copy of the export invoice annotated to indicate the items on which drawback is being claimed; and

      (4) Records documenting the transfer of the merchandise including records kept in the normal course of business upon which the claim is based ( § 190.10).

      (c)  Amendments to claims for which the drawback entries have not been liquidated must be made within 5 years of the date of importation of the merchandise designated as the basis for the drawback claim. Liquidated drawback entries may not be amended; however, they may be protested as provided for in § 190.84 and part 174 of this chapter.

      § 190.53   Restructuring of claims.

#### § § 190.53

      (a)  CBP may require claimants to restructure their drawback claims in such a manner as to foster administrative efficiency. In making this determination, CBP will consider the following factors:

      (1) The number of transactions of the claimant (imports and exports);

      (2) The value of the claims;

      (3) The frequency of claims;

      (4) The product or products being claimed; and

      (5) For 19 U.S.C. 1313(a) and 1313(b) claims, the provisions, as applicable, of the general manufacturing drawback ruling or the specific manufacturing drawback ruling.

      (b)  In order to be exempt from a restructuring, a claimant must demonstrate an inability or impracticability in restructuring its claims as required by CBP and must provide a mutually acceptable alternative. Criteria used in such determination will include a demonstration by the claimant of one or more of the following:

      (1) Complexities caused by multiple commodities or the applicable general manufacturing drawback ruling or the specific manufacturing drawback ruling;

      (2) Variable and conflicting manufacturing and inventory periods (for example, financial, accounting and manufacturing records maintained are significantly different);

      (3) Complexities caused by multiple manufacturing locations;

      (4) Complexities caused by difficulty in adjusting accounting and inventory records (for example, records maintained—financial or accounting—are significantly different); and/or

      (5) Complexities caused by significantly different methods of operation.

    Subpart F—Verification of Claims

      § 190.61   Verification of drawback claims.

#### § § 190.61

      (a)  All claims are subject to verification by CBP.

      (b)  CBP personnel will verify compliance with the law and this part, the accuracy of the related general manufacturing drawback ruling or specific manufacturing drawback ruling (as applicable), and the selected drawback claims. Verification may include an examination of all records relating to the transaction(s).

      (c)  When a claim has been selected for verification, liquidation will be postponed only on the drawback entry for the claim selected for verification. Postponement will continue in effect until the verification has been completed and a report is issued, subject to the limitation in 19 CFR 159.12(f). In the event that a substantial error is revealed during the verification, CBP may postpone liquidation of all related product line claims, or, in CBP's discretion, all claims made by that claimant.

      (d) —(1)  If verification of a drawback claim filed under a specific manufacturing drawback ruling ( § 190.8) reveals errors or deficiencies in the drawback ruling or application therefor, the verifying CBP official will promptly inform CBP Headquarters (Attention: Entry Process and Duty Refunds Branch, Regulations and Rulings, Office of Trade).

      (2)  If verification of a drawback claim filed under a general manufacturing drawback ruling ( § 190.7) reveals errors or deficiencies in a general manufacturing drawback ruling, the letter of notification of intent to operate under the general manufacturing drawback ruling, or the acknowledgment of the letter of notification of intent, the verifying CBP official will promptly inform CBP Headquarters (Attention: Entry Process and Duty Refunds Branch, Regulations and Rulings, Office of Trade).

      (3)  CBP Headquarters will review the stated errors or deficiencies and take appropriate action ( 19 U.S.C. 1625; 19 CFR part 177).

      § 190.62   Penalties.

#### § § 190.62

      (a)  Any person who knowingly and willfully files any false or fraudulent entry or claim for the payment of drawback upon the exportation or destruction of merchandise or knowingly or willfully makes or files any false document for the purpose of securing the payment to himself or others of any drawback on the exportation or destruction of merchandise greater than that legally due, will be subject to the criminal provisions of 18 U.S.C. 550, 1001, or any other appropriate criminal sanctions.

      (b)  Any person who seeks, induces or affects the payment of drawback, by fraud or negligence, or attempts to do so, is subject to civil penalties, as provided under 19 U.S.C. 1593a. A fraudulent violation is subject to a maximum administrative penalty of 3 times the total actual or potential loss of revenue. Repetitive negligent violations are subject to a maximum penalty equal to the actual or potential loss of revenue.

      § 190.63   Liability for drawback claims.

#### § § 190.63

      (a)  Any person making a claim for drawback will be liable for the full amount of the drawback claimed.

      (b)  An importer will be liable for any drawback claim made by another person with respect to merchandise imported by the importer in an amount equal to the lesser of:

      (1) The amount of duties, taxes, and fees that the person claimed with respect to the imported merchandise; or

      (2) The amount of duties, taxes, and fees that the importer authorized the other person to claim with respect to the imported merchandise.

      (c)  Persons described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section will be jointly and severally liable for the amount described in paragraph (b).

    Subpart G—Exportation and Destruction

      § 190.71   Drawback on articles destroyed under CBP supervision.

#### § § 190.71

      (a)  At least 7 working days before the intended date of destruction of merchandise or articles upon which drawback is intended to be claimed, a Notice of Intent to Export, Destroy, or Return Merchandise for Purposes of Drawback on CBP Form 7553 must be filed by the claimant with the CBP port where the destruction is to take place, giving notification of the date and specific location where the destruction is to occur. Within 4 working days after receipt of the CBP Form 7553, CBP will advise the filer in writing of its determination to witness or not to witness the destruction. If the filer of the notice is not so notified within 4 working days, the merchandise may be destroyed without delay and will be deemed to have been destroyed under CBP supervision. Unless CBP determines to witness the destruction, the destruction of the articles following timely notification on CBP Form 7553 will be deemed to have occurred under CBP supervision. If CBP attends the destruction, CBP will certify on CBP Form 7553.

      (b)  When CBP does not attend the destruction, the claimant must submit evidence that destruction took place in accordance with the Notice of Intent to Export, Destroy, or Return Merchandise for Purposes of Drawback on CBP Form 7553. The evidence must be issued by a disinterested third party (for example, a landfill operator). The type of evidence depends on the method and place of destruction, but must establish that the merchandise was, in fact, destroyed within the meaning of “destruction” in § 190.2.

      (c)  After destruction, the claimant must provide CBP Form 7553, certified by the CBP official witnessing the destruction in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section, to CBP as part of the complete drawback claim based on the destruction ( § 190.51(a)). If CBP has not attended the destruction, the claimant must provide the evidence that destruction took place in accordance with the approved CBP Form 7553, as provided for in paragraph (b) of this section, as part of the complete drawback claim based on the destruction ( § 190.51(a)).

      (d)  Under 19 U.S.C. 1313(x), a destruction may include a process by which materials are recovered from imported merchandise or from an article manufactured from imported merchandise for drawback claims made pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 1313(a), (b), (c), and (j). In determining the amount of duties to be refunded as drawback to a claimant, the value of recovered materials (including the value of any tax benefit or royalty payment) that accrues to the drawback claimant must be deducted from the value of the imported merchandise that is destroyed, or from the value of the merchandise used, or designated as used, in the manufacture of the article.

      § 190.72   Proof of exportation.

#### § § 190.72

      (a)  Proof of exportation of articles for drawback purposes must establish fully the date and fact of exportation and the identity of the exporter by providing the following summary data as part of a complete claim ( § 190.51) (in addition to providing prior notice of intent to export if applicable):

      (1) Date of export;

      (2) Name of exporter;

      (3) Description of the goods;

      (4) Quantity and unit of measure;

      (5) Schedule B number or HTSUS number; and

      (6) Country of ultimate destination.

      (b)  The documents for establishing exportation (which may be records kept in the normal course of business) include, but are not limited to:

      (1) Records or other documentary evidence of exportation (originals or copies) issued by the exporting carrier, such as a bill of lading, air waybill, freight waybill, Canadian Customs manifest, and/or cargo manifest;

      (2) Records from a CBP-approved electronic export system of the United States Government (§ 190.73);

      (3) Official postal records (originals or copies) which evidence exportation by mail (§ 190.74);

      (4) Notice of lading for supplies on certain vessels or aircraft (§ 190.112); or

      (5) Notice of transfer for articles manufactured or produced in the United States which are transferred to a foreign trade zone (§ 190.183).

      § 190.73   Electronic proof of exportation.

#### § § 190.73

      Records kept through an electronic export system of the United States Government may be presented as actual proof of exportation only if CBP has officially approved the use of that electronic export system as proof of compliance for drawback claims. Official approval will be published as a general notice in the Customs Bulletin.

      § 190.74   Exportation by mail.

#### § § 190.74

      If the merchandise on which drawback is to be claimed is exported by mail or parcel post, the official postal records (original or copies) which describe the mail shipment will be sufficient to prove exportation. The postal record must be identified on the drawback entry, and must be retained by the claimant in their records and made available to CBP upon request ( § 190.51(a)).

      § 190.75   Exportation by the Government.

#### § § 190.75

      (a)  When a department, branch, agency, or instrumentality of the U.S. Government exports products with the intention of claiming drawback, it may establish the exportation in the manner provided in § 190.72 ( § 190.4).

      (b)  When a supplier of merchandise to the Government or any of the parties specified in § 190.82 claims drawback, exportation must be established under § 190.72.

      § 190.76   [Reserved]

#### § § 190.76

    Subpart H—Liquidation and Protest of Drawback Entries

      § 190.81   Liquidation.

#### § § 190.81

      (a)  Drawback entries may be liquidated after:

      (1) Liquidation of the designated import entry or entries becomes final pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section; or

      (2) Deposit of estimated duties on the imported merchandise and before liquidation of the designated import entry or entries.

      (b)  (1) Drawback may be paid upon liquidation of a claim based on estimated duties if one or more of the designated import entries have not been liquidated, or the liquidation has not become final (because of a protest being filed) ( also § 173.4(c) of this chapter), only if the drawback claimant and any other party responsible for the payment of liquidated import duties each files a written request for payment of each drawback claim, waiving any right to payment or refund under other provisions of law, to the extent that the estimated duties on the unliquidated import entry are included in the drawback claim for which drawback on estimated duties is requested under this paragraph. The drawback claimant must, to the best of its knowledge, identify each import entry that has been protested and that is included in the drawback claim. A drawback entry, once finally liquidated on the basis of estimated duties pursuant to paragraph (e)(2) of this section, will not be adjusted by reason of a subsequent final liquidation of the import entry.

      (2) However, if final liquidation of the import entry discloses that the total amount of import duty is different from the total estimated duties deposited, except in those cases when drawback is 100% of the duty, the party responsible for the payment of liquidated duties, as applicable, will:

      (i) Be liable for 1 percent of all increased duties found to be due on that portion of merchandise recorded on the drawback entry; or

      (ii) Be entitled to a refund of 1 percent of all excess duties found to have been paid as estimated duties on that portion of the merchandise recorded on the drawback entry.

      (c) —(1)  Subject to the requirements in paragraph (2) of this section, drawback may be paid upon liquidation of a claim based on voluntary tenders of the unpaid amount of lawful ordinary customs duties or any other payment of lawful ordinary customs duties for an entry, or withdrawal from warehouse, for consumption ( § 190.3(a)(1)(iii)), provided that:

      (i) The tender or payment is specifically identified as duty on a specifically identified entry, or withdrawal from warehouse, for consumption;

      (ii) Liquidation of the specifically identified entry, or withdrawal from warehouse, for consumption became final prior to such tender or payment; and

      (iii) Liquidation of the drawback entry in which that specifically identified import entry, or withdrawal from warehouse, for consumption is designated has not become final.

      (2)  Drawback may be paid on claims based on voluntary tenders or other payments of duties under this subsection only if the drawback claimant and any other party responsible for the payment of the voluntary tenders or other payments of duties each files a written request for payment of each drawback claim based on such voluntary tenders or other payments of duties, waiving any claim to payment or refund under other provisions of law, to the extent that the voluntary tenders or other payment of duties under this paragraph are included in the drawback claim for which drawback on the voluntary tenders or other payment of duties is requested under this paragraph.

      (d)  Drawback will be based on the final liquidated duties paid that have been made final by operation of law (except in the case of the written request for payment of drawback on the basis of estimated duties, voluntary tender of duties, and other payments of duty, and waiver, provided for in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section).

      (e)  (1)  When the drawback claim has been completed by the filing of the entry and other required documents, and exportation (or destruction) of the merchandise or articles has been established, CBP will determine drawback due on the basis of the complete drawback claim, the applicable general manufacturing drawback ruling or specific manufacturing drawback ruling, and any other relevant evidence or information. Notice of liquidation will be given electronically as provided in §§ 159.9 and 159.10(c)(3) of this chapter.

      (2)  (i)  A drawback claim that satisfies the requirements of paragraph (d) that is not liquidated within 1 year from the date of the drawback claim ( § 190.51(e)(1)(i)) will be deemed liquidated for the purpose of the drawback claim at the drawback amount asserted by the claimant or claim, unless the time for liquidation is extended in accordance with § 159.12 or if liquidation is suspended as required by statute or court order.

      (ii)  A drawback claim that satisfies the requirements of paragraphs (b) or (c) of this section will be deemed liquidated upon the deposit of estimated duties on the unliquidated imported merchandise ( § 190.81(b)).

      (f) —(1)  Where two or more products result from the manufacture or production of merchandise, drawback will be distributed to the several products in accordance with their relative values at the time of separation.

      (2)  The values to be used in computing the distribution of drawback where two or more products result from the manufacture or production of merchandise under drawback conditions must be the market value (as provided for in the definition of relative value in § 190.2), unless other values are approved by CBP.

      (g)  CBP will authorize the amount of the refund due as drawback to the claimant.

      § 190.82   Person entitled to claim drawback.

#### § § 190.82

      Unless otherwise provided in this part ( §§ 190.42(b), 190.162, 190.175(a), 190.186), the exporter (or destroyer) will be entitled to claim drawback, unless the exporter (or destroyer), by means of a certification, waives the right to claim drawback and assigns such right to the manufacturer, producer, importer, or intermediate party (in the case of drawback under 19 U.S.C. 1313(j)(1) and (2), _see_ § 190.33(a) and (b)). Such certification must also affirm that the exporter (or destroyer) has not assigned and will not assign the right to claim drawback on the particular exportation or destruction to any other party. The certification provided for in this section may be a blanket certification for a stated period.

      § 190.83   Person entitled to receive payment.

#### § § 190.83

      Drawback is paid to the claimant ( § 190.82).

      § 190.84   Protests.

#### § § 190.84

      Procedures to protest the denial, in whole or in part, of a drawback entry must be in accordance with part 174 of this chapter (19 CFR part 174).

    Subpart I—Waiver of Prior Notice of Intent To Export or Destroy; Accelerated Payment of Drawback

CBP will provide written notice, by registered or certified mail, of such a stay to the person for whom waiver of prior notice was approved. CBP will specify the reason(s) for the stay in such written notice. The stay will take effect 2 working days after the date the person signs the return post office receipt for the registered or certified mail. The stay will remain in effect for the period specified in the written notice, or until such earlier date as CBP notifies the person for whom waiver of prior notice was approved in writing that the reason for the stay has been satisfied. After the stay is lifted, operation under the waiver of prior notice procedure may resume for exports on or after the date the stay is lifted.

      (e)  CBP may propose to revoke the approval of an application for waiver of prior notice of intent to export or destroy, under this section, for good cause (such as, noncompliance with the drawback law and/or regulations). CBP will give written notice of the proposed revocation of a waiver of prior notice of intent to export or destroy.

      (f)  Action by the drawback office to approve, deny, stay, or revoke waiver of prior notice of intent to export or destroy, unless reversed by CBP Headquarters, will govern the applicant's eligibility for this procedure in all CBP drawback offices. If the application for waiver of prior notice of intent to export or destroy is approved, the claimant must refer to such approval in the first drawback claim filed after such approval in the drawback office approving waiver of prior notice and must submit a copy of the approval letter with the first drawback claim filed in any drawback office other than the approving office, when the export or destruction upon which the claim is based was without prior notice, under this section.

The approval of accelerated payment of drawback will terminate at the end of such 1-year period unless the successor applies for accelerated payment of drawback under this section. If such successor applies for accelerated payment of drawback under this section within such 1-year period, the successor may continue to operate under the predecessor's approval of accelerated payment until CBP approves or denies the successor's application for accelerated payment under this section, subject to the provisions in this section ( in particular, paragraph (f) of this section).

      (4)  With the application, the applicant must submit a description (with sample documents) of how the applicant will ensure compliance with its certification that the statutory and regulatory drawback requirements will be met. This description may be in the form of a booklet. The detail contained in this description should vary depending on the size and complexity of the applicant's accelerated drawback program (for example, if the dollar amount is great and there are several kinds of drawback involved, with differing inventory, manufacturing, and shipping methods, greater detail in the description will be required).

      (d)  If approved for accelerated payment, the claimant must furnish a properly executed bond in an amount sufficient to cover the estimated amount of drawback to be claimed during the term of the bond. If outstanding accelerated drawback claims exceed the amount of the bond, the drawback office will require additional bond coverage as necessary before additional accelerated payments are made.

      (e) —(1)  The drawback office will review and verify the information submitted in and with the application. In order for CBP to evaluate the application, CBP may request additional information (including additional sample documents) and/or explanations of any of the information provided for in paragraph (b)(4) of this section. Based on the information submitted on and with the application and any information so requested, and based on the applicant's record of transactions with CBP, the drawback office will approve or deny the application. The criteria to be considered in reviewing the applicant's record with CBP include, but are not limited to (as applicable):

      (4)  If an application for accelerated payment of drawback under this section is denied, the applicant will be given written notice, specifying the grounds therefor, together with what corrective action may be taken, and informing the applicant that the denial may be appealed in the manner prescribed in paragraph (i) of this section. The applicant may not reapply for accelerated payment of drawback until the reason for the denial is resolved.

      (f)  CBP may propose to revoke the approval of an application for accelerated payment of drawback under this section, for good cause (such as, noncompliance with the drawback law and/or regulations). In case of such proposed revocation, CBP will give written notice, by registered or certified mail, of the proposed revocation of the approval of accelerated payment. The notice will specify the reasons for CBP's proposed action and the procedures for challenging CBP's proposed revocation action as prescribed in paragraph (h) of this section. The revocation will take effect 30 days after the date of the proposed revocation if not timely challenged under paragraph (h) of this section. If timely challenged, the revocation will take effect after completion of the challenge procedures in paragraph (h) of this section unless the challenge is successful.

    Subpart S—Drawback Compliance Program

      § 190.191   Purpose.

#### § § 190.191

      This subpart sets forth the requirements for the drawback compliance program in which claimants and other parties in interest, including customs brokers, may participate after being certified by CBP. Participation in the program is voluntary. Under the program, CBP is required to inform potential drawback claimants and related parties clearly about their rights and obligations under the drawback law and regulations. Reduced penalties and/or warning letters may be issued once a party has been certified for the program, and is in general compliance with the appropriate procedures and requirements thereof.

      § 190.192   Certification for compliance program.

#### § § 190.192

      (a)  A party may be certified as a participant in the drawback compliance program after meeting the core requirements established under the program, or after negotiating an alternative drawback compliance program suited to the needs of both the party and CBP. Certification requirements will take into account the size and nature of the party's drawback program, the type of drawback claims filed, and the volume of claims filed. Whether the party is a drawback claimant, a broker, or one that provides data and documentation on which a drawback claim is based, will also be considered.

      (b)  In order to be certified as a participant in the drawback compliance program or negotiated alternative drawback compliance program, the party must demonstrate that it:

      (c)  A customs broker may be certified as a participant in the drawback compliance program only on behalf of a given claimant ( § 190.194(b)). To do so, a customs broker who assists a claimant in filing for drawback must be able to demonstrate, for and on behalf of such claimant, conformity with the core requirements of the drawback compliance program as set forth in paragraph (b) of this section. The broker must ensure that the claimant has the necessary documentation and records to support the drawback compliance program established on its behalf, and that claims to be filed under the program are reviewed by the broker for accuracy and completeness.

Based on the information submitted on and with the application and any information so requested, and based on the applicant's record of transactions with CBP, the drawback office will approve or deny the application.

The drawback office will give written notification to an applicant of its certification as a participant in the drawback compliance program. A customs broker obtaining certification for a drawback claimant will be sent written notification on behalf of such claimant, with a copy of the notification also being sent to the claimant.

      (c)  When a party that has been certified as a participant in the drawback compliance program and is generally in compliance with the appropriate procedures and requirements of the program commits a violation of 19 U.S.C. 1593a(a) ( § 190.62(b)), CBP will, in the absence of fraud or repeated violations, and in lieu of a monetary penalty as otherwise provided under section 1593a, issue a written notice of the violation to the party. Repeated violations by a participant, including a customs broker, may result in the issuance of penalties and the removal of certification under the program until corrective action, satisfactory to CBP, is taken.

      (d)  If certification as a participant in the drawback compliance program is denied, the applicant will be given written notice by the drawback office, specifying the grounds for such denial, together with any action that may be taken to correct the perceived deficiencies, and informing the applicant that such denial may be appealed to the drawback office that issued the notice of denial and then appealed to CBP Headquarters.

      (2)  If CBP determines that the certification of a program participant should be removed, the drawback office will send the program participant a written notice of the removal. Such notice will inform the program participant of the grounds for the removal and will advise the program participant of its right to file an appeal of the removal in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section.

      (3)  The removal of certification will be effective immediately in cases of willfulness on the part of the program participant or when required by public health, interest, or safety. In all other cases, the removal of certification will be effective when the program participant has received notice under paragraph (e)(2) of this section and either no appeal has been filed within the time limit prescribed in paragraph (f)(2) of this section or all appeal procedures have been concluded by a decision that upholds the removal action. Removal of certification may subject the affected person to penalties.

      (f) —(1)  A party may challenge a denial of an application for certification as a participant in the drawback compliance program by filing a written appeal, within 30 days of issuance of the notice of denial, with the drawback office.

      § 191.7   General manufacturing drawback ruling.

#### § § 191.7

      (a)  General manufacturing drawback rulings are designed to simplify drawback for certain common manufacturing operations but do not preclude or limit the use of applications for specific manufacturing drawback rulings (see § 191.8). A manufacturer or producer engaged in an operation that falls within a published general manufacturing drawback ruling may submit a letter of notification of intent to operate under that general ruling. Where a separately-incorporated subsidiary of a parent corporation is engaged in manufacture or production for drawback, the subsidiary is the proper party to submit the letter of notification, and cannot operate under a letter of notification submitted by the parent corporation.

      (b) —(1)  General manufacturing drawback rulings are contained in appendix A to this part. As deemed necessary by Customs, new general manufacturing drawback rulings will be issued as Treasury Decisions and added to the appendix thereafter.

      (2) —(i)  Letters of notification of intent to operate under a general manufacturing drawback ruling shall be submitted to any drawback office where drawback entries will be filed and liquidated, provided that the general manufacturing drawback ruling will be followed without variation. If there is any variation in the general manufacturing drawback ruling, the manufacturer or producer shall apply for a specific manufacturing drawback ruling under § 191.8 of this subpart.

      (ii)  Letters of notification of intent shall be submitted in duplicate unless claims are to be filed at more than one drawback office, in which case one additional copy of the letter of notification shall be filed for each additional office. Upon issuance of a letter of acknowledgment (paragraph (c)(1) of this section), the drawback office with which the letter of notification is submitted shall forward the additional copy to such additional office(s), with a copy of the letter of acknowledgment.

      (3)  Each manufacturer or producer submitting a letter of notification of intent to operate under a general manufacturing drawback ruling under this section must provide the following specific detailed information:

      (i) Name and address of manufacturer or producer (if the manufacturer or producer is a separately-incorporated subsidiary of a corporation, the subsidiary corporation must submit a letter of notification in its own name);

      (ii) In the case of a business entity, the names of the persons listed in § 191.6(a)(1) through (6) who will sign drawback documents;

      (iii) Locations of the factories which will operate under the letter of notification;

      (v) Description of the merchandise and articles, unless specifically described in the general manufacturing drawback ruling;

      (vi) Description of the manufacturing or production process, unless specifically described in the general manufacturing drawback ruling;

      (vii) Basis of claim used for calculating drawback; and

      (viii) IRS (Internal Revenue Service) number (with suffix) of the manufacturer or producer.

      (c)  The drawback office to which the letter of notification of intent to operate under a general manufacturing drawback ruling was submitted shall review the letter of notification of intent.

      (1)  The drawback office shall promptly issue a letter of acknowledgment, acknowledging receipt of the letter of intent and authorizing the person to operate under the identified general manufacturing drawback ruling, subject to the requirements and conditions of that general manufacturing drawback ruling and the law and regulations, to the person who submitted the letter of notification if:

      (i) The letter of notification is complete ( containing the information required in paragraph (b)(3) of this section);

      (ii) The general manufacturing drawback ruling identified by the manufacturer or producer is applicable to the manufacturing or production process;

      (iii) The general manufacturing drawback ruling identified by the manufacturer or producer is followed without variation; and

      (iv) The described manufacturing or production process is a manufacture or production under § 191.2(q) of this subpart.

      (2)  With the letter of acknowledgment the drawback office shall include the unique computer-generated number assigned to the acknowledgment of the letter of notification of intent to operate. This number must be stated when the person files manufacturing drawback claims with Customs under the general manufacturing drawback ruling.

      (3)  If the letter of notification of intent to operate does not meet the requirements of paragraph (c)(1) of this section in any respect, the drawback office shall promptly and in writing specifically advise the person of this fact and why this is so. A letter of notification of intent to operate which is not acknowledged may be resubmitted to the drawback office with which it was initially submitted with modifications and/or explanations addressing the reasons given for non-acknowledgment, or the matter may be referred (by letter from the manufacturer or producer) to CBP Headquarters (Attention: Entry Process and Duty Refunds Branch, Regulations and Rulings, Office of International Trade).

      (d)  Acknowledged letters of notification under this section shall remain in effect under the same terms as provided for in § 191.8(h) for specific manufacturing drawback rulings.

      § 191.8   Specific manufacturing drawback ruling.

#### § § 191.8

      (a)  Unless operating under a general manufacturing drawback ruling (see § 191.7), each manufacturer or producer of articles intended to be claimed for drawback shall apply for a specific manufacturing drawback ruling. Where a separately-incorporated subsidiary of a parent corporation is engaged in manufacture or production for drawback, the subsidiary is the proper party to apply for a specific manufacturing drawback ruling, and cannot operate under any specific manufacturing drawback ruling approved in favor of the parent corporation.

      (b)  Sample formats for applications for specific manufacturing drawback rulings are contained in appendix B to this part.

      (c)  The application of each manufacturer or producer shall include the following information as applicable:

      (7) Description of the exported article;

      (8) Basis of claim for calculating manufacturing drawback;

      (9) Summary of the records kept to support claims for drawback; and

If drawback claims are to be filed under the ruling at more than one drawback office, one additional copy of the application shall be filed with CBP Headquarters for each additional office.

      (e)  CBP Headquarters shall review the application for a specific manufacturing drawback ruling.

      (1)  If consistent with the drawback law and regulations, Customs Headquarters shall issue a letter of approval to the applicant and shall forward 1 copy of the application for the specific manufacturing drawback ruling to the appropriate drawback office(s) with a copy of the letter of approval. Synopses of approved specific manufacturing drawback rulings shall be published in the weekly Customs Bulletin with each synopsis being published under an identifying Treasury Decision (T.D.). Each specific manufacturing drawback ruling shall be assigned a unique computer-generated manufacturing number which shall be included in the letter of approval to the applicant from Customs Headquarters, shall appear in the published synopsis, and must be used when filing manufacturing drawback claims with Customs.

      (2)  If not consistent with the drawback law and regulations, CBP Headquarters shall promptly and in writing inform the applicant that the application cannot be approved and shall specifically advise the applicant why this is so. A disapproved application may be resubmitted with modifications and/or explanations addressing the reasons given for disapproval, or the disapproval may be appealed to CBP Headquarters (Attention: Director, Entry Process and Duty Refunds Branch, Regulations and Rulings, Office of International Trade).

      (f)  When an application for a specific manufacturing drawback ruling states that drawback is to be based upon a schedule filed by the manufacturer or producer, the schedule will be reviewed by Customs Headquarters. The application may include a request for authorization for the filing of supplemental schedules with the drawback office where claims are filed.

      (g) —(1)  Except as provided for limited modifications in paragraph (g)(2) of this section, a manufacturer or producer desiring to modify an existing specific manufacturing drawback ruling shall submit a supplemental application for such a ruling to CBP Headquarters (Attention: Entry Process and Duty Refunds Branch, Regulations and Rulings, Office of International Trade). Such a supplemental application may, at the discretion of the manufacturer or producer, be in the form of the original application, or it may identify the specific manufacturing drawback ruling to be modified (by T.D. number and unique computer-generated number) and include only those paragraphs of the application to be modified, with a statement that all other paragraphs are unchanged and are incorporated by reference in the supplemental application.

      (2)  (i) A supplemental application for a specific manufacturing drawback ruling shall be submitted to the drawback office(s) where claims are filed if the modifications are limited to:

      (A) The location of a factory, or the addition of one or more factories where the methods followed and records maintained are the same as those at another factory operating under the existing specific manufacturing drawback ruling of the manufacturer or producer;

      § 191.9   Agency.

#### § § 191.9

      (a)  An owner of the identified merchandise, the designated imported merchandise and/or the substituted other merchandise that is used to produce the exported articles may employ another person to do part, or all, of the manufacture or production under 19 U.S.C. 1313(a) or (b) and § 191.2(q) of this subpart. For purposes of this section, such owner is the principal and such other person is the agent. Under 19 U.S.C. 1313(b), the principal shall be treated as the manufacturer or producer of merchandise used in manufacture or production by the agent. The principal must be able to establish by its manufacturing records, the manufacturing records of its agent(s), or the manufacturing records of both (or all) parties, compliance with all requirements of this part (see, in particular, § 191.26 of this part).

      (b) —(1)  The manufacturer must establish that it is the principal in a contract between it and its agent who actually does the work on either the designated or substituted merchandise, or both, for the principal. The contract must include:

      (i) Terms of compensation to show that the relationship is an agency rather than a sale;

      (ii) How transfers of merchandise and articles will be recorded by the principal and its agent;

      (iii) The work to be performed on the merchandise by the agent for the principal;

      (iv) The degree of control that is to be exercised by the principal over the agent's performance of work;

      (v) The party who is to bear the risk of loss on the merchandise while it is in the agent's custody; and

      (vi) The period that the contract is in effect.

      (2)  The records of the principal and/or the agent must establish that the principal had legal and equitable title to the merchandise before receipt by the agent. The right of the agent to assert a lien on the merchandise for work performed does not derogate the principal's ownership interest under this section.

      (3)  The relationship between the principal and agent must not be that of a seller and buyer. If the parties' records show that, with respect to the merchandise that is the subject of the principal-agent contract, the merchandise is sold to the agent by the principal, or the articles manufactured by the agent are sold to the principal by the agent, those records are inadequate to establish existence of a principal-agency relationship under this section.

      (c) —(1)  An owner who intends to operate under the principal-agent procedures of this section must state that intent in any letter of notification of intent to operate under a general manufacturing drawback ruling filed under § 191.7 of this subpart or in any application for a specific manufacturing drawback ruling filed under § 191.8 of this subpart.

      (2)  Each agent operating under this section must have filed a letter of notification of intent to operate under a general manufacturing drawback ruling (see § 191.7), for an agent, covering the articles manufactured or produced, or have obtained a specific manufacturing drawback ruling (see § 191.8), as appropriate.

      (d) —(1)  Principals and agents operating under this section are not required to file a certificate of delivery (for the merchandise transferred from the principal to the agent) or a certificate of manufacture and delivery (for the articles transferred from the agent to the principal). The principal for whom processing is conducted under this section shall file, with any drawback claim or certificate of manufacture and delivery based on an article manufactured or produced under the principal-agent procedures in this section, a certificate, subject to the recordkeeping requirements of §§ 191.15 of this subpart and 191.26 of this part, certifying that upon request by Customs it can establish the following:

      (i) Quantity, kind and quality of merchandise transferred from the principal to the agent;

      (ii) Date of transfer of the merchandise from the principal to the agent;

      (iii) Date of manufacturing or production operations performed by the agent;

      (iv) Total quantity and description of merchandise appearing in or used in manufacturing or production operations performed by the agent;

      (v) Total quantity and description of articles produced in manufacturing or production operations performed by the agent;

      (vi) Quantity, kind and quality of articles transferred from the agent to the principal; and

      (vii) Date of transfer of the articles from the agent to the principal.

      (2)  The certificate required under paragraph (d)(1) of this section may be a blanket certificate for a particular kind and quality of merchandise for a stated period.

      § 191.10   Certificate of delivery.

#### § § 191.10

      (a)  A party who: imports and pays duty on imported merchandise; receives imported merchandise; in the case of 19 U.S.C. 1313(j)(2), receives imported merchandise, commercially interchangeable merchandise, or any combination of imported and commercially interchangeable merchandise; or receives an article manufactured or produced under 19 U.S.C. 1313(a) and/or (b): may transfer such merchandise or manufactured article to another party. The party shall record this transfer by preparing and issuing in favor of such other party a certificate of delivery, certified by the importer or other party through whose possession the merchandise or manufactured article passed (see paragraph (c) of this section). A certificate of delivery issued with respect to the delivered merchandise or article:

      (1) Documents the transfer of that merchandise or article;

      (2) Identifies such merchandise or article as being that to which a potential right to drawback exists; and

      (3) Assigns such right to the transferee (see § 191.82 of this part).

      (b)  The certificate of delivery must include the following information:

      (1) The party to whom the merchandise or articles are delivered;

      (2) Date of delivery;

      (3) Import entry number;

      (4) Quantity delivered;

      (5) Total duty paid on, or attributable to, the delivered merchandise;

      (7) Date of importation;

      (8) Port where import entry filed;

      (9) Person from whom received;

      (10) Description of the merchandise delivered;

      (11) The HTSUS number with a minimum of 6 digits, for the designated imported merchandise (such HTSUS number shall be from the entry summary and other entry documentation for the merchandise unless the issuer of the certificate of delivery received the merchandise under another certificate of delivery, or a certificate of manufacture and delivery, in which case such HTSUS number shall be from the other certificate); and

      (12) If the merchandise transferred is substituted for the designated imported merchandise under 19 U.S.C. 1313(j)(2), the HTSUS or Schedule B commodity number, with a minimum of 6 digits.

      (c) —(1)  If the imported merchandise was not delivered directly from the importer to the manufacturer, or from the importer to the exporter (or destroyer), each intermediate transfer of the imported merchandise shall be documented by means of a certificate of delivery issued in favor of the receiving party, and certified by the person through whose possession the merchandise passed.

      (2)  If the article manufactured or produced under 19 U.S.C. 1313 (a) or (b) is not delivered directly from the manufacturer to the exporter (or destroyer), each transfer after the transfer from the manufacturer (which shall be documented by means of a certificate of manufacture and delivery) shall be documented by means of a certificate of delivery, issued in favor of the receiving party, and certified by the person through whose possession the article passed.

      (d)  Records supporting the information required on the certificate(s) of delivery, as listed in paragraph (b) of this section, must be retained by the issuing party for 3 years from the date of payment of the related claim or longer period if required by law (see 19 U.S.C. 1508(c)(3)).

      (e)  The certificate of delivery shall be retained by the party to whom the merchandise or article covered by the certificate was delivered. Customs may request the certificate from the claimant for the drawback claim based upon the certificate (see §§ 191.51, 191.52). If the certificate is requested by Customs, but is not provided by the claimant, the part of the drawback claim dependent on that certificate will be denied.

      (f)  The person in whose name merchandise is withdrawn from a bonded warehouse shall be considered the importer for drawback purposes. No certificate of delivery is required covering prior transfers of merchandise while in a bonded warehouse.

      (a)  To comply with §§ 191.21 and 191.22 of this part, the use of domestic merchandise taken in exchange for imported merchandise of the same kind and quality (as defined in § 191.2(x)(1) of this part for purposes of 19 U.S.C. 1313(b)) shall be treated as use of the imported merchandise if no certificate of delivery is issued covering the transfer of the imported merchandise. This provision shall be known as tradeoff and is authorized by § 313(k) of the Act, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1313(k)).

      (b)  Tradeoff must occur between two separate legal entities but it is not necessary that the entity exchanging the imported merchandise be the importer thereof. In addition, tradeoff must consist of an exchange of same kind and quality merchandise and nothing else (the exchange may be of different quantities of same kind and quality merchandise, but may not involve the payment or receipt of cash payments or other than same kind and quality merchandise). If the quantities of merchandise exchanged are different, the lesser quantity shall be the quantity available for drawback. If the quantity of domestic merchandise received is greater than the quantity of imported merchandise exchanged, the merchandise identified for drawback shall be the portion of the domestic merchandise equal to the quantity of imported merchandise which is first received.

      (c)  Each would-be user of tradeoff, except those operating under an approved specific manufacturing drawback ruling covering substitution, must apply to the Entry Process and Duty Refunds Branch, Regulations and Rulings, Office of International Trade, CBP Headquarters, for a determination of whether the imported and domestic merchandise are of the same kind and quality. For those users manufacturing under substitution drawback, this request should be contained in the application for a specific manufacturing drawback ruling (§ 191.8). For those users manufacturing under a general manufacturing drawback ruling (§ 191.7), the request should be made by a separate letter.

      § 191.14   Identification of merchandise or articles by accounting method.

#### § § 191.14

      (a)  This section provides for the identification of merchandise or articles for drawback purposes by the use of accounting methods. This section applies to identification of merchandise or articles in inventory or storage, as well as identification of merchandise used in manufacture or production (see § 191.2(h) of this subpart). This section is not applicable to situations in which the drawback law authorizes substitution (substitution is allowed in specified situations under 19 U.S.C. 1313(b), 1313(j)(2), 1313(k), and 1313(p); this section does apply to situations in these subsections in which substitution is not allowed, as well as to the subsections of the drawback law under which no substitution is allowed). When substitution is authorized, merchandise or articles may be substituted without reference to this section, under the criteria and conditions specifically authorized in the statutory and regulatory provisions providing for the substitution.

      (b)  Manufacturers, producers, claimants, or other appropriate persons may identify for drawback purposes lots of merchandise or articles under this section, subject to each of the following conditions and criteria:

      (1) The lots of merchandise or articles to be so identified must be fungible (see § 191.2(o) of this part);

      (2) The person using the identification method must be able to establish that inventory records (for example, material control records), prepared and used in the ordinary course of business, account for the lots of merchandise or articles to be identified as being received into and withdrawn from the same inventory. Even if merchandise or articles are received or withdrawn at different geographical locations, if such inventory records treat receipts or withdrawals as being from the same inventory, those inventory records may be used to identify the merchandise or articles under this section, subject to the conditions of this section. If any such inventory records (that is, inventory records prepared and used in the ordinary course of business) treat receipts and withdrawals as being from different inventories, those inventory records must be used and receipts into or withdrawals from the different inventories may not be accounted for together. If units of merchandise or articles can be specifically identified (for example, by serial number), the merchandise or articles must be specifically identified and may not be identified by accounting method, unless it is established that inventory records, prepared and used in the ordinary course of business, treat the merchandise or articles to be identified as being received into and withdrawn from the same inventory (subject to the above conditions);

      (3) Unless otherwise provided in this section or specifically approved by Customs (by a binding ruling under part 177 of this chapter), all receipts (or inputs) into and all withdrawals from the inventory must be recorded in the accounting record;

      (4) The records which support any identification method under this section are subject to verification by Customs (see § 191.61 of this part). If Customs requests such verification, the person using the identification method must be able to demonstrate how, under generally accepted accounting procedures, the records which support the identification method used account for all merchandise or articles in, and all receipts into and withdrawals from, the inventory, and the drawback per unit for each receipt and withdrawal; and

      (5) Any accounting method which is used by a person for drawback purposes under this section must be used without variation with other methods for a period of at least one year, unless approval is given by Customs for a shorter period.

      (c)  The following accounting methods are approved for use in the identification of merchandise or articles for drawback purposes under this section.

      (1) —(i)  The FIFO method is the method by which fungible merchandise or articles are identified by recordkeeping on the basis of the first merchandise or articles received into the inventory. Under this method, withdrawals are from the oldest (first-in) merchandise or articles in the inventory at the time of withdrawal.

      (ii)  If the beginning inventory is zero, 100 units with $1 drawback attributable per unit are received in inventory on the 2nd of the month, 50 units with no drawback attributable per unit are received into inventory on the 5th of the month, 75 units are withdrawn for domestic (non-export) shipment on the 10th of the month, 75 units with $2 drawback attributable per unit are received in inventory on the 15th of the month, 100 units are withdrawn for export on the 20th of the month, and no other receipts or withdrawals occurred in the month, the drawback attributable to the 100 units withdrawn for export on the 20th is a total of $75 (25 units from the receipt on the 2nd with $1 drawback attributable per unit, 50 units from the receipt on the 5th with no drawback attributable per unit, and 25 units from the receipt on the 15th with $2 drawback attributable per unit). The basis of the foregoing and the effects on the inventory of the receipts and withdrawals, and balance in the inventory thereafter are as follows: On the 2nd of the month the receipt of 100 units ($1 drawback/unit) results in a balance of that amount; the receipt of 50 units ($0 drawback/unit) on the 5th results in a balance of 150 units (100 with $1 drawback/unit and 50 with $0 drawback/unit); the withdrawal on the 10th of 75 units ($1 drawback/unit) results in a balance of 75 units (25 with $1 drawback/unit and 50 with $0 drawback/unit); the receipt of 75 units ($2 drawback/unit) on the 15th results in a balance of 150 units (25 with $1 drawback/unit, 50 with $0 drawback/unit, and 75 with $2 drawback/unit); the withdrawal on the 20th of 100 units (25 with $1 drawback/unit, 50 with $0 drawback/unit, and 25 with $2 drawback unit) results in a balance of 50 units (all 50 with $2 drawback/unit).

      (2) —(i)  The LIFO method is the method by which fungible merchandise or articles are identified by recordkeeping on the basis of the last merchandise or articles received into the inventory. Under this method, withdrawals are from the newest (last-in) merchandise or articles in the inventory at the time of withdrawal.

      (ii)  In the example in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, the drawback attributable to the 100 units withdrawn for export on the 20th is a total of $175 (75 units from the receipt on the 15th with $2 drawback attributable per unit and 25 units from the receipt on the 2nd with $1 drawback attributable per unit). The basis of the foregoing and the effects on the inventory of the receipts and withdrawals, and balance in the inventory thereafter are as follows: On the 2nd of the month the receipt of 100 units ($1 drawback/unit) results in a balance of that amount; the receipt of 50 units ($0 drawback/unit) on the 5th results in a balance of 150 units (100 with $1 drawback/unit and 50 with $0 drawback/unit); the withdrawal on the 10th of 75 units (50 with $0 drawback/unit and 25 with $1 drawback/unit) results in a balance of 75 units (all with $1 drawback/unit); the receipt of 75 units ($2 drawback/unit) on the 15th results in a balance of 150 units (75 with $1 drawback/unit and 75 with $2 drawback/unit); the withdrawal on the 20th of 100 units (75 with $2 drawback/unit and 25 with $1 drawback/unit) results in a balance of 50 units (all 50 with $1 drawback/unit).

      (3) —(i)  The low-to-high method is the method by which fungible merchandise or articles are identified by recordkeeping on the basis of the lowest drawback amount per unit of the merchandise or articles in inventory. Merchandise or articles with no drawback attributable to them (for example, domestic merchandise or duty-free merchandise) must be accounted for and are treated as having the lowest drawback attributable to them. Under this method, withdrawals are from the merchandise or articles with the least amount of drawback attributable to them, then those with the next higher amount, and so forth. If the same amount of drawback is attributable to more than one lot of merchandise or articles, withdrawals are from the oldest (first-in) merchandise or articles among those lots with the same amount of drawback attributable. Drawback requirements are applicable to withdrawn merchandise or articles as identified (for example, if the merchandise or articles identified were attributable to an import more than 5 years (more than 3 years for unused merchandise drawback) before the claimed export, no drawback could be granted).

      (ii) —(A)  Under the ordinary low-to-high method, all receipts into and all withdrawals from the inventory are recorded in the accounting record and accounted for so that each withdrawal, whether for export or domestic shipment, is identified by recordkeeping on the basis of the lowest drawback amount per unit of the merchandise or articles available in the inventory.

      (B)  In this example, the beginning inventory is zero, and receipts into and withdrawals from the inventory are as follows:

      The drawback attributable to the January 15 withdrawal for export is zero (the available receipt with the lowest drawback amount per unit is the January 2 receipt), the drawback attributable to the January 28 withdrawal for domestic shipment (no drawback) is zero (the remainder of the January 2 receipt), the drawback attributable to the February 5 withdrawal for export is $100.50 (the January 5 and January 20 receipts), the drawback attributable to the February 15 withdrawal for export is $47.50 (the February 10 receipt), the drawback attributable to the February 23 withdrawal for domestic shipment (no drawback) is zero (the February 20 receipt), the drawback attributable to the February 28 withdrawal for export is $102.50 (the January 25 and January 31 receipts), the drawback attributable to the March 15 withdrawal for export is $42.50 (the March 10 receipt), the drawback attributable to the March 21 withdrawal for domestic shipment (no drawback) is $52.50 (the February 25 receipt), and the drawback attributable to the March 31 withdrawal for export is $98.00 (the March 25 and March 5 receipts). Remaining in inventory is the March 20 receipt of 50 units ($1.08 drawback/unit). Total drawback attributable to withdrawals for export in this example would be $391.00.

      (iii) —(A)  Under the low-to-high method with established average inventory turn-over period, all receipts into and all withdrawals for export are recorded in the accounting record and accounted for so that each withdrawal is identified by recordkeeping on the basis of the lowest drawback amount per available unit of the merchandise or articles received into the inventory in the established average inventory turn-over period preceding the withdrawal.

      (B)  Under this method, domestic withdrawals (withdrawals for domestic shipment) are not accounted for and do not affect the available units of merchandise or articles. All withdrawals for export must be accounted for whether or not drawback is available or claimed on the withdrawals. Once a withdrawal for export is made and accounted for under this method, the merchandise or articles withdrawn are no longer available for identification.

      (C)  For purposes of this section, average inventory turn-over period is based on the rate of withdrawal from inventory and represents the time in which all of the merchandise or articles in the inventory at a given time must have been withdrawn. To establish an average of this time, at least 1 year, or three (3) turn-over periods (if inventory turns over less than 3 times per year), must be averaged. The inventory turn-over period must be that for the merchandise or articles to be identified, except that if the person using the method has more than one kind of merchandise or articles with different inventory turn-over periods, the longest average turn-over period established under this section may be used (instead of using a different inventory turn-over period for each kind of merchandise or article).

      (D)  In the example in paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(B) of this section (but, as required for this method, without accounting for domestic withdrawals, and with an established average inventory turn-over period of 30 days), the drawback attributable to the January 15 withdrawal for export is zero (the available receipt in the preceding 30 days with the lowest amount of drawback is the January 2 receipt, of which 50 units will remain after the withdrawal), the drawback attributable to the February 5 withdrawal for export is $101.50 (the January 20 and January 25 receipts), the drawback attributable to the February 15 withdrawal for export is $47.50 (the February 10 receipt), the drawback attributable to the February 28 withdrawal for export is $51.50 (the February 20 and January 31 receipts), the drawback attributable to the March 15 withdrawal for export is $42.50 (the March 10 receipt), and the drawback attributable to the March 31 withdrawal for export is $98.00 (the March 25 and March 5 receipts). No drawback may be claimed on the basis of the January 5 receipt or the February 25 receipt because in the case of each, there were insufficient withdrawals for export within the established average inventory turn-over period; the 50 units remaining from the January 2 receipt after the January 15 withdrawal are not identified for a withdrawal for export because there is no other withdrawal for export (other than the January 15 withdrawal) within the established average inventory turn-over period; the March 20 receipt (50 units at $1.08) is not yet attributed to withdrawals for export. Total drawback attributable to withdrawals for export in this example would be $341.00.

      (iv) —(A)  Under the low-to-high blanket method, all receipts into and all withdrawals for export are recorded in the accounting record and accounted for so that each withdrawal is identified by recordkeeping on the basis of the lowest drawback amount per available unit of the merchandise or articles received into inventory in the period preceding the withdrawal equal to the statutory period for export under the kind of drawback involved (e.g., 180 days under 19 U.S.C. 1313(p), 3 years under 19 U.S.C. 1313(c) and 1313(j), and 5 years otherwise under 19 U.S.C. 1313(i)). Drawback requirements are applicable to withdrawn merchandise or articles as identified (for example, if the merchandise or articles identified were attributable to an import more than 5 years (more than 3 years for 19 U.S.C. 1313(j); more than 180 days after the date of import or after the close of the manufacturing period for 19 U.S.C. 1313(p)) before the claimed export, no drawback could be granted).

      (B)  Under this method, domestic withdrawals (withdrawals for domestic shipment) are not accounted for and do not affect the available units of merchandise or articles. All withdrawals for export must be accounted for whether or not drawback is available or claimed on the withdrawals. Once a withdrawal for export is made and accounted for under this method, the merchandise or articles withdrawn are no longer available for identification.

      (C)  In the example in paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(B) of this section (but, as required for this method, without accounting for domestic withdrawals), the drawback attributable to the January 15 withdrawal for export is zero (the available receipt in the inventory with the lowest amount of drawback is the January 2 receipt, of which 50 units will remain after the withdrawal), the drawback attributable to the February 5 withdrawal for export is $50.00 (the remainder of the January 2 receipt and the January 5 receipt), the drawback attributable to the February 15 withdrawal for export is $47.50 (the February 10 receipt), the drawback attributable to the February 28 withdrawal for export is $50.50 (the February 20 and January 20 receipts), the drawback attributable to the March 15 withdrawal for export is $42.50 (the March 10 receipt), and the drawback attributable to the March 31 withdrawal for export is $96.00 (the March 25 and January 25 receipts). Receipts not attributed to withdrawals for export are the January 31 (50 units at $1.03), February 25 (50 units at $1.05), March 5 (50 units at $1.06), and March 20 (50 units at $1.08) receipts. Total drawback attributable to withdrawals for export in this example would be $286.50.

      (4) —(i)  The average method is the method by which fungible merchandise or articles are identified on the basis of the calculation by recordkeeping of the amount of drawback that may be attributed to each unit of merchandise or articles in the inventory. In this method, the ratio of:

      (A) The total units of a particular receipt of the fungible merchandise in the inventory at the time of a withdrawal to;

      (B) The total units of all receipts of the fungible merchandise (including each receipt into inventory) at the time of the withdrawal;

      (C) Is applied to the withdrawal, so that the withdrawal consists of a proportionate quantity of units from each particular receipt and each receipt is correspondingly decreased. Withdrawals and corresponding decreases to receipts are rounded to the nearest whole number.

      (ii)  In the example in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, the drawback attributable to the 100 units withdrawn for export on the 20th is a total of $133 (50 units from the receipt on the 15th with $2 drawback attributable per unit, 33 units from the receipt on the 2nd with $1 drawback attributable per unit, and 17 units from the receipt on the 5th with $0 drawback attributable per unit). The basis of the foregoing and the effects on the inventory of the receipts and withdrawals, and balance in the inventory thereafter are as follows: On the 2nd of the month the receipt of 100 units ($1 drawback/unit) results in a balance of that amount; the receipt of 50 units ($0 drawback/unit) on the 5th results in a balance of 150 units (100 with $1 drawback/unit and 50 with $0 drawback/unit); the withdrawal on the 10th of 75 units (50 with $1 drawback/unit (applying the ratio of 100 units from the receipt on the 2nd to the total of 150 units at the time of withdrawal) and 25 with $0 drawback/unit (applying the ratio of 50 units from the receipt on the 5th to the total of 150 units at the time of withdrawal)) results in a balance of 75 units (with 50 with $1 drawback/unit and 25 with $0 drawback/unit, on the basis of the same ratios); the receipt of 75 units ($2 drawback/unit) on the 15th results in a balance of 150 units (50 with $1 drawback/unit, 25 with $0 drawback/unit, and 75 with $2 drawback/unit); the withdrawal on the 20th of 100 units (50 with $2 drawback/unit (applying the ratio of the 75 units from the receipt on the 15th to the total of 150 units at the time of withdrawal), 33 with $1 drawback/unit (applying the ratio of the 50 units remaining from the receipt on the 2nd to the total of 150 units at the time of withdrawal, and 17 with $0 drawback/unit (applying the ratio of the 25 units remaining from the receipt on the 5th to the total of 150 units at the time of withdrawal)) results in a balance of 50 units (25 with $2 drawback/unit, 17 with $1 drawback/unit, and 8 with $0 drawback/unit, on the basis of the same ratios).

      (5)  A properly established average inventory turn-over period, as provided for in paragraph (c)(3)(iii)(C) of this section, may be used to determine:

      (i) The fact and date(s) of use in manufacture or production of the imported designated merchandise and other (substituted) merchandise (see 19 U.S.C. 1313(b)); or

      (ii) The fact and date(s) of manufacture or production of the finished articles (see 19 U.S.C. 1313(a) and (b)).

      (d)  (1) Persons proposing to use an accounting method for identification of merchandise or articles for drawback purposes which has not been previously approved for such use (see paragraph (c) of this section), or which includes modifications from the methods listed in paragraph (c) of this section, may seek approval by Customs of the proposed accounting method under the provisions for obtaining an administrative ruling (see part 177 of this chapter). The conditions applied and the criteria used by Customs in approving such an alternative accounting method, or a modification of one of the approved accounting methods, will be the criteria in paragraph (b) of this section, as well as those in paragraph (d)(2) of this section.

      (2) In order for a proposed accounting method to be approved by Customs for purposes of this section, it shall meet the following criteria:

      (i) For purposes of calculations of drawback, the proposed accounting method must be either revenue neutral or favorable to the Government; and

      (ii) The proposed accounting method should be:

      (A) Generally consistent with commercial accounting procedures, as applicable for purposes of drawback;

      (B) Consistent with inventory or material control records used in the ordinary course of business by the person proposing the method; and

      (C) Easily administered by both Customs and the person proposing the method.

      § 191.15   Recordkeeping.

#### § § 191.15

      Pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 1508(c)(3), all records which pertain to the filing of a drawback claim or to the information contained in the records required by 19 U.S.C. 1313 in connection with the filing of a drawback claim shall be retained for 3 years after payment of such claims or longer period if required by law (under 19 U.S.C. 1508, the same records may be subject to a different period for different purposes).

    Subpart B—Manufacturing Drawback

      § 191.21   Direct identification drawback.

#### § § 191.21

      Section 313(a) of the Act, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1313(a)), provides for drawback upon the exportation, or destruction under Customs supervision, of articles which are not used in the United States prior to their exportation or destruction, and which are manufactured or produced in the United States wholly or in part with the use of particular imported, duty-paid merchandise and/or drawback product(s). Where two or more products result, drawback shall be distributed among the products in accordance with their relative value (see § 191.2(u)) at the time of separation. Merchandise may be identified for drawback purposes under 19 U.S.C. 1313(a) in the manner provided for and prescribed in § 191.14 of this part.

      § 191.22   Substitution drawback.

#### § § 191.22

      (a)  If imported, duty-paid, merchandise and any other merchandise (whether imported or domestic) of the same kind and quality are used in the manufacture or production of articles within a period not to exceed 3 years from the receipt of the imported merchandise by the manufacturer or producer of the articles, then upon the exportation, or destruction under Customs supervision, of any such articles, without their having been used in the United States prior to such exportation or destruction, drawback is provided for in § 313(b) of the Act, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1313(b)), even though none of the imported, duty-paid merchandise may have been used in the manufacture or production of the exported or destroyed articles. The amount of drawback allowable cannot exceed that which would have been allowable had the merchandise used therein been the imported, duty-paid merchandise. For purposes of drawback of internal revenue tax imposed under Chapters 32, 38, 51, and 52 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (IRC), drawback granted on the export or destruction of substituted merchandise will be limited to the amount of taxes paid (and not returned by refund, credit, or drawback) on the substituted merchandise.

      (b)  Duty-paid merchandise or drawback products used at one factory of a manufacturer or producer within 3 years after the date on which the material was received by the manufacturer or producer may be designated as the basis for drawback on articles manufactured or produced in accordance with these regulations at other factories of the same manufacturer or producer.

      (c)  A manufacturer or producer may designate any eligible imported merchandise or drawback product which it has used in manufacture or production.

      (d) —(1)  Upon compliance with the requirements in this section and under 19 U.S.C. 1313(s), a drawback successor as defined in paragraph (d)(2) of this section may designate merchandise or drawback product used by a predecessor before the date of succession as the basis for drawback on articles manufactured or produced by the successor after the date of succession.

      (2)  A “drawback successor” is a manufacturer or producer to whom another entity (predecessor) has transferred, by written agreement, merger, or corporate resolution:

      (i) All or substantially all of the rights, privileges, immunities, powers, duties, and liabilities of the predecessor; or

      (ii) The assets and other business interests of a division, plant, or other business unit of such predecessor, provided that the value of the transferred assets and interests (realty, personalty, and intangibles, exclusive of the drawback rights) exceeds the value of such drawback rights, whether vested or contingent.

      (3) —(i)  The predecessor or successor must certify that the successor is in possession of the predecessor's records which are necessary to establish the right to drawback under the law and regulations with respect to the merchandise or drawback product.

      (ii)  The predecessor or successor must certify in an attachment to the claim, that the predecessor has not designated and will not designate, nor enable any other person to designate, such merchandise or product as the basis for drawback.

      (iii)  In instances in which assets and other business interests of a division, plant, or other business unit of a predecessor are transferred, the predecessor or successor must specify, and maintain supporting records to establish, the value of the drawback rights and the value of all other transferred property.

      (iv)  The written agreement, merger, or corporate resolution, provided for in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, and the records and evidence provided for in paragraph (d)(3) (i) through (iii) of this section, must be retained by the appropriate party(s) for 3 years from the date of payment of the related claim and are subject to review by Customs upon request.

      (e) —(1)  Where two or more products are produced concurrently in a substitution manufacturing operation, drawback shall be distributed to each product in accordance with its relative value (see § 191.2(u)) at the time of separation.

      (2)  Where the claim covers a manufacturing period rather than a manufacturing lot, the entire period covered by the claim is the time of separation of the products and the value per unit of product is the market value for the period (see § 191.2(u) of this part).

      § 191.23   Methods of claiming drawback.

#### § § 191.23

      (a)  Drawback may be paid based on the amount of the imported or substituted merchandise used in the manufacture of the exported article, where there is no waste or the waste is valueless or unrecoverable. This method must be used when multiple products also necessarily and concurrently result from the manufacturing process, and there is no valuable waste (see paragraph (c) of this section).

      (b)  Drawback is allowable under this method based only on the amount of imported or substituted merchandise that appears in (is contained in) the exported articles. This method may not be used if there are multiple products also necessarily and concurrently resulting from the manufacturing process.

      (c)  Drawback is allowable under this method based on the quantity of merchandise or drawback products used to manufacture the exported or destroyed article, reduced by an amount equal to the quantity of this merchandise that the value of the waste would replace. This method must be used when multiple products also necessarily and concurrently result from the manufacturing process, and there is valuable waste.

      (d)  A drawback claimant may use either the abstract or schedule method to show the quantity of material used or appearing in the exported or destroyed article. An abstract is the summary of records which shows the total quantity used in or appearing in all articles produced during the period covered by the abstract. A schedule shows the quantity of material used in producing, or appearing in, each unit of product. Manufacturers or producers submitting letters of notification of intent to operate under a general manufacturing drawback ruling (see § 191.7) and applicants for approval of specific manufacturing drawback rulings (see § 191.8) shall state whether the abstract or schedule method is used; if no such statement is made, drawback claims must be based upon the abstract method.

      (e) —(1)  When the waste has a value and the drawback claim is not limited to the quantity of imported or substituted merchandise or drawback products appearing in the exported or destroyed articles claimed for drawback, the manufacturer or producer shall keep records to show the market value of the merchandise or drawback products used to manufacture or produce the exported or destroyed articles, as well as the market value of the resulting waste, under the used in less valuable waste method (see § 191.2(u) of this part).

      (2)  If claim for waste is waived, only the “appearing in” basis may be used (see paragraph (b) of this section). Waste records need not be kept unless required to establish the quantity of imported duty-paid merchandise or drawback products appearing in the exported or destroyed articles claimed for drawback.

      § 191.24   Certificate of manufacture and delivery.

#### § § 191.24

      (a)  When an article or drawback product manufactured or produced under a general manufacturing drawback ruling or a specific manufacturing drawback ruling is transferred from the manufacturer or producer to another party, a certificate of manufacture and delivery shall be prepared and certified by the manufacturer.

      (b)  The following information shall be required on the certificate of manufacture and delivery executed by the manufacturer or producer:

      (3) The quantity, kind and quality of imported, duty-paid merchandise or drawback product designated;

      (4) Import entry numbers, HTSUS number for the imported merchandise to at least the 6th digit (such HTSUS number shall be from the entry summary and other entry documentation for the imported, duty-paid merchandise unless the issuer of the certificate of manufacture and delivery received the merchandise under another certificate (either of delivery or of manufacture and delivery), in which case such HTSUS number shall be from the other certificate), and applicable duty amounts;

      (5) Date received at factory;

      (6) Date used in manufacture;

      (7) Value at factory, if applicable;

      (8) Quantity of waste, if any, if applicable;

      (12) Date of manufacture or production of the articles;

      (13) The quantity of articles transferred; and

      (14) The person from whom the article or drawback product is delivered.

      (c)  The certificate of manufacture and delivery shall be filed with the drawback claim it supports (unless previously filed) (see § 191.51 of this part).

      (d)  A certificate of manufacture and delivery documents the delivery of articles from the manufacturer or producer to another party, identifies such articles as being those to which a potential right to drawback exists, and assigns such potential rights to the transferee (see also § 191.82 of this part).

      § 191.25   Destruction under Customs supervision.

#### § § 191.25

      A claimant may destroy merchandise and obtain manufacturing drawback by complying with the procedures set forth in § 191.71 of this part relating to destruction.

      § 191.26   Recordkeeping for manufacturing drawback.

#### § § 191.26

      (a) —(1)  Each manufacturer or producer under 19 U.S.C. 1313(a) shall keep records to allow the verifying Customs official to trace all articles manufactured or produced for exportation or destruction with drawback, from importation, through production, to exportation or destruction. To this end, these records shall specifically establish:

      (i) The date or inclusive dates of manufacture or production;

      (ii) The quantity and identity of the imported duty-paid merchandise or drawback products used in or appearing in (see § 191.23) the articles manufactured or produced;

      (iii) The quantity, if any, of the nondrawback merchandise used, when these records are necessary to determine the quantity of imported duty-paid merchandise or drawback product used in the manufacture or production of the exported or destroyed articles or appearing in them;

      (iv) The quantity and description of the articles manufactured or produced;

      (v) The quantity of waste incurred, if applicable; and

      (vi) That the finished articles on which drawback is claimed were exported or destroyed within 5 years after the importation of the duty-paid merchandise, without having been used in the United States prior to such exportation or destruction. (If the completed articles were commingled after manufacture, their identity may be maintained in the manner prescribed in § 191.14 of this part.)

      (2)  The merchandise and articles to be exported or destroyed shall be accounted for in a manner which will enable the manufacturer, producer, or claimant:

      (i) To determine, and the Customs official to verify, the applicable import entry, certificate of delivery, and/or certificate of manufacture and delivery associated with the claim; and

      (ii) To identify with respect to that import entry, certificate of delivery, and/or certificate of manufacture and delivery, the imported duty-paid merchandise or drawback products used in manufacture or production.

      (b)  The records of the manufacturer or producer of articles manufactured or produced in accordance with 19 U.S.C. 1313(b) shall establish the facts in paragraph (a)(1)(i), (iv) through (vi) of this section, and:

      (1) The quantity, identity, and specifications of the merchandise designated (imported duty-paid, or drawback product);

      (2) The quantity, identity, and specifications of merchandise of the same kind and quality as the designated merchandise before its use to manufacture or produce (or appearing in) the exported or destroyed articles;

      (3) That, within 3 years after receiving the designated merchandise at its plant, the manufacturer or producer used it in manufacturing or production and that during the same 3-year period it manufactured or produced the exported or destroyed articles; and

      (4) If the designated merchandise is a chemical element that was contained in imported material that was subject to an  rate of duty, and a substitution drawback claim is made based on that chemical element:

      (i) The duty paid on the imported material must be apportioned among its constituent components. The claim on the chemical element that is the designated merchandise must be limited to the duty apportioned to that element on a unit-for-unit attribution using the unit of measure set forth in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) that is applicable to the imported material. If the material is a compound with other constituents, including impurities, and the purity of the compound in the imported material is shown by satisfactory analysis, that purity, converted to a decimal equivalent of the percentage, is multiplied against the entered amount of the material to establish the amount of pure compound. The amount of the element in the pure compound is to be determined by use of the atomic weights of the constituent elements and converting to the decimal equivalent of their respective percentages and multiplying that decimal equivalent against the above-determined amount of pure compound.

      (ii) The amount claimed as drawback based on the chemical element must be deducted from the duty paid on the imported material that may be claimed on any other drawback claim.

      (c)  When waste has a value and the manufacturer, producer, or claimant, has not limited the claims based on the quantity of imported or substituted merchandise appearing in the articles exported or destroyed, the manufacturer or producer shall keep records to show the market value of the merchandise used to manufacture or produce the exported or destroyed article, as well as the quantity and market value of the waste incurred (see § 191.2(u) of this part). In such records, the quantity of merchandise identified or designated for drawback, under 19 U.S.C. 1313(a) or 1313(b), respectively, shall be based on the quantity of merchandise actually used to manufacture or produce the exported or destroyed articles. The waste replacement reduction will be determined by reducing from the quantity of merchandise actually used the amount of merchandise which the value of the waste would replace.

      (d)  Where the claimant purchases articles from the manufacturer and exports them, the claimant shall file the related certificate of manufacture and delivery as part of the claim (see § 191.51(a)(1) of this part).

      (e) —(1)  _Multiple claimants_ may file for drawback with respect to the same export (for example, if an automobile is exported, where different parts of the automobile have been produced by different manufacturers under drawback conditions and the exporter waives the right to claim drawback and assigns such right to the manufacturers under § 191.82 of this part).

      (2) —(i)  Each drawback claimant shall file a separate letter, as part of the claim, describing the component article on the export bill of lading to which each claim will relate. Each letter shall show the name of the claimant and bear a statement that the claim shall be limited to its respective component article. The exporter shall endorse the letters, as required, to show the respective interests of the claimants.

      (ii)  Exporters may waive and assign their drawback rights for all, or any portion, of their exportations with respect to a particular commodity for a given period to a drawback claimant.

      (iii)  If the parties elect to use the export summary procedure (§ 191.73 of this part) each drawback claimant shall complete a chronological summary of exports for the respective component product to which each claim will relate. Each claimant shall identify in the chronological summary the name of the other claimant(s) and the component product for which each will independently claim drawback, if known at the time the drawback claim is filed. The exporter shall endorse the summaries, as required, to show the respective interests of the claimants. Each claimant shall have on file and make available to Customs upon request, the endorsement from the exporter assigning the right to claim drawback.

      (f)  Pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 1508(c)(3), all records required to be kept by the manufacturer, producer, or claimant with respect to drawback claims, and records kept by others to complement the records of the manufacturer, producer, or claimant with respect to drawback claims shall be retained for 3 years after the date of payment of the related claims (under 19 U.S.C. 1508, the same records may be subject to a different retention period for different purposes).

      (c)  Drawback claims may be filed before the letter of notification of intent to operate under a general manufacturing drawback ruling covering the claims is acknowledged (§ 191.7), or before the specific manufacturing drawback ruling covering the claims is approved (§ 191.8), but no drawback shall be paid until such acknowledgement or approval, as appropriate.

      § 191.28   Person entitled to claim drawback.

#### § § 191.28

      The exporter (or destroyer) shall be entitled to claim drawback, unless the exporter (or destroyer), by means of a certification, assigns the right to claim drawback to the manufacturer, producer, importer, or intermediate party. Such certification shall also affirm that the exporter (or destroyer) has not and will not itself claim drawback or assign the right to claim drawback on the particular exportation or destruction to any other party. The certification provided for under this section may be a blanket certification for a stated period. Drawback is paid to the claimant, who may be the manufacturer, producer, intermediate party, importer, or exporter (destroyer).

#### § § 191.32

      (a)  Section 313(j)(2) of the Act, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1313(j)(2)), provides for drawback on merchandise which is commercially interchangeable with imported merchandise if the commercially interchangeable merchandise is exported, or destroyed under Customs supervision, before the close of the 3-year period beginning on the date of importation of the imported merchandise, and before such exportation or destruction, the commercially interchangeable merchandise is not used in the United States (see paragraph (e) of this section) and is in the possession of the party claiming drawback.

      (b)  (1) The claimant must have possessed the substituted merchandise that was exported or destroyed, as provided in paragraph (d)(1) of this section;

      (2) The substituted merchandise must be commercially interchangeable with the imported merchandise that is designated for drawback;

      (3) The substituted merchandise exported or destroyed must not have been used in the United States before its exportation or destruction (see paragraph (e) of this section); and

      (4) For purposes of drawback of internal revenue tax imposed under Chapters 32, 38 (with the exception of Subchapter A of Chapter 38), 51, and 52 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (IRC), drawback granted on the export or destruction of substituted merchandise will be limited to the amount of taxes paid (and not returned by refund, credit, or drawback) on the substituted merchandise.

      (c)  In determining commercial interchangeability, Customs shall evaluate the critical properties of the substituted merchandise and in that evaluation factors to be considered include, but are not limited to, Governmental and recognized industrial standards, part numbers, tariff classification and value. A party may seek a nonbinding predetermination of commercial interchangeability directly from the appropriate drawback office. A determination of commercial interchangeability can be obtained in one of two ways:

      (1) A formal ruling from the Entry Process and Duty Refunds Branch, Regulations and Rulings, Office of International Trade; or

      (2) A submission of all the required documentation necessary to make a commercial interchangeability determination with each individual drawback claim filed.

      (d)  For substitution unused merchandise drawback:

      (1) The claimant must have had possession of the exported or destroyed merchandise at some time during the 3-year period following the date of importation of the imported designated merchandise; and

      (2) The merchandise to be exported or destroyed to qualify for drawback must be exported, or destroyed under Customs supervision, before the close of the 3-year period beginning on the date of importation of the imported designated merchandise.

      (e)  In cases in which an operation or operations is or are performed on the substituted merchandise, the performing of any operation or combination of operations, not amounting to manufacture or production under the provisions of the manufacturing drawback law, on the commercially interchangeable substituted merchandise is not a use of that merchandise for purposes of this section.

      (f) —(1)  Upon compliance with the requirements of this section and under 19 U.S.C. 1313(s), a drawback successor as defined in paragraph (f)(2) of this section may designate either of the following as the basis for drawback on merchandise possessed by the successor after the date of succession:

      (i) Imported merchandise which the predecessor, before the date of succession, imported; or

      (ii) Imported and/or commercially interchangeable merchandise which was transferred to the predecessor and for which the predecessor received, before the date of succession, a certificate of delivery from the person who imported and paid duty on the imported merchandise.

      (2)  A “drawback successor” is an entity to which another entity (predecessor) has transferred, by written agreement, merger, or corporate resolution:

      (i) All or substantially all of the rights, privileges, immunities, powers, duties, and liabilities of the predecessor; or

      (ii) The assets and other business interests of a division, plant, or other business unit of such predecessor, provided that the value of the transferred assets and interests (realty, personality, and intangibles, exclusive of the drawback rights) exceeds the value of such drawback rights, whether vested or contingent.

      (3) —(i)  The predecessor or successor must certify in an attachment to the drawback claim that the successor is in possession of the predecessor's records which are necessary to establish the right to drawback under the law and regulations with respect to the imported and/or commercially interchangeable merchandise.

      (ii)  The predecessor or successor must certify in an attachment to the drawback claim, that the predecessor has not and will not designate, nor enable any other person to designate, the imported and/or commercially interchangeable merchandise as the basis for drawback.

      (iii)  In instances in which assets and other business interests of a division, plant, or other business unit of a predecessor are transferred, the predecessor or successor must specify, and maintain supporting records to establish, the value of the drawback rights and the value of all other transferred property.

      (iv)  The written agreement, merger, or corporate resolution, provided for in paragraph (f)(2) of this section, and the records and evidence provided for in paragraph (f)(3)(i) through (iii) of this section, must be retained by the appropriate party(ies) for 3 years from the date of payment of the related claim and are subject to review by Customs upon request.

      § 191.33   Person entitled to claim drawback.

#### § § 191.33

      (a)  (1) Under 19 U.S.C. 1313(j)(1), the exporter (or destroyer) shall be entitled to claim drawback.

      (2) The exporter or destroyer may waive the right to claim drawback and assign such right to the importer or any intermediate party. A drawback claimant under 19 U.S.C. 1313(j)(1) other than the exporter or destroyer shall secure and retain a certification signed by the exporter or destroyer that such party waived the right to claim drawback, and did not and will not authorize any other party to claim the exportation or destruction for drawback (see § 191.82 of this part). The certification provided for under this section may be a blanket certification for a stated period. The claimant shall file such certification at the time of, or prior to, the filing of the claim(s) covered by the certification.

      (b)  (1) Under 19 U.S.C. 1313(j)(2), the following parties may claim drawback:

      (i) In situations where the exporter or destroyer of the substituted merchandise is also the importer of the imported merchandise, that party shall be entitled to claim drawback.

      (ii) In situations where the exporter or destroyer receives from the person who imported and paid the duty on the imported merchandise a certificate of delivery documenting the transfer of imported merchandise, commercially interchangeable merchandise, or any combination of imported and commercially interchangeable merchandise, and exports or destroys such transferred merchandise, that exporter or destroyer shall be entitled to claim drawback. (Any such transferred merchandise, regardless of its origin, will be treated as imported merchandise for purposes of drawback under § 1313(j)(2), and any retained merchandise will be treated as domestic merchandise.)

      (iii) In situations where the transferred merchandise described in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section is the subject of further transfer(s), such transfer(s) shall be documented by certificate(s) of delivery, and the exporter or destroyer shall be entitled to claim drawback (multiple substitutions are not permitted).

      (2) The exporter or destroyer may waive the right to claim drawback and assign such right to the importer or to any intermediate party, provided that the claimant had possession of the substituted merchandise prior to its exportation or destruction. A drawback claimant under 19 U.S.C. 1313(j)(2) other than the exporter or destroyer shall secure and retain a certification signed by the exporter or destroyer that such party waived the right to claim drawback, and did not and will not authorize any other party to claim the exportation or destruction for drawback (see § 191.82 of this part). The certification provided for under this section may be a blanket certification for a stated period. The claimant shall file such certification at the time of, or prior to, the filing of the claim(s) covered by the certification.

      § 191.34   Certificate of delivery required.

#### § § 191.34

      (a)  If the exported or destroyed merchandise claimed for drawback under 19 U.S.C. 1313(j)(1) was not imported by the exporter or destroyer, a properly executed certificate of delivery must be prepared by the importer and each intermediate party. Each such transfer of the merchandise must be documented by its own certificate of delivery.

      (1)  The certificate of delivery shall be completed as provided in § 191.10 of this part. Each party must also certify on the certificate of delivery that the party did not use the transferred merchandise (see § 191.31(c) of this part).

      (2)  The certificate of delivery shall be retained by the party to whom the merchandise or article covered by the certificate was delivered. Customs may request the certificate from the claimant for the drawback claim based upon the certificate (see §§ 191.51, 191.52). If the certificate is requested by Customs, but is not provided by the claimant, the part of the drawback claim dependent on that certificate will be denied.

      (b)  For purposes of substitution unused merchandise drawback, 19 U.S.C. 1313(j)(2), if the importer, or a party who received imported merchandise and a certificate of delivery for that imported merchandise, directly or indirectly, from the importer, transfers to another party imported merchandise, duty-paid merchandise, commercially interchangeable merchandise, or any combination thereof, the transferor shall prepare and issue in favor of such party a certificate of delivery covering the transferred merchandise. The certificate of delivery must expressly state that it is prepared pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 1313(j)(2). Merchandise so transferred for which drawback is allowed under 19 U.S.C. 1313(j)(2) may not be designated for any other drawback purposes. Each transfer, whether of the imported merchandise or of imported merchandise, duty-paid merchandise, commercially interchangeable merchandise, or any combination thereof, must be documented by its own certificate of delivery. Certificates of delivery under this paragraph are subject to the provisions for completion and retention of certificates of delivery in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section.

      (c)  The person in whose name merchandise is withdrawn from a bonded warehouse shall be considered the importer for drawback purposes. No certificate of delivery need be prepared covering prior transfers of merchandise while in a bonded warehouse, because such transfers will be recorded in the warehouse entry (see § 144.22 of this chapter).

      § 191.35   Notice of intent to export; examination of merchandise.

#### § § 191.35

      (a)  A notice of intent to export merchandise which may be the subject of an unused merchandise drawback claim (19 U.S.C. 1313(j)) must be provided to the Customs Service to give Customs the opportunity to examine the merchandise. The claimant, or the exporter, must file at the port of intended examination a Notice of Intent to Export, Destroy, or Return Merchandise for Purposes of Drawback on Customs Form 7553 at least 2 working days prior to the date of intended exportation unless Customs approves another filing period or the claimant has been granted a waiver of prior notice (see § 191.91 of this part).

      (b)  The notice shall certify that the merchandise has not been used in the United States before exportation. In addition, the notice shall provide the bill of lading number, if known, the name and telephone number, mailing address, and, if available, fax number and e-mail address of a contact person, and the location of the merchandise.

      (c)  Within two (2) working days after receipt of the Notice of Intent to Export, Destroy, or Return Merchandise for Purposes of Drawback (see paragraph (a) of this section), Customs will notify the party designated on the Notice in writing of Customs decision to either examine the merchandise to be exported, or to waive examination. If Customs timely notifies the designated party, in writing, of its decision to examine the merchandise (see paragraph (d) of this section), but the merchandise is exported without having been presented to Customs for examination, any drawback claim, or part thereof, based on the Notice of Intent to Export, Destroy, or Return Merchandise for Purposes of Drawback shall be denied. If Customs notifies the designated party, in writing, of its decision to waive examination of the merchandise, or, if timely notification of a decision by Customs to examine or to waive examination is absent, the merchandise may be exported without delay.

      (d)  If Customs gives timely notice of its decision to examine the export merchandise, the merchandise to be examined shall be promptly presented to Customs. Customs shall examine the merchandise within five (5) working days after presentation of the merchandise. The merchandise may be exported without examination if Customs fails to timely examine the merchandise after presentation to Customs. If the examination is completed at a port other than the port of actual exportation, the merchandise shall be transported in-bond to the port of exportation.

      (e)  The appropriate Customs office may permit release of merchandise without examination, or may examine routinely (to the extent determined to be necessary) the items exported.

      § 191.36   Failure to file Notice of Intent to Export, Destroy, or Return Merchandise for Purposes of Drawback.

      (ii) Written declarations regarding:

      (A) The reason(s) that Customs was not notified of the intent to export; and

      (B) Whether the applicant, to the best of its knowledge, will have future exportations on which unused merchandise drawback might be claimed; and

      () Business records prepared in the ordinary course of business;

      () Laboratory records prepared in the ordinary course of business; and/or

      () Inventory records prepared in the ordinary course of business tracing all relevant movements and storage of the imported merchandise, substituted merchandise, and/or exported merchandise; and

      (B) Evidence establishing compliance with all other applicable drawback requirements.

      (2)  The procedure provided for in this section may be used by a claimant only once, unless good cause is shown (for example, successorship).

      (3)  Drawback claims may be filed under this section pending disposition of the application. However, those drawback claims will not be processed or paid until the application is approved by Customs.

      (b)  In order for Customs to evaluate the application under this section, Customs may request, and the applicant shall provide, any of the information listed in paragraph (a)(_1_)(iii)(A)() through () of this section. In making its decision to approve or deny the application under this section, Customs will consider factors such as, but not limited to, the following:

      (1) Information provided by the claimant in the written application;

      (2) Any of the information listed in paragraph (a)(_1_)(iii)(A)() through () of this section and requested by Customs under this paragraph; and

      (c)  Customs will notify the applicant in writing within 90 days after receipt of the application of its decision to approve or deny the application, or of Customs inability to approve, deny or act on the application and the reason therefor.

      (d)  If CBP denies the application, the applicant may file a written appeal with the drawback office which issued the denial, provided that the applicant files this appeal within 30 days of the date of denial. If CBP denies this initial appeal, the applicant may file a further written appeal with CBP Headquarters, Office of International Trade, Trade Policy and Programs, provided that the applicant files this further appeal within 30 days of the denial date of the initial appeal. CBP may extend the 30 day period for appeal to the drawback office or to CBP Headquarters, for good cause, if the applicant applies in writing for such extension within the appropriate 30 day period above.

      (e)  If an applicant states it will have future exportations on which unused merchandise drawback may be claimed (see paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(B) of this section), the applicant will be informed of the procedures for waiver of prior notice (see § 191.91 of this part). If the applicant seeks waiver of prior notice under § 191.91, any documentation submitted to Customs to comply with this section will be included in the request under § 191.91. An applicant which states that it will have future exportations on which unused merchandise drawback may be claimed (see paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(B) of this section) and which does not obtain waiver of prior notice shall notify Customs of its intent to export prior to each such exportation, in accordance with § 191.35.

      § 191.37   Destruction under Customs supervision.

#### § § 191.37

      A claimant may destroy merchandise and obtain unused merchandise drawback by complying with the procedures set forth in § 191.71 of this part relating to destruction.

      § 191.38   Records.

#### § § 191.38

      (b)  Merchandise subject to drawback under 19 U.S.C. 1313(j)(1) and (j)(2) shall be accounted for in a manner which will enable the claimant:

      (1) To determine, and Customs to verify, the applicable import entry or certificate of delivery;

      (2) To determine, and Customs to verify, the applicable exportation or destruction; and

      (3) To identify with respect to the import entry or certificate of delivery, the imported duty-paid merchandise.

    Subpart D—Rejected Merchandise

      § 191.41   Rejected merchandise drawback.

#### § § 191.41

      Section 313(c) of the Act, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1313(c)), provides for drawback upon the exportation or destruction under Customs supervision of imported merchandise which has been entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption, duty-paid; and which does not conform to sample or specifications; has been shipped without the consent of the consignee; or has been determined to be defective as of the time of importation. The claimant must show by evidence satisfactory to Customs that the exported or destroyed merchandise was defective at the time of importation, or was not in accordance with sample or specifications, or was shipped without the consent of the consignee (see subpart P for drawback of internal-revenue taxes for unmerchantable or nonconforming distilled spirits, wines, or beer).

      § 191.42   Procedures and supporting documentation.

#### § § 191.42

      (a)  Drawback will be denied on merchandise that is exported or destroyed after the statutory 3-year time period.

      (b)  The claimant must submit documentation to CBP as part of the complete drawback claim ( § 191.51) to establish that the merchandise did not conform to sample or specification, was shipped without the consent of the consignee, or was defective as of the time of importation ( § 191.45 for additional requirements for claims made with respect to rejected retail merchandise under 19 U.S.C. 1313(c)(1)(C)(ii)). If the claimant was not the importer, the claimant must also:

      (1) Submit a statement signed by the importer and every other person, other than the ultimate purchaser, that owned the goods that no other claim for drawback was made on the goods by any other person; and

      (2) Certify that records are available to support the statement required in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.

      (c)  A notice of intent to export or destroy merchandise which may be the subject of a rejected merchandise drawback claim (19 U.S.C. 1313(c)) must be provided to CBP to give CBP the opportunity to examine the merchandise. The claimant, or the exporter (for destruction under CBP supervision, see § 191.71), must file at the port of intended redelivery to CBP custody a Notice of Intent to Export, Destroy, or Return Merchandise for Purposes of Drawback on CBP Form 7553 at least 5 working days prior to the date of intended return to CBP custody.

      (d)  The notice must provide the bill of lading number, if known, the name and telephone number, mailing address, and, if available, fax number and email address of a contact person, and the location of the merchandise.

      (e)  Within 2 working days after receipt of the Notice of Intent to Export, Destroy, or Return Merchandise for Purposes of Drawback ( paragraph (c) of this section), CBP will notify, in writing, the party designated on the Notice of CBP's decision to either examine the merchandise to be exported or destroyed, or to waive examination. If CBP timely notifies the designated party, in writing, of its decision to examine the merchandise ( paragraph (f) of this section), but the merchandise is exported or destroyed without having been presented to CBP for such examination, any drawback claim, or part thereof, based on the Notice of Intent to Export, Destroy, or Return Merchandise for Purposes of Drawback, must be denied. If CBP notifies the designated party, in writing, of its decision to waive examination of the merchandise, or, if timely notification of a decision by CBP to examine or to waive examination is absent, the merchandise may be exported or destroyed without delay and will be deemed to have been returned to CBP custody.

      (f)  If CBP gives timely notice of its decision to examine the merchandise to be exported or destroyed, the merchandise to be examined must be promptly presented to CBP. CBP must examine the merchandise within 5 working days after presentation of the merchandise. The merchandise may be exported or destroyed without examination if CBP fails to timely examine the merchandise after presentation to CBP, and in such case the merchandise will be deemed to have been returned to CBP custody. If the examination is to be completed at a port other than the port of actual exportation or destruction, the merchandise must be transported in-bond to the port of exportation or destruction.

      (g)  The appropriate CBP office may permit release of merchandise without examination, or may examine, to the extent determined to be necessary, the items exported or destroyed.

      (h)  When filing the drawback claim, the drawback claimant must correctly calculate the amount of drawback due ( § 191.51(b)). The procedures for restructuring a claim ( § 191.53) apply to rejected merchandise drawback if the claimant has an ongoing export program which qualifies for this type of drawback.

      (i)  Claimants must provide documentary evidence of exportation ( subpart G of this part). The claimant may establish exportation by mail as set out in § 191.74.

      § 191.43   Unused merchandise claim.

#### § § 191.43

      Rejected merchandise may be the subject of an unused merchandise drawback claim under 19 U.S.C. 1313(j)(1), in accordance with subpart C of this part, to the extent that the merchandise qualifies therefor.

      § 191.44   Destruction under Customs supervision.

#### § § 191.44

      A claimant may destroy merchandise and obtain rejected merchandise drawback by complying with the procedures set forth in § 191.71 of this part relating to destruction.

      § 191.45   Returned retail merchandise.

#### § § 191.45

      (a)  Section 313(c)(1)(C)(ii) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1313(c)(1)(C)(ii)), provides for drawback upon the exportation or destruction under CBP supervision of imported merchandise which has been entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption, duty-paid and ultimately sold at retail by the importer, or the person who received the merchandise from the importer, and for any reason returned to and accepted by the importer, or the person who received the merchandise from the importer.

      (b)  (1) Drawback is allowable, subject to compliance with all requirements set forth in this subpart; and

      (2) The claimant must also show by evidence satisfactory to CBP that drawback may be claimed by—

      (i) Designating an entry of merchandise that was imported within 1 year before the date of exportation or destruction of the merchandise described in paragraph (a) of this section under CBP supervision.

      (ii) Certifying that the same 8-digit HTSUS subheading number and specific product identifier (such as part number, SKU, or product code) apply to both the merchandise designated for drawback (in the import documentation) and the returned merchandise.

      (c)  The amount of drawback allowable will not exceed 99 percent of the amount of duties, taxes, and fees paid with respect to the imported merchandise.

      (d)  No drawback will be refunded if CBP is not satisfied that the claimant has provided, upon request, the documentation necessary to support the certification required in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section.

    Subpart E—Completion of Drawback Claims

      § 191.51   Completion of drawback claims.

#### § § 191.51

      (a) —(1)  Unless otherwise specified, a complete drawback claim under this part shall consist of the drawback entry on Customs Form 7551, applicable certificate(s) of manufacture and delivery, applicable Notice(s) of Intent to Export, Destroy, or Return Merchandise for Purposes of Drawback, applicable import entry number(s), coding sheet unless the data is filed electronically, and evidence of exportation or destruction under subpart G of this part.

      (2)  Additionally, at the time of the filing of the claim, the associated certificate(s) of delivery must be in the possession of the party to whom the merchandise or article covered by the certificate was delivered. Any required certificate(s) of manufacture and delivery, if not previously filed with Customs, must be filed with the claim. Previously filed certificates of manufacture and delivery, if required, shall be referenced in the claim.

      (3)  Claimants filing any drawback claims under this part for imported merchandise associated with an entry summary if any other merchandise covered on that entry summary has been designated as the basis of a drawback substitution claim under part 190 of this chapter must provide additional information enabling CBP to verify the availability of drawback for the indicated merchandise and associated line item within 30 days of claim submission. The information to be provided will include, but is not limited to: Summary document specifying the lines used and unused on the import entry; the import entry summary, corresponding commercial invoices, and copies of all drawback claims that previously designated the import entry summary; and post summary/liquidation changes (for imports or drawback claims, if applicable).

      (b) —(1)  Drawback claimants are required to correctly calculate the amount of drawback due. The amount of drawback requested on the drawback entry is generally to be 99 percent of the import duties eligible for drawback. (For example, if $1,000 in import duties are eligible for drawback less 1 percent ($10), the amount claimed on the drawback entry should be for $990.) Claims exceeding 99 percent (or 100% when 100% of the duty is available for drawback) will not be paid until the calculations have been corrected by the claimant. Claims for less than 99 percent (or 100% when 100% of the duty is available for drawback) will be paid as filed, unless the claimant amends the claim in accordance with § 191.52(c).

      (2)  Where a drawback claimant seeks unused merchandise drawback pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 1313(j), or drawback for substitution of finished petroleum derivatives pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 1313(p)(2)(A)(iii) or (iv), for a merchandise processing fee paid pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 58c(a)(9)(A), the claimant is required to correctly apportion the fee to that merchandise that provides the basis for drawback when calculating the amount of drawback requested on the drawback entry. This is determined as follows:

      (i)  The value of each line item of entered merchandise subject to a merchandise processing fee is calculated (to four decimal places) by dividing the value of the line item subject to the fee by the total value of entered merchandise subject to the fee. The resulting value forms the relative value ratio.

      (ii)  To apportion the merchandise processing fee to each line item, the relative value ratio for each line item is multiplied by the merchandise processing fee paid.

      (iii)  The amount of merchandise processing fee apportioned to each line item is multiplied by 99 percent to calculate that portion of the fee attributable to each line item that is eligible for drawback.

      (iv)  To calculate the amount of a merchandise processing fee eligible for drawback per unit of merchandise, the line item amount that is eligible for drawback is divided by the number of units covered by that line item (to two decimal places).

      (c) —(1)  Drawback claimants are required to provide, on all drawback claims they submit, the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) number(s) for the designated imported merchandise and the HTSUS number(s) or the Schedule B commodity number(s) for the exported article or articles.

      (2)  For imports, HTSUS numbers shall be provided from the entry summary(s) and other entry documentation, when the claimant is the importer of record, or from the certificate of delivery and/or the certificate of manufacture and delivery, otherwise. Manufacturing drawback claimants filing drawback claims based on certificate(s) of manufacture and delivery filed with the claims or previously filed with Customs (see paragraph (a) of this section), may meet this requirement with the HTSUS number(s) for the designated imported merchandise on such certificate(s).

      (3)  For exports, the HTSUSA number(s) or Schedule B commodity classification number(s) must be from the Electronic Export Information (EEI), when required. If no EEI is required (see, e.g., 15 CFR 30.58), the claimant must provide the Schedule B commodity classification number(s) or HTSUSA number(s) that the exporter would have set forth in the EEI, but for the exemption from the requirement to file EEI.

      (4)  The HTSUS numbers and Schedule B commodity numbers shall be stated to at least 6 digits.

      (5)  For imports, HTSUS numbers are required for merchandise entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after April 6, 1998. For exports, HTSUS numbers or Schedule B commodity numbers are required for exported merchandise or articles exported on or after the date 1 year after April 6, 1998.

      (d)  For manufacturing drawback, the claimant shall file the drawback claim with the drawback office listed, as appropriate, in the general manufacturing drawback ruling or the specific manufacturing drawback ruling (see §§ 191.7 and 191.8 of this part). For other kinds of drawback, the claimant shall file the claim with any drawback office.

      (e) —(1)  A completed drawback claim, with all required documents, shall be filed within 3 years after the date of exportation or destruction of the merchandise or articles which are the subject of the claim. Except for landing certificates (see § 191.76 of this part), or unless this time is extended as provided in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, claims not completed within the 3-year period shall be considered abandoned. Except as provided in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, no extension will be granted unless it is established that Customs was responsible for the untimely filing.

      (2)  The 3-year period for filing a completed drawback claim provided for in paragraph (e)(1) of this section may be extended for a period not to exceed 18 months if:

      (i) The claimant establishes to the satisfaction of Customs that the claimant was unable to file the drawback claim because of an event declared by the President to be a major disaster, within the meaning given to that term in 42 U.S.C. 5122(2), on or after January 1, 1994; and

      (ii) The claimant files a request for such extension with Customs within 1 year from the last day of the 3-year period referred to in paragraph (e)(1) of this section.

      (3)  If an extension is granted with respect to a request filed under paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section, the periods of time for retaining records under 19 U.S.C. 1508(c)(3) shall be extended for an additional 18 months.

      § 191.52   Rejecting, perfecting or amending claims.

#### § § 191.52

      (a)  Upon review of a drawback claim, if the claim is determined to be incomplete (see § 191.51(a)(1)), the claim will be rejected and Customs will notify the filer in writing. The filer shall then have the opportunity to complete the claim subject to the requirement for filing a complete claim within 3 years.

      (b)  If Customs determines that the claim is complete according to the requirements of § 191.51(a)(1), but that additional evidence or information is required, Customs will notify the filer in writing. The claimant shall furnish, or have the appropriate party furnish, the evidence or information requested within 30 days of the date of notification by Customs. Customs may extend this 30 day period for good cause if the claimant files a written request for such extension within the 30 day period. The evidence or information required under this paragraph may be filed more than 3 years after the date of exportation or destruction of the articles which are the subject of the claim. Such additional evidence or information may include, but is not limited to:

      (1) The export bill of lading or other actual evidence of exportation, as provided for in § 191.72(a) of this part, which shall show that the articles were shipped by the person filing the drawback entry, or a letter of endorsement from the party in whose name the articles were shipped which shall be attached to such bill of lading, showing that the party filing the entry is authorized to claim drawback and receive payment (the claimant shall have on file and make available to Customs upon request, the endorsement from the exporter assigning the right to claim drawback);

      (2) A copy of the import entry and invoice annotated for the merchandise identified or designated;

      (3) A copy of the export invoice annotated to indicate the items on which drawback is being claimed; and

      (4) Certificate(s) of delivery upon which the claim is based (see § 191.10(e) of this part).

      (c)  Amendments to claims for which the drawback entries have not been liquidated must be made within three (3) years after the date of exportation or destruction of the articles which are the subject of the original drawback claim. Liquidated drawback entries may not be amended; however, they may be protested as provided for in § 191.84 of this part and part 174 of this chapter.

      § 191.53   Restructuring of claims.

#### § § 191.53

      (a)  Customs may require claimants to restructure their drawback claims in such a manner as to foster Customs administrative efficiency. In making this determination, Customs will consider the following factors:

      (1) The number of transactions of the claimant (imports and exports);

      (2) The value of the claims;

      (3) The frequency of claims;

      (4) The product or products being claimed; and

      (5) For 19 U.S.C. 1313(a) and 1313(b) claims, the provisions, as applicable, of the general manufacturing drawback ruling or the specific manufacturing drawback ruling.

      (b)  In order to be exempt from a restructuring, a claimant must demonstrate an inability or impracticability in restructuring its claims as required by Customs and must provide a mutually acceptable alternative. Criteria used in such determination will include a demonstration by the claimant of one or more of the following:

      (1) Complexities caused by multiple commodities or the applicable general manufacturing drawback ruling or the specific manufacturing drawback ruling;

      (2) Variable and conflicting manufacturing and inventory periods (for example, financial, accounting and manufacturing records maintained are significantly different);

      (3) Complexities caused by multiple manufacturing locations;

      (4) Complexities caused by difficulty in adjusting accounting and inventory records (for example, records maintained—financial or accounting—are significantly different); and/or

      (5) Complexities caused by significantly different methods of operation.

    Subpart F—Verification of Claims

      § 191.61   Verification of drawback claims.

#### § § 191.61

      (a) —(1)  All claims shall be subject to verification by the port director where the claim is filed.

      (2)  The port director selecting the claim for verification may forward copies of the claim and, as applicable, letters of notification and acknowledgement for the general manufacturing drawback ruling or application and letter of approval for a specific manufacturing drawback ruling, and request for verification, to other drawback offices when deemed necessary.

      (b)  The verifying office shall verify compliance with the law and this part, the accuracy of the related general manufacturing drawback ruling or specific manufacturing drawback ruling (as applicable), and the selected drawback claims. Verification may include an examination of all records relating to the transaction(s).

      (c)  When a claim has been selected for verification, liquidation will be postponed only on the drawback entries for those claims selected for verification. Postponement will continue in effect until the verification has been completed and the appropriate port director issues a report. In the event that a substantial error is revealed during the verification, Customs may postpone liquidation of all related product line claims, or, in Customs discretion, all claims for that claimant.

      (d) —(1)  If verification of a drawback claim filed under a specific manufacturing drawback ruling (see § 191.8 of this part) reveals errors of deficiencies in the drawback ruling or application therefor, the port director shall promptly inform CBP Headquarters (Attention: Entry Process and Duty Refunds Branch, Regulations and Rulings, Office of International Trade).

      (2)  If verification of a drawback claim filed under a general manufacturing drawback ruling (see § 191.7 of this part) reveals errors or deficiencies in a general manufacturing drawback ruling, the letter of notification of intent to operate under the general manufacturing drawback ruling, or the acknowledgment of the letter of notification of intent, the port director shall promptly inform CBP Headquarters (Attention: Entry Process and Duty Refunds Branch, Regulations and Rulings, Office of International Trade).

      (3)  CBP Headquarters shall review the stated errors or deficiencies and take appropriate action (see 19 U.S.C. 1625; 19 CFR part 177).

Within 4 working days after receipt of the Customs Form 7553, Customs shall advise the filer in writing of its determination to witness or not to witness the destruction. If the filer of the notice is not so notified within 4 working days, the merchandise may be destroyed without delay and will be deemed to have been destroyed under Customs supervision. Unless Customs determines to witness the destruction, the destruction of the articles following timely notification on Customs Form 7553 shall be deemed to have occurred under Customs supervision. If Customs attends the destruction, it must certify the Notice of Intent to Export, Destroy, or Return Merchandise for Purposes of Drawback.

      (b)  When Customs does not attend the destruction, the claimant must submit evidence that destruction took place in accordance with the approved Notice of Intent to Export, Destroy, or Return Merchandise for Purposes of Drawback. The evidence must be issued by a disinterested third party (for example, a landfill operator). The type of evidence depends on the method and place of destruction, but must establish that the merchandise was, in fact, destroyed within the meaning of “destruction” in § 191.2(g) ( that no articles of commercial value remained after destruction).

      (c)  After destruction, the claimant must provide the Customs Form 7553, certified by the Customs official witnessing the destruction in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section, to Customs as part of the completed drawback claim based on the destruction (see § 191.51(a) of this part). If Customs has not attended the destruction, the claimant must provide the evidence that destruction took place in accordance with the approved Customs Form 7553, as provided for in paragraph (b) of this section, as part of the completed drawback claim based on the destruction (see § 191.51(a) of this part).

      (c) —(1)  The claimant, whether or not the exporter, shall maintain the Chronological Summary of Exports and such additional evidence of exportation required by Customs to establish fully the identity of the exported articles and the fact of exportation. Actual evidence of exportation, as described in § 191.72(a) of this subpart, is the primary evidence of export for drawback purposes.

      (2)  The claimant shall submit as part of the claim the Chronological Summary of Exports (see § 191.51). The claimant shall retain records supporting the Chronological Summary of Exports for 3 years after payment of the related claim, and such records are subject to review by Customs.

#### § § 191.74

      If the merchandise on which drawback is to be claimed is exported by mail or parcel post, the official postal records (original or copies) which describe the mail shipment shall be sufficient to prove exportation.

The certificate shall show the exact time of landing in the foreign destination and describe the aircraft or parts subject to drawback in sufficient detail to enable Customs officers to identify them with the documentation of exportation.

      (b)  A landing certificate shall be filed within one year from the written Customs request, unless Customs Headquarters grants an extension.

      (c)  A landing certificate shall be signed by a revenue officer of the foreign country of the export's destination, unless the embassy of that country certifies in writing that there is no Customs administration in that country, in which case the landing certificate may be signed by the consignee or the carrier's agent at the place of unlading.

    Subpart H—Liquidation and Protest of Drawback Entries

      § 191.81   Liquidation.

#### § § 191.81

      (a)  Drawback entries may be liquidated after:

      (1) Liquidation of the designated import entry or entries becomes final pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section; or

      (2) Deposit of estimated duties on the imported merchandise and before liquidation of the designated import entry or entries.

      (b)  (1) Drawback may be paid upon liquidation of a claim based on estimated duties if one or more of the designated import entries have not been liquidated, or the liquidation has not become final (because of a protest being filed) ( also § 173.4(c) of this chapter), only if the drawback claimant and any other party responsible for the payment of liquidated import duties each files a written request for payment of each drawback claim, waiving any right to payment or refund under other provisions of law, to the extent that the estimated duties on the unliquidated import entry are included in the drawback claim for which drawback on estimated duties is requested under this paragraph. The drawback claimant must, to the best of its knowledge, identify each import entry that has been protested and that is included in the drawback claim. A drawback entry, once finally liquidated on the basis of estimated duties pursuant to paragraph (e)(2) of this section, will not be adjusted by reason of a subsequent final liquidation of the import entry.

      (2) However, if final liquidation of the import entry discloses that the total amount of import duty is different from the total estimated duties deposited, except in those cases when drawback is 100% of the duty, the party responsible for the payment of liquidated duties, as applicable, will:

      (i) Be liable for 1 percent of all increased duties found to be due on that portion of merchandise recorded on the drawback entry; or

      (ii) Be entitled to a refund of 1 percent of all excess duties found to have been paid as estimated duties on that portion of the merchandise recorded on the drawback entry.

      (c) —(1)  Subject to the requirements in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, drawback may be paid upon liquidation of a claim based on voluntary tenders of the unpaid amount of lawful ordinary customs duties or any other payment of lawful ordinary customs duties for an entry, or withdrawal from warehouse, for consumption ( § 191.3(a)(1)(iii)), provided that:

      (i) The tender or payment is specifically identified as duty on a specifically identified entry, or withdrawal from warehouse, for consumption;

      (ii) Liquidation of the specifically identified entry, or withdrawal from warehouse, for consumption became final prior to such tender or payment; and

      (iii) Liquidation of the drawback entry in which that specifically identified import entry, or withdrawal from warehouse, for consumption is designated has not become final.

      (2)  Drawback may be paid on claims based on voluntary tenders or other payments of duties under this subsection only if the drawback claimant and any other party responsible for the payment of the voluntary tenders or other payments of duties each files a written request for payment of each drawback claim based on such voluntary tenders or other payments of duties, waiving any claim to payment or refund under other provisions of law, to the extent that the voluntary tenders or other payment of duties under this paragraph are included in the drawback claim for which drawback on the voluntary tenders or other payment of duties is requested under this paragraph.

      (d)  Drawback will be based on the final liquidated duties paid that have been made final by operation of law (except in the case of the written request for payment of drawback on the basis of estimated duties, voluntary tender of duties, and other payments of duty, and waiver, provided for in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section).

      (e)  (1)  When the drawback claim has been completed by the filing of the entry and other required documents, and exportation (or destruction) of the merchandise or articles has been established, CBP will determine drawback due on the basis of the complete drawback claim, the applicable general manufacturing drawback ruling or specific manufacturing drawback ruling, and any other relevant evidence or information. Notice of liquidation will be given electronically as provided in §§ 159.9 and 159.10(c)(3) of this chapter.

      (2)  (i)  A drawback claim that satisfies the requirements of paragraph (d) that is not liquidated within 1 year from the date of the drawback claim ( § 190.51(e)(1)(i) of this chapter) will be deemed liquidated for the purposes of the drawback claim at the drawback amount asserted by the claimant or claim, unless the time for liquidation is extended in accordance with § 159.12 of this chapter or if liquidation is suspended as required by statute or court order.

      (ii)  A drawback claim that satisfies the requirements of paragraphs (b) or (c) of this section will be deemed liquidated upon the deposit of estimated duties on the unliquidated imported merchandise ( paragraph (b) of this section).

      (iii)  The provisions of paragraphs (e)(2)(i) of this section will apply to drawback entries made on or after December 3, 2004. An entry or claim for drawback filed before December 3, 2004, the liquidation of which was not final as of December 3, 2004, will be deemed liquidated on the date that is 1 year after December 3, 2004, at the drawback amount asserted by the claimant at the time of the entry or claim.

      (f) —(1)  Where two or more products result from the manufacture or production of merchandise, drawback will be distributed to the several products in accordance with their relative values at the time of separation.

      (2)  The values to be used in computing the distribution of drawback where two or more products result from the manufacture or production of merchandise under drawback conditions must be the market value (as provided for in the definition of relative value in § 191.2(u)), unless other values are approved by CBP.

      (g)  CBP will authorize payment of the amount of the refund due as drawback to the claimant.

The previously approved waiver of prior notice shall terminate at the end of such 1-year period unless the claimant applies for waiver of prior notice under this section. If a claimant approved for waiver of prior notice as of April 6, 1998 applies for waiver of prior notice under this section within such 1-year period, the claimant may continue to operate under its existing waiver of prior notice until Customs approves or denies the application for waiver of prior notice under this section, subject to the provisions in this section (see, in particular, paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section).

      (3)  When a claimant (predecessor) is approved for waiver of prior notice under this section and all of the rights, privileges, immunities, powers, duties and liabilities of the claimant are transferred by written agreement, merger, or corporate resolution to a successor, such approval of waiver of prior notice shall remain in effect for a period of 1 year after such transfer. The approval of waiver of prior notice shall terminate at the end of such 1-year period unless the successor applies for waiver of prior notice under this section. If such successor applies for waiver of prior notice under this section within such 1-year period, the successor may continue to operate under the predecessor's waiver of prior notice until Customs approves or denies the successor's application for waiver of prior notice under this section, subject to the provisions in this section (see, in particular, paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section).

      (iii) A certification that the following documentary evidence will be made available for Customs review upon request:

      (d)  An approval of waiver of prior notice may be stayed, for a specified reasonable period, should Customs desire for any reason to examine the merchandise being exported with drawback prior to its exportation for purposes of verification. Customs shall provide written notice, by registered or certified mail, of such a stay to the person for whom waiver of prior notice was approved. Customs shall specify the reason(s) for the stay in such written notice. The stay shall take effect 2 working days after the date the person signs the return post office receipt for the registered or certified mail. The stay shall remain in effect for the period specified in the written notice, or until such earlier date as Customs notifies the person for whom waiver of prior notice was approved in writing that the reason for the stay has been satisfied. After the stay is lifted, operation under the waiver of prior notice procedure may resume for exports on or after the date the stay is lifted.

      (e)  Customs may propose to revoke the approval of an application for waiver of prior notice of intent to export, under this section, for good cause (noncompliance with the drawback law and/or regulations). Customs shall give written notice of the proposed revocation of a waiver of prior notice of intent to export.

      (f)  Action by the appropriate drawback office to approve, deny, stay, or revoke waiver of prior notice of intent to export, unless reversed by Customs Headquarters, will govern the applicant's eligibility for this procedure in all Customs drawback offices. If the application for waiver of prior notice of intent to export is approved, the claimant shall refer to such approval in the first drawback claim filed after such approval in the drawback office approving waiver of prior notice and shall submit a copy of the approval letter with the first drawback claim filed in any drawback office other than the approving office, when the export upon which the claim is based was without prior notice, under this section.

      (g)  An appeal of a denial of an application under this section, or challenge to the proposed revocation of an approved application under this section, may be made by letter to the drawback office issuing the denial or proposed revocation and must be filed within 30 days of the date of denial or proposed revocation. A denial of an appeal or challenge made to the drawback office may itself be appealed to CBP Headquarters, Office of International Trade, Trade Policy and Programs, and must be filed within 30 days of the denial date of the initial appeal or challenge.

      § 191.92   Accelerated payment.

#### § § 191.92

      (a) —(1)  Accelerated payment of drawback is available under this section on drawback claims under this part, unless specifically excepted from such accelerated payment. Accelerated payment of drawback consists of the payment of estimated drawback before liquidation of the drawback entry. Accelerated payment of drawback is only available when Customs review of the request for accelerated payment of drawback does not find omissions from, or inconsistencies with the requirements of the drawback law and part 191 (see, especially, subpart E of this part). Accelerated payment of a drawback claim does not constitute liquidation of the drawback entry.

      (2)  For claimants approved for accelerated payment of drawback as of April 6, 1998, such approval of accelerated payment shall remain in effect, under the Customs Regulations in effect as of the time of the approval of accelerated payment, for a period of 1 year after April 6, 1998. The previously approved accelerated payment of drawback shall terminate at the end of such 1-year period unless the claimant applies for accelerated payment under this section. If a claimant approved for accelerated payment of drawback as of April 6, 1998 applies for accelerated payment under this section within such 1-year period, the claimant may continue to operate under its existing approval of accelerated payment until Customs approves or denies the application for accelerated payment under this section, subject to the provisions in this section (see, in particular, paragraph (f) of this section).

      (3)  When a claimant (predecessor) is approved for accelerated payment of drawback under this section and all of the rights, privileges, immunities, powers, duties and liabilities of the claimant are transferred by written agreement, merger, or corporate resolution to a successor, such approval of accelerated payment shall remain in effect for a period of 1 year after such transfer. The approval of accelerated payment of drawback shall terminate at the end of such 1-year period unless the successor applies for accelerated payment of drawback under this section. If such successor applies for accelerated payment of drawback under this section within such 1-year period, the successor may continue to operate under the predecessor's approval of accelerated payment until Customs approves or denies the successor's application for accelerated payment under this section, subject to the provisions in this section (see, in particular, paragraph (f) of this section).

      (b)  A person who wishes to apply for accelerated payment of drawback must file a written application with the drawback office where claims will be filed.

      (ii) Internal Revenue Service (IRS) number (with suffix);

      (iii) Identity (by name and title) of the person in claimant's organization who will be responsible for the drawback program;

      (B) Dollar amount of bond coverage for the first year under the accelerated payment procedure; and

      (C) Procedures to ensure that bond coverage remains adequate (that is, procedures to alert the applicant when and if its accelerated payment potential liability exceeds its bond coverage);

      (v) Description of merchandise and/or articles covered by the application;

      (vi) Type(s) of drawback covered by the application; and

      (vii) Estimated dollar value of potential drawback during the next 12-month period covered by the application.

      (3)  In or with the application, the applicant must also submit a certification, signed by the applicant, that all applicable statutory and regulatory requirements for drawback will be met.

      (4)  With the application, the applicant must submit a description (with sample documents) of how the applicant will ensure compliance with its certification that the statutory and regulatory drawback requirements will be met. This description may be in the form of a booklet. The detail contained in this description should vary depending on the size and complexity of the applicant's accelerated drawback program (for example, if the dollar amount is great and there are several kinds of drawback involved, with differing inventory, manufacturing, and shipping methods, greater detail in the description will be required). The description must include at least:

      (i) The name of the official in the claimant's organization who is responsible for oversight of the claimant's drawback program;

      (ii) The procedures and controls demonstrating compliance with the statutory and regulatory drawback requirements;

      (c)  The drawback office, upon request, shall provide applicants for accelerated payment with a sample letter format to assist them in preparing their submissions.

      (d)  If approved for accelerated payment, the claimant must furnish a properly executed bond in an amount sufficient to cover the estimated amount of drawback to be claimed during the term of the bond. If outstanding accelerated drawback claims exceed the amount of the bond, the drawback office will require additional bond coverage as necessary before additional accelerated payments are made.

      (e) —(1)  The drawback office shall review and verify the information submitted in and with the application. In order for Customs to evaluate the application, Customs may request additional information (including additional sample documents) and/or explanations of any of the information provided for in paragraph (b)(4) of this section. Based on the information submitted on and with the application and any information so requested, and based on the applicant's record of transactions with Customs, the drawback office will approve or deny the application. The criteria to be considered in reviewing the applicant's record with Customs include, but are not limited to (as applicable):

      (i) The presence or absence of unresolved Customs charges (duties, taxes, or other debts owed Customs);

      (ii) The accuracy of the claimant's past drawback claims; and

      (iii) Whether accelerated payment of drawback or waiver of prior notice of intent to export was previously revoked or suspended.

      (2)  Customs will notify the applicant in writing within 90 days of receipt of the application of its decision to approve or deny the application, or of Customs inability to approve, deny, or act on the application and the reason therefor.

      (3)  The approval of an application for accelerated payment, under this section, shall be effective as of the date of Customs written notification of approval under paragraph (e)(2) of this section. Accelerated payment of drawback shall be available under this section to unliquidated drawback claims filed before and after such date. For claims filed before such date, accelerated payment of drawback shall be paid only if the claimant furnishes a properly executed single transaction bond covering the claim, in an amount sufficient to cover the amount of accelerated drawback to be paid on the claim.

      (4)  If an application for accelerated payment of drawback under this section is denied, the applicant shall be given written notice, specifying the grounds therefor, together with what corrective action may be taken, and informing the applicant that the denial may be appealed in the manner prescribed in paragraph (i) of this section. The applicant may not reapply for accelerated payment of drawback until the reason for the denial is resolved.

      (f)  Customs may propose to revoke the approval of an application for accelerated payment of drawback under this section, for good cause (that is, noncompliance with the drawback law and/or regulations). In case of such proposed revocation, Customs shall give written notice, by registered or certified mail, of the proposed revocation of the approval of accelerated payment. The notice shall specify the reasons for Customs proposed action and the procedures for challenging Customs proposed revocation action as prescribed in paragraph (h) of this section. The revocation shall take effect 30 days after the date of the proposed revocation if not timely challenged under paragraph (h) of this section. If timely challenged, the revocation will take effect after completion of the challenge procedures in paragraph (h) of this section unless the challenge is successful.

      (g)  Action by the appropriate drawback office to approve, deny, or revoke accelerated payment of drawback will govern the applicant's eligibility for this procedure in all Customs drawback offices. If the application for accelerated payment of drawback is approved, the claimant shall refer to such approval in the first drawback claim filed after such approval in the drawback office approving accelerated payment of drawback and shall submit a copy of the approval letter with the first drawback claim filed in a drawback office other than the approving office.

      (h)  An appeal of a denial of an application under this section, or challenge to the proposed revocation of an approved application under this section, may be made in writing to the drawback office issuing the denial or proposed revocation and must be filed within 30 days of the date of denial or proposed revocation. A denial of an appeal or challenge made to the drawback office may itself be appealed to CBP Headquarters, Office of International Trade, Trade Policy and Programs, and must be filed within 30 days. The 30-day period for appeal or challenge to the drawback office or to CBP Headquarters may be extended for good cause, upon written request by the applicant or holder for such extension filed with the appropriate office within the 30-day period.

      § 191.172   Definitions.

#### § § 191.172

      The following are definitions for purposes of this subpart only:

      (a)  “Qualified article” means an article described in headings 2707, 2708, 2710 through 2715, 2901, 2902, 2909.19.14, or 3901 through 3914 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS). In the case of an article described in headings 3901 through 3914, the definition covers the article in its primary forms as provided in Note 6 to chapter 39 of the HTSUS.

      (b)  “Same kind and quality article” means an article which is commercially interchangeable with, or which is referred to under the same 8-digit classification of the HTSUS as, the article to which it is compared. (For example, unleaded gasoline and jet fuel (naphtha or kerosene-type), both falling under the same HTSUS classification (2710.00.15) would be considered same kind and quality articles because they fall under the same 8 digit HTSUS classification, even though they are not “commercially interchangeable”.)

      (c)  “Exported article” means an article which has been exported and is the qualified article, an article of the same kind and quality as the qualified article, or any combination thereof.

#### § § 191.191

      This subpart sets forth the requirements for the Customs drawback compliance program in which claimants and other parties in interest, including Customs brokers, may participate after being certified by Customs.

Certification requirements shall take into account the size and nature of the party's drawback program, the type of drawback claims filed, and the volume of claims filed. Whether the party is a drawback claimant, a broker, or one that provides data and documentation on which a drawback claim is based, will also be considered.

      (b)  In order to be certified as a participant in the drawback compliance program or negotiated alternative drawback compliance program, the party must be able to demonstrate that it:

      (c)  A Customs broker may be certified as a participant in the drawback compliance program only on behalf of a given claimant (see § 191.194(b)). To do so, a Customs broker who is employed to assist a claimant in filing for drawback must be able to demonstrate, for and on behalf of such claimant, conformity with the core requirements of the drawback compliance program as set forth in paragraph (b) of this section. The broker shall ensure that the claimant has the necessary documentation and records to support the drawback compliance program established on its behalf, and that claims to be filed under the program are reviewed by the broker for accuracy and completeness.

      (2)  The drawback office shall review and verify the information submitted in and with the application. In order for CBP to evaluate the application, CBP may request additional information (including additional sample documents) and/or explanations of any of the information provided for in § 191.193(c) and (d) of this subpart. Based on the information submitted on and with the application and any information so requested, and based on the applicant's record of transactions with CBP, the drawback office will approve or deny the application. The criteria to be considered in reviewing the applicant's record with CBP shall include (as applicable):

      (ii) The accuracy of the claimant's past drawback claims; and

      (iii) Whether accelerated payment of drawback or waiver of prior notice of intent to export was previously revoked or suspended.

      (b)  Certification as a participant in the drawback compliance program will be given to applicants whose applications are approved under the criteria in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. The applicable drawback office will give written notification to an applicant of its certification as a participant in the drawback compliance program.

Repeated violations by a participant, including a CBP broker, may result in the issuance of penalties and the removal of certification under the program until corrective action, satisfactory to CBP, is taken.

      (d)  If certification as a participant in the drawback compliance program is denied to an applicant, the applicant shall be given written notice by the applicable drawback office, specifying the grounds for such denial, together with any action that may be taken to correct the perceived deficiencies, and informing the applicant that such denial may be appealed to the appropriate drawback office and then appealed to CBP Headquarters.

      (e) —(1)  The certification for participation in the drawback compliance program by a party may be removed when any of the following conditions are discovered:

      (i) The certification privilege was obtained through fraud or mistake of fact;

      (ii) The program participant is no longer in compliance with the customs laws and CBP regulations, including the requirements set forth in § 191.192;

      (iii) The program participant repeatedly files false drawback claims or false or misleading documentation or other information relating to such claims; or

      (iv) The program participant is convicted of any felony or has committed acts which would constitute a misdemeanor or felony involving theft, smuggling, or any theft-connected crime.

      (2)  If CBP determines that the certification of a program participant should be removed, the applicable drawback office will serve the program participant with written notice of the removal. Such notice will inform the program participant of the grounds for the removal and will advise the program participant of its right to file an appeal of the removal in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section.

      (3)  The removal of certification will be effective immediately in cases of willfulness on the part of the program participant or when required by public health, interest, or safety. In all other cases, the removal of certification will be effective when the program participant has received notice under paragraph (e)(2) of this section and either no appeal has been filed within the time limit prescribed in paragraph (f)(2) of this section or all appeal procedures have been concluded by a decision that upholds the removal action. Removal of certification may subject the affected person to penalties.

      (f) —(1)  A party may challenge a denial of an application for certification as a participant in the drawback compliance program by filing a written appeal, within 30 days of issuance of the notice of denial, with the applicable drawback office. A denial of an appeal may itself be appealed to CBP Headquarters, Trade Policy and Programs, Office of International Trade, within 30 days after issuance of the applicable drawback office's appeal decision. CBP Headquarters will review the appeal and will respond with a written decision within 30 days after receipt of the appeal unless circumstances require a delay in issuance of the decision. If the decision cannot be issued within the 30-day period, CBP Headquarters will advise the appellant of the reasons for the delay and of any further actions which will be carried out to complete the appeal review and of the anticipated date for issuance of the appeal decision.

      (2)  A party who has received a CBP notice of removal of certification for participation in the drawback compliance program may challenge the removal by filing a written appeal, within 30 days after issuance of the notice of removal, with the applicable drawback office. A denial of an appeal may itself be appealed to CBP Headquarters, Trade Policy and Programs, Office of International Trade, within 30 days after issuance of the applicable drawback office's appeal decision. CBP Headquarters will consider the allegations upon which the removal was based and the responses made to those allegations by the appellant and will render a written decision on the appeal within 30 days after receipt of the appeal.

      § 192.2   Requirements for exportation.

#### § § 192.2

      (a)  A person attempting to export a used self-propelled vehicle shall present to Customs, at the port of exportation, both the vehicle and the required documentation describing the vehicle, which includes the Vehicle Identification Number or, if the vehicle does not have a Vehicle Identification Number, the product identification number. Exportation of a vehicle will be permitted only upon compliance with these requirements, unless the vehicle was entered into the United States under an in-bond procedure, or under a carnet or Temporary Importation Bond; a vehicle entered under an in-bond procedure, or under a carnet or Temporary Importation Bond is exempt from these requirements. The person attempting to export the vehicle may employ an agent for the exportation of the vehicle.

      (b) —(1) —(i)  For used, self-propelled vehicles issued, by any jurisdiction in the United States, a Certificate of Title or a Salvage Title that remains in force, the owner must provide to Customs, at the time and place specified in this section, the original Certificate of Title or a certified copy of the Certificate of Title and two complete copies of the original Certificate of Title or certified copy of the original.

      (ii)  If the used, self-propelled vehicle is leased or a recorded lien exists in the U.S., in addition to complying with paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, the provisional owner must provide to Customs a separate writing from the third-party-in-interest which expressly provides that the subject vehicle may be exported. This writing must be on the third-party's letterhead paper, and contain a complete description of the vehicle including the Vehicle Identification Number (VIN), the name of the owner or lienholder of the leased vehicle, and the telephone numbers at which that owner or lienholder may be contacted. The writing must bear an original signature of the third-party and state the date it was signed.

      (iii)  If the used, self-propelled vehicle is owned by a U.S. government employee and is being exported in conjunction with that employee's reassignment abroad pursuant to official travel orders, then, in lieu of complying with paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, the employee may be required to establish that he has complied with the sponsoring agency's internal travel department procedures for vehicle export.

      (2)  For used, self-propelled vehicles that are registered or titled abroad, the owner must provide to Customs, at the time and place specified in this section, the original document that provides satisfactory proof of ownership (with an English translation of the text if the original language is not in English), and two complete copies of that document (and translation, if necessary).

      (3) —(i)  For newly-manufactured, self-propelled vehicles that are purchased from a U.S. manufacturer, distributor, or dealer that become used, as defined in this subpart, and are issued a Manufacturer's Statement of Origin (MSO), but not issued a Certificate of Title by any jurisdiction of the United States, the owner must provide to Customs, at the time and place specified in this section, the original MSO and two complete copies of the original MSO.

      (ii)  For newly-manufactured, self-propelled vehicles purchased from a U.S. manufacturer, distributor, or dealer that become used, as defined in this subpart, and not issued an MSO or a Certificate of Title by any jurisdiction of the United States, the owner must establish that the jurisdiction from where the vehicle comes does not have any ownership documentation requirements regarding such vehicles and provide to Customs, at the time and place specified in this section, an original document that proves ownership, such as a dealer's invoice, and two complete copies of such original documentation.

      (iii)  For used, self-propelled vehicles for which a junk or scrap certificate issued, by any jurisdiction of the United States, remains in force, the owner must provide to Customs, at the time and place specified in this section, the original certificate or a certified copy of the original document and two complete copies of the original document or certified copy of the original.

      (iv)  For used, self-propelled vehicles that were issued, by any jurisdiction of the United States, a title or certificate that is no longer in force, or that are not required to be titled or registered, and for which an MSO was not issued, the owner must establish that the jurisdiction from where the vehicle comes does not have any ownership documentation requirements regarding such vehicles and provide to Customs, at the time and place specified in this section, the original document that shows his basis for ownership or right of possession, such as a bill of sale, and two complete copies of that original document. Further, the owner must certify in writing to Customs that the procurement of the vehicle was a bona fide transaction, and that the vehicle presented for export is not stolen.

      (c) —(1)  For those vehicles exported by vessel or aircraft, the required documentation and the vehicle must be presented to Customs at least 72 hours prior to export.

      (2)  For those vehicles exported by rail, highway, or under their own power:

      (i) The required documentation must be submitted to Customs at least 72 hours prior to export; and

      (ii) The vehicle must be presented to Customs at the time of exportation.

      (d)  Port directors will establish locations at which exporters must present the required documentation and the vehicles for inspection. Port directors will publicize these locations, including their hours of operation.

      (e)  Customs will determine the authenticity of the documents submitted. Once the authenticity of the documents is established, Customs will mark the documents. In most cases the original document(s) will be returned to the exporter. In those cases where the original title document was presented to and retained by Customs and cannot be found prior to the vehicle's export, the exporter's authenticated copy of the original documentation serves as evidence of compliance with the reporting requirements.

      (d) Any stolen self-propelled vehicle, vessel or aircraft or part thereof or any self-propelled vehicle or part of a self-propelled vehicle from which the identification number has been removed, obliterated, tampered with or altered may be subject to seizure and foreiture pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 1627a.

      § 192.4   Liability of carriers.

#### § § 192.4

      Under the provisions of 19 U.S.C. 1436, the vessel master is charged with the responsibility for presenting a true manifest. If used vehicles are not included on the manifest or are inaccurately described thereon, a liability for penalties may be incurred.

    Subpart B—Filing of Export Information Through the Automated Export System (AES)

**Source:** Source: T.D. 99-57, 64 FR 40987, July 28, 1999, unless otherwise noted.

      § 192.11   Description of the AES.

#### § § 192.11

      The Automated Export System (AES) is the information system for collecting Electronic Export Information (EEI) from persons exporting goods from the United States, Puerto Rico, or the U.S. Virgin Islands; between Puerto Rico and the United States; and to the U.S. Virgin Islands from the United States or Puerto Rico. Pursuant to the Census Bureau's Foreign Trade Regulations (FTR), all commodity export information for which EEI is required must be filed through the AES. This system is the CBP-approved electronic data interchange system used for purposes of filing EEI as required by § 192.14. AES is also the system by which certain sea carriers may report required outbound vessel information electronically ( §§ 4.63, 4.75, and 4.76 of this chapter). Eligibility and application procedures are found in the General Requirements section of the FTR, codified at 15 CFR part 30, subpart A. The Census Bureau's FTR (15 CFR part 30, subpart A) provides that exporters may choose to submit export information through AES by any one of three electronic filing options available. Only Option 4, the complete post-departure submission of export information, requires prior approval by participating agencies before it can be used by AES participants.

      § 192.12   Criteria for denial of applications requesting AES post-departure (Option 4) filing status; appeal procedures.

#### § § 192.12

      (a)  Applications for the option of filing export commodity information electronically through AES after the vessel has departed (Option 4 filing status) must be unanimously approved by Customs, Census and other participating government agencies. Disapproval by one of the participating agencies will cause rejection of the application.

      (b)  Customs may deny a participant's application for any of the following reasons:

      (1) The applicant is not an exporter, as defined in the Census Regulations (15 CFR 30.7(d));

      (2) The applicant has a history of non-compliance with export regulations (e.g., exporter has a history of late electronic submission of commodity records or a record of non-submission of required export documentation);

      (3) The applicant has been indicted, convicted, or is currently under an investigation, wherein Customs has developed probable cause, for a felony involving any Customs law or any export law administered by another government agency; or

      (4) The applicant has made or caused to be made in the “Letter of Intent”, a false or misleading statement or omission with respect to any material fact.

      (c)  Applicants will be notified of approval or denial in writing by Census. (Applicants whose applications are denied by other agencies must contact those agencies for their specific appeal procedures.) Applicants whose applications are denied by Customs will be provided with the specific reason(s) for non-selection. Applicants may challenge Customs decision by following the appeal procedure provided at § 192.13(b).

      § 192.13   Revocation of participants' AES post-departure (Option 4) filing privileges; appeal procedures.

#### § § 192.13

      (a)  Customs may revoke Option 4 privileges of participants for the following reasons:

      (1) The exporter has made or caused to be made in the “Letter of Intent”, a false or misleading statement or omission with respect to any material fact;

      (2) The exporter submitting the “Letter of Intent” is indicted, convicted, or is currently under an investigation, wherein Customs has developed probable cause, for a felony involving any Customs law or any export law administered by another government agency;

      (3) The exporter fails to substantially comply with export regulations; or

      (4) Continued participation in AES as an Option 4 filer would pose a threat to national security, such that continued participation in Option 4 should be terminated.

      (b)  When Customs has decided to revoke a participant's Option 4 filing privileges, the participant will be notified in writing of the reason(s) for the decision. The participant may challenge Customs decision by filing an appeal within thirty (30) calendar days of receipt of the notice of decision. Except as stated elsewhere in this paragraph, the revocation will become effective when the participant has either exhausted all appeal proceedings or thirty (30) calendar days after receipt of the notice of revocation if no appeal is filed. However, in cases of intentional violations of any Customs law on the part of the program participant or when required by the national security, revocations will become effective immediately upon notification. Appeals should be addressed to the Director, Outbound Programs, U.S. Customs, Ronald Reagan Building, 1300 Pennsylvania Ave, NW, Room 5.4c, Washington, DC 20229. Customs will issue a written decision or notice of extension to the participant within thirty (30) calendar days of receipt of the appeal. If a notice of extension is forwarded, the applicant will be provided with the reason(s) for extension of this time period and an expected date of decision. Participants who have had their Option 4 filing privileges revoked and applicants not selected to participate in Option 4 of AES may not reapply for this filing status for one year following written notification of rejection or revocation.

      § 192.14   Electronic information for outward cargo required in advance of departure.

#### § § 192.14

      (a)  Pursuant to section 343(a), Trade Act of 2002, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2071 note), for any commercial cargo that is to be exported from the United States by vessel, aircraft, rail, or truck, unless exempted under paragraph (d) of this section, the U.S. Principal Party in Interest (USPPI), the USPPI's authorized agent, or the authorized filing agent of the Foreign Principal Party in Interest (FPPI) must electronically transmit for receipt by CBP, no later than the time period specified in paragraph (b) of this section, certain Electronic Export Information (EEI), as enumerated in paragraph (c) of this section. Specifically, to effect the advance electronic transmission of the required cargo information to CBP, the USPPI, the USPPI's authorized agent, or the FPPI's authorized filing agent must use a CBP-approved electronic data interchange system (currently, the Automated Export System (AES)).

      (b) —(1)  The USPPI, the USPPI's authorized agent, or the FPPI's authorized filing agent must electronically transmit the EEI required by § 30.6 of the Census Bureau's FTR (15 CFR 30.6) and have received the AES Internal Transaction Number (ITN) (see paragraph (b)(3) of this section) for outbound cargo no later than the time period specified as follows:

      (i) For vessel cargo, the USPPI, the USPPI's authorized agent, or the FPPI's authorized filing agent must provide the EEI filing citation (the ITN), exclusion, and/or exemption legend to the exporting carrier no later than 24 hours prior to loading cargo on the vessel at the U.S. port of lading;

      (ii) For air cargo, including cargo being transported by air express couriers, the USPPI, the USPPI's authorized agent, or the FPPI's authorized filing agent must provide the EEI filing citation (the ITN), exclusion, and/or exemption legend to the exporting carrier no later than 2 hours prior to the scheduled departure time of the aircraft from the U.S. port of export;

      (iii) For truck cargo, including cargo departing by express consignment courier, the USPPI, the USPPI's authorized agent, or the FPPI's authorized filing agent must provide the EEI filing citation (the ITN), exclusion, and/or exemption legend to the exporting carrier no later than 1 hour prior to the arrival of the truck at the border;

      (iv) For rail cargo, the USPPI, the USPPI's authorized agent, or the FPPI's authorized filing agent must provide the EEI filing citation (the ITN), exclusion, and/or exemption legend to the exporting carrier no later than 2 hours prior to the arrival of the train at the border;

      (v) For shipments of used self-propelled vehicles as defined in § 192.1, the USPPI's authorized agent, or the FPPI's authorized filing agent must provide the EEI filing citation (the ITN), exclusion, and/or exemption legend to the exporting carrier at least 72 hours prior to export; and

      (vi) For cargo shipped by pipeline, the USPPI, the USPPI's authorized agent, or the FPPI's authorized filing agent should refer to § 30.4 of the Census Bureau's FTR (15 CFR 30.4, 30.46) for applicable time frames for the transmission of EEI.

      (2)  The time periods in paragraph (b)(1) of this section for reporting required EEI to CBP for outward vessel, air, truck, or rail cargo only apply to shipments without an export license, license exemption, or license exception that require full predeparture reporting of shipment data, in order to comply with the advance cargo information filing requirements under section 343(a), Trade Act of 2002, as amended. Requirements placed on exports controlled by other government agencies will remain in force unless changed by the agency having the regulatory authority to do so. CBP will also continue to require 72-hour advance notice for used vehicle exports pursuant to § 192.2(c)(1) and (c)(2)(i). The USPPI, the USPPI's authorized agent, or the FPPI's authorized filing agent should refer to the relevant titles of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) for pre-filing requirements of other government agencies. In particular, for the advance reporting requirements for exports of U.S. Munitions List items, see the U.S. Department of State's International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) (22 CFR parts 120 through 130).

      (3)  Once the USPPI, the USPPI's authorized agent, or the FPPI's authorized filing agent has transmitted the EEI required under paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section, and AES has received and accepted this data, AES will generate and transmit to the party that filed the EEI a confirmation number, the Internal Transaction Number (ITN), assigned to that shipment confirming acceptance of the EEI transmission. When the submission is not accepted, a rejection message will be transmitted to the filer.

      (c) —(1)  The commodity data elements that are required to be reported electronically through the approved system are found in § 30.6 of the Census Bureau's FTR (15 CFR 30.6).

      (2)  The following transportation data elements are also required to be reported electronically through the approved system. These data elements are also found in § 30.6 of the Census Bureau's FTR (30 CFR 30.6):

      (i) Method of transportation (the method of transportation is defined as that by which the goods are exported or shipped (vessel, air, rail, or truck));

      (ii) Carrier identification (for vessel, rail and truck shipments, the unique carrier identifier is the 4-character Standard Carrier Alpha Code (SCAC); for aircraft, the carrier identifier is the 2- or 3-character International Air Transport Association (IATA) code);

      (iii) Conveyance name (the conveyance name is the name of the carrier; for sea carriers, this is the name of the vessel; for others, the carrier name);

      (iv) Country of ultimate destination (this is the country as known to the USPPI, the USPPI's authorized agent, or the FPPI's authorized filing agent at the time of exportation, where the cargo is to be consumed or further processed or manufactured; this country would be identified by the 2-character International Standards Organization (ISO) code for the country of ultimate destination);

      (v) Date of export (the USPPI, the USPPI's authorized agent, or the FPPI's authorized filing agent must report the date the cargo is scheduled to leave the United States for all modes of transportation; if the actual date is not known, the USPPI, the USPPI's authorized agent, or the FPPI's authorized filing agent must report the best estimate as to the time of departure); and

      (vi) Port of export (the port where the outbound cargo departs from the United States is designated by its unique code, as set forth in Annex C, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS); the USPPI, the USPPI's authorized agent, or the FPPI's authorized filing agent must report the port of exportation as known when the USPPI, USPPI's authorized agent, or the FPPI's authorized filing agent tenders the cargo to the outbound carrier; should the carrier export the cargo from a different port and the carrier so informs the USPPI, the USPPI's authorized agent, or the FPPI's authorized filing agent, the port of exportation must be corrected by the filer in AES.).

      (3)  The USPPI, the USPPI's authorized agent, or the FPPI's authorized filing agent must furnish to the exporting carrier a proof of EEI filing citation (the ITN), post-departure filing citation, AES downtime filing citation (when allowed), and the exclusion, and/or exemption legends (see paragraph (d) of this section) for annotation on the carrier's outward manifest, waybill, or other export documentation covering the cargo to be shipped. The proof of EEI filing citation (the ITN), post-departure filing citation, AES downtime filing citation, exclusion, and/or exemption legend must conform to the approved EEI filing citation, exclusion, and/or exemption legend formats in Appendix B to the Census Bureau's FTR (15 CFR part 30, Appendix B).

      (4) —(i)  The carrier may not load cargo without first receiving from the USPPI, the USPPI's authorized agent, or the FPPI's authorized filing agent either the related electronic filing citation as prescribed under paragraph (c)(3) of this section, or an appropriate exemption legend for the cargo as specified in paragraph (d) of this section.

      (ii)  For cargo that CBP has identified as potentially high-risk, the carrier, after being duly notified by CBP, will be responsible for delivering the cargo for inspection/examination. When cargo identified as high risk has already been exported, CBP may demand that the export carrier redeliver the cargo in accordance with the terms of its international carrier bond (see § 113.64(m)(2) of this chapter).

      (5)  When the USPPI, the USPPI's authorized agent, or the FPPI's authorized filing agent electronically presenting the cargo information required in paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section receives any of this information from another party, CBP will take into consideration how, in accordance with ordinary commercial practices, the USPPI, the USPPI's authorized agent, or the FPPI's authorized filing agent acquired this information, and whether and how the USPPI, the USPPI's authorized agent, or the FPPI's authorized filing agent is able to verify this information. When the USPPI, the USPPI's authorized agent, or the FPPI's authorized filing agent is not reasonably able to verify any information received, CBP will permit this party to electronically present the information on the basis of what it reasonably believes to be true.

      (d)  The USPPI, the USPPI's authorized agent, or the FPPI's authorized filing agent must furnish to the outbound carrier an appropriate exemption or exclusion legend for any export shipment laden that is not subject to predeparture electronic information filing under this section. The exemption or exclusion legend must conform to the proper format approved by the Census Bureau (see 15 CFR part 30, Appendix B).
