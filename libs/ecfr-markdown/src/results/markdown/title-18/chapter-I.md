Such notice shall provide sufficient information and facts to enable the entity to provide a response. Within 30 days of such notice, the entity may submit to the Investigating Officer a non-public response, which may consist of a statement of fact, argument, and/or memorandum of law, with such supporting documentation as the entity chooses, showing why a proceeding governed by part 385 of this chapter should not be instituted against said entity, or why said entity should not be made a defendant in a civil action brought by the Commission.

      § 1b.20   Request for confidential treatment.

#### § § 1b.20

In such case, the person making such claim shall, at the time said person produces the document to the officer conducting the investigation shall also produce a second copy of the document from which has been deleted the information for which the person wishes to claim confidential treatment. The person shall indicate on the original document that a request for confidential treatment is being made for some or all of the information in the document and shall file a statement specifying the specific statutory justification for non-disclosure of the information for which confidential treatment is claimed. General claims of confidentiality are not sufficient. Sufficient information must be furnished for the officer conducting the investigation, or other appropriate official, to make an informed decision on the request for confidential treatment. If the person states that the information comes within the exception in 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4) for trade secrets and commercial or financial information, the person shall include a statement specifying why the information is privileged or confidential. If the person filing a document does not submit a second copy of the document with the confidential information deleted, the Officer conducting the investigation may assume that there is no objection to public disclosure of the document in its entirety. The Commission retains the right to make the determination with regard to any claim of confidentiality. Notice of the decision by the investigating Officer or other appropriate official to deny a claim, in whole or in part, and an opportunity to respond shall be given to a person claiming confidentiality no less than 5 days before its public disclosure.

        § 2.1a   Public suggestions, comments, proposals on substantial prospective regulatory issues and problems.

#### § § 2.1a

        (a) The Commission by this policy statement explicitly encourages the public, including those persons subject to regulation by the Commission, to submit suggestions, comments, or proposals concerning substantial prospective regulatory policy issues and problems, the resolution of which will have a substantial impact upon those regulated by the Commission or others affected by the Commission's activities. This policy is intended to serve as a means of advising the Commission on a timely basis of potential significant issues and problems which may come before it in the course of its activities and to permit the Commission an early opportunity to consider argument regarding policy questions and administrative reforms in a general context rather than in the course of individual proceedings.

        (b) Upon receipt of suggestions, comments, or proposals pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, the Commission shall review the matters raised and take whatever action is deemed necessary with respect to the filing, including, but not limited to, requesting further information from the filing party, the public, or the staff, or prescribing an informal public conference for initial discussion and consultation with the Commission, a Commissioner, or the Staff, concerning the matter(s) raised. In the absence of a notice of proposed rulemaking, any conferences or procedures undertaken pursuant to this section shall not be deemed by the Commission as meeting the requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act with respect to notice of rulemakings, but are to be utilized by the Commission as initial discussions for advice as a means of determining the need for Commission action, investigation or study prior to the issuance of a notice of proposed rulemaking to the extent required by the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553.

        (c) [Reserved]

        (d) A person may not invoke this policy as a means of advocating ex parte before the Commission a position in a proceeding pending at the Commission and any such filing will be rejected. Comments must relate to general conditions in industry or the public or policies or practices of the Commission which may need reform, review, or initial consideration by the Commission.

        § 2.1c   Policy statement on consultation with Indian tribes in Commission proceedings.

#### § § 2.1c

        (a) The Commission recognizes the unique relationship between the United States and Indian tribes and Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA) Corporations as defined by treaties, statutes, and judicial decisions. Indian tribes have various sovereign authorities, including the power to make and enforce laws, administer justice, and manage and control their lands and resources. Through several Executive Orders and a Presidential Memorandum, departments and agencies of the Executive Branch have been urged to consult with federally-recognized Indian tribes in a manner that recognizes the government-to-government relationship between these agencies and tribes. In essence, this means that consultation should involve direct contact between agencies and tribes and should recognize the status of the tribes as governmental sovereigns.

        (b) The Commission acknowledges that, as an independent agency of the federal government, it has a trust responsibility to Indian tribes and this historic relationship requires it to adhere to certain fiduciary standards in its dealings with Indian tribes.

        (c) The Commission will endeavor to work with Indian tribes on a government-to-government basis, and with ANCSA Corporations in a similar manner, and will seek to address the effects of proposed projects on tribal rights and resources through consultation pursuant to the Commission's trust responsibility, the Federal Power Act, the Natural Gas Act, the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act, section 32 of the Public Utility Holding Company Act, the Interstate Commerce Act, the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act, and in the Commission's environmental and decisional documents.

        (d) As an independent regulatory agency, the Commission functions as a neutral, quasi-judicial body, rendering decisions on applications filed with it, and resolving issues among parties appearing before it, including Indian tribes. Therefore, the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act and the Commission's rules concerning off-the-record communications, as well as the nature of the Commission's licensing and certificating processes and of the Commission's review of jurisdictional rates, terms and conditions, place some limitations on the nature and type of consultation that the Commission may engage in with any party in a contested case. Nevertheless, the Commission will endeavor, to the extent authorized by law, to reduce procedural impediments to working directly and effectively with tribal governments.

        (e) The Commission, in keeping with its trust responsibility, will assure that tribal concerns and interests are considered whenever the Commission's actions or decisions have the potential to adversely affect Indian tribes, Indian trust resources, or treaty rights. The Commission will use the agency's environmental and decisional documents to communicate how tribal input has been considered.

        (f) The Commission will seek to engage tribes in high-level meetings to discuss general matters of importance, such as those that uniquely affect the tribes. Where appropriate, these meetings may be arranged for particular tribes, by region, or in some proceedings involving hydroelectric projects, by river basins.

        (g) The Commission will strive to develop working relationships with tribes and will seek to establish procedures to educate Commission staff about tribal governments and cultures and to educate tribes about the Commission's various statutory functions and programs. To assist in this effort, the Commission is establishing the position of tribal liaison. The tribal liaison will provide a point of contact and a resource for tribes for any proceeding at the Commission.

        (h) Concurrently with this policy statement, the Commission is issuing certain new regulations regarding the licensing of hydroelectric projects. In this connection, the Commission sets forth the following additional policies for the hydroelectric licensing process.

        (i) The Commission believes that the hydroelectric licensing process will benefit by more direct and substantial consultation between the Commission staff and Indian tribes. Because of the unique status of Indian tribes in relation to the Federal government, the Commission will endeavor to increase direct communications with tribal representatives in appropriate circumstances, recognizing that different issues and stages of a proceeding may call for different approaches, and there are some limitations that must be observed.

        (j) The Commission will seek to notify potentially-affected tribes about upcoming hydroelectric licensing processes, to discuss the consultation process and the importance of tribal participation, to learn more about each tribe's culture, and to establish case-by-case consultation procedures consistent with our  rules.

        (k) In evaluating a proposed hydroelectric project, the Commission will consider any comprehensive plans prepared by Indian tribes or inter-tribal organizations for improving, developing, or conserving a waterway or waterways affected by a proposed project. The Commission will treat as a comprehensive plan, a plan that:

        (1) Is a comprehensive study of one or more of the beneficial uses of a waterway or waterways;

        (2) Includes a description of the standards applied, the data relied upon, and the methodology used in preparing the plan; and

        (3) Is filed with the Secretary of the Commission.  18 CFR 2.19.

        § 2.7   Recreational development at licensed projects.

#### § § 2.7

        The Commission will evaluate the recreational resources of all projects under Federal license or applications therefor and seek, within its authority, the ultimate development of these resources, consistent with the needs of the area to the extent that such development is not inconsistent with the primary purpose of the project. Reasonable expenditures by a licensee for public recreational development pursuant to an approved plan, including the purchase of land, will be included as part of the project cost. The Commission will not object to licensees and operators of recreational facilities within the boundaries of a project charging reasonable fees to users of such facilities in order to help defray the cost of constructing, operating, and maintaining such facilities. The Commission expects the licensee to assume the following responsibilities:

        (a) To acquire in fee and include within the project boundary enough land to assure optimum development of the recreational resources afforded by the project. To the extent consistent with the other objectives of the license, such lands to be acquired in fee for recreational purposes shall include the lands adjacent to the exterior margin of any project reservoir plus all other project lands specified in any approved recreational use plan for the project.

        (b) To develop suitable public recreational facilities upon project lands and waters and to make provisions for adequate public access to such project facilities and waters and to include therein consideration of the needs of persons with disabilities in the design and construction of such project facilities and access.

        (c) To encourage and cooperate with appropriate local, State, and Federal agencies and other interested entities in the determination of public recreation needs and to cooperate in the preparation of plans to meet these needs, including those for sport fishing and hunting.

        (d) To encourage governmental agencies and private interests, such as operators of user-fee facilities, to assist in carrying out plans for recreation, including operation and adequate maintenance of recreational areas and facilities.

        (e) To cooperate with local, State, and Federal Government agencies in planning, providing, operating, and maintaining facilities for recreational use of public lands administered by those agencies adjacent to the project area.

        (f)(1) To comply with Federal, State and local regulations for health, sanitation, and public safety, and to cooperate with law enforcement authorities in the development of additional necessary regulations for such purposes.

        (2) To provide either by itself or through arrangement with others for facilities to process adequately sewage, litter, and other wastes from recreation facilities including wastes from watercraft, at recreation facilities maintained and operated by the licensee or its concessionaires.

        (g) To ensure public access and recreational use of project lands and waters without regard to race, color, sex, religious creed or national origin.

        (h) To inform the public of the opportunities for recreation at licensed projects, as well as of rules governing the accessibility and use of recreational facilities.

        (a) The Commission has approved several sets of standard conditions for normal inclusion in preliminary permits or licenses for hydroelectric developments. In a special situation, of course, the Commission in issuing a permit or license for a project will modify or eliminate a particular article (condition). For reference purposes the sets of conditions are designated as “Forms”—those for preliminary permits are published in Form P-1, and those for licenses are published in Form L's. There are different Form L's for different types of licenses, and the forms have been revised from time to time. Thus at any given time there will be several series of standard forms applicable to the various vintages of different types of licenses. The forms and their revisions are published on the Commission's Web site ().

        § 2.17   Price discrimination and anticompetitive effect (price squeeze issue).

#### § § 2.17

        To implement compliance with the Supreme Court decision in  v.  426 U.S. 271 (1976), aff'g 510 F. 2d 1264 (D.C. Cir. 1975) and to expedite the consideration of price squeeze issues in wholesale electric rate proceedings, the Commission adopts the following procedures for raising price squeeze issues which are to be followed unless they are demonstrated in an individual case to be inadequate:

        (a) Any wholesale customer, state commission or other interested person may file petitions to intervene alleging price discrimination and anticompetitive effects of the wholesale rates. In order to have the issue of price discrimination considered in the rate proceeding, the intervening customer or other interested person must support its allegation by a prima facie case. The elements of the prima facie case shall include at a minimum:

        (1) Specification of the filing utility's retail rate schedules with which the intervening wholesale customer is unable to compete due to purchased power costs;

        (2) A showing that a competitive situation exists in that the wholesale customer competes in the same market as the filing utility;

        (3) A showing that the retail rates are lower than the proposed wholesale rates for comparable service;

        (4) The wholesale customer's prospective rate for comparable retail service, i.e. the rate necessary to recover bulk power costs (at the proposed wholesale rate) and distribution costs;

        (5) An indication of the reduction in the wholesale rate necessary to eliminate the price squeeze alleged.

        (b) Where price squeeze is alleged, the Commission shall, in the order granting intervention, direct the Administrative Law Judge to convene a prehearing conference within 15 days from the date of the order for the purpose of hearing intervenors' request for data required to present their case, including prima facie showing, on price squeeze issues.

        (c) Within 30 days from the date of the conference the filing utility shall respond to the data requests authorized by the Administrative Law Judge.

        (d) Within 30 days from the filing utility's response, the intervenors shall file their case-in-chief on price squeeze issues, which shall include their prima facie case, unless filed previously.

        (e) The burden of proof (i.e. the risk of nonpersuasion) to rebut the allegations of price squeeze and to justify the proposed rates are on the utility proposing the rates under section 205(e) of the Federal Power Act.

        (f) In proceedings where price squeeze is an issue, the Secretary shall include the state commission, agency or body which is responsible for regulation of retail rates in the state affected in the service list maintained under § 385.2010(c) of this chapter.

#### § § 2.18

        (a) In general, when a public utility files a phased rate increase, the Commission will determine the appropriate suspension period based on the total increase requested in all phases. If a utility files a rate increase within sixty days after filing another rate increase, the Commission will consider the filings together to be a phased rate increase request.

        (b) This policy will not be applied if the increase is phased:

        (1) To coordinate with new facilities coming on line;

        (2) To implement a rate moderation plan;

        (3) To avoid price squeeze;

        (4) To comply with a settlement approved by the Commission; or

        (5) If the utility makes a convincing showing that application of the policy would be harsh and inequitable and that, therefore, good cause has been shown not to apply the policy in the case.

        (a) In determining whether the proposed hydroelectric project is best adapted to a comprehensive plan under section (10)(a)(1) of the Federal Power Act for improving or developing a waterway, the Commission will consider the extent to which the project is consistent with a comprehensive plan (where one exists) for improving, developing, or conserving a waterway or waterways affected by the project that is prepared by:

        (1) An agency established pursuant to Federal law that has the authority to prepare such a plan, or

        (2) A state agency, of the state in which the facility is or will be located, authorized to conduct such planning pursuant to state law.

        § 2.20   Good faith requests for transmission services and good faith responses by transmitting utilities.

#### § § 2.20

        (a)  (1) This Statement of Policy is adopted in furtherance of the goals of sections 211(a) and 213(a) of the Federal Power Act, as amended and added by the Energy Policy Act of 1992.

        (2) Under section 211(a), the Commission may issue an order requiring a transmitting utility to provide transmission services (including any enlargement of transmission capacity necessary to provide such services) only if an applicant has made a request for transmission services to the transmitting utility that would be the subject of such order at least 60 days prior to its filing of an application for such order. The requirement in section 211(a) that an applicant make such a request will be met if such an applicant has, pursuant to section 213(a) of the FPA, made a good faith request to a transmitting utility to provide wholesale transmission services and requests specific rates and charges, and other terms and conditions.

        (3) It is the Commission's intention to apply the standards of this Statement of Policy when determining whether and when a valid “good faith” request for service was made.

        (4) It is the Commission's intention to encourage an open exchange of information that exhibits a reasonable degree of specificity and completeness between the party requesting transmission services and the transmitting utility.

        (5) The Commission intends to apply this Statement of Policy so as to carry out Congress' objective that, subject to appropriate terms and conditions and just and reasonable rates, in conformance with section 212 of the FPA, access to the electric transmission system for the purposes of wholesale transactions be more widely available.

        (b)  The Commission generally considers the following to constitute the minimum components of a good faith request for transmission services:

        (1) The identity, address, telephone number, and facsimile number of the party requesting transmission services, and the same information, if different, for the party's contact person or persons.

        (2) A statement that the party requesting transmission services is, or will be upon commencement of service, an entity eligible to request transmission under sections 211(a) and 213(a) of the FPA.

        (3) A statement that the request for transmission services is intended to satisfy the “request for transmission services” requirement under sections 211(a) and 213(a) of the FPA, and that the request is not a request for mandatory retail wheeling prohibited under section 212(h) of the FPA.

        (4) The party requesting transmission services should specify the character and nature of the services requested. Some types of service may require more detailed information than others. Where point-to-point service is requested, the party requesting transmission services should specify the anticipated point(s) of receipt to the transmitting utility's grid and the anticipated point(s) of delivery from the transmitting utility's grid. Where a party requesting transmission services requests additional flexibility to schedule multiple resources to meet its needs ( network service), the request for services should contain a description of the requested services in sufficient detail to permit the transmitting utility to model the additional services on its transmission system.

        (5) The names of any other parties likely to provide transmission service to deliver electric energy to, and receive electric energy from, the transmitting utility's grid in connection with the requested transmission services.

        (6) The proposed dates for initiating and terminating the requested transmission services.

        (7) The total amount of transmission capacity being requested.

        (8) To the extent it is known or can be estimated, a description of the “expected transaction profile” including load factor data describing the hourly quantities of power and energy the party requesting transmission services would expect to deliver to the transmitting utility's grid at relevant points of interconnection. In the event delivery is to multiple points within the transmitting utility's electric control area, the requestor should describe, to the extent it is known or can be estimated, the expected load (over a given duration of time) at each such delivery point.

        (9) Whether firm or non-firm service is being requested. Where a party requests non-firm service, it should specify the priority of service it is willing to accept, or the conditions under which it is willing to accept interruption or curtailment, if known.

        (10) A statement as to whether the request is being made in response to a solicitation and a copy of the solicitation if publicly available. This will help the transmitting utility determine whether requests for transmission service are duplicative or mutually exclusive of requests filed by other parties.

        (11) The proposed rates, terms and conditions for the requested transmission services as required by section 213(a). It is not necessary for the requestor to propose a specific numerical rate. Rather, a party requesting transmission services can fulfill the rates, terms and conditions requirement by specifying a rate methodology ( embedded or incremental cost) or by referencing an existing formula rate, transmission tariff, or transmission contract. The validity of the good faith request will not depend on the rates proposed by the party requesting transmission services. This requirement is not intended to allow utilities to delay responses to requests for transmission services, or to deny requests for transmission services on the basis of an overly rigid or technical approach to the “rates, terms and conditions” element of the request.

        (12) Any other information to facilitate the expeditious processing of its request. Such information will improve the negotiation process, reduce costs, and will improve chances to arrange the requested transmission without resorting to section 211 application procedures before the Commission.

        (c)  The Commission generally considers the following to constitute the minimum components of a reply to a good faith request for transmission services under section 213(a):

        (1) Unless the parties agree to a different time frame, the transmitting utility must acknowledge the request within 10 days of receipt. The acknowledgement must include a date by which a response will be sent to the party requesting transmission services and a statement of any fees associated with responding to the request (e.g., initial studies).

        (2) The transmitting utility may ask the applicant to provide clarification of only the information needed to evaluate and process a “good faith” request. If the person requesting transmission services believes the transmitting utility is attempting to frustrate the process by making excessive requests for clarification, it may raise this issue if, and when, it files a request for a section 211 order with the Commission.

        (3) The transmitting utility must respond to a request within 60 days of receipt or some other mutually agreed upon response date. If both parties agree to an alternative schedule, the agreement must be in writing and signed by both parties.

        (4) If the transmitting utility determines that it can provide all the requested services from existing capacity, it should respond by offering the party requesting transmission services an executable service agreement that at a minimum contains the following information:

        (i) A description of the proposed transmission rate and any other costs. It is not necessary for the proposed service agreement to contain a fully developed cost-of-service. However, the agreement should explain the basis for the charges for each component of service, including the unbundled components of any transmission rate as well as any other charges.

        (ii) The proposed service agreement should explicitly describe all of the applicable terms and conditions of the transmission services provided under the agreement.

        (iii) The transmitting utility should accompany the proposed service agreement with a clear statement of the time during which the offer to provide the transmission services will remain open. An open agreement offer may obligate the seller while imposing no countervailing obligation on the purchaser, and an unexecuted contract potentially ties up transmission facilities, thus jeopardizing the availability and price for subsequent requests that would use the same facilities. However, at a minimum, a transmitting utility should permit the party requesting transmission services sufficient time to review service agreements and coordinate multiple stages of joint transactions.

        (5) If the transmitting utility determines that it must construct additional facilities or modify existing facilities to provide all or part of the requested services, it must:

        (i) Identify the specific constraints and their duration that prevent it from providing all the requested services and explain how these constraints prevent it from providing all the requested services or the desired level of firmness.

        (ii) Provide to the applicant all studies, computer input and output data, planning, operating and other documents, work papers, assumptions and any other material that forms the basis for determining the constraints.

        (iii) Offer to the applicant an executable agreement under which the applicant agrees to reimburse the transmitting utility for all costs of performing any studies necessary to determine what changes to the transmitting utility's grid are needed to overcome the constraint and provide the requested services, their cost, and the estimated time to complete them. At a minimum, the proposed agreement should contain the following:

        (A) An estimate of the cost of the study and the time required to complete it, and

        (B) A commitment to supply to the party requesting transmission services all computer input and output data, planning, operating and other documents, work papers, assumptions and any other material used to perform the study.

        (iv) If a transmitting utility determines that it can provide part but not all of the requested services without building new facilities, it should inform the applicant of any portion of the requested services that can be performed without constructing additional facilities or modifying existing facilities. In effect, the transmitting utility may be able to treat such a request as two separate transactions—one for service on existing facilities and the other as a request involving expansion decisions. Furthermore, where there are alternative, less expensive means of satisfying all or a portion of a transmission request, the Commission expects the transmitting utility to explore such alternatives (, redispatching certain generating units to alleviate a constraint).

        § 2.21   Regional Transmission Groups.

#### § § 2.21

        (a)  The Commission encourages Regional Transmission Groups (RTGs) as a means of enabling the market for electric power to operate in a more competitive and efficient way. The Commission believes that RTGs can provide a means of coordinating regional planning of the transmission system and assuring that system capabilities are always adequate to meet system demands. RTG agreements that contain components that satisfy paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section generally will be considered to be just, reasonable, and not unduly discriminatory or preferential under the Federal Power Act (FPA). The Commission encourages RTG agreements that contain as much detail as possible in all of the components listed, particularly if the RTG participants will be seeking Commission deference to decisions reached under an RTG agreement.

        (b)  (1) An RTG agreement should provide for broad membership and, at a minimum, allow any entity that is subject to, or eligible to apply for, an order under section 211 of the FPA to be a member. An RTG agreement should encompass an area of sufficient size and contiguity to enable members to provide transmission services in a reliable, efficient, and competitive manner.

        (2) An RTG agreement should provide a means of adequate consultation and coordination with relevant state regulatory, siting, and other authorities.

        (3) An RTG agreement should include fair and nondiscriminatory governance and decision making procedures, including voting procedures.

        (c)  (1) An RTG agreement should impose on member transmitting utilities an obligation to provide transmission services for other members, including the obligation to enlarge facilities, on a basis that is consistent with sections 205, 206, 211, 212 and 213 of the FPA. To the extent practicable and known, the RTG agreement should specify the terms and conditions under which transmission services will be offered.

        (2) An RTG agreement should require, at a minimum, the development of a coordinated transmission plan on a regional basis and the sharing of transmission planning information, with the goal of efficient use, expansion, and coordination of the interconnected electric system on a grid-wide basis. An RTG agreement should provide mechanisms to incorporate the transmission needs of non-members into regional plans. An RTG agreement should include as much detail as possible with regard to operational and planning procedures.

        (3) An RTG agreement should include voluntary dispute resolution procedures that provide a fair alternative to resorting in the first instance to section 206 complaints or section 211 proceedings.

        (4) An RTG agreement should include an exit provision for RTG members that leave the RTG, specifying the obligations of a departing member.

        (d)  Any proposed RTG agreement that in any manner affects or relates to the transmission of electric energy in interstate commerce by a public utility, or rates or charges for such transmission, must be filed with the Commission. Any public utility member of a proposed RTG may file the RTG agreement with the Commission on behalf of the other public utility members under section 205 of the FPA.

        § 2.22   Pricing policy for transmission services provided under the Federal Power Act.

#### § § 2.22

        (a) The Commission has adopted a Policy Statement on its pricing policy for transmission services provided under the Federal Power Act. That Policy Statement can be found at 69 FERC 61,086. The Policy Statement constitutes a complete description of the Commission's guidelines for assessing the pricing proposals. Paragraph (b) of this section is only a brief summary of the Policy Statement.

        (b) The Commission endorses transmission pricing flexibility, consistent with the principles and procedures set forth in the Policy Statement. It will entertain transmission pricing proposals that do not conform to the traditional revenue requirement as well as proposals that conform to the traditional revenue requirement. The Commission will evaluate “conforming” transmission pricing proposals using the following five principles, described more fully in the Policy Statement.

        (1) Transmission pricing must meet the traditional revenue requirement.

        (2) Transmission pricing must reflect comparability.

        (3) Transmission pricing should promote economic efficiency.

        (4) Transmission pricing should promote fairness.

        (5) Transmission pricing should be practical.

        (c) Under these principles, the Commission will also evaluate “non-conforming” proposals which do not meet the traditional revenue requirement, and will require such proposals to conform to the comparability principle. Non-conforming proposals must include an open access comparability tariff and will not be allowed to go into effect prior to review and approval by the Commission under procedures described in the Policy Statement.

        § 2.23   Use of reserved authority in hydropower licenses to ameliorate cumulative impacts.

#### § § 2.23

        The Commission will address and consider cumulative impact issues at original licensing and relicensing to the fullest extent possible consistent with the Commission's statutory responsibility to avoid undue delay in the relicensing process and to avoid undue delay in the amelioration of individual project impacts at relicensing. To the extent, if any, that it is not possible to explore and address all cumulative impacts at relicensing, the Commission will reserve authority to examine and address such impacts after the new license has been issued, but will define that reserved authority as narrowly and with as much specificity as possible, particularly with respect to the purpose of reserving that authority. The Commission intends that such articles will describe, to the maximum extent possible, reasonably foreseeable future resource concerns that may warrant modifications of the licensed project. Before taking any action pursuant to such reserved authority, the Commission will publish notice of its proposed action and will provide an opportunity for hearing by the licensee and all interested parties. Hydropower licenses also contain standard “reopener” articles (see § 2.9 of this part) which reserve authority to the Commission to require, among other things, licensees of projects located in the same river basin to mitigate the cumulative impacts of those projects on the river basin. In light of the policy described above, the Commission will use the standard “reopener” articles to explore and address cumulative impacts only (except in extraordinary circumstances) where such impacts were not known at the time of licensing or are the result of changed circumstances. The Commission has authority under the Federal Power Act to require licensees, during the term of the license, to develop and provide data to the Commission on the cumulative impacts of licensed projects located in the same river basin. In issuing both new and original licenses, the Commission will coordinate the expiration dates of the licenses to the maximum extent possible, to maximize future consideration of cumulative impacts at the same time in contemporaneous proceedings at relicensing. The Commission's intention is to consider to the extent practicable cumulative impacts at the time of licensing and relicensing, and to eliminate the need to resort to the use of reserved authority.

        § 2.25   Ratemaking treatment of the cost of emissions allowances in coordination transactions.

#### § § 2.25

        (a)  This Statement of Policy is adopted in furtherance of the goals of Title IV of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, Pub. L. 101-549, Title IV, 104 Stat. 2399, 2584 (1990).

        (b)  If a public utility's coordination rate on file with the Commission provides for recovery of variable costs on an incremental basis, the Commission will allow recovery of the incremental costs of emissions allowances associated with a coordination sale. If a coordination rate does not reflect incremental costs, the public utility should propose alternative allowance costing methods or demonstrate that the coordination rate does not produce unreasonable results. The Commission finds that the cost to replace an allowance is an appropriate basis to establish the incremental cost.

        (c)  The Commission will allow public utilities to determine emissions allowance costs on the basis of an index or combination of indices of the current price of emissions allowances, provided that the public utility affords purchasing utilities the option of providing emissions allowances. Public utilities should explain and justify any use of different incremental cost indices for pricing coordination sales and making dispatch decisions.

        (d)  Public utilities should explain the methods used to compute the amount of emissions allowances included in coordination transactions.

        (e)  (1) Public utilities should provide information to purchasing utilities regarding the timing of opportunities for purchasers to stipulate whether they will purchase or return emissions allowances. A public utility may require a purchasing utility to declare, no later than the beginning of the coordination transaction:

        (i) Whether it will purchase or return emissions allowances; and

        (ii) If it will return emissions allowances, the date on which those allowances will be returned.

        (2) Public utilities may include in agreements with purchasing utilities non-discriminatory provisions for indemnification if the purchasing utility fails to provide emissions allowances by the date on which it declares that the allowances will be returned.

        (f)  The ratemaking treatment of emissions allowance costs endorsed in this Policy Statement does not preclude other approaches proposed by individual utilities on a case-by-case basis.

        § 2.26   Policies concerning review of applications under section 203.

#### § § 2.26

        (a) The Commission has adopted a Policy Statement on its policies for reviewing transactions subject to section 203. That Policy Statement can be found at 77 FERC ¶ 61,263 (1996). The Policy Statement is a complete description of the relevant guidelines. Paragraphs (b)-(e) of this section are only a brief summary of the Policy Statement.

        (b)  In determining whether a proposed transaction subject to section 203 is consistent with the public interest, the Commission will generally consider the following factors; it may also consider other factors:

        (1) The effect on competition;

        (2) The effect on rates; and

        (3) The effect on regulation.

        (c)  Applicants should provide data adequate to allow analysis under the Department of Justice/Federal Trade Commission Merger Guidelines, as described in the Policy Statement and Appendix A to the Policy Statement.

        (d)  Applicants should propose mechanisms to protect customers from costs due to the merger. If the proposal raises substantial issues of relevant fact, the Commission may set this issue for hearing.

        (e)  (1) Where the affected state commissions have authority to act on the transaction, the Commission will not set for hearing whether the transaction would impair effective regulation by the state commissions. The application should state whether the state commissions have this authority.

        (2) Where the affected state commissions do not have authority to act on the transaction, the Commission may set for hearing the issue of whether the transaction would impair effective state regulation.

        (f) Under section 203(a)(4) of the Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C. 824b), in reviewing a proposed transaction subject to section 203, the Commission will also consider whether the proposed transaction will result in cross-subsidization of a non-utility associate company or pledge or encumbrance of utility assets for the benefit of an associate company, unless that cross-subsidization, pledge, or encumbrance will be consistent with the public interest.

        § 2.55   Auxiliary installations and replacement facilities.

#### § § 2.55

        For the purposes of section 7(c) of the Natural Gas Act, as amended, the word  as used therein shall be interpreted to exclude:

        (a)  (1) Installations (excluding gas compressors) which are merely auxiliary or appurtenant to an authorized or proposed transmission pipeline system and which are installations only for the purpose of obtaining more efficient or more economical operation of the authorized or proposed transmission facilities, such as: Valves; drips; pig launchers/receivers; yard and station piping; cathodic protection equipment; gas cleaning, cooling and dehydration equipment; residual refining equipment; water pumping, treatment and cooling equipment; electrical and communication equipment; and buildings. The auxiliary installations must be located within the existing or proposed certificated permanent right-of-way or authorized facility site and must be constructed using the temporary work space used to construct the existing or proposed facility (see Appendix A to this Part 2 for guidelines on what is considered to be the appropriate work area in this context).

        (2)  One of the following requirements will apply to any specified auxiliary installation. If auxiliary facilities are to be installed:

        (i) On existing transmission facilities, then no notification is required;

        (ii) On, or at the same time as, certificated facilities which are not yet in service (except those authorized under the automatic procedures of part 157 of subpart F of this chapter), then a description of the auxiliary facilities and their locations must be provided to the Commission at least 30 days in advance of their installation; or

        (iii) On, or at the same time as facilities that are proposed, then the auxiliary facilities must be described in the environmental report specified in § 380.12 or in a supplemental filing while the application is pending.

        (3)  Authorization to abandon or replace auxiliary facilities that were or could be installed under paragraph (a)(1) of this section is pre-granted under section 7(b) of the Natural Gas Act, and no reporting is required, provided that:

        (i) All activities will be confined to areas, including temporary work space, previously authorized by the Commission for the construction and operation of facilities at that location;

        (ii) All activities will comply with applicable conditions on certificate authorizations for the construction and operation of facilities at that location; and

        (iii) The abandonment or replacement will have no adverse impact on customers' certificated services.

        (b)  (1) Facilities which constitute the replacement of existing facilities that have or will soon become physically deteriorated or obsolete, to the extent that replacement is deemed advisable, if:

        (i) The replacement will not result in a reduction or abandonment of service through the facilities;

        (ii) The replacement facilities will have a substantially equivalent designed delivery capacity, will be located in the same right-of-way or on the same site as the facilities being replaced, and will be constructed using the temporary work space used to construct the existing facility (see Appendix A to Part 2 for guidelines on what is considered to be the appropriate work area in this context);

        (iii) Except as described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the company files notification of such activity with the Commission at least 30 days prior to commencing construction.

        (2)  The advance notification described in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section is not required if:

        (i) The cost of the replacement project does not exceed the cost limit specified in Column 1 of Table I of § 157.208(d) of this chapter; or

        (ii) U.S. Department of Transportation safety regulations require that the replacement activity be performed immediately;

        (3)  The advance notification described in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section must include the following information:

        (i) A brief description of the facilities to be replaced (including pipeline size and length, compression horsepower, design capacity, and cost of construction);

        (ii) Current U.S. Geological Survey 7.5-minute series topographic maps showing the location of the facilities to be replaced; and

        (iii) A description of the procedures to be used for erosion control, revegetation and maintenance, and stream and wetland crossings.

        (4)  On or before May 1 of each year, a company must file (in accordance with filing procedures posted on the Commission's Web site at ) an annual report that lists for the previous calendar year each replacement project that was completed pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section and that was exempt from the advance notification requirement pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this section. For each such replacement project, the company must include all of the information described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section.  A company does not have to include in this annual report any above-ground replacement project that did not involve compression facilities or the use of earthmoving equipment.

        (c)  (1)(i) No activity described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section that involves ground disturbance is authorized unless a company makes a good faith effort to notify in writing each affected landowner, as noted in the most recent county/city tax records as receiving the tax notice, whose property will be used and subject to ground disturbance as a result of the proposed activity, at least five days prior to commencing any activity under this section. A landowner may waive the five-day prior notice requirement in writing, so long as the notice has been provided. No landowner notice under this section is required:

        (A) If all ground disturbance will be confined entirely to areas within the fence line of an existing above-ground site of facilities operated by the company; or

        (B) For activities done for safety, DOT compliance, or environmental or unplanned maintenance reasons that are not foreseen and that require immediate attention by the company.

        (ii) The notification shall include at least:

        (A) A brief description of the facilities to be constructed or replaced and the effect the activity may have on the landowner's property;

        (B) The name and phone number of a company representative who is knowledgeable about the project; and

        (C) A description of the Commission's Landowner Helpline, which an affected person may contact to seek an informal resolution of a dispute as explained in § 1b.22(a) of this chapter and the Landowner Helpline number.

        (2) “Affected landowners” include owners of interests, as noted in the most recent county/city tax records as receiving tax notice, in properties (including properties subject to rights-of-way and easements for facility sites, compressor stations, well sites, and all above-ground facilities, and access roads, pipe and contractor yards, and temporary work space) that will be directly affected by ( used) and subject to ground disturbance as a result of activity under this section.

#### § § 2.57

        The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will exercise the emergency powers set forth in the second proviso of section 7(c) of the Natural Gas Act to authorize in appropriate cases, by issuance of temporary certificates, comparatively minor enlargements or extensions of an existing pipeline system. It will not be the policy of the Commission, however, to proceed summarily, i.e., without notice or hearing, in cases where the proposed construction is of major proportions. Pipeline companies are accordingly urged to conduct their planning and to submit their applications for authority sufficiently early so that compliance with the requirements relating to issuance of permanent certificates of public convenience and necessity (when those requirements are deemed applicable by the Commission) will not cause undue delay in the commencement of necessary construction.

        § 2.60   Facilities and activities during an emergency—accounting treatment of defense-related expenditures.

#### § § 2.60

        The Commission, cognizant of the need of the natural gas industry for advice with respect to the applicability of the Natural Gas Act and the Commission's regulations thereunder regarding activities and operations of natural gas companies taking security measures in preparation for a possible national emergency, sets forth the following interpretation and statement of policy:

        (a)  The definition of  in § 2.55(a) for which no certificate authority is necessary includes such defense-related facilities as (1) fallout shelters at compressor stations and other operating and maintenance camps; (2) emergency company headquarters or other similar installations; and (3) emergency communication equipment.

        (b) The Commission will consider reasonable investment in defense-related facilities, such as those described in paragraph (a) of this section, to be  for ratemaking purposes.

        (c) When a person, not otherwise subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission, files an application for a certificate of public convenience and necessity authorizing the construction of facilities to be used solely for operation in a national emergency for the delivery of gas to, or receipt of gas from, a person subject to the Commission's jurisdiction, the Commission will consider a request by such applicant for waiver of the requirement to keep and maintain its accounts in accordance with the Uniform System of Accounts for Natural Gas Companies (parts 201 and 204 of this chapter) or to file the annual reports to the Commission required by §§ 260.1 and 260.2 of this chapter.

        Pursuant to the provisions of section 441(a)(4)(A) of the Tax Reform Act of 1969, 83 Stat. 487, 625, natural gas pipeline companies which have exercised the option provided by that section to change from flow through accounting will be permitted by the Commission, with respect to liberalized depreciation, to employ a normalization method for computing Federal income taxes in their accounts and annual reports with respect to property constructed or acquired after January 1, 1970, to the extent to which such property increases the productive or operational capacity of the utility and is not a replacement of existing capacity. Such normalization will also be permitted for ratemaking purposes. As to balances in Account No. 282 of the Uniform System of Accounts, “Accumulated deferred income taxes—Other property,” it will remain the Commission's policy to deduct such balances from the rate base of natural gas pipeline companies in rate proceedings.

        § 2.76   Regulatory treatment of payments made in lieu of take-or-pay obligations.

#### § § 2.76

        With respect to payments made to a first seller of natural gas as consideration for waiving or revising any agreement for the first sale of natural gas, as defined by section (2)(21) of the Natural Gas Policy Act (NGPA), the Commission sets forth the following statement of general policy and interpretation of law.

        (a)  A first seller of natural gas that receives payments as consideration for amending or waiving the take-or-pay or similar minimum payment provisions of a contract for the first sale of natural gas is not in violation of section 504(a) of the NGPA.

        (b)  A pipeline that makes any payments referred to under paragraph (a) of this section, to first sellers may file to recover such costs in any section 4(e) rate filing other than a filing to recover purchased gas costs.

        (c)  A pipeline's method of recovering these costs and how it should apportion them among customers will be addressed on a case-by-case basis in the context of individual rate case filings.

        (d)  When a pipeline seeks to recover payments referred to under paragraph (a) of this section, its customers will have the full opportunity contemplated by section 4 of the Natural Gas Act to raise questions as to the prudence of such payments, the apportionment of costs among customers proposed by the filing pipeline, and any other reasonably related matters.

        (e)  With regard to natural gas the sale of which is subject to the Commission's jurisdiction under the Natural Gas Act, if any payments referred to under paragraph (a) of this section are accompanied by a change in or a termination of, the first seller's contractual obligation to provide natural gas service, the Commission will, as a general policy under sections 7(c) and 7(b) of the Natural Gas Act, expeditiously grant any certificate amendments or abandonment authorizations, required to effectuate such contractual or service modifications.

        In cases where a producer abandonment application is based on payments made pursuant to this policy statement, the interstate pipeline making the payments will be deemed to have waived any right to oppose the abandonment.

        § 2.78   Utilization and conservation of natural resources—natural gas.

#### § § 2.78

        (a)(1) The national interests in the development and utilization of natural gas resources throughout the United States will be served by recognition and implementation of the following priority-of-service categories for use during periods of curtailed deliveries by jurisdictional pipeline companies:

        (i) Residential, small commercial (less than 50 Mcf on a peak day).

        (ii) Large commercial requirements (50 Mcf or more on a peak day), firm industrial requirements for plant protection, feedstock and process needs, and pipeline customer storage injection requirements.

        (iii) All industrial requirements not specified in paragraph (a)(1)(ii), (iv), (v), (vi), (vii), (viii), or (ix) of this section.

        (iv) Firm industrial requirements for boiler fuel use at less than 3,000 Mcf per day, but more than 1,500 Mcf per day, where alternate fuel capabilities can meet such requirements.

        (v) Firm industrial requirements for large volume (3,000 Mcf or more per day) boiler fuel use where alternate fuel capabilities can meet such requirements.

        (vi) Interruptible requirements of more than 300 Mcf per day, but less than 1,500 Mcf per day, where alternate fuel capabilities can meet such requirements.

        (vii) Interruptible requirements of intermediate volumes (from 1,500 Mcf per day through 3,000 Mcf per day), where alternate fuel capabilities can meet such requirements.

        (viii) Interruptible requirements of more than 3,000 Mcf per day, but less than 10,000 Mcf per day, where alternate fuel capabilities can meet such requirements.

        (ix) Interruptible requirements of more than 10,000 Mcf per day, where alternate fuel capabilities can meet such requirements.

        (2) The priorities-of-deliveries set forth above will be applied to the deliveries of all jurisdictional pipeline companies during periods of curtailment on each company's system; except, however, that, upon a finding of extraordinary circumstances after hearing initiated by a petition filed under § 385.207 of this chapter, exceptions to those priorities may be permitted.

        (3) The above list of priorities requires the full curtailment of the lower priority category volumes to be accomplished before curtailment of any higher priority volumes is commenced. Additionally, the above list requires both the direct and indirect customers of the pipeline that use gas for similar purposes to be placed in the same category of priority.

        (4) The tariffs filed with this Commission should contain provisions that will reflect sufficient flexibility to permit pipeline companies to respond to emergency situations (including environmental emergencies) during periods of curtailment where supplemental deliveries are required to forestall irreparable injury to life or property.

        (b) Request for relief from curtailment shall be filed under § 385.1501 of this chapter. Those petitions shall use the priorities set forth in (paragraph (a)(1) of this section) above, the definitions contained in paragraph (b)(3) of this section and shall contain the following minimal information:

        (1) The specific amount of natural gas deliveries requested on peak day and monthly basis, and the type of contract under which the deliveries would be made.

        (2) The estimated duration of the relief requested.

        (3) A breakdown of all natural gas requirements on peak day and monthly bases at the plant site by specific end-uses.

        (4) The specific end-uses to which the natural gas requested will be utilized and should also reflect the scheduling within each particular end-use with and without the relief requested.

        (5) The estimated peak day and monthly volumes of natural gas which would be available with and without the relief requested from all sources of supply for the period specified in the request.

        (6) A description of existing alternate fuel capabilities on peak day and monthly bases broken down by end-uses as shown in paragraph (b)(3) of this section.

        (7) For the alternate fuels shown in paragraph (b)(5) of this section, provide a description of the existing storage facilities and the amount of present fuel inventory, names and addresses of existing alternate fuel suppliers, and anticipated delivery schedules for the period for which relief is sought.

        (8) The current price per million Btu for natural gas supplies and alternate fuels supplies.

        (9) A description of efforts to secure natural gas and alternate fuels, including documentation of contacts with the Federal Energy Office and any state or local fuel allocation agencies or public utility commission.

        (10) A description of all fuel conservation activities undertaken in the facility for which relief is sought.

        (11) If petitioner is a local natural gas distributor, a description of the currently effective curtailment program and details regarding any flexibility which may be available by effectuating additional curtailment to its existing industrial customers. The distributor should also provide a breakdown of the estimated disposition of its natural gas estimated to be available by end-use priorities established in paragraph (a)(1) of this section for the period for which relief is sought.

        (c) When used in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, the following terms will be defined as follows:

        (1)  Service to customers which consists of direct natural gas usage in a residential dwelling for space heating, air conditioning, cooking, water heating, and other residential uses.

        (2)  Service to customers engaged primarily in the sale of goods or services including institutions and local, state, and federal government agencies for uses other than those involving manufacturing or electric power generation.

        (3)  Service to customers engaged primarily in a process which creates or changes raw or unfinished materials into another form or product including the generation of electric power.

        (4)  Service from schedules or contracts under which seller is expressly obligated to deliver specific volumes within a given time period and which anticipates no interruptions, but which may permit unexpected interruption in case the supply to higher priority customers is threatened.

        (5)  Service from schedules or contracts under which seller is not expressly obligated to deliver specific volumes within a given time period, and which anticipates and permits interruption on short notice, or service under schedules or contracts which expressly or impliedly require installation of alternate fuel capability.

        (6)  Is defined as minimum volumes required to prevent physical harm to the plant facilities or danger to plant personnel when such protection cannot be afforded through the use of an alternate fuel. This includes the protection of such material in process as would otherwise be destroyed, but shall not include deliveries required to maintain plant production. For the purposes of this definition propane and other gaseous fuels shall not be considered alternate fuels.

        (7)  Is defined as natural gas used as raw material for its chemical properties in creating an end product.

        (8)  Is defined as gas use for which alternate fuels are not technically feasible such as in applications requiring precise temperature controls and precise flame characteristics. For the purposes of this definition propane and other gaseous fuels shall not be considered alternate fuels.

        (9)  Is considered to be natural gas used as a fuel for the generation of steam or electricity, including the utilization of gas turbines for the generation of electricity.

        (10)  Is defined as a situation where an alternate fuel could have been utilized whether or not the facilities for such use have actually been installed;  Where the use of natural gas is for plant protection, feedstock, or process uses and the only alternate fuel is propane or other gaseous fuel then the consumer will be treated as if he had no alternate fuel capability.

        § 2.80   Detailed environmental statement.

#### § § 2.80

        (a) It will be the general policy of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to adopt and to adhere to the objectives and aims of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) in its regulations promulgated for statutes under the jurisdiction of the Commission, including the Federal Power Act, the Natural Gas Act and the Natural Gas Policy Act. The National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 requires, among other things, all Federal agencies to include a detailed environmental statement in every recommendation or report on proposals for legislation and other major Federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.

        (b) Therefore, in compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, the Commission staff will make a detailed environmental statement when the regulatory action taken by the Commission under the statutes under the jurisdiction of the Commission will have a significant environmental impact. The specific regulations implementing NEPA are contained in part 380 of the Commission's regulations.

        § 2.103   Statement of policy respecting take or pay provisions in gas purchase contracts.

#### § § 2.103

        (a) Recognizing that take or pay contract obligations may be shielding the prices of deregulated and other higher cost gas from market constraints, the Commission sets forth its general policy regarding prepayments for natural gas pursuant to take or pay provisions in gas contracts and amendments thereto between producers and interstate pipelines which become effective December 23, 1982. The provisions of this policy statement do not establish a binding norm but instead provide general guidance. In particular cases, both the underlying validity of the policy and its application to particular facts may be challenged and are subject to further consideration.

        (b) With respect to gas purchase contracts entered into on or after December 23, 1982, the Commission intends to apply a rebuttable presumption in general rate cases that prepayments to producers will not be given rate base treatment if the prepayments are made pursuant to take or pay requirements in such gas purchase contracts or amendments which exceed 75 percent of annual deliverability.

> [47 FR 57269, Dec. 23, 1982]

        § 2.104   Mechanisms for passthrough of pipeline take-or-pay buyout and buydown costs.

#### § § 2.104

        (a)  The Commission as a matter of policy will provide two distinct mechanisms for passthrough of take-or-pay buyout and buydown costs of interstate natural gas pipelines. The first is pursuant to existing Commission policy and practice. Under this method, pipelines may pass through prudently incurred take-or-pay buyout and buydown costs in their sales commodity rates. The second method is available to pipelines which agree to an equitable sharing of take-or-pay costs and which transport under part 284 of this chapter. Qualifying pipelines may utilize the alternative passthrough mechanisms described in this section. Where a pipeline agrees to absorb from 25 to 50 percent of take-or-pay buyout and buydown costs, the Commission will permit the pipeline to recover through a fixed charge an amount equal to (but not greater than) the amount absorbed. Any remaining costs up to 50 percent of total buyout and buydown costs may be recovered either through a commodity rate surcharge or a volumetric surcharge on total throughput.

        (b)  A pipeline's volume-based surcharges must be based on the volumes which underlie its most recent Commission-approved rates. Fixed charges must be based on each customer's cumulative deficiency in purchases in recent years (during which the current take-or-pay liabilities of the pipelines were incurred) measured in relation to that customer's purchases during a representative period during which take-or-pay liabilities were not incurred. The allocation formula employed must incorporate the following guidelines:

        (1) A representative base period must be selected. The base period must reflect a representative level of purchases by the pipeline's firm customers during a period preceding the onset of changed conditions which resulted in reduced purchases and growth of the take-or-pay problem.

        (2) Firm purchases by each customer during the base year under firm rate schedules or contracts for firm service must be determined.

        (3) Firm sales purchase deficiency volumes for each subsequent year must be determined.

        (4) A fixed charge based on each customer's cumulative deficiencies as compared to total cumulative deficiencies must be derived. The filing pipeline will be free to select for rate calculation and filing purposes a reasonable amortization period for buyout and buydown costs being recovered through fixed charges or volumetric surcharges. The pipeline will be entitled to interest at the rate set forth in part 154 of this chapter on unamortized amounts.

        (c)  (1) Pipelines acting pursuant to this section may submit on or before December 31, 1990, a non-PGA rate filing under section 4(e) of the Natural Gas Act. Pipelines may include in their filings a fixed charge and a volumetric surcharge to recover buyout and buydown costs actually paid as of the date of filing plus similar costs which are known and measurable within the following nine months. Detailed support for the amounts claimed and for the calculation of customer surcharges must be provided. In addition, the pipeline must disclose and describe all consideration, both cash and noncash, given to producers in exchange for take-or-pay relief.

        (2) In any filings made under this section, pipelines must include proposals for periodic (preferably annual) adjustments to customer surcharges, together with any necessary accounting procedures, designed to assure that revenues recovered by the pipeline remain in balance with buyout and buydown costs covered by the filing and actually incurred by the pipeline.

        (d)  (1) The Commission will examine the issue of prudence if it is raised by a party in an individual proceeding. If it is raised, the pipeline will be required to demonstrate the prudence of take-or-pay buyout and buydown costs which it seeks to recover from its customers through both fixed and volume-based charges.

        (2) The Commission intends to exercise its authority to the full extent permitted by the Natural Gas Act to approve take-or-pay settlements. The Commission intends to approve uncontested take-or-pay settlements which are consistent with this section and found to be in the public interest. The Commission will also, if it appears reasonable and permissible to do so, approve contested settlements as to all consenting parties and initiate separate hearings to establish the rates for opposing parties. Alternatively, the Commission will approve contested settlements on the merits if supported by substantial evidence in the record. In any case where hearings are held as to the prudence of take-or-pay buyout and buydown costs, the Commission will permit the pipeline the opportunity to recover all take-or-pay costs found to be prudent from the contesting parties on a proportional basis, even if the amount allowed is greater than the amounts initially sought to be recovered by the pipeline.

        (e)  Downstream pipelines must flow through approved take-or-pay fixed charges based on the cumulative purchase deficiencies of their customers. Volumetrically-based surcharges must be flowed through on a volumetric basis. Customers of downstream pipelines have the right in connection with either PGA or general rate filings to challenge the purchasing practices of such pipelines. Remedies for purchasing practices found by the Commission to be imprudent will be determined on a case-by-case basis.

        (f)  Pipeline rate proceedings pending September 15, 1987 may be utilized as a forum for implementing the approved cost recovery mechanisms set forth in this section. Permission will be granted in cases where implementation of this policy in pending proceedings appears feasible, will not result in inordinate delay, or can be expected to result in unnecessary or cumulative rate filings with the Commission. In the event permission is granted, the presiding judge(s) will allow pipelines to supplement their filings to the extent necessary to assure compliance with the filing and data requirements set forth herein. The presiding judges shall also establish any procedures necessary to protect the rights of all parties. Any rates established pursuant to this section will be permitted to become effective only prospectively upon Commission approval.

        (g)  This section does not go beyond the Commission's determination in the April 10, 1985, policy statement (Docket No. PL85-1-000) that take-or-pay buyout and buydown costs do not violate the pricing provision of the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 (NGPA). It is not intended to affect take-or-pay prepayments made by pipelines and included in account 165 and in their rate bases. Nor does it address the issue of whether take-or-pay prepayments to a producer for gas not taken and which cannot be made up violate the Title I pricing provisions of the NGPA. This policy statement applies only to buyout and buydown costs paid by pipelines that are transporting under part 284 of this chapter, under existing contracts, and is not intended to disturb in any way take-or-pay settlements previously entered into between pipelines and their producer suppliers.

#### § § 2.105

        An interstate natural gas pipeline that transports under part 284 of this chapter may include in its tariff a charge, not related to facilities, for standing ready to supply gas to sales customers in accordance with the following principles:

        (a) The pipeline may not recover take-or-pay or similar charges from suppliers by any other means.

        (b) The pipeline must allow its sales customers to nominate levels of service freely within their firm sales entitlements or otherwise employ a mechanism for the renegotiation of levels of service at regular intervals.

        (c) The pipeline must announce prior to nominations by the customers a firm price or pricing formula for the service, and hold that price or pricing formula firm during the interval arranged in paragraph (b) of this section.

        (d) By nominating a new level of service lower than its current level, a customer has consented to any abandonment sought by the pipeline commensurate with the difference between the current level of service and the nominated level.

        § 2.300   Statement of policy concerning allegations of fraud, abuse, or similar grounds under section 601(c) of the NGPA.

#### § § 2.300

        Recognizing the potential for an increasing number of intervenor complaints predicated on the fraud, abuse, or similar grounds exception to guaranteed passthrough, the Commission sets forth the elements of a cognizable claim under section 601(c)(2) which it expects to apply in cases in which fraud, abuse, or similar grounds is raised. The provisions of this policy statement do not establish a binding norm but instead provide general guidance. In particular cases, both the underlying validity of the policy and its application to particular facts may be challenged and are subject to further consideration. The procedure prescribed conforms with the NGPA's general guarantee of passthrough by placing the burden of pleading the elements and proving the elements of a case on intervenors who would allege fraud, abuse, or similar grounds as a basis for denying passthrough of gas prices incurred by an interstate pipeline.

        (a) In order for the issue of fraud, as that term is used in section 601(c) of the NGPA, to be considered in a proceeding, an intervenor or intervenors must file a complaint alleging that:

        (1) The interstate pipeline, any first seller who sells natural gas to the interstate pipeline, or both acting together, have made a fraudulent misrepresentation or concealment; and

        (2) Because of that fraudulent misrepresentation or concealment, the amount paid by the interstate pipeline to any first seller of natural gas was higher than it would have been absent the fraudulent conduct.

        (b) In order for the issue of abuse, as that term is used in section 601(c) of the NGPA, to be considered in a proceeding, an intervenor or intervenors must file a complaint alleging that:

        (1) The interstate pipeline, a first seller who sells to the interstate pipeline, or both acting together, have made a negligent misrepresentation or concealment, or other misrepresentation or concealment in disregard of a duty; and

        (2) Because of that negligent misrepresentation or concealment, or other misrepresentation or concealment in disregard of a duty, the amount paid by the interstate pipeline to any first seller of natural gas was higher than it would have been absent the negligent misrepresentation or concealment, or other misrepresentation or concealment made in disregard of a duty.

        (c) In order for the issue of similar grounds, as that term is used in section 601(c) of the NGPA, to be considered in a proceeding, an intervenor or intervenors must file a complaint alleging that:

        (1) The interstate pipeline, any first seller who sells natural gas to the interstate pipeline, or both acting together, have made an innocent misrepresentation of fact; and

        (2) Because of that innocent misrepresentation of facts, the amount paid by the interstate pipeline to any first seller of natural gas was higher than it would have been absent the innocent misrepresentation of fact.

        § 2.400   Statement of interpretation of waste concerning natural gas as the primary energy source for qualifying small power production facilities.

#### § § 2.400

        For purposes of deciding whether natural gas may be considered as waste as the primary energy source pursuant to § 292.204(b)(1)(i) of this chapter, the Commission will use the criteria described in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of this section.

        (a)  Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, natural gas with a heating value of 300 Btu per standard cubic foot (scf) or below will be considered unmarketable.

        (b)  In determining whether natural gas with a heating value above 300 Btu but not more than 800 Btu per scf and natural gas produced in the Moxa Arch area is unmarketable, the Commission will consider the following information:

        (1) The percentages of the chemical components of the gas, the wellhead pressure, and the flow rate;

        (2) Whether the applicant offered the gas to all potential buyers located within 20 miles of the wellhead under terms and conditions commensurate with those prevailing in the region and that such potential buyers refused to buy the gas; and

        (3) A study, which may be submitted by an applicant, that evaluates the economics of upgrading the gas for sale and transporting the gas to a pipeline. The study should include estimates of the revenues which could be derived from the sale of the gas and the fixed and variable costs of upgrading.

        (c)  In determining whether natural gas with a heating value above 800 Btu per scf is marketable, the Commission will consider the information included in paragraph (b) of this section and whether:

        (1) The gas has actually been flared, vented to the atmosphere, or continuously injected into a non-producing zone for a period of one year, pursuant to legal authority; or

        (2) The gas has been certified as waste, , suitable for disposal, by an appropriate state authority.

#### § § 2.500

        (a) It is the policy of the Commission that any small entity is eligible to be considered for a reduction or waiver of a civil penalty if it has no history of previous violations, and the violations at issue are not the product of willful or criminal conduct, have not caused loss of life or injury to persons, damage to property or the environment or endangered persons, property or the environment. An eligible small entity will be granted a waiver if it can also demonstrate that it performed timely remedial efforts, made a good faith effort to comply with the law and did not obtain an economic benefit from the violations. An eligible small entity that cannot meet the criteria for waiver of a civil penalty may be eligible for consideration of a reduced penalty. Upon the request of a small entity, the Commission will consider the entity's ability to pay before assessing a civil penalty.

        (b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, the Commission reserves the right to waive or reduce civil penalties in appropriate individual circumstances where it determines that a waiver or reduction is warranted by the public interest.

      Classification

        § 3a.11   Classification of official information.

#### § § 3a.11

        (a)  Information or material which requires protection against unauthorized disclosure in the interest of the national defense or foreign relations of the United States (hereinafter collectively termed ) is classified Top Secret, Secret or Confidential, depending upon the degree of its significance to _national security_. No other categories are to be used to identify official information or material requiring protection in the interest of national security, except as otherwise expressly provided by statute. These classification categories are defined as follows:

        (1)  Top Secret refers to national security information or material which requires the highest degree of protection. The test for assigning Top Secret classification is whether its unauthorized disclosure could reasonably be expected to cause _exceptionally grave damage_ to the national security. Examples of  include armed hostilities against the United States or its allies; disruption of foreign relations vitally affecting the national security; the compromise of vital national defense plans or complex cryptologic and communications intelligence systems; the revelation of sensitive intelligence operations; and the disclosure of scientific or technological developments vital to national security. This classification is to be used with the utmost restraint.

        (2)  Secret refers to national security information or material which requires a substantial degree of protection. The test for assigning Secret classification shall be whether its unauthorized disclosure could reasonably be expected to cause _serious damage_ to the national security. Examples of  include disruption of foreign relations significantly affecting the national security; significant impairment of a program or policy directly related to the national security; revelation of significant military plans or intelligence operations; and compromise of significant scientific or technological developments relating to national security. The classification Secret shall be sparingly used.

        (3)  Confidential refers to national security information or material which requires protection, but not to the degree described in paragraphs (a) (1) and (2) of this section. The test for assigning Confidential classification shall be whether its unauthorized disclosure could reasonably be expected to cause damage to the national security.

        (b) Classified information will be assigned the lowest classification consistent with its proper protection. Documents will be classified according to their own content and not necessarily according to their relationship to other documents.

        (c) The overall classification of a file or group of physically connected documents will be at least as high as that of the most highly classified document therein. When put together as a unit or complete file, the classification of the highest classified document contained therein will be marked on a cover sheet, file folder (front and back), or other similar covering, and on any transmittal letters, comments, or endorsements.

        (d)  These designations are not security classification designations, but are used to indicate a requirement to protect material from unauthorized disclosure. Material identified under the provisions of this subparagraph will be handled and protected in the same manner as material classified Confidential except that it will not be subject to the central control system described in § 3a.71. Administrative Control designations are:

        (1)  This designation is used to identify information which does not require protection in the interest of national security, but requires protection in accordance with statutory requirements or in the public interest and which is exempt from public disclosure under 5 U.S.C. 552(b) and § 388.105(n) of this chapter.

        (2)  This administrative control designation is used by the Department of State to identify nondefense information requiring protection from unauthorized access. Material identified with this notation must be limited to persons having a definite need to know in order to fulfill their official responsibilities.

        (e) A letter or other correspondence which transmits classified material will be classified at a level at least as high as that of the highest classified attachment or enclosure. This is necessary to indicate immediately to persons who receive or handle a group of documents the highest classification involved. If the transmittal document does not contain classified information, or if the information in it is classified lower than in an enclosure, the originator will include a notation to that effect. (See § 3a.31(e).)

        § 3a.12   Authority to classify official information.

#### § § 3a.12

        (a) The authority to classify information or material originally under E.O. 11652 is restricted to those offices within the executive branch which are concerned with matters of national security, and is limited to the minimum number absolutely required for efficient administration.

        (b) The authority to classify information or material originally as Top Secret is to be exercised only by such officials as the President may designate in writing and by the heads of the following departments and agencies and such of their principal staff officials as the heads of these departments and agencies may designate in writing;

        (c) The authority to classify information or material originally as Secret is exercised only by:

        (1) Officials who have Top Secret classification authority under § 3a.11(b); and

        (2) The heads of the following departments and agencies and such principal staff officials as they may designate in writing:

        (d) The authority to classify information or material originally as Confidential is exercised by officials who have Top Secret or Secret classification authority.

        (e) Pursuant to E.O. 11652, the authority to classify information or material originally as Secret or Confidential in the FERC shall be exercised only by the Chairman, the Vice Chairman, and the Executive Director. When an incumbent change occurs in these positions, the name of the new incumbent will be reported to the Interagency Classification Review Committee NSC.

        § 3a.13   Classification responsibility and procedure.

#### § § 3a.13

        (a) Each FERC official who has classifying authority (§ 3a.12) shall be held accountable for the propriety of the classifications attributed to him. Unnecessary classification and overclassification shall be avoided. Classification shall be solely on the basis of national security considerations. In no case shall information be classified in order to conceal inefficiency or administrative error, to prevent embarrassment to the FERC or any of its officials or employees, or to prevent for any other reason the release of information which does not require protection in the interest of national security.

        (b) Each classified document shall show on its face its classification and whether it is subject to or exempt from the General Declassification Schedule (§ 3a.22(b)). It also shall show the office of origin, the date of preparation and classification and, to the extent practicable, be so marked as to indicate which portions are classified, at what level, and which portions are not classified in order to facilitate excerpting and other use. Material which merely contains references to classified materials, which references do not reveal classified information, shall not be classified.

        (c) Material classified under this part shall indicate on its face the identity of the highest authority authorizing the classification. Where the individual who signs or otherwise authenticates a document or item has also authorized the classification, no further annotation as to his identity is required.

        (d) Classified information or material furnished to the United States by a foreign government or international organization shall either retain its original classification or be assigned a U.S. classification. In either case, the classification shall assure a degree of protection equivalent to that required by the government or international organization which furnished the information or material.

        (e) Whenever information or material classified by an authorized official is incorporated in another document or other material by any person other than the classifier, the previously assigned security classification category shall be reflected thereon together with the identity of the classifier.

        (f) As a holder of classified information or material, the FERC shall observe and respect the classification assigned by the originator. If it is believed that there is unnecessary classification; that the assigned classification is improper, or that the document is subject to declassification under E.O. 11652, the FERC will so inform the originator who is then required by the Executive order to reexamine the classification.

      Declassification and Downgrading

        § 3a.21   Authority to downgrade and declassify.

#### § § 3a.21

        (a) The authority to downgrade and declassify information or material shall be exercised as follows:

        (1) Information or material may be downgraded or declassified by the official authorizing the original classification, by a successor or by a supervisory official of either.

        (2) Downgrading and declassification authority may also be exercised by an official specifically authorized under regulations issued by the head of the Department listed in sections 2 A and B of E.O. 11652, March 10, 1972.

        (3) In the case of classified information or material transferred pursuant to statute or Executive order in conjunction with a transfer of function and not merely for storage purposes, the receiving department or agency shall be deemed to be the originating department or agency for all purposes under E.O. 11652, including downgrading and declassification.

        (4) In the case of classified information or material not officially transferred under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, but originated in a department or agency which has since ceased to exist, each department or agency in possession shall be deemed to be the originating department or agency for all purposes. Such information or material may be downgraded and declassified after consulting with any other departments or agencies having an interest in the subject matter.

        (5) Classified information or material transferred to the General Services Administration for accession to the Archives of the United States shall be downgraded and declassified by the Archivist of the United States in accordance with E.O. 11652, directives of the President issued through the National Security Council, and pertinent regulations of the departments and agencies.

        § 3a.22   Declassification and downgrading.

#### § § 3a.22

        (a) When classified information of material no longer requires the level of protection assigned to it, it shall be downgraded or declassified in order to preserve the effectiveness and integrity of the classification system. The Chairman, Vice Chairman, and Executive Director exercise downgrading and declassification authority in the FERC.

        (b) Information and material classified prior to June 1, 1972, and assigned to Group 4 under E.O. 10501, as amended by E.O. 10964, unless declassified earlier by the original classifying authority, shall be declassified and downgraded in accordance with the following General Declassification Schedule.

        (1)  Information or material originally classified TOP SECRET becomes automatically downgraded to Secret at the end of the second full calendar year following the year in which it was originated, downgraded to Confidential at the end of the fourth full calendar year following the year in which it was originated, and declassified at the end of the 10th full calendar year following the year in which it was originated.

        (2)  Information and material originally classified Secret becomes automatically downgraded to Confidential at the end of the second full calendar year following the year in which it was originated, and declassified at the end of the eighth full calendar year following the year in which it was originated.

        (3)  Information and material originally classified Confidential becomes automatically declassified at the end of the sixth full calendar year following the year in which it was originated.

        (c) To the fullest extent applicable, there shall be indicated on each such FERC originated classified document whether it can be downgraded or declassified at a date earlier than under the above schedule, or after a specified event, or upon the removal of classified attachments or enclosures. Classified information in the possession of the Federal Power Commission, but not bearing a marking for automatic downgrading or declassification, will be marked or designated by the Chairman or the Security Officer designated by § 3a.51 hereof for automatic downgrading or declassification in accordance with the rules and regulations of the department or agency which originally classified the information or material.

        (d) When the FERC official having classification authority downgrades or cancels the classification of a document before its classification status changes automatically, each addressee to whom the document was transmitted shall be notified of the change unless the addressee has previously advised that the document was destroyed. Addressees must be notified similarly when it has been determined that a document must be upgraded.

        (e) When classified information from more than one source is incorporated into a new document or other material, the document or other material shall be classified, downgraded, or declassified in accordance with the provisions of E.O. 11652 and NSC directives thereunder applicable to the information requiring the greatest protection.

        (f) All information or material classified prior to June 1, 1972, other than that described in paragraph (b) of this section, is excluded from the General Classification Schedule. However, at any time after the expiration of 10 years from the date of origin it shall be subject to classification review and disposition by FERC provided:

        (1) A department or agency or member of the public requests review;

        (2) The request describes the record with sufficient particularity to enable FERC to identify it; and

        (3) The record can be obtained with a reasonable amount of effort.

        (g) All classified information or material which is 30 years old or more will be declassified under the following conditions:

        (1) All information and material classified after June 1, 1972, will, whether or not declassification has been requested, become automatically declassified at the end of 30 full calendar years after the date of its original classification except for such specifically identified information or material which the Chairman personally determines in writing to require continued protection because such continued protection is essential to the national security, or disclosure would place a person in immediate jeopardy. In such case, the Chairman also will specify the period of continued classification.

        (2) All information and material classified before June 1, 1972 and more than 30 years old will be systematically reviewed for declassification by the Archivist of the United States by the end of the 30th full calendar year following the year in which it was originated. In his review, the Archivist will separate and keep protected only such information or material as is specifically identified by the Chairman in accordance with paragraph (g) (1) of this section. In such case, the Chairman also will specify the period of continued classification.

        (3) The Executive Director, acting for the Chairman, is assigned to assist the Archivist of the United States in the exercise of his responsibilities indicated in paragraph (g)(2) of this section. He will:

        (i) Provide guidance and assistance to archival employees in identifying and separating those materials originated in FERC which are deemed to require continued classification; and

        (ii) Develop a list for submission to the Chairman which identifies the materials so separated, with recommendations concerning continued classification. The Chairman will then make the determination required under paragraphs (g) (1) and (2) of this section and cause a list to be created which identifies the documents included in the determination, indicates the reason for continued classification, and specifies the date on which such material shall be declassified.

> [Order 470, 38 FR 5161, Feb. 26, 1973, as amended by Order 756, 77 FR 4893, Feb. 1, 2012]

        § 3a.23   Review of classified material for declassification purposes.

#### § § 3a.23

        (a) All information and material classified after June 1, 1972, and determined in accordance with Chapter 21, title 44, United States Code, to be of sufficient historical or other value to warrant preservation shall be systematically reviewed on a timely basis for the purpose of making such information and material publicly available according to the declassification determination at the time of classification. During each calendar year the FPC shall segregate to the maximum extent possible all such information and material warranting preservation and becoming declassified at or prior to the end of such year. Promptly after the end of such year the FERC, or the Archives of the United States if transferred thereto, shall make the declassified information and material available to the public to the extent permitted by law.

        (b) Departments and agencies and members of the public may direct requests for review for declassification, as described in § 3a.22(f), to:

        (c) The FERC Review Committee will establish procedures to review and act within 30 days upon all applications and appeals regarding requests for declassification. The chairman, acting through the committee, is authorized to overrule previous determinations in whole or in part when, in its judgment, continued protection is no longer required. If the committee determines that continued classification is required under the criteria of section 5(B) of E.O. 11652, it will promptly so notify the requester and advise him that he may appeal the denial to the Interagency Classification Review Committee.

        (d) A request by a department or agency or a member of the public to review for declassification documents more than 30 years old shall be referred directly to the Archivist of the United States, and he shall have the requested documents reviewed for declassification. If the information or material requested has been transferred to the General Services Administration for accession into the Archives, the Archivist shall, together with the chairman, have the requested documents reviewed for declassification. Classification shall be continued in either case only when the chairman makes the personal determination indicated in § 3a.22(g)(1). The Archivist shall notify the requester promptly of such determination and of his right to appeal the denial to the Interagency Classification Review Committee.

        (e) For purposes of administrative determinations under paragraph (b), (c), or (d) of this section, the burden is on the FERC to show that continued classification is warranted. Upon a determination that the classified material no longer warrants classification, it will be declassified and made available to the requester if not otherwise exempt from disclosure under section 552(b) of Title 5, U.S.C. (Freedom of Information Act) or other provisions of law.

        (f) A request for classification review must describe the document with sufficient particularity to enable the FERC to identify it and obtain it with a reasonable amount of effort. Whenever a request is deficient in its description of the record sought, the requester will be asked to provide additional identifying information whenever possible. Before denying a request on the ground that it is unduly burdensome, the requester will be asked to limit his request to records that are reasonably obtainable. If the requester then does not describe the records sought with sufficient particularity, or the record requested cannot be obtained with a reasonable amount of effort, the requester will be notified of the reasons why no action will be taken and of his right to appeal such decision.

        (g) The FERC Review Committee will consist of the Executive Director, as Committee Chairman, the Secretary, and the Director, Office of Public Information, as members. In addition to the activities described in this paragraph, the Review Committee has authority to act on all suggestions and complaints with respect to administration of E.O. 11652 and this part 3a.

        (h) The FERC Review Committee is also responsible for recommending to the chairman appropriate administrative action to correct abuse or violation of any provision of E.O. 11652 or NSC directives thereunder, including notifications by warning letter, formal reprimand, and to the extent permitted by law, suspension without pay and removal.

        (i) The Chairman of the Review Committee will submit through the chairman, FERC, a report quarterly to the Interagency Classification Review Committee, NSC, of actions on classification review requests, classification abuses, and unauthorized disclosures.

      Classification Markings and Special Notations

        § 3a.31   Classification markings and special notations.

#### § § 3a.31

        (a) After the chairman, the vice chairman, or the executive director determines that classified information is contained in an original document or other item, the appropriate marking, i.e., Secret or Confidential, will be applied as indicated herein. In addition, each classified document will reflect its date of origin and the Bureau, Office, or Regional Office responsible for its preparation and issuance, and the identity of the highest authority authorizing the classification. Where the individual who signs or otherwise authenticates the document or other item has also authorized the classification, no further annotation as to his identity is required. Each classified document will also show on its face whether it is subject to or exempt from the General Declassification Schedule described in § 3a.22(b).

        (1) For marking documents which are subject to the General Declassification Schedule, the following stamp will be used:

        (2) For marking documents which are to be automatically declassified on a given event or date earlier than the General Declassification Schedule the following stamp will be used:

        (3) For marking documents which are exempt from the General Declassification Schedule the following stamp will be used:

        (b) Should the classifier fail to mark such document with one of the foregoing stamps, the document shall be deemed to be subject to the General Declassification Schedule. The person who signs or finally approves a document or other material containing classified information shall be deemed to be the classifier. If the classifier is other than such person he shall be identified on the stamp as indicated.

        (c) On documents, the classification markings Secret and Confidential will be stamped in red ink, printed, or written in letters considerably larger than those used in the text of the document. On documents which are typewritten in elite, pica or executive size type, the above markings should be in letters not less than three-sixteenths inch in height. No markings, other than those indicated above, are authorized to designate that a document or material requires protection in the interests of national security. The overall classification assigned to a document will be conspicuously marked on the top and bottom of each page and on the outside of the front and back covers, if any. Letters of transmittal, endorsements, routing slips, or any other papers of any size which conceal or partially conceal the cover, the title page, or first page, will bear the marking of the overall classification.

        (d) Whenever a classified document contains either more than one security classification category or unclassified information, each section, part or paragraph should be marked to the extent practicable to show its classification category or that it is unclassified.

        (e) Letters of transmittal or other covering documents which are classified solely because of classified enclosures or attachments, or which are classified in a lower category than such enclosures or attachments, will bear either of the following markings, as appropriate.

        (1) If the covering document is classified on its own, but has enclosures or attachments of a higher classification, or is a component (i.e., an endorsement or comment) or a file in which other components bear a higher classification:

        (2) If unclassified when separated from its classified enclosures or attachments:

        (f) In addition to the classification category markings prescribed above, the first or title page of each classified document will contain instructions as appropriate, in accordance with the following:

        (1)  The declassification and downgrading notation, as described in § 3a.31(g) will be applied to classified documents only. The notation will not be carried forward to unclassified letters of transmittals or other cover documents. When such cover documents are classified by their own content, they will be annotated with the notwithstanding instructions which pertain to the enclosures.

        (2)  Classified information will not be released or disclosed to any foreign national without proper specific authorization. This applies even when the classified material does not bear the special handling notice described below. The special handling notice indicated only that the material has been reviewed and a specific determination made that the information is not releasable to foreign nationals. If it is anticipated that the handling or distribution of a classified document will make it liable to inadvertent disclosure to foreign nationals it will be marked with a separate special handling notation, which will be carried forward to letters of transmittals or other cover documents. The notation reads:

        (g) Whenever classified material is upgraded, downgraded, or declassified, the material will be marked to reflect:

        (1) The change in classification.

        (2) The authority for the action.

        (3) The effective date.

        (4) The person or unit taking the action.

        (h) In addition to the foregoing marking requirements, warning notices shall be displayed prominently on classified documents or materials as prescribed below. When display of these warning notices on the documents or other materials is not feasible, the warnings shall be included in the written notification of the assigned classification.

        (1)  For classified information or material containing restricted data as defined in the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended:

        (2)  For classified information or material containing solely Formerly Restricted Data, as defined in section 142.d, Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended:

        (3)  For classified information or material furnished to persons outside the Executive Branch of Government other than as described in paragraphs (h)(1) and (2) of this section.

        (4)  For classified information or material relating to sensitive intelligence sources and methods, the following warning notice shall be used, in addition to and in conjunction with those prescribed in paragraph (h)(1), (2), or (3), of this section, as appropriate:

      Access to Classified Materials

        § 3a.41   Access requirements.

#### § § 3a.41

        (a) The Personnel Security Officer, on a continuing current basis, will certify to the Security Officer, the head of each bureau and office and each regional engineer, the names of officers and employees who have been granted a security clearance for access to classified material and the level of such clearance (Top Secret, Secret, Confidential). The Personnel Security Officer will maintain accurate and current listings of personnel who have been granted security clearances in accordance with the standards and criteria of Executive Orders 10450 and 10865 and as prescribed by this part.

        (b) In addition to a security clearance, staff members must have a need for access to classified information or material in connection with the performance of duties. The determination for the need-to-know will be made by the official having responsibility for the classified information or material.

        (c) When a staff member no longer requires access to classified information or material in connection with performance of official duties, the Personnel Security Officer will administratively withdraw the security clearance. Additionally, when a staff member no longer needs access to a particular security classification category, the security clearance will be adjusted to the classification category required. In both cases, this action will be without prejudice to the staff member's eligibility for a security clearance or upgrading of category should the need again arise.

        (d) Access to classified information or material originated by the FERC may be authorized to persons outside the Executive Branch of the Government engaged in historical research and to former Presidential appointees as provided in paragraphs VI B and C of the NSC directive dated May 17, 1972. The determination of access authorization will be made by the Chairman.

        (e) Except as otherwise provided in section 102 of the National Security Act of 1947, 61 Stat. 495, 50 U.S.C. 403, classified information or material originating in one department or agency shall not be disseminated outside any other department or agency to which it has been made available without the consent of the originating organization.

The Director, OAO, will designate alternate Top Secret Control Officers and alternated Security Officers, who will be authorized, subject to such limitations as may be imposed by the Director, to perform the duties for which the Top Secret Control Officer and Security Officer is responsible. As used hereinafter, the terms Top Secret Control Officer and Security Officer shall be interpreted as including the alternate Top Secret Control Officers and Security Officers. The FERC Security Officer is authorized and directed to insure the proper application of the provisions of Executive Order 11652 and of this part.

        (b) Regional Engineers are designated as Regional Security Officers for the purpose of carrying out the functions assigned herein.

        (c) The Director, OAO, will appoint in writing appropriately cleared staff members to act as couriers for transmittal, as necessary, for classified information or material.

      Storage and Custody of Classified Information

        § 3a.61   Storage and custody of classified information.

#### § § 3a.61

        (a) Unless specifically authorized by the Chairman or Executive Director, classified information and materials within the Washington office will be stored only in GSA-approved security containers in the Office of Administrative Operations. Such containers will be of steel construction with built-in, three-position, dial-type, manipulation-proof, changeable combination locks.

        (b) A custodian and one or more alternate custodians will be assigned responsibility for the security of each container under his jurisdiction in which classified information is stored. Such assignment will be made a matter of record by executing GSA Optional Form 63, Classified Container Registration, and affixing it to the container concerned. Custodians will be responsible for assuring that combinations are changed as required and that locking and checking functions are accomplished daily in compliance with paragraphs (g) and (h) of this section.

        (c) GSA Optional Form 63 is a 3-sheet form, each sheet having a specific purpose and disposition, as follows:

        (1) Sheet 1 records the names, addresses, and home telephone numbers of the custodian and alternate custodians. Sheet 1 is affixed to the outside of the container.

        (2) Sheet 2 records the combination of the container and is placed inside Sheet 3, which is an envelope.

        (3) Sheet 3, an envelope, is a carbon copy of Sheet 1. When the container combination is recorded on Sheet 2, it is sealed inside Sheet 3 which is then forwarded to the FERC Top Secret Control Officer.

        (d) GSA Optional Form 62, Safe or Cabinet Security Record, will be attached conspicuously to the outside of each container used to store classified information. The form is used to certify the opening and locking of a container, and the checking of a container at the end of each working day or whenever it is opened and locked during the day.

        (e) Combinations of containers used to store classified materials will be assigned classifications equal to the highest category of classified information stored therein. Active combinations are subject to the safeguarding and receipting requirements of this instruction. Superseded combinations become declassified automatically and certificates of destruction therefore are unnecessary.

        (f) Knowledge of or access to the combination of a container used for the storage of classified material will be given only to those appropriately cleared individuals who are authorized access to the information stored therein.

        (g) Combinations of containers used to store classified material will be changed at least once a year. A combination will be changed also whenever anyone knowing or having access to it is transferred; when the combination has been subjected to compromise; when the security classification of the container is upgraded; and at any other time as may be deemed necessary. Combinations to locks on security containers will be changed only by individuals having a security clearance equal to the highest category of classified material stored therein. Changing lock combinations is a responsibility of OAO. (See FPC Special Instruction No. AM 2162.2, Periodic Change of Combination on Locks.)

        (h) The individual who unlocks a container will indicate the date and time and initial entry on GSA Optional Form 62. At the close of each workday, or when the container is locked at earlier time, the individual locking the container will make the appropriate entry on GSA Optional Form 62. An individual other than the one who locked the container will check to insure that it is properly closed and locked and will make the appropriate entry on GSA Optional Form 62. When a container has not been opened during the day, the checker will enter the date and the notation “Not Opened” and make appropriate entry in the “Checked By” column.

        (i) The red and white reversible “Closed-Open” cardboard sign will be used on all classified containers to indicate whether the container is open or locked.

        (j) Typewriter ribbons used in the preparation of classified information will be safeguarded in the manner appropriate for the degree of classification involved. Cloth ribbons are considered insecure until both upper and lower lines have been cycled through the typewriter at least twice. Carbon paper or film ribbons are insecure at all times since the imprint thereon cannot be obliterated and such ribbon must be destroyed as classified waste. Insecure ribbons will not be left in typewriters overnight but will be stored in appropriate classified container.

#### § § 3a.71

        (a) The Office of Administrative Operations is the central control registry for the receipt and dispatch of classified material in the Washington office and maintains the accountability register of all classified material. In addition, each Regional Engineer will maintain an accountability register for classified material of which he has custody.

        (b) With the exception of the Chairman, Vice Chairman, and Executive Director, no individual, bureau, or office is authorized to receive, open, or dispatch classified material other than the authorized personnel in OAO or the Regional Engineers. Classified material received by other than the OAO or Regional Engineers will be delivered promptly and unopened to the Security Officer or Regional Engineer in order that it may be brought under accountable control.

        (c) Each classified document received by or originating in the FERC will be assigned an individual control number by the central control registry, OAO. Control numbers will be assigned serially within a calendar year. The first digit of the four-digit control number will indicate the calendar year in which the document was originated or received in the FERC. Control numbers assigned to top secret material will be separate from the sequence for other classified material and will be prefixed by the letters “TS”. Examples:

        (d) The accounting system for control of classified documents will be effected through the use of FERC Form 55, Classified Document Control Record and Receipt. This form will be used to:

        (1) Register an accurate, unclassified description of the document; its assigned control number; and the date it is placed under accountability.

        (2) Serve as the accountability register for classified material.

        (3) Record all changes in status or custody of the document during its classification life or the period it is retained under accountability in the FERC.

        (4) Serve as the principal basis for all classified document inventory and tracer actions.

        (5) Serve as a receipt for the central control registry when the document is transferred.

        (e) For Top Secret documents only, an access register, FPC Form 1286, Top Secret Access Record, for recording the names of all individuals having access to the document, will be prepared in addition to FPC Form 55. In addition, a physical inventory of all Top Secret documents will be conducted during June of each year by the Top Secret Control Officer and witnessed by a staff member holding a Top Secret clearance.

        (f) When classified documents are regraded, declassified, or destroyed, the change in status will be recorded in the file copy of FPC Form 55 in the central control registry.

        (g) Classified documents will not be reproduced by any means except on the specific written authority of the FPC Security Officer.

        (h) In the Washington Office, classified material will be destroyed by OAO and will be accomplished by burning in the presence of a  and a  Destroying and witnessing officials will be alternate Security Officers from OAO. A record of destruction of each classified document will be maintained on FPC Form 1285. Classified Document Destruction Certificate. In addition, the date of destruction and the destruction certificate number will be recorded on the file copy of FPC Form 55 in the central control registry. The original signed copy of the destruction certificate will be retained in the central control registry. The duplicate copy will be retained by the _destroying official_. Regional Engineers will follow these instructions for destruction of classified material in their possession, except that the destroying official shall be the Regional Engineer and the witnessing official shall be any other individual having appropriate security clearance.

        (i) It is the responsibility of any staff member who has knowledge of the loss or possible compromise of classified information immediately to report the circumstances to the Director, OAO. The Director, OAO, will notify the originating Department and any other interested Department of the loss or possible compromise in order that a damage assessment can be conducted. An immediate inquiry will be initiated by the Director, OAO, for the purpose of taking corrective action and for recommendations to the chairman, through the Review Committee, for appropriate administrative, disciplinary, or legal action.

      Transmittal of Classified Material

        § 3a.81   Transmittal of classified material.

#### § § 3a.81

        (a) A continuous receipting system, using copies of FERC Form 55, will record all transfers of classified items between elements or officials within the FERC. Receipts for transmittal of classified items from the central registry to the first recipient will be acknowledged on copy number one (original) of FERC Form 55. This copy will be returned to and become part of the central register, where it will remain as an active record until the item is either destroyed or transmitted outside the FERC control registry system. Receipts for subsequent transmittals through the FERC will be recorded on the remaining copies of FERC Form 55.

        (b) A recipient will acknowledge receipt and assumption of custody of classified material exactly as it is described on FPC Form 55. If it is determined that parts are missing, it is incorrectly numbered, or otherwise recorded in error on FPC Form 55. The recipient will not sign for the material but will return it promptly to the transmitting element, notifying them accordingly.

        (c) Whenever a classified or protected document is being internally transmitted, or is in use, it will be covered by either FERC Label 19, Top Secret Cover Sheet (yellow); FERC Label 20, Secret Cover Sheet (red); FERC Label 21, Confidential Cover Sheet (blue), or FERC Label 22, Official Use Only (Limited Official Use) green. In addition, the red back sheet, FERC Label 23, will be used. With the exception of the FERC Form 55, no transmittal paper or other material will be placed over the label, and no writing will be applied thereon.

        (d) The transmission or transfer of custody of classified material outside of the FERC Washington offices or the Regional Offices will be covered by FERC Form 1284, Classified Document Receipt and/or Tracer, prepared in duplicate (one post card and one paper copy). The post card will be enclosed, along with the material being transferred, in the inner envelope, wrapping or container, and the paper copy retained in the central registry pending return of the signed post card.

        (e) Classified material transmitted outside of the FERC Washington offices or the Regional Offices will be dispatched in two opaque envelopes or double wrapped in opaque wrapping paper. The outgoing material will be prepared for transmission by:

        (1) Preparing and enclosing an appropriate receipt (see paragraph (d) of this section) in the inner envelope or wrapping.

        (2) Addressing, return addressing, and sealing or taping the inner envelope or wrapping.

        (3) Marking the security classification and other required notations on the front and back of the inner cover. If the nature of the contents deem it necessary or advisable, the inner cover may be marked with the following or a similar notation “To Be Opened By Addressee Only.” When this notation is used, an appropriate “Attention” line must be contained in the address on the outer envelope to insure delivery to the intended recipient.

        (4) Enclosing the inner envelope or wrapping in an opaque outer envelope wrapper containing the appropriate address information. These outer covers will not contain any of the markings contained on the inner cover. If the outer cover does not fully conceal the markings on the inner envelope or wrapper, a sheet of plain paper should be folded around the inner wrapper to conceal the markings.

        (f) Transmittal of Top Secret information and material shall be effected preferably by oral discussion in person between the officials concerned. Otherwise the transmission of Top Secret information and material shall be by specifically designated personnel, by State Department diplomatic pouch, by a messenger-courier system especially created for that purpose, over authorized communications circuits in encrypted form or by other means authorized by the National Security Council.

      Subpart B—Standards for Maintenance and Collection of Records

        § 3b.201   Content of records.

#### § § 3b.201

        (a) All records which are maintained by the Commission in a system of records will contain only such information about an individual that is relevant and necessary to accomplish a purpose of the Commission as required to be accomplished by statute or by executive order of the President. Pursuant to § 3b.3(a)(4) of this part, the Commission will identify in the  the specific provisions in law which authorize it to maintain information in a system of records. In determining the  and  of records, the following considerations will govern:

        (1) Whether each item of information relates to the purposes, in law, for which the system is maintained;

        (2) The adverse consequences, if any, of not collecting the information;

        (3) Whether the need for the information could be met through the maintenance of the information in a non-individually identifiable form;

        (4) Whether the information in the record is required to be collected on every individual who is the subject of a record in the system or whether a sampling procedure would suffice;

        (5) The length of time it is necessary to retain the information;

        (6) The financial cost of maintaining the record as compared to the adverse consequences of not maintaining it; and

        (7) Whether the information, while generally relevant and necessary to accomplish a statutory purpose, is specifically relevant and necessary only in certain cases.

        (b) All records which the Commission maintains in a system of records and which are used to make a determination about an individual will be maintained with such accuracy, relevance, timeliness, and _completeness_ as is reasonably necessary to assure fairness to the individual in the determination. Where practicable, in questionable instances, reverification of pertinent information with the individual to whom the record pertains may be appropriate. In pursuit of  in the collection of information, the Commission will limit its records to those elements of information which clearly bear on the determination for which the records are intended to be used, assuring that all elements necessary to the determination are present before the determination is made.

        (c) Prior to disseminating any records in a system of records, the Commission will make reasonable efforts to assure that such records are as accurate, relevant, timely, and complete as appropriate for the purposes for which they are collected and/or maintained, except when they are disclosed to a member of the public under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552, as amended, or to another agency.

        (d) No records of the Commission in a system of records shall describe how any individual exercises his First Amendment rights unless expressly authorized by statute or by the individual about whom the record is maintained or unless pertinent to and within the scope of an authorized law enforcement activity. The exercise of these rights includes, but is not limited to, religious and political beliefs, freedom of speech and of the press, and freedom of assembly and petition. In determining whether or not a particular activity constitutes the exercise of a right guaranteed by the First Amendment, the Commission will apply the broadest reasonable interpretation.

        § 3b.202   Collection of information from individuals concerned.

#### § § 3b.202

        (a) Any information collected by the Commission for inclusion in a system of records which may result in adverse determinations about an individual's rights, benefits, and privileges under Federal programs, will, to the greatest extent practicable, be collected directly from the subject individual (see paragraph (d) of this section).

        (b) The Commission will inform each individual whom it asks to supply information about himself, on the form which it uses to collect the information, or on a separate sheet that can be easily retained by the individual, in language which is explicit, informative, and easily understood, and not so lengthy as to deter an individual from reading it, of:

        (1) The specific provision of the statute or executive order of the President, including the brief title or subject of that statute or order which authorizes the solicitation of the information; whether disclosure of such information is mandatory or voluntary; and whether the Commission is authorized or required to impose penalties for failing to respond;

        (2) The principal purpose or purposes for which the information is intended to be used;

        (3) The routine uses which may be made of the information, as described in the  in the notice of the system of records in which the information is maintained, and which are relatable and necessary to a purpose described pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this section; and

        (4) The effects (beneficial and adverse) on the individual if any, of not providing all or any part of the requested information.

        (c) Social security numbers will not be required from individuals whom the Commission asks to supply information unless the disclosure of the number is required by Federal statute or unless disclosure is to the Commission maintaining a system of records in existence and operating before January 1, 1975, if such disclosure was required pursuant to a statute or regulation adopted prior to such date to verify the identity of an individual. When an individual is requested to disclose his social security number to the Commission, he will be informed under what statutory or other authority such number is solicited, what uses will be made of it, whether disclosure is mandatory or voluntary, and if it is mandatory, under what provisions of law or regulation.

        (d) The use of third-party sources to collect information about an individual may be appropriate in certain circumstances. In determining when the use of third-party sources would be appropriate, the following considerations will govern:

        (1) When the information needed can only be obtained from a third party;

        (2) When the cost of collecting the information directly from the individual concerned far exceeds the cost of collecting it from a third party;

        (3) When there is little risk that the information proposed to be collected from the third party, if inaccurate, could result in an adverse determination about the individual concerned.

        (4) When there is a need to insure the accuracy of information supplied by an individual by verifying it with a third party, or there is a need to obtain a qualitative assessment of the individual's capabilities or character; or

        (5) When there are provisions for verifying any third-party information with the individual concerned before making a determination based on that information.

        § 3b.203   Rules of conduct.

        (1) That there are criminal penalties for knowing and willful unauthorized disclosure of material within a system of records; for willful failure to publish a public notice of the existence of a system of records; and for knowingly and willfully requesting or obtaining records under false pretenses;

        (2) That the Commission may be subject to civil suit due to failure to amend an individual's record in accordance with his request or failure to review his request in conformity with § 3b.224; refusal to comply with an individual's request of access to a record under § 3b.221; willful or intentional failure to maintain a record accurately pursuant to § 3b.201(b) and consequently a determination is made which is adverse to the individual; or willful or intentional failure to comply with any other provision of the Privacy Act of 1974, or any rule promulgated thereunder, in such a way as to have an adverse effect upon an individual.

        § 3b.220   Notification of maintenance of records to individuals concerned.

#### § § 3b.220

        (a) Upon written request, either in person or by mail, to the appropriate system manager specified for each system of records, an individual will be notified whether a system of records maintained by the Commission and named by the individual contains a record or records pertaining to him and filed under his individual name, or some other identifying particular.

        (b) The system manager may require appropriate identification pursuant to § 3b.222, and if necessary, may request from the individual additional information needed to locate the record which the individual should reasonably be expected to know, such as, but not limited to, date of birth, place of birth, and a parent's first name.

        (c) When practicable, the system manager will provide a written acknowledgement of the inquiry within ten days of receipt of the inquiry (excluding Saturdays, Sundays and legal public holidays) and notification of whether or not a system of records maintained by the Commission and named by the individual contains a record pertaining to him and filed under his individual name or some other identifying particular. If the system manager is unable to provide an answer within the ten-day period, he will so inform the individual in writing, stating the reasons therefor (for good cause shown), and when it is anticipated that notification will be made. Such an extension will not exceed fifteen days from receipt of the inquiry (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays).

        (d)  as used in all sections of this part, includes circumstances such as the following: Where a search for and/or collection of requested records from inactive storage, field offices, or other establishments is required; where a voluminous amount of data is involved; where information on other individuals must be separated or expunged from the record; or where consultations are required with other agencies or with others having a substantial interest in the determination of the request.

        § 3b.221   Access of records to individuals concerned.

#### § § 3b.221

        (a) Upon written request, either in person or by mail, to the appropriate system manager specified for each system of records, any individual may gain access to records or information in a system of records pertaining to him and filed under his individual name, or some other identifying particular, to review and to have a copy made of all or any portion thereof in a form comprehensible to him.

        (b) A person of his own choosing may accompany the individual to whom the record pertains when the record is disclosed [see § 3b.222(e)].

        (c) Before disclosure, the following procedure may apply:

        (d) The system manager will provide a written acknowledgement of the receipt of a request for access within ten days of receipt (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays). Such acknowledgement may, if necessary, request any additional information needed to locate the record which the individual may reasonably be expected to know, and may require appropriate identification pursuant to § 3b.222 of this part. No acknowledgment is required if access can be granted within the ten-day period.

        (1) If access can be granted, the system manager will notify the individual, in writing, as to when, and whether access will be granted in person or by mail, so that access will be provided within twenty days of the receipt of the request (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays). If the system manager is unable to provide access within twenty days of receipt of the request, he will inform the individual in writing as to the reasons therefor (for good cause shown), and when it is anticipated that access will be granted. If the expected date of access indicated in the written notification to the individual cannot be met, the system manager will advise the individual in writing of the delay, the reasons therefor (for good cause shown), and of a revised date when access will be granted. Such extensions will not exceed thirty days from receipt of the request (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays).

        (2) If access cannot be granted, the system manager will inform the individual, in writing, within twenty days of receipt of the request (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays) of the refusal of his request; the reasons for the refusal; the right of the individual, within thirty days of receipt of the refusal, to request in writing a review of the refusal by the Chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 888 First Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, or by an officer designated by the Chairman pursuant to § 3b.224(f); and the right of the individual to seek advice or assistance from the system manager in obtaining such a review.

        (e) The Chairman, or officer designated pursuant to § 3b.224(f), not later than thirty days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays) from the date of receipt of the individual's request for review will complete such review, unless, for good cause shown, the Chairman, or designated officer, extends the thirty-day period in writing to the individual with reasons for the delay and the approximate date on which the review is expected to be completed. Such an extension will not exceed thirty-five days from receipt of the request for review (excluding Saturdays, Sundays and legal public holidays). The Chairman, or designated officer, will make one of the following determinations:

        (1) Grant the individual access to the requested record and notify the individual, in writing, as to when, and whether access will be granted in person or by mail; or

        (2) Inform the individual in writing of the refusal, the reasons therefor, and the right of the individual to seek judicial review of the refusal of his request for access.

        § 3b.222   Identification requirements.

#### § § 3b.222

        The appropriate system manager specified for each system of records will require reasonable identification from individuals to assure that records in a system of records are disclosed to the proper person. Identification requirements will be consistent with the nature of the records being disclosed.

        (a) Disclosure of records to the individual to whom the record pertains, or under whose name or some other identifying particular the record is filed, in person, requires that the individual show an identification card. Employee identification, a Medicare card, or a driver's license are examples of acceptable identification. Documents incorporating a picture and signature of the individual are preferred.

        (b) For records disclosed by mail, the system manager will require certain minimum identifying information: name, date of birth, or the system's personal identifier if known to the individual. A comparison of the signatures of the requester and those in the record will be used to determine identity.

        (c) If the system manager determines that the data in the record is so sensitive that unauthorized access could cause harm or embarrassment to the individual involved, a signed notarized statement asserting identity or some other reasonable means to verify identity will be required.

        (d) If an individual can provide no suitable information or documents for identification, the system manager will require a signed statement from the individual asserting his identity and stipulating that the individual understands that knowingly or willfully seeking or obtaining access to records about an individual under false pretenses is a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of up to $5,000.

        (e) The system manager will require an individual who wishes to be accompanied by another person when reviewing his records to furnish a signed written statement authorizing discussion of his records in the presence of the accompanying person.

        (f) The appropriate identification requirements of this section may be required by a system manager from an individual to whom a record does not pertain who seeks access to the record pursuant to § 3b.225 of this part.

        (g) No individual will be denied notification of maintenance of a record pursuant to § 3b.220 or access to a record pursuant to §§ 3b.221 and 3b.224 for refusing to disclose a social security number.

        (h) No verification of identity will be required of individuals seeking notification of or access to records which are otherwise available to a member of the public under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552, as amended.

        § 3b.223   Fees.

#### § § 3b.223

        (a) Fees will be charged for the direct cost of duplication of records in a system of records when copies are requested by the individual seeking access to the records. Any person may obtain a copy of the Commission's schedule of fees by telephone, by mail or by coming in person to the office of the appropriate system manager who is responsible for the protection and accountability of the desired record. Requests for copies of requested records and payment therefor must be made to the system manager. Fees will only be charged for costs of $2 or more.

        (b) Where practicable, self-service duplication of requested documents may also be made on duplicating machines by the person requesting the records, on a reimbursable basis to the system manager, in the presence of the Commission representative having physical custody of the record. Where data has been extracted from one of the Commission's systems of records on magnetic tape or disks, or computer files, copies of the records of these files may be secured on a reimbursable basis upon written request to the appropriate system manager. The fee will vary for each requirement, depending on size and complexity.

        (c) No fee will be charged in the following instances:

        (1) When the system manager determines that he can grant access to records only by providing a copy of the record through the mail because he cannot provide reasonable means for the individual to have access in person;

        (2) For search and review of requested records to determine if they fall within the disclosure requirements of this part; and

        (3) When the system manager makes a copy of the record as a necessary part of the process of making it available for review.

        (d) Except for requests made by Government agencies, certification of copies of any official Commission record shall be accompanied by a fee of $2 per document.

        § 3b.224   Requests to amend records and disputes thereon.

#### § § 3b.224

        (a) Upon written request, either in person or by mail, to the appropriate system manager specified for each system of records, any individual may amend records in a system of records pertaining to him and filed under his individual name or some other identifying particular. Such requests should contain identifying information needed to locate the record, a brief description of the item or items of information to be amended, and information in support of the request for amendment. The individual may obtain assistance in preparing his request to amend a record from the appropriate system manager.

        (b) The system manager will provide a written acknowledgement of the receipt of a request to amend within ten days of receipt (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays). Such an acknowledgement may, if necessary, request any additional information needed to make a determination which the individual may reasonably be expected to know, and verification of identity consistent with § 3b.222. The acknowledgement will clearly describe the request and advise the individual requesting the amendment when he may expect to be notified of action taken on the request. No acknowledgement is required if the request can be reviewed, processed, and the individual notified of compliance or denial within the ten-day period.

        (c) The system manager will complete the review and advise the individual in writing of the results within twenty days of the receipt of the request (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays). If the system manager is unable to complete the review within twenty days of the receipt of the request, he will inform the individual in writing as to the reasons therefor (for good cause shown) and when it is anticipated that the review will be completed. If the completion date for the review indicated in the acknowledgement cannot be met, the system manager will advise the individual in writing of the delay, the reasons therefor (for good cause shown), and of a revised date when the review may be expected to be completed. Such extensions will not exceed thirty days from receipt of the request (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays). The system manager will take one of the following actions:

        (1) Make the requested correction or amendment; so advise the individual in writing; and, where an accounting of the disclosure of the record was made pursuant to § 3b.226, advise all previous recipients of the record in writing of the fact that the amendment was made and the substance of the amendment [see § 3b.225(d)]; or

        (2) Inform the individual in writing of the refusal to amend the record in accordance with the request; the reasons for the refusal including any of the standards which were employed pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section in conducting the review; the right of the individual, within thirty days of receipt of the refusal, to request in writing a review of the refusal by the Chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 888 First Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, or by an officer designated by the Chairman pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section; and the right of the individual to seek advice or assistance from the system manager in obtaining such a review.

        (d) In reviewing a record in response to a request to amend, the system manager and the Chairman, or the officer he designates pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section, shall assess the accuracy, relevance, timeliness and completeness of the record. They shall consider the record in terms of the criteria established in § 3b.201 of this part.

        (e) The Chairman, or officer designated pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section, not later than thirty days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays) from the date of receipt of the individual's request for review, will complete such review, unless, for good cause shown, the Chairman, or designated officer, extends the thirty-day period in a writing to the individual with reasons for the delay and the approximate date on which the review is expected to be completed. Such an extension will not exceed thirty-five days from receipt of the request for review (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays). The Chairman, or designated officer, will make one of the following determinations:

        (1) Make the correction in accordance with the individual's request and proceed as in paragraph (c)(1) of this section; or

        (2) Inform the individual in writing of:

        (i) The refusal to amend the record in accordance with the request,

        (ii) The reasons therefor, including any of the standards which were employed pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section in conducting the review;

        (iii) The right of the individual to file with the Chairman, or designated officer, a concise written statement setting forth the reasons for his disagreement with the decision;

        (iv) The fact that the statement of disagreement will be made available to anyone to whom the record is subsequently disclosed, together with the portion of the record which is disputed clearly noted, and, with, at the discretion of the Chairman, or designated officer, a brief statement by the Chairman, or designated officer, summarizing the reasons for refusing to amend the record;

        (v) Where an accounting of the disclosure of the record was made pursuant to § 3b.226 of this part, the fact that prior recipients of the disputed record will be provided a copy of the individual's statement of disagreement, with the portion of the record which is disputed clearly noted, and, at the Chairman's or designated officer's discretion, the statement summarizing the refusal to amend [see § 3b.225(d)]; and

        (vi) The individual's right to seek judicial review of the refusal to amend.

        (f) The Chairman may designate, in writing, another officer of the Commission to act in his capacity for the purposes of this part. The officer will be organizationally independent of or senior to the system manager who made the initial determination and will conduct a review independent of the initial determination.

The written statement of assurance should include at a minimum:

        (i) A statement of the purpose for requesting the record; and

        (ii) Certification that the record will only be used for statistical purposes.

        (6) To the National Archives of the United States, pursuant to 44 U.S.C. 2103, as a record which has sufficient historical or other value to warrant its continued preservation by the United States Government, or for the evaluation by the Administrator of General Services or his designee to determine whether the record has such value;

        (7) To another agency or to an instrumentality of any governmental jurisdiction within or under the control of the United States for a civil or criminal law enforcement activity if the activity is authorized by law, and if the head of the agency or instrumentality, or his delegated official, has made a written request to the appropriate system manager specifying the particular portion of the record desired and the law enforcement activity for which the record is being sought;

        (8) To a person pursuant to a showing of compelling circumstances affecting the health or safety of an individual (not necessarily the individual to whom the record pertains), if, upon disclosure, notification of such is sent to the last known address of the individual to whom the record pertains;

        (9) To either House of Congress, or to any committee or subcommittee thereof, on a matter within its jurisdiction;

A notice will be sent to the individual's last known address noted in the Commission's files.

        (d) The appropriate system manager shall notify all prior recipients of records, disclosure to whom an accounting was made pursuant to § 3b.226, of any amendments made to the records, including corrections, amendments and notations of dispute made pursuant to §§ 3b.224(c)(1) and 3b.224(e)(1) and (2)(v), within ten days of receipt of the corrected information or notation of dispute (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays), except under unusual circumstances [see circumstances described in § 3b.220(d)].

        (e) The content of the records disclosed under this section shall be maintained pursuant to the standards established in § 3b.201(c).

        § 3b.226   Accounting of disclosures.

        (c) Except for disclosures made for law enforcement purposes pursuant to § 3b.225(b)(7), and unless the system of records has been exempted from this provision pursuant to subpart D of this part, each system manager will make the accounting made under paragraph (a) of this section available to the individual named in the record at his written request.

        (d) The accounting of disclosures is not a system of records under the definition in § 3b.2(e) and no accounting will be maintained for disclosure of the accounting of disclosures.

        § 3b.227   Mailing lists.

#### § § 3b.227

        An individual's name and address maintained by the Commission will not be sold or rented for commercial or other solicitation purposes not related to the purposes for which the information was collected, unless such sale or rental is specifically authorized by law. This provision shall not be construed to require the withholding of names or addresses otherwise permitted to be made public, as pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552, as amended.

        (5) Anyone may file a petition with the Commission requesting access to the information specified in paragraph (b)(3) of this section if it believes that an applicant is not making the information reasonably available for public inspection or reproduction. The petition must describe in detail the basis for the petitioner's belief.

        (6) An applicant must publish notice twice of the filing of its application, no later than 14 days after the filing date, in a daily or weekly newspaper of general circulation in each county in which the project is located. The notice must disclose the filing date of the application and briefly summarize it, including the applicant's name and address, the type of facility applied for, its proposed location, the places where the information specified in paragraph (b)(3) of this section is available for inspection and reproduction, and the date by which any requests for additional scientific studies are due under paragraph (b)(7) of this section, and must state that the Commission will publish subsequent notices soliciting public participation if the application is found acceptable for filing. The applicant must promptly provide the Commission with proof of the publications of this notice.

        (7) If any resource agency, Indian tribe, or person believes that an additional scientific study should be conducted in order to form an adequate factual basis for a complete analysis of the application on its merits, the resource agency, Indian tribe, or person must file a request for the study with the Commission not later than 60 days after the application is filed and serve a copy of the request on the applicant. The Commission will issue public notice of the tendering for filing of each application for hydropower license or exemption; each such applicant must submit a draft of this notice to the Commission with its application. For any such additional study request, the requester must describe the recommended study and the basis for the request in detail, including who should conduct and participate in the study, its methodology and objectives, whether the recommended study methods are generally accepted in the Scientific community, how the study and information sought will be useful in furthering the resource goals that are affected by the proposed facilities, and approximately how long the study will take to complete, and must explain why the study objectives cannot be achieved using the data already available. In addition, in the case of a study request by a resource agency or Indian tribe that had failed to request the study during the pre-filing consultation process under § 4.38 of this part or § 16.8 of this chapter, the agency or Indian tribe must explain why this request was not made during the pre-filing consultation process and show good cause why its request for the study should be considered by the Commission.

        (8) An applicant may file a response to any such study request within 30 days of its filing, serving a copy of the response on the requester.

        (9) The requirements of paragraphs (b)(3) to (b)(8) of this section only apply to an application for license or exemption filed on or after May 20, 1991. Paragraphs (b)(3) and (b)(4) of this section do not apply to applications subject to the requirements of § 16.7 of this chapter.

        (c)(1) Every applicant for a license or exemption for a project with a capacity of 80 megawatts or less must include in its application copies of the statements made under § 4.38(b)(2)(vi).

        (2) If an applicant reverses a statement of intent not to seek PURPA benefits:

        (3) If the project affects lands of the United States, notify the appropriate Federal office of the application and the specific lands affected, pursuant to section 24 of the Federal Power Act.

        (4) For an application for a license seeking benefits under section 210 of the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978, as amended, for a project that would be located at a new dam or diversion, serve the public notice issued for the application under paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section to interested agencies at the time the applicant is notified that the application is accepted for filing.

        (e) In order for an application to conform adequately to the requirements of paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of this section and of § 4.38, an application must be completed fully. No blanks should be left in the application. No material or information required in the application should be omitted. If an applicant believes that its application conforms adequately without containing certain required material or information, it must explain in detail why the material or information is not being submitted and what steps were taken by the applicant to provide the material or information. If the Commission finds that an application does not adequately conform to the requirements of paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of this section and of § 4.38, the Commission or its designee will consider the application either deficient or patently deficient.

        (1)  (i) An application that in the judgment of the Director of the Office of Energy Projects does not conform to the requirements of paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of this section and of § 4.38, may be considered deficient. An applicant having a deficient application will be afforded additional time to correct deficiencies, not to exceed 45 days from the date of notification in the case of an application for a preliminary permit or exemption from licensing or 90 days from the date of notification in the case of an application for license. Notification will be by letter or, in the case of minor deficiencies, by telephone. Any notification will specify the deficiencies to be corrected. Deficiencies must be corrected by submitting the specified materials or information to the Secretary of the Commission within the time specified in the notification of deficiency in accordance with filing procedures posted on the Commission's Web site at

        (ii) Upon submission of a conforming application, action will be taken in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section.

        (iii) If the revised application is found not to conform to the requirements of paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of this section and of § 4.38, or if the revisions are not timely submitted, the revised application will be rejected. Procedures for rejected applications are specified in paragraph (e)(2)(iii).

        (2)  (i) If, within 90 days of its filing date, the Director of the Office of Energy Projects determines that an application patently fails to substantially comply with the requirements of paragraph (a), (b), and (c) of this section and of § 4.38 of this part or § 16.8 of this chapter, or is for a project that is precluded by law, the application will be rejected as patently deficient with the specification of the deficiencies that render the application patently deficient.

        (ii) If, after 90 days of its filing date, the Director of the Office of Energy Projects determines that an application patently fails to substantially comply with the requirements of paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section and of § 4.38 of this part or § 16.8 of this chapter, or is for a project that is precluded by law:

        (A) The application will be rejected by order of the Commission, if the Commission determines it is patently deficient; or

        (B) The application will be considered deficient under paragraph (e)(1) of this section, if the Commission determines it is not patently deficient.

        (iii) Any application that is rejected may be resubmitted if the deficiencies are corrected and if, in the case of a competing application, the resubmittal is timely. The date the rejected application is resubmitted will be considered the new filing date for purposes of determining its timeliness under § 4.36 and the disposition of competing applications under § 4.37.

        (f) Any application will be considered  as of the application filing date if the Secretary receives all of the information and documents necessary to conform to the requirements of paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of this section and of § 4.38 within the time prescribed by the Commission or its delegate under paragraph (e) of this section.

        (g) An applicant may be required to submit any additional information or documents that the Commission or its designee considers relevant for an informed decision on the application. The information or documents must take the form, and must be submitted within the time, that the Commission or its designee prescribes. An applicant may also be required to provide within a specified time additional copies of the complete application, or any of the additional information or documents that are filed, to the Commission or to any person, agency, or other entity that the Commission or its designee specifies. If an applicant fails to provide timely additional information, documents, or copies of submitted materials as required, the Commission or its designee may dismiss the application, hold it in abeyance, or take other appropriate action under this chapter or the Federal Power Act.

        (h) A prospective applicant, prior to submitting its application for filing, may seek advice from the Commission staff regarding the sufficiency of the application. For this purpose, five copies of the draft application should be submitted to the Director of the Division of Hydropower Licensing. An applicant or prospective applicant may confer with the Commission staff at any time regarding deficiencies or other matters related to its application. All conferences are subject to the requirements of § 385.2201 of this chapter governing ex parte communications. The opinions or advice of the staff will not bind the Commission or any person delegated authority to act on its behalf.

        (i) Intervention in any preliminary permit proceeding will not constitute intervention in any subsequent licensing or exemption proceeding.

        (j) Any application, the effectiveness of which is conditioned upon the future occurrence of any event or circumstance, will be rejected.

        (k)  (1) If this section requires an applicant to reveal Critical Energy Infrastructure Information (CEII), as defined in § 388.113(c) of this chapter, to any person, the applicant shall omit the CEII from the information made available and insert the following in its place:

        (i) A statement that CEII is being withheld;

        (ii) A brief description of the omitted information that does not reveal any CEII; and

        (iii) This statement: “Procedures for obtaining access to Critical Energy Infrastructure Information (CEII) may be found at 18 CFR 388.113. Requests for access to CEII should be made to the Commission's CEII Coordinator.”

        (2) The applicant, in determining whether information constitutes CEII, shall treat the information in a manner consistent with any filings that applicant has made with the Commission and shall to the extent practicable adhere to any previous determinations by the Commission or the CEII Coordinator involving the same or like information.

        (3) The procedures contained in §§ 388.112 and 388.113 of this chapter regarding designation of, and access to, CEII, shall apply in the event of a challenge to a CEII designation or a request for access to CEII. If it is determined that information is not CEII or that a requester should be granted access to CEII, the applicant will be directed to make the information available to the requester.

        (4) Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit any persons from voluntarily reaching arrangements or agreements calling for the disclosure of CEII.

        § 4.33   Limitations on submitting applications.

#### § § 4.33

        (a)  The Commission will not accept an application for a preliminary permit for project works that:

        (1) Would develop, conserve, and utilize, in whole or in part, the same water resources that would be developed, conserved, and utilized by a project for which there is an unexpired preliminary permit.

        (2) Would interfere with a licensed project in a manner that, absent the licensee's consent, would be precluded by Section 6 of the Federal Power Act.

        (3) Would develop, conserve, and utilize, in whole or in part, the same water resources that would be developed, conserved, and utilized by a project for which an initial development application has been filed unless the preliminary permit application is filed not later than the time allowed under § 4.36(a) for the filing of applications in competition against an initial application for a preliminary permit that would develop, conserve, and utilize, in whole or in part, the same resources.

        (b)  The Commission will not accept an application for a license or project works that would develop, conserve, or utilize, in whole or part, the same water resources that would be developed, conserved, and utilized by a project for which there is:

        (1) An unexpired preliminary permit, unless the permittee has submitted an application for license; or

        (2) An unexpired license, except as provided for in Section 15 of the Federal Power Act.

        (c)  (1) Except as permitted under § 4.33(c)(2), § 4.94(d), or § 4.106 (c), (e) or (f), the Commission will not accept an application for a license for project works that are already exempted from licensing under this part.

        (2) If a project is exempted from licensing pursuant to § 4.103 or § 4.109 and real property interests in any non-Federal lands would be necessary to develop or operate the project, any person who is both a qualified license applicant and has any of those real property interests in non-Federal lands may submit a license application for that project. If a license application is submitted under this clause, any other qualified license applicant may submit a competing license application in accordance with § 4.36.

        (d) —(1)  (i) If there is an unexpired permit in effect for a project, the Commission will accept an application for exemption of that project from licensing only if the exemption applicant is the permittee. Upon acceptance for filing of the permittee's application, the permit will be considered to have expired.

        (ii) If there is an unexpired license in effect for a project, the Commission will accept an application for exemption of that project from licensing only if the exemption applicant is the licensee.

        (2)  If an accepted license application for a project was submitted by a permittee before the preliminary permit expired, the Commission will not accept an application for exemption of that project from licensing submitted by a person other than the former permittee.

        (3)  If the first accepted license application for a project was filed by a qualified exemption applicant, the applicant may request that its license application be treated initially as an application for exemption from licensing by so notifying the Commission in writing and, unless only rights to use or occupy Federal lands would be necessary to develop and operate the project, by submitting documentary evidence showing that the applicant holds the real property interests required under § 4.31. Such notice and documentation must be submitted not later than the last date for filing protests or motions to intervene prescribed in the public notice issued for its license application under § 4.32(d)(2).

        (e)  Any accepted preliminary permit or license application submitted by a person who later applies for exemption of the project from licensing will retain its validity and priority under this subpart until the preliminary permit or license application is withdrawn or the project is exempted from licensing.

        § 4.34   Hearings on applications; consultation on terms and conditions; motions to intervene; alternative procedures.

#### § § 4.34

        (a)  The Commission may order a trial-type hearing on an application for a preliminary permit, a license, or an exemption from licensing upon either its own motion or the motion of any interested party of record. Any trial-type hearing will be limited to the issues prescribed by order of the Commission. In all other cases the hearings will be conducted by notice and comment procedures.

        (b)  All comments (including mandatory and recommended terms and conditions or prescriptions) on an application for exemption or license must be filed with the Commission no later than 60 days after issuance by the Commission of public notice declaring that the application is ready for environmental analysis. All reply comments must be filed within 105 days of that notice. All comments and reply comments and all other filings described in this section must be served on all persons listed in the service list prepared by the Commission, in accordance with the requirements of § 385.2010 of this chapter. If a party or interceder (as defined in § 385.2201 of this Chapter) submits any written material to the Commission relating to the merits of an issue that may affect the responsibilities of a particular resource agency, the party or interceder must also serve a copy of the submission on this resource agency. The Commission may allow for longer comment or reply comment periods if appropriate. A commenter or reply commenter may obtain an extension of time from the Commission only upon a showing of good cause or extraordinary circumstances in accordance with § 385.2008 of this chapter. Late-filed fish and wildlife recommendations will not be subject to the requirements of paragraphs (e), (f)(1)(ii), and (f)(3) of this section, and late-filed terms and conditions or prescriptions will not be subject to the requirements of paragraphs (f)(1)(iv), (f)(1)(v), and (f)(2) of this section. Late-filed fish and wildlife recommendations, terms and conditions, or prescriptions will be considered by the Commission under section 10(a) of the Federal Power Act if such consideration would not delay or disrupt the proceeding.

        (1)  Any agency responsible for mandatory terms and conditions or prescriptions for licenses or exemptions, pursuant to sections 4(e), 18, and 30(c) of the Federal Power Act and section 405(d) of the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of l978, as amended, must provide these terms and conditions or prescriptions in its initial comments filed with the Commission pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section. In those comments, the agency must specifically identify and explain the mandatory terms and conditions or prescriptions and their evidentiary and legal basis. In the case of an application prepared other than pursuant to part 5 of this chapter, if ongoing agency proceedings to determine the terms and conditions or prescriptions are not completed by the date specified, the agency must submit to the Commission by the due date:

        (i) Preliminary terms and conditions or prescriptions and a schedule showing the status of the agency proceedings and when the terms and conditions or prescriptions are expected to become final; or

        (ii) A statement waiving the agency's right to file the terms and conditions or prescriptions or indicating the agency does not intend to file terms and conditions or prescriptions.

        (2)  All fish and wildlife agencies must set forth any recommended terms and conditions for the protection, mitigation of damages to, or enhancement of fish and wildlife, pursuant to the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act and section 10(j) of the Federal Power Act, in their initial comments filed with the Commission by the date specified in paragraph (b) of this section. All Indian tribes must submit recommendations (including fish and wildlife recommendations) by the same date. In those comments, a fish and wildlife agency or Indian tribe must discuss its understanding of the resource issues presented by the proposed facilities and the evidentiary basis for the recommended terms and conditions.

        (3)  Resource agencies, other governmental units, and members of the public must file their recommendations in their initial comments by the date specified in paragraph (b) of this section. The comments must clearly identify all recommendations and present their evidentiary basis.

        (4)  (i) If the information and analysis (including reasonable alternatives) presented in a draft environmental document, issued for comment by the Commission, indicate a need to modify the recommendations or terms and conditions or prescriptions previously submitted to the Commission pursuant to paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(2), or (b)(3) of this section, the agency, Indian tribe, or member of the public must file with the Commission any modified recommendations or terms and conditions or prescriptions on the proposed project (and reasonable alternatives) no later than the due date for comments on the draft environmental impact statement. Modified recommendations or terms and conditions or prescriptions must be clearly distinguished from comments on the draft document.

        (ii) If an applicant files an amendment to its application that would materially change the project's proposed plans of development, as provided in § 4.35, an agency, Indian tribe or member of the public may modify the recommendations or terms and conditions or prescriptions it previously submitted to the Commission pursuant to paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(2), or (b)(3) of this section no later than the due date specified by the Commission for comments on the amendment.

        (5)(i) With regard to certification requirements under section 401(a)(1) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (Clean Water Act) for an application for a license or exemption from licensing, an applicant shall file within 60 days from the date of issuance of the notice of ready for environmental analysis:

        (A) A copy of the water quality certification or the certifying authority's express waiver;

        (B) A copy of the request for certification, including proof of the date on which the certifying authority received the request; or

        (C) Evidence of waiver of water quality certification as described in paragraph (b)(5)(iii) of this section.

        (ii) In the case of an application process using the alternative procedures of paragraph 4.34(i), the filing requirement of paragraph (b)(5)(i) shall apply upon issuance of notice the Commission has accepted the application as provided for in paragraph 4.32(d) of this part.

        (iii) A certifying authority is deemed to have waived the certification requirements of section 401(a)(1) of the Clean Water Act if the certifying authority has not denied, expressly waived, or granted certification by one year after the date the certifying authority received a written request for certification. If a certifying authority denies certification, the applicant must file a copy of the denial within 30 days after the applicant received it.

        (c)  If necessary or appropriate the Commission may require additional procedures ( a pre-hearing conference, further notice and comment on specific issues or oral argument). A party may request additional procedures in a motion that clearly and specifically sets forth the procedures requested and the basis for the request. Replies to such requests may be filed within 15 days of the request.

        (d)  Pursuant to the Federal Power Act and the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978, as amended, the Commission will coordinate as appropriate with other government agencies responsible for mandatory terms and conditions for exemptions and licenses for hydropower projects. Pursuant to the Federal Power Act and the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act, the Commission will consult with fish and wildlife agencies concerning the impact of a hydropower proposal on fish and wildlife and appropriate terms and conditions for license to adequately and equitably protect, mitigate damages to, and enhance fish and wildlife (including related spawning grounds and habitat). Pursuant to the Federal Power Act and the Endangered Species Act, the Commission will consult with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service or the National Marine Fisheries Service, as appropriate, concerning the impact of a hydropower proposal on endangered or threatened species and their critical habitat.

        (e)  (1) In connection with its environmental review of an application for license, the Commission will analyze all terms and conditions timely recommended by fish and wildlife agencies pursuant to the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act for the protection, mitigation of damages to, and enhancement of fish and wildlife (including related spawning grounds and habitat) affected by the development, operation, and management of the proposed project. Submission of such recommendations marks the beginning of the process under section 10(j) of the Federal Power Act.

        (2) The agency must specifically identify and explain the recommendations and the relevant resource goals and objectives and their evidentiary or legal basis. The Commission may seek clarification of any recommendation from the appropriate fish and wildlife agency. If the Commission's request for clarification is communicated in writing, copies of the request will be sent by the Commission to all parties, affected resource agencies, and Indian tribes, which may file a response to the request for clarification within the time period specified by the Commission. If the Commission believes any fish and wildlife recommendation may be inconsistent with the Federal Power Act or other applicable law, the Commission will make a preliminary determination of inconsistency in the draft environmental document or, if none, the environmental assessment. The preliminary determination, for any recommendations believed to be inconsistent, shall include an explanation why the Commission believes the recommendation is inconsistent with the Federal Power Act or other applicable law, including any supporting analysis and conclusions, and an explanation of how the measures recommended in the environmental document would adequately and equitably protect, mitigate damages to, and enhance, fish and wildlife (including related spawning grounds and habitat) affected by the development, operation, and management of the project.

        (3) Any party, affected resource agency, or Indian tribe may file comments in response to the preliminary determination of inconsistency, including any modified recommendations, within the time frame allotted for comments on the draft environmental document or, if none, the time frame for comments on the environmental analysis. In this filing, the fish and wildlife agency concerned may also request a meeting, telephone or video conference, or other additional procedure to attempt to resolve any preliminary determination of inconsistency.

        (4) The Commission shall attempt, with the agencies, to reach a mutually acceptable resolution of any such inconsistency, giving due weight to the recommendations, expertise, and statutory responsibilities of the fish and wildlife agency. If the Commission decides, or an affected resource agency requests, the Commission will conduct a meeting, telephone, or video conference, or other procedures to address issues raised by its preliminary determination of inconsistency and comments thereon. The Commission will give at least 15 days' advance notice to each party, affected resource agency, or Indian tribe, which may participate in the meeting or conference. Any meeting, conference, or additional procedure to address these issues will be scheduled to take place within 90 days of the date the Commission issues a preliminary determination of inconsistency. The Commission will prepare a written summary of any meeting held under this subsection to discuss section 10(j) issues, including any proposed resolutions and supporting analysis, and a copy of the summary will be sent to all parties, affected resource agencies, and Indian tribes.

        (5) The section 10(j) process ends when the Commission issues an order granting or denying the license application in question. If, after attempting to resolve inconsistencies between the fish and wildlife recommendations of a fish and wildlife agency and the purposes and requirements of the Federal Power Act or other applicable law, the Commission does not adopt in whole or in part a fish and wildlife recommendation of a fish and wildlife agency, the Commission will publish the findings and statements required by section 10(j)(2) of the Federal Power Act.

        (f) —(1)  (i) All licenses shall be issued on the conditions specified in section 10 of the Federal Power Act and such other conditions as the Commission determines are lawful and in the public interest.

        (ii) Subject to paragraph (f)(3) of this section, fish and wildlife conditions shall be based on recommendations timely received from the fish and wildlife agencies pursuant to the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act.

        (iii) The Commission will consider the timely recommendations of resource agencies, other governmental units, and members of the public, and the timely recommendations (including fish and wildlife recommendations) of Indian tribes affected by the project.

        (iv) Licenses for a project located within any Federal reservation shall be issued only after the findings required by, and subject to any conditions that may be timely received pursuant to, section 4(e) of the Federal Power Act.

        (v) The Commission will require the construction, maintenance, and operation by a licensee at its own expense of such fishways as may be timely prescribed by the Secretary of Commerce or the Secretary of the Interior, as appropriate, pursuant to section 18 of the Federal Power Act.

        (2)  Any exemption from licensing issued for conduit facilities, as provided in section 30(b) of the Federal Power Act, or for small hydroelectric power projects having a proposed installed capacity of 10,000 kilowatts or less, as provided in section 405(d) of the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978, as amended, shall include such terms and conditions as the fish and wildlife agencies may timely determine are appropriate to carry out the responsibilities specified in section 30(c) of the Federal Power Act.

        (3)  If, after attempting to resolve inconsistencies between the fish and wildlife recommendations of a fish and wildlife agency and the purposes and requirements of the Federal Power Act or other applicable law, the Commission does not adopt in whole or in part a fish and wildlife recommendation of a fish and wildlife agency, the Commission will publish the findings and statements required by section 10(j)(2) of the Federal Power Act.

        (g)  The provisions of paragraphs (b) through (d) and (f) of this section apply only to applications for license or exemption; paragraph (e) applies only to applications for license.

        (h) Unless otherwise provided by statute, regulation or order, all filings in hydropower hearings, except those conducted by trial-type procedures, shall conform to the requirements of subpart T of part 385 of this chapter.

        (i)  (1) An applicant may submit to the Commission a request to approve the use of alternative procedures for pre-filing consultation and the filing and processing of an application for an original, new or subsequent hydropower license or exemption that is subject to § 4.38 or § 16.8 of this chapter, or for the amendment of a license that is subject to the provisions of § 4.38.

        (2) The goal of such alternative procedures shall be to:

        (i) Combine into a single process the pre-filing consultation process, the environmental review process under the National Environmental Policy Act and administrative processes associated with the Clean Water Act and other statutes;

        (ii) Facilitate greater participation by and improve communication among the potential applicant, resource agencies, Indian tribes, the public and Commission staff in a flexible pre-filing consultation process tailored to the circumstances of each case;

        (iii) Allow for the preparation of a preliminary draft environmental assessment by an applicant or its contractor or consultant, or of a preliminary draft environmental impact statement by a contractor or consultant chosen by the Commission and funded by the applicant;

        (iv) Promote cooperative efforts by the potential applicant and interested entities and encourage them to share information about resource impacts and mitigation and enhancement proposals and to narrow any areas of disagreement and reach agreement or settlement of the issues raised by the hydropower proposal; and

        (v) Facilitate an orderly and expeditious review of an agreement or offer of settlement of an application for a hydropower license, exemption or amendment to a license.

        (3) A potential hydropower applicant requesting the use of alternative procedures must:

        (i) Demonstrate that a reasonable effort has been made to contact all resource agencies, Indian tribes, citizens' groups, and others affected by the applicant's proposal, and that a consensus exists that the use of alternative procedures is appropriate under the circumstances;

        (ii) Submit a communications protocol, supported by interested entities, governing how the applicant and other participants in the pre-filing consultation process, including the Commission staff, may communicate with each other regarding the merits of the applicant's proposal and proposals and recommendations of interested entities; and

        (iii) Serve a copy of the request on all affected resource agencies and Indian tribes and on all entities contacted by the applicant that have expressed an interest in the alternative pre-filing consultation process.

        (4) As appropriate under the circumstances of the case, the alternative procedures should include provisions for:

        (i) Distribution of an initial information package and conduct of an initial information meeting open to the public;

        (ii) The cooperative scoping of environmental issues (including necessary scientific studies), the analysis of completed studies and any further scoping; and

        (iii) The preparation of a preliminary draft environmental assessment or preliminary draft environmental impact statement and related application.

        (5)(i) If the potential applicant's request to use the alternative procedures is filed prior to July 23, 2005, the Commission will give public notice in the  inviting comment on the applicant's request to use alternative procedures. The Commission will consider any such comments in determining whether to grant or deny the applicant's request to use alternative procedures. Such a decision will not be subject to interlocutory rehearing or appeal.

        (ii) If the potential applicant's request to use the alternative procedures is filed on or after July 23, 2005 and prior to the deadline date for filing a notification of intent to seek a new or subsequent license required by § 5.5 of this chapter, the Commission will give public notice and invite comments as provided for in paragraph (i)(5)(i) of this section. Commission approval of the potential applicant's request to use the alternative procedures prior to the deadline date for filing of the notification of intent does not waive the potential applicant's obligation to file the notification of intent required by § 5.5 of this chapter and Pre-Application Document required by § 5.6 of this chapter.

        (iii) If the potential applicant's request to use the alternative procedures is filed on or after July 23, 2005 and is at the same time as the notification of intent to seek a new or subsequent license required by § 5.5, the public notice and comment procedures of part 5 of this chapter shall apply.

        (6) If the Commission accepts the use of alternative procedures, the following provisions will apply.

        (i) To the extent feasible under the circumstances of the proceeding, the Commission will give notice in the  and the applicant will give notice, in a local newspaper of general circulation in the county or counties in which the project is located, of the initial information meeting and the scoping of environmental issues. The applicant will also send notice of these stages to a mailing list approved by the Commission.

        (ii) Every six months, the applicant shall file with the Commission a report summarizing the progress made in the pre-filing consultation process and referencing the applicant's public file, where additional information on that process can be obtained. Summaries or minutes of meetings held in the process may be used to satisfy this filing requirement. The applicant must also file with the Commission a copy of its initial information package, each scoping document, and the preliminary draft environmental review document. All filings with the Commission under this section must include the number of copies required by paragraph (h) of this section, and the applicant shall send a copy of these filings to each participant that requests a copy.

        (iii) At a suitable location, the applicant will maintain a public file of all relevant documents, including scientific studies, correspondence, and minutes or summaries of meetings, compiled during the pre-filing consultation process. The Commission will maintain a public file of the applicant's initial information package, scoping documents, periodic reports on the pre-filing consultation process, and the preliminary draft environmental review document.

        (iv) An applicant authorized to use alternative procedures may substitute a preliminary draft environmental review document and additional material specified by the Commission instead of Exhibit E to its application and need not supply additional documentation of the pre-filing consultation process. The applicant will file with the Commission the results of any studies conducted or other documentation as directed by the Commission, either on its own motion or in response to a motion by a party to the licensing or exemption proceeding.

        (v) Pursuant to the procedures approved, the participants will set reasonable deadlines requiring all resource agencies, Indian tribes, citizens' groups, and interested persons to submit to the applicant requests for scientific studies during the pre-filing consultation process, and additional requests for studies may be made to the Commission after the filing of the application only for good cause shown.

        (vi) During the pre-filing process the Commission may require the filing of preliminary fish and wildlife recommendations, prescriptions, mandatory conditions, and comments, to be submitted in final form after the filing of the application; no notice that the application is ready for environmental analysis need be given by the Commission after the filing of an application pursuant to these procedures.

        (vii) Any potential applicant, resource agency, Indian tribe, citizens' group, or other entity participating in the alternative pre-filing consultation process may file a request with the Commission to resolve a dispute concerning the alternative process (including a dispute over required studies), but only after reasonable efforts have been made to resolve the dispute with other participants in the process. No such request shall be accepted for filing unless the entity submitting it certifies that it has been served on all other participants. The request must document what efforts have been made to resolve the dispute.

        (7) If the potential applicant or any resource agency, Indian tribe, citizens' group, or other entity participating in the alternative pre-filing consultation process can show that it has cooperated in the process but a consensus supporting the use of the process no longer exists and that continued use of the alternative process will not be productive, the participant may petition the Commission for an order directing the use by the potential applicant of appropriate procedures to complete its application. No such request shall be accepted for filing unless the entity submitting it certifies that it has been served on all other participants. The request must recommend specific procedures that are appropriate under the circumstances.

        (8) The Commission may participate in the pre-filing consultation process and assist in the integration of this process and the environmental review process in any case, including appropriate cases where the applicant, contractor, or consultant funded by the applicant is not preparing a preliminary draft environmental assessment or preliminary draft environmental impact statement, but where staff assistance is available and could expedite the proceeding.

        (9) If this section requires an applicant to reveal Critical Energy Infrastructure Information (CEII), as defined by § 388.113(c) of this chapter, to any person, the applicant shall follow the procedures set out in § 4.32(k).

        § 4.37   Rules of preference among competing applications.

#### § § 4.37

        Except as provided in § 4.33(e), the Commission will select among competing applications on the following bases:

        (a) If an accepted application for a preliminary permit and an accepted application for a license propose project works that would develop, conserve, and utilize, in whole or in part, the same water resources, and the applicant for a license has demonstrated its ability to carry out its plans, the Commission will favor the license applicant unless the permit applicant substantiates in its filed application that its plans are better adapted to develop, conserve, and utilize in the public interest the water resources of the region.

        (b) If two or more applications for preliminary permits or two or more applications for licenses (not including applications for a new license under section 15 of the Federal Power Act) are filed by applicants for project works that would develop, conserve, and utilize, in whole or in part, the same water resources, and if none of the applicants is a preliminary permittee whose application for license was accepted for filing within the permit period, the Commission will select between or among the applicants on the following bases:

        (1) If both or neither of two applicants are either a municipality or a state, the Commission will favor the applicant whose plans are better adapted to develop, conserve, and utilize in the public interest the water resources of the region, taking into consideration the ability of each applicant to carry out its plans.

        (2) If both of two applicants are either a municipality or a state, or neither of them is a municipality or a state, and the plans of the applicants are equally well adapted to develop, conserve, and utilize in the public interest the water resources of the region, taking into consideration the ability of each applicant to carry out its plans, the Commission will favor the applicant with the earliest application acceptance date.

        (3) If one of two applicants is a municipality or a state, and the other is not, and the plans of the municipality or a state are at least as well adapted to develop, conserve, and utilize in the public interest the water resources of the region, the Commission will favor the municipality or state.

        (4) If one of two applicant is a municipality or a state, and the other is not, and the plans of the applicant who is not a municipality or a state are better adapted to develop, conserve, and utilize in the public interest the water resources of the region, the Commission will inform the municipality or state of the specific reasons why its plans are not as well adapted and afford a reasonable period of time for the municipality or state to render its plans at least as well adapted as the other plans. If the plans of the municipality or state are rendered at least as well adapted within the time allowed, the Commission will favor the municipality or state. If the plans are not rendered at least as well adapted within the time allowed, the Commission will favor the other applicant.

        (c) If two or more applications for licenses are filed for project works which would develop, conserve, and utilize, in whole or in part, the same water resources, and one of the applicants was a preliminary permittee whose application was accepted for filing within the permit period (), the Commission will select between or among the applicants on the following bases:

        (1) If the plans of the priority applicant are at least as well adapted as the plans of each other applicant to develop, conserve, and utilize in the public interest the water resources of the region, taking into consideration the ability of each applicant to carry out its plans, the Commission will favor the priority applicant.

        (2) If the plans of an applicant who is not a priority applicant are better adapted than the plans of the priority applicant to develop, conserve, and utilize in the public interest the water resources of the region, taking into consideration the ability of each applicant to carry out its plans, the Commission will inform the priority applicant of the specific reasons why its plans are not as well adapted and afford a reasonable period of time for the priority applicant to render its plans at least as well adapted as the other plans. If the plans of the priority applicant are rendered at least as well adapted within the time allowed, then the Commission will favor the priority applicant. If the plans of the priority applicant are not rendered as well adapted within the time allowed, the criteria specified in paragraph (b) will govern.

        (3) The criteria specified in paragraph (b) will govern selection among applicants other than the priority applicant.

        (d) With respect to a project for which an application for an exemption from licensing has been accepted for filing, the Commission will select among competing applications on the following bases:

        (1) If an accepted application for a preliminary permit and an accepted application for exemption from licensing propose to develop mutually exclusive small hydroelectric power projects, the Commission will favor the applicant whose substantiated plans in the application received by the Commission are better adapted to develop, conserve, and utilize in the public interest the water resources of the region. If the substantiated plans are equally well adapted, the Commission will favor the application for exemption from licensing.

        (2) If an application for a license and an application for exemption from licensing, or two or more applications for exemption from licensing are each accepted for filing and each proposes to develop a mutually exclusive project, the Commission will favor the applicant whose plans are better adapted to develop, conserve, and utilize in the public interest the water resources of the region. If the plans are equally well adapted, the Commission will favor the applicant with the earliest application acceptance date.

        (e) A municipal applicant must provide evidence that the municipality is competent under applicable state and local laws to engage in the business of developing, transmitting, utilizing, or distributing power, or such applicant will be considered a non-municipal applicant for the purpose of determining the disposition of competing applications.

        (a)  The Commission reserves the right to conduct investigations under sections 4(g), 306, 307, and 311 of the Federal Power Act with respect to any acts, complaints, facts, conditions, practices, or other matters related to the construction, operation, or maintenance of the exempt facility. If any term or condition of the exemption is violated, the Commission may revoke the exemption, issue a suitable order under section 4(g) of the Federal Power Act, or take appropriate action for enforcement, forfeiture, or penalties under Part III of the Federal Power Act.

        (b)  The construction, operation, and maintenance of the exempt project must comply with any terms and conditions that the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, the National Marine Fisheries Service, and any state fish and wildlife agencies have determined are appropriate to prevent loss of, or damage to, fish or wildlife resources or otherwise to carry out the purposes of the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act, as specified in exhibit E of the application for exemption from licensing or in the comments submitted in response to the notice of exemption application.

        (c)  The Commission may revoke this exemption if actual construction of any proposed generating facilities has not begun within two years or has not been completed within four years from the effective date of this exemption. If an exemption is revoked under this article, the Commission will not accept from the prior exemption holder a subsequent application for exemption from licensing or a notice of exemption from licensing for the same project within two years of the revocation.

        (d)  This exemption does not confer any right to use or occupy any federal lands that may be necessary for the development or operation of the project. Any right to use or occupy any federal lands for those purposes must be obtained from the administering federal land agencies. The Commission may accept a license application submitted by any qualified license applicant and revoke this exemption, if any necessary right to use or occupy federal lands for those purposes has not been obtained within one year from the date on which this exemption was granted.

        (e)  In order to best develop, conserve, and utilize in the public interest the water resources of the region, the Commission may require that the exempt facilities be modified in structure or operation or may revoke this exemption.

        (f)  The Commission may revoke this exemption if, in the application process, material discrepancies, inaccuracies, or falsehoods were made by or on behalf of the applicant.

        (g)  Before transferring any property interests in the exempt project, the exemption holder must inform the transferee of the terms and conditions of the exemption. Within 30 days of transferring the property interests, the exemption holder must inform the Commission of the identity and address of the transferee.

#### § § 4.96

        (a) An exemption holder must construct and operate its project as described in the exemption application approved by the Commission or its delegate.

        (b) If an exemption holder desires to change the design, location, method of construction or operation of its project, it must first notify the appropriate Federal and state fish and wildlife agencies and inform them in writing of the changes it intends to implement. If these agencies determine that the changes would not cause the project to violate the terms and conditions imposed by the agencies, and if the changes would not materially alter the design, location, method of construction or operation of the project, the exemption holder may implement the changes. If any of these agencies determines that the changes would cause the project to violate the terms and conditions imposed by the agencies, or if the changes would materially alter the design, location, method of construction or the operation of the project works, the exemption holder may not implement the changes without first acquiring authorization from the Commission to amend its exemption, or acquiring a license that authorizes the project, as changed.

        (c) An application to amend an exemption may be filed only by the holder of the exemption. An application to amend an exemption will be governed by the Commission's regulations governing applications for exemption. The Commission will not accept applications in competition with an application to amend an exemption, unless the Director of the Office of Energy Projects determines that it is in the public interest to do so.

        § 4.303   Post-filing procedures.

#### § § 4.303

        (a) —(1)  Within 60 days after the last date for filing mandatory terms and conditions pursuant to § 4.32(c)(4) for a new dam or diversion license application seeking PURPA benefits, § 4.93(b) for an application for exemption of a small conduit hydroelectric facility, or § 4.105(b)(1) for an application for case-specific exemption of a small hydroelectric power project, a fish and wildlife agency must file with the Commission a cost statement of the reasonable costs the agency incurred in setting mandatory terms and conditions for the proposed project. An agency may request, in writing, along with any supporting documentation an extension of this 60-day period.

        (2)  The Director of the Office of Energy Projects (Director) will, by letter, notify each fish and wildlife agency if a section 30(c) application is rejected, withdrawn or dismissed. Within 60 days from the date of notification, a fish and wildlife agency must file with the Commission a cost statement of the reasonable costs the agency incurred prior to the date the application was rejected, withdrawn, or dismissed. An agency may submit a written request for an extension of this 60-day period along with any supporting documentation.

        (b) If an agency has not submitted a cost statement or extension request within the time provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, it waives its right to receive fees for that project pursuant to this subpart.

        (c)  After the Commission receives a cost statement from all fish and wildlife agencies as required by paragraph (a) of this section, the Commission will bill the section 30(c) applicant. The bill will show:

        (1) The cost statement submitted to the Commission by each fish and wildlife agency;

        (2) Any amounts already paid by the applicant pursuant to § 4.302; and

        (3)(i) The amount due, if the amount already paid by the applicant pursuant to § 4.302 is less than the total of all the cost statements; or

        (ii) The amount to be refunded to the applicant, if the amount already paid by the applicant pursuant to § 4.302 is more than the total of all the cost statements.

        (d) Within 45 days from the date of a bill issued under paragraph (b) of this section, a section 30(c) applicant must pay in full to the Commission any remaining amounts due on the cost statements regardless of whether any of these amounts are in dispute.

        (e) —(1)  Any dispute regarding the reasonableness of any fish and wildlife agency cost statement must be made within 45 days from the date of a bill issued under paragraph (b) of this section.

        (2)  The burden of showing that an agency's cost statement is unreasonable is on the applicant. However, a fish and wildlife agency must supply the disputing applicant and the Commission with the documentation necessary to support its cost statement. The Director of the Office of Energy Projects will determine the reasonableness of a disputed fish and wildlife agency cost statement. The Director's decision will be in writing. The Director will notify the disputing applicant and the fish and wildlife agency of the decision by letter. Any decision of the Director may be appealed by either party pursuant to 18 CFR 385.1902. In deciding whether or not a disputed cost statement is reasonable, the Director will review the application, the disputed cost statement and any other documentation relating to the particular environmental problems associated with the disputing applicant's proposed project. The Director will consider such factors as:

        (i) The time the fish and wildlife agency spent reviewing the application;

        (ii) The proportion of the cost statement to the time the fish and wildlife agency spent reviewing the application;

        (iii) Whether the fish and wildlife agency's expenditures conform to Federal expenditure guidelines for such items as travel, per diem, personnel, and contracting; and

        (iv) Whether the studies conducted by the agency, if any, are duplicative, limited to the proposed project area, unnecessary to determine the impacts to or mitigation measures for the particular fish and wildlife resources affected by the proposed project, or otherwise unnecessary to set terms and conditions for the proposed project.

        (3)  If the Director determines that a disputed fish and wildlife agency cost statement is unreasonable, the disputing applicant and the fish and wildlife agency will be afforded 45 days from the date of notification to attempt to reach an agreement regarding the reimbursable costs of the agency. If the disputing applicant and the fish and wildlife agency fail to reach an agreement on the disputed cost statement within 45 days from the date of notification, the Director will determine the costs that the agency should reasonably have incurred.

        (f)  (1) If the amount paid by a section 30(c) applicant under § 4.302 exceeds the total amount of the cost statements submitted by fish and wildlife agencies under paragraph (a) of this section, the Commission will notify the Treasury to refund the difference to the applicant within 45 days from the date of the bill issued to the applicant under paragraph (b) of this section.

        (2) If the amount paid by a section 30(c) applicant exceeds the amount determined to be reasonable by the Director pursuant to paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the Commission will notify the Treasury to refund the difference to the applicant within 45 days of the resolution of all dispute proceedings.

#### § § 4.305

        (a) The Commission may take any appropriate action permitted by law if a section 30(c) applicant does not make a payment required under this subpart. The Commission will not be liable to any fish and wildlife agency for failure to collect any amounts under this subpart.

        (b) If the Commission is unable to collect the full amount due by a section 30(c) applicant on behalf of more than one agency, the amount the Commission does collect will be distributed to the agencies on a  basis except if an agency's cost statement is greater than its most recent estimate to the applicant under § 4.301(b), then the difference between the estimate and the cost statement will not be reimbursed until any amounts owed to other agencies have been paid.

#### § § 5.26

      (a) In connection with its environmental review of an application for license, the Commission will analyze all terms and conditions timely recommended by fish and wildlife agencies pursuant to the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act for the protection, mitigation of damages to, and enhancement of fish and wildlife (including related spawning grounds and habitat) affected by the development, operation, and management of the proposed project. Submission of such recommendations marks the beginning of the process under section 10(j) of the Federal Power Act.

      (b) The agency must specifically identify and explain the recommendations and the relevant resource goals and objectives and their evidentiary or legal basis. The Commission may seek clarification of any recommendation from the appropriate fish and wildlife agency. If the Commission's request for clarification is communicated in writing, copies of the request will be sent by the Commission to all parties, affected resource agencies, and Indian tribes, which may file a response to the request for clarification within the time period specified by the Commission. If the Commission believes any fish and wildlife recommendation may be inconsistent with the Federal Power Act or other applicable law, the Commission will make a preliminary determination of inconsistency in the draft environmental document or, if none, the environmental assessment. The preliminary determination, for any recommendations believed to be inconsistent, shall include an explanation why the Commission believes the recommendation is inconsistent with the Federal Power Act or other applicable law, including any supporting analysis and conclusions and an explanation of how the measures recommended in the environmental document would adequately and equitably protect, mitigate damages to, and enhance, fish and wildlife (including related spawning grounds and habitat) affected by the development, operation, and management of the project.

      (c) Any party, affected resource agency, or Indian tribe may file comments in response to the preliminary determination of inconsistency, including any modified recommendations, within the time frame allotted for comments on the draft environmental document or, if none, the time frame for comments on the environmental assessment. In this filing, the fish and wildlife agency concerned may also request a meeting, telephone or video conference, or other additional procedure to attempt to resolve any preliminary determination of inconsistency.

      (d) The Commission shall attempt, with the agencies, to reach a mutually acceptable resolution of any such inconsistency, giving due weight to the recommendations, expertise, and statutory responsibilities of the fish and wildlife agency. If the Commission decides, or an affected resource agency requests, the Commission will conduct a meeting, telephone or video conference, or other procedures to address issues raised by its preliminary determination of inconsistency and comments thereon. The Commission will give at least 15 days' advance notice to each party, affected resource agency, or Indian tribe, which may participate in the meeting or conference. Any meeting, conference, or additional procedure to address these issues will be scheduled to take place within 90 days of the date the Commission issues a preliminary determination of inconsistency. The Commission will prepare a written summary of any meeting held under this paragraph to discuss section 10(j) issues, including any proposed resolutions and supporting analysis, and a copy of the summary will be sent to all parties, affected resource agencies, and Indian tribes.

      (e) The section 10(j) process ends when the Commission issues an order granting or denying the license application in question. If, after attempting to resolve inconsistencies between the fish and wildlife recommendations of a fish and wildlife agency and the purposes and requirements of the Federal Power Act or other applicable law, the Commission does not adopt in whole or in part a fish and wildlife recommendation of a fish and wildlife agency, the Commission will publish the findings and statements required by section 10(j)(2) of the Federal Power Act.

      (g)  (1) The Commission will consider, on a case-by-case basis, requests for a short suspension of the procedural schedule for the purpose of participants conducting settlement negotiations, where it determines that the suspension will not adversely affect timely action on a license application. In acting on such requests, the Commission will consider, among other things:

      (i) Whether requests for suspension of the procedural schedule have previously been made or granted;

      (ii) Whether the request is supported by a consensus of participants in the proceeding and an explanation of objections to the request expressed by any participant;

      (iii) The likelihood that a settlement agreement will be filed within the requested suspension period; and

      (iv) Whether the requested suspension is likely to cause any new or subsequent license to be issued after the expiration of the existing license.

      (i)  (1) In determining whether a final proposal for a new license under section 15 of the Federal Power Act is best adapted to serve the public interest, the Commission will consider the factors enumerated in sections 15(a)(2) and (a)(3) of the Federal Power Act.

      (2) If there are only insignificant differences between the final applications of an existing licensee and a competing Applicant after consideration of the factors enumerated in section 15(a)(2) of the Federal Power Act, the Commission will determine which Applicant will receive the license after considering:

      (i) The existing licensee's record of compliance with the terms and conditions of the existing license; and

      (ii) The actions taken by the existing licensee related to the project which affect the public.

      (iii) An existing licensee that files an application for a new license in conjunction with an entity or entities that are not currently licensees of all or part of the project will not be considered an existing licensee for the purpose of the insignificant differences provision of section 15(a)(2) of the Federal Power Act.

    PART 11—ANNUAL CHARGES UNDER PART I OF THE FEDERAL POWER ACT

### Part 11

**Authority:** Authority: 16 U.S.C. 792-828c; 42 U.S.C. 7101-7352.

      Subpart A—Charges for Costs of Administration, Use of Tribal Lands and Other Government Lands, and Use of Government Dams

        § 11.1   Costs of administration.

#### § § 11.1

        (a)  Pursuant to section 10(e) of the Federal Power Act and section 3401 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986, the Commission will assess reasonable annual charges against licensees and exemptees to reimburse the United States for the costs of administration of the Commission's hydropower regulatory program.

        (b)  The annual charges under this section will be charged to and allocated among:

        (1) All licensees of projects of more than 1.5 megawatts of installed capacity; and

        (2) All holders of exemptions under either section 30 of the Federal Power Act or sections 405 and 408 of the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978, as amended by section 408 of the Energy Security Act of 1980, but only if the exemption was issued subsequent to April 21, 1995 and is for a project of more than 1.5 megawatts of installed capacity.

        (3) If the exemption for a project of more than 1.5 megawatts of installed capacity was issued subsequent to April 21, 1995 but pursuant to an application filed prior to that date, the exemptee may credit against its annual charge any filing fee paid pursuant to § 381.601 of this chapter, which was removed effective April 21, 1995, 18 CFR 381.601 (1994), until the total of all such credits equals the filing fee that was paid.

        (c)  For licensees and exemptees, other than State or municipal:

        (1) A determination shall be made for each fiscal year of the costs of administration of Part I of the Federal Power Act chargeable to such licensees or exemptees, from which shall be deducted any administrative costs that are stated in the license or exemption or fixed by the Commission in determining headwater benefit payments.

        (2) For each fiscal year the costs of administration determined under paragraph (c)(1) of this section will be assessed against such licenses or exemptee in the proportion that the annual charge factor for each such project bears to the total of the annual charge factors under all such outstanding licenses and exemptions.

        (3) The annual charge factor for each such project shall be found as follows:

        (i) For a conventional project the factor is its authorized installed capacity plus 112.5 times its annual energy output in millions of kilowatt-hours.

        (ii) For a pure pumped storage project the factor is its authorized installed capacity.

        (iii) For a mixed conventional-pumped storage project the factor is its authorized installed capacity plus 112.5 times its gross annual energy output in millions of kilowatt-hours less 75 times the annual energy used for pumped storage pumping in million of kilowatt-hours.

        (iv) For purposes of determining their annual charges factor, projects that are operated pursuant to an exemption will be deemed to have an annual energy output of zero.

        (4) To enable the Commission to determine such charges annually, each licensee whose authorized installed capacity exceeds 1.5 megawatts must file with the Commission, on or before November 1 of each year, a statement under oath showing the gross amount of power generated (or produced by nonelectrical equipment) and the amount of power used for pumped storage pumping by the project during the preceding fiscal year, expressed in kilowatt hours. If any licensee does not report the gross energy output of its project within the time specified above, the Commission's staff will estimate the energy output and this estimate may be used in lieu of the filings required by this section made by such licensee after November 1.

        (5) For unconstructed projects, the assessments begin on the date by which the licensee or exemptee is required to commence project construction, or as that deadline may be extended. For constructed projects, the assessments begin on the effective date of the license or exemption, except for any new capacity authorized therein. The assessments for new authorized capacity at licensed or exempted projects begin on the date by which the licensee or exemptee is required to commence construction of the new capacity. In the event that assessments begin during a fiscal year, the charges will be prorated.

        (d)  For State or municipal licensees and exemptees:

        (1) A determination shall be made for each fiscal year of the cost of administration under Part I of the Federal Power Act chargeable to such licensees and exemptees, from which shall be deducted any administrative costs that are stated in the license or exemption or that are fixed by the Commission in determining headwater benefit payments.

        (2) An exemption will be granted to a licensee or exemptee to the extent, if any, to which it may be entitled under section 10(e) of the Act provided the data is submitted as requested in paragraphs (d) (4) and (5) of this section.

        (3) For each fiscal year the total actual cost of administration as determined under paragraph (d)(1) of this section will be assessed against each such licensee or exemptee (except to the extent of the exemptions granted pursuant to paragraph (d)(2) of this section) in the proportion that the authorized installed capacity of each such project bears to the total such capacity under all such outstanding licenses or exemptions.

        (4) To enable the Commission to compute on the bill for annual charges the exemption to which State and municipal licensees and exemptees are entitled because of the use of power by the licensee or exemptee for State or municipal purposes, each such licensee or exemptee must file with the Commission, on or before November 1 of each year, a statement under oath showing the following information with respect to the power generated by the project and the disposition thereof during the preceding fiscal year, expressed in kilowatt-hours:

        (i) Gross amount of power generated by the project.

        (ii) Amount of power used for station purposes and lost in transmission, etc.

        (iii) Net amount of power available for sale or use by licensee or exemptee, classified as follows:

        (A) Used by licensee or exemptee.

        (B) Sold by licensee or exemptee.

        (5) When the power from a licensed or exempted project owned by a State or municipality enters into its electric system, making it impracticable to meet the requirements of this section with respect to the disposition of project power, such licensee or exemptee may, in lieu thereof, furnish similar information with respect to the disposition of the available power of the entire electric system of the licensee or exemptee.

        (6) The assessments commence on the date of commencement of project operation. In the event that project operation commences during a fiscal year, the charges will be prorated based on the date on which operation commenced.

        (e)  For projects involving transmission lines only, the administrative charge will be stated in the license.

        (f)  No licensed or exempted project's annual charge may exceed a maximum charge established each year by the Commission to equal 2.0 percent of the adjusted Commission costs of administration of the hydropower regulatory program. For every project with an annual charge determined to be above the maximum charge, that project's annual charge will be set at the maximum charge, and any amount above the maximum charge will be reapportioned to the remaining projects. The reapportionment will be computed using the method outlined in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section (but excluding any project whose annual charge is already set at the maximum amount). This procedure will be repeated until no project's annual charge exceeds the maximum charge.

        (g)  (1) With respect to costs incurred by the Commission, the assessment of annual charges will be based on an estimate of the costs of administration of Part I of the Federal Power Act that will be incurred during the fiscal year in which the annual charges are assessed. After the end of the fiscal year, the assessment will be recalculated based on the costs of administration that were actually incurred during that fiscal year; the actual costs will be compared to the estimated costs; and the difference between the actual and estimated costs will be carried over as an adjustment to the assessment for the subsequent fiscal year.

        (2) The issuance of bills based on the administrative costs incurred by the Commission during the year in which the bill is issued will commence in 1993. The annual charge for the administrative costs that were incurred in fiscal year 1992 will be billed in 1994. At the licensee's option, the charge may be paid in three equal annual installments in fiscal years 1994, 1995, and 1996, plus any accrued interest. If the licensee elects the three-year installment plan, the Commission will accrue interest (at the most recent yield of two-year Treasury securities) on the unpaid charges and add the accrued interest to the installments billed in fiscal years 1995 and 1996.

        (h) In making their annual reports to the Commission on their costs in administering Part I of the Federal Power Act, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Marine Fisheries Service are to deduct any amounts that were deposited into their Treasury accounts during that year as reimbursements for conducting studies and reviews pursuant to section 30(e) of the Federal Power Act.

        (i)  As used in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section,  means the lesser of the ratings of the generator or turbine units. The rating of a generator is the product of the continuous-load capacity rating of the generator in kilovolt-amperes (kVA) and the system power factor in kW/kVA. If the licensee or exemptee does not know its power factor, a factor of 1.0 kW/kVA will be used. The rating of a turbine is the product of the turbine's capacity in horsepower (hp) at best gate (maximum efficiency point) opening under the manufacturer's rated head times a conversion factor of 0.75 kW/hp. If the generator or turbine installed has a rating different from that authorized in the license or exemption, or the installed generator is rewound or otherwise modified to change its rating, or the turbine is modified to change its rating, the licensee or exemptee must apply to the Commission to amend its _authorized installed capacity_ to reflect the change.

        (j)  For a license having the capacity of the project for annual charge purposes stated in horsepower, that capacity shall be deemed to be the capacity stated in kilowatts elsewhere in the license, including any amendments thereto.

        § 11.2   Use of government lands.

#### § § 11.2

        (a) Reasonable annual charges for recompensing the United States for the use, occupancy, and enjoyment of its lands (other than lands adjoining or pertaining to Government dams or other structures owned by the United States Government) or its other property, will be fixed by the Commission.

        (b)  Annual charges for the use of government lands will be payable in advance, and will be set on the basis of an annual schedule of per-acre rental fees, as set forth in Appendix A of this part. The Executive Director will publish the updated fee schedule in the

        (c) The annual per-acre rental fee is the product of four factors: the adjusted per-acre value multiplied by the encumbrance factor multiplied by the rate of return multiplied by the annual adjustment factor.

        (1)  (i) Counties (or other geographical areas) are assigned a per-acre value based on their average per-acre land and building value published in the Census of Agriculture (Census) by the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS). The adjusted per-acre value is computed by reducing the NASS Census land and building value by the sum of a state-specific modifier and seven percent. A table of state-specific adjustments will be available on the Commission's Web site.

        (ii) The state-specific modifier is a percentage reduction applicable to all counties or geographic areas in a state (except Puerto Rico), and represents the ratio of the total value of irrigated farmland in the state to the total value of all farmland in the state. The state-specific modifier will be recalculated every five years beginning in payment year 2016.

        (iii) The state-specific modifier for Puerto Rico is 13 percent.

        (iv) For all geographic areas in Alaska except for the Aleutian Islands Area, the Commission will calculate a statewide per-acre value based on the average per-acre land and building values published in the NASS Census for the Kenai Peninsula Area and the Fairbanks Area. This statewide per-acre value will be reduced by the sum of the state-specific modifier and seven percent. The resulting adjusted statewide per-acre value will be applied to all projects located in Alaska, except for projects located in the Aleutian Island Area.

        (2)  The encumbrance factor is 50 percent.

        (3)  The rate of return is 5.77 percent through payment year 2025. The rate of return will be adjusted every 10 years thereafter, and will be based on the 10-year average of the 30-year Treasury bond yield rate immediately preceding the applicable NASS Census. For example, for years 2026 through 2035, the rate of return will be based on the 10-year average (2012-2021) of the 30-year Treasury bond yield rate immediately preceding the 2022 NASS Census. If the 30-year Treasury bond yield rate is not available, the next longest term Treasury bond available should be used in its place.

        (4)  The annual adjustment factor is 1.9 percent through payment year 2015. For years 2016 through 2025, the annual adjustment factor is the annual change in the Implicit Price Deflator for the Gross Domestic Product (IPD-GDP) for the ten years (2014-2023) preceding issuance (2024) of the most recent NASS Census (2022). Each subsequent ten year adjustment will be made in the same manner.

        (d) The annual charge for the use of Government lands for 2013 will be reduced by 25 percent for all licensees subject to this section.

        (e) The minimum annual charge for the use of Government lands under any license will be $25.

        § 11.3   Use of government dams, excluding pumped storage projects.

#### § § 11.3

        (a)  (1) Any licensee whose non-Federal project uses a Government dam or other structure for electric power generation and whose annual charges are not already specified in final form in the license must pay the United States an annual charge for the use of that dam or other structure as determined in accordance with this section. Payment of such annual charge is in addition to any reimbursement paid by a licensee for costs incurred by the United States as a direct result of the licensee's project development at such Government dam.

        (2) Any licensee that is obligated under the terms of a license issued on or before September 16, 1986 to pay specified annual charges for the use of a Government dam must continue to pay the annual charges prescribed in the project license pending any readjustment of the annual charge for the project made pursuant to section 10(e) of the Federal Power Act.

        (b)  Annual charges for the use of Government dams or other structures owned by the United States are 1 mill per kilowatt-hour for the first 40 gigawatt-hours of energy a project produces, 1  mills per kilowatt-hour for over 40 up to and including 80 gigawatt-hours, and 2 mills per kilowatt-hour for any energy the project produces over 80 gigawatt-hours.

        (c)  (1) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, each licensee must file with the Commission, on or before November 1 of each year, a sworn statement showing the gross amount of energy generated during the preceding fiscal year and the amount of energy provided free of charge to the Government. The determination of the annual charge will be based on the gross energy production less the energy provided free of charge to the Government.

        (2) A licensee who has filed these data under another section of part 11 or who has submitted identical data with FERC or the Energy Information Administration for the same fiscal year is not required to file the information described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. Referenced filings should be identified by company name, date filed, docket or project number, and form, number.

        (d)  A licensee may file a request with the Director of the Office of Energy Projects for a credit for contractual payments made for construction, operation, and maintenance of a Government dam at any time before 30 days after receiving a billing for annual charges determined under this section. The Director, or his designee, will grant such a credit only when the licensee demonstrates that a credit is reasonably justified. The Director, or his designee, shall consider, among other factors, the contractual arrangements between the licensee and the Federal agency which owns the dam and whether these arrangements reveal clearly that substantial payments are being made for power purposes, relevant legislation, and other equitable factors.

        (a)  The Commission will determine on a case-by-case basis under section 10(e) of the Federal Power Act the annual charges for any pumped storage project using a Government dam or other structure and for any project using tribal lands within Indian reservations.

        (b)  (1) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section a Licensee whose project includes pumped storage facilities must file with the Commission, on or before November 1 of each year, a sworn statement showing the gross amount of energy generated during the preceding fiscal year, and the amount of energy provided free of charge to the Government, and the amount of energy used for pumped storage pumping.

        (2) A licensee who has filed these data under another section of part 11 or who has submitted identical data with FERC or the Energy Information Administration for the same fiscal year is not required to file the information required in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. Referenced filings should be identified by company name, date filed, docket or project number, and form number.

        § 11.6   Exemption of State and municipal licensees and exemptees.

#### § § 11.6

        (a)  A State or municipal licensee or exemptee may claim total or partial exemption from the assessment of annual charges upon one or more of the following grounds:

        (1) The project was primarily designed to provide or improve navigation;

        (2) To the extent that power generated, transmitted, or distributed by the project was sold directly or indirectly to the public (ultimate consumer) without profit;

        (3) To the extent that power generated, transmitted, or distributed by the project was used by the licensee for State or municipal purposes.

        (b)  No State or municipal licensee shall be entitled to exemption from the payment of annual charges on the ground that the project was primarily designed to provide or improve navigation unless the licensee establishes that fact from the actual conditions under which the project was constructed and was operated during the calendar year for which the charge is made.

        (c)  A State or municipal licensee shall be entitled to exemption from the payment of annual charges for the project to the extent that power generated, transmitted, or distributed by the project is used by the licensee itself for State or municipal purposes, such as lighting streets, highways, parks, public buildings, etc., for operating licensee's water or sewerage system, or in performing other public functions of the licensee.

        (d)  No State or municipal licensee shall be entitled to exemption from the payment of annual charges on the ground that power generated, transmitted, or distributed by the project is sold to the public without profit, unless such licensee shall show:

        (1) That it maintains an accounting system which segregates the operations of the licensed project and reflects with reasonable accuracy the revenues and expenses of the project;

        (2) That an income statement, prepared in accordance with the Commission's Uniform System of Accounts, shows that the revenues from the sale of project power do not exceed the total amount of operating expenses, maintenance, depreciation, amortization, taxes, and interest on indebtedness, applicable to the project property. Periodic accruals or payments for redemption of the principal of bonds or other indebtedness may not be deducted in determining the net profit of the project.

        (e)  Notwithstanding compliance by a State or municipal licensee with the requirements of paragraph (d) of this section, it shall be subject to the payment of annual charges to the extent that electric power generated, transmitted, or distributed by the project is sold to another State, municipality, person, or corporation for resale, unless the licensee shall show that the power was sold to the ultimate consumer without profit. The matter of whether or not a profit was made is a question of fact to be established by the licensee.

        (f)  Notwithstanding compliance by a State or municipal licensee with the requirements of paragraph (d) of this section, it shall be subject to the payment of annual charges to the extent that power generated, transmitted, or distributed by the project was supplied under an interchange agreement to a State, municipality, person, or corporation for sale at a profit (which power was not offset by an equivalent amount of power received under such interchange agreement) unless the licensee shall show that the power was sold to ultimate consumers without profit.

        (g)  During the period when the licensed project is under construction and is not generating power, it will be considered as operating without profit within the meaning of this section, and licensee will be entitled to total exemption from the payment of annual charges, except as to those charges relating to the use of a Government dam or tribal lands within Indian reservations.

        (h)  When the power from the licensed project enters into the electric power system of the State or municipal licensee, making it impracticable to meet the requirements set forth in this section with respect to the operations of the project only, such licensee may, in lieu thereof, furnish the same information with respect to the operations of said electric power system as a whole.

        (i)  Applications for exemption from payment of annual charges shall be signed by an authorized executive officer or chief accounting officer of the licensee or exemptee and verified under oath. The application must be filed with the Secretary of the Commission in accordance with filing procedures posted on the Commission's Web site at  within the time allowed (by § 11.20) for the payment of the annual charges. If the licensee or exemptee, within the time allowed for the payment of the annual charges, files notice that it intends to file an application for exemption, an additional period of 30 days is allowed within which to complete and file the application for exemption. The filing of an application for exemption does not by itself alleviate the requirement to pay the annual charges, nor does it exonerate the licensee or exemptee from the assessment of penalties under § 11.21. If a bill for annual charges becomes payable after an application for an exemption has been filed and while the application is still pending for decision, the bill may be paid under protest and subject to refund.

      Subpart B—Charges for Headwater Benefits

**Source:** Source: Order 453, 51 FR 24318, July 3, 1986, unless otherwise noted.

        § 11.10   General provision; waiver and exemptions; definitions.

#### § § 11.10

        (a)  (1) The Commission will assess or approve charges under this subpart for direct benefits derived from headwater projects constructed by the United States, a licensee, or a pre-1920 permittee. Charges under this subpart will amount to an equitable part of the annual costs of interest, maintenance, and depreciation expenses of such headwater projects and the costs to the Commission of determining headwater benefits charges. Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the owner of any non-Federal downstream project that receives headwater benefits must pay charges determined under this subpart.

        (2) Headwater benefits are the additional electric generation at a downstream project that results from regulation of the flow of the river by the headwater, or upstream, project, usually by increasing or decreasing the release of water from a storage reservoir.

        (b)  The owner of a downstream project with installed generating capacity of 1.5 MW (2000 horsepower) or less or for which the Commission has granted an exemption from section 10(f) is not required to pay headwater benefits charges.

        (c)  For purposes of this subpart:

        (1)  means the difference between the number of kilowatt-hours of energy produced at a downstream project with the headwater project and that which would be produced without the headwater project.

        (2)  means gross generation of electricity at a hydroelectric project, including generation needed for station use or the equivalent for direct drive units, measured in kilowatt-hours. It does not include energy used for or derived from pumping in a pumped storage facility.

        (3)  means the total costs of an upstream project constructed by the United States, a licensee, or pre-1920 permittee.

        (4)  means the difference between the cost of a multiple-function headwater project with and without any particular function.

        (5)  means the difference between the separable cost of a specific function in a multiple-function project and the lesser of:

        (i) The benefits of that function in the project, as determined by the responsible Federal agency at the time the project or function was authorized; or

        (ii) The cost of the most likely alternative single-function project providing the same benefits.

        (6)  means the difference between the total project cost and the total separable costs. _Joint-use cost_s are allocated among the project functions according to each function's percentage of the total remaining benefits.

        (7)  means that portion of the headwater project costs that is directly attributable to the function of power generation at the headwater project, including, but not limited to, the cost of the electric generators, turbines, penstocks, and substation.

        (8)  means the portion of the joint-use cost allocated to the power function of the project.

        (9)  means the annual interest, depreciation, and maintenance expense portion of the joint-use power cost, including costs of non-power functions required by statute to be paid by revenues from the power function.

        (10)  means:

        (i) The owner of a non-Federal downstream hydroelectric project which is directly benefited by a headwater project constructed by the United States, a licensee, or a pre-1920 permittee;

        (ii) The owner of a headwater project constructed by the United States, a licensee, or a pre-1920 permittee;

        § 11.11   Energy gains method of determining headwater benefits charges.

#### § § 11.11

        (a)  This section applies to any determination of headwater benefits charges, unless:

        (1) The Commission has approved headwater benefits charges pursuant to an existing coordination agreement among the parties;

        (2) The parties reach, and the Commission approves, a settlement with respect to headwater benefits charges, pursuant to § 11.14(a) of this subpart; or

        (3) Charges may be assessed under § 11.14(b).

        (b) —(1)  Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, a headwater benefits charge for a downstream project is determined under this subpart by apportioning the section 10(f) costs of the headwater project among the headwater project and all downstream projects that are not exempt from or waived from headwater benefits charges under § 11.10(b) of this chapter, according to each project's share of the total energy benefits to those projects resulting from the headwater project.

        (2)  The annual headwater benefits charge for a downstream project is derived by multiplying the section 10(f) cost by the ratio of the energy gains received by the downstream project to the sum of total energy gains received by all downstream projects (except those projects specified in § 11.10(b) of this chapter) plus the energy generated at the headwater project that is assigned to the joint-use power cost, as follows:

        (3) If power generation is not a function of the headwater project, section 10(f) costs will be apportioned only among the downstream projects.

        (4) If the headwater project is constructed after the downstream project, liability for headwater benefits charges will accrue beginning on the day on which any energy losses at the downstream project due to filling the headwater reservoir have been offset by subsequent energy gains. If the headwater project is constructed prior to the downstream project, liability for headwater benefits charges will accrue beginning on the day on which benefits are first realized by the downstream project.

        (5) No final charge assessed by the Commission under this subpart may exceed 85 percent of the _value of the energy gains_. If a party demonstrates, within the time specified in § 11.17(b)(3) for response to a preliminary assessment, that any final charge assessed under this subpart, not including the cost of the investigation assessed under § 11.17(c), exceeds 85 percent of the value of the energy gains provided to the downstream project for the period for which the charge is assessed, the Commission will reduce the charge to not more than 85 percent of the value. For purposes of this paragraph, the  is the cost of obtaining an equivalent amount of electricity from the most likely alternative source during the period for which the charge is assessed.

        § 11.12   Determination of section 10(f) costs.

#### § § 11.12

        (a)  If the headwater project was constructed by a licensee or pre-1920 permittee and a party requests the Commission to determine charges, the Commission will determine on a case-by-case basis what portion of the annual interest, maintenance, and depreciation costs of the headwater project constitutes the section 10(f) costs, for purposes of this subpart.

        (b)  (1) If the headwater project was constructed or is operated by the United States, and the Commission has not approved a settlement between the downstream project owner and the headwater project owner, the section 10(f) cost will be determined by deriving, from information provided by the headwater project owner pursuant to § 11.16 of this subpart, the joint-use power cost and the portion of the annual joint-use power cost that represents the interest, maintenance, and depreciation costs of the project.

        (2) If power is not an authorized function of the headwater project, the section 10(f) cost is the annual interest, maintenance, and depreciation portion of the headwater project costs designated as the joint-use power cost, derived by deeming a power function at the project. The value of the benefits assigned to the deemed power function, for purposes of determining the value of remaining benefits of the joint-use power cost, is the total value of downstream energy gains included in the headwater benefits formula.

        (3) For purposes of this paragraph,  means the lesser of:

        (i) The cost of generating an equivalent amount of electricity at the most likely alternative facility at the time the headwater project became operational; or

        (ii) The incremental cost of installing electrical generation at the headwater project at the time the project became operational.

        § 11.13   Energy gains calculations.

#### § § 11.13

        (a)  (1) Energy gains at a downstream project are determined by simulating operation of the downstream project with and without the effects of the headwater project. Except for determinations which are not complex or in which headwater benefits are expected to be small, calculations will be made by application of the Headwater Benefits Energy Gains Model, as presented in  which is available for the National Technical Information Service, U.S. Department of Commerce, 5285 Port Royal Road, Springfield, VA 22161.

        (2) If more than one headwater project provide energy gains to a downstream project, the energy gains at the downstream project are attributed to the headwater projects according to the time sequence of commencement of operation in which each headwater project provided energy gains at the downstream project, by:

        (i) Crediting the headwater project that is first in time with the amount of energy gains that it provided to the downstream project prior to operation of the headwater project that is next in time; and

        (ii) Crediting any subsequent headwater project with the additional increment of energy gains provided by it to the downstream project.

        (3) Annual energy losses at a downstream project, or group of projects owned by the same entity, that are attributable to the headwater project will be subtracted from energy gains for the same annual period at the downstream project or group of projects. A net loss in one calendar year will be subtracted from net gains in subsequent years until no net loss remains.

        (b)  (1) Except as provided in paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section, the portion of the total annual energy generation at the headwater project that is to be attributed to the joint-use power cost is derived by multiplying the total annual generation at the headwater project and the ratio of the project investment cost assigned to the joint-use power cost to the sum of the investment cost assigned to both the specific power cost and the joint-use power cost of the headwater project, as follows:

        (2) If the headwater project contains a pumped storage facility, calculation of the portion of the total annual energy generation at the headwater project that is attributable to the joint-use power cost will be determined on a case-by-case basis.

        (3) If no power is generated at the headwater project, the amount of energy attributable to the joint-use power cost under this section is the total of all downstream energy gains included in the headwater benefits formula.

        § 11.14   Procedures for establishing charges without an energy gains investigation.

#### § § 11.14

        (a)  (1) Owners of downstream and headwater projects subject to this subpart may negotiate a settlement for headwater benefits charges. Settlements must be filed with the Commission for its approval, according to the provisions of § 385.602.

        (2) If the headwater project is a Federal project, any settlement under this section must result in headwater benefits payments that approximate those that would result under the energy gains method.

        (b)  (1) For any downstream project being assessed headwater benefit charges on or before September 16, 1986, the Commission will continue to assess charges to that project on the same basis until changes occur in the river basin, including hydrology or project development, that affect headwater benefits.

        (2) Any procedures that apply to § 11.17(b)(5) of this subpart will apply to any prospectively fixed charges that are continued under this paragraph.

        § 11.15   Procedures for determining charges by energy gains investigation.

#### § § 11.15

        (a)  Except as permitted under § 11.14, the Commission will conduct an investigation to obtain information for establishing headwater benefits charges under this subpart. The Commission will investigate and determine charges for a project downstream from a non-Federal headwater project only if the parties are unable to agree to a settlement and one of the parties requests the Commission to determine charges.

        (b)  The Commission will notify each downstream project owner and each headwater project owner when it initiates an investigation under this section, and the period of project operations to be studied will be specified. An investigation will continue until a final charge has been established for all years studied in the investigation.

        (c)  If any project owner wishes to object to the assessment of a headwater benefits charge on jurisdictional grounds, such objection must:

        (1) Be raised within 30 days after the notice of the investigation is issued; and

        (2) State in detail the grounds for its objection.

        (d)  (1) For any downstream project for which a final charge pursuant to an investigation has never been established, the Commission will conduct an initial investigation to determine a final charge.

        (2) The Commission may, for good cause shown by a party or on its own motion, initiate a new investigation of a river basin to determine whether, because of any change in the hydrology, project development, or other characteristics of the river basin that effects headwater benefits, it should:

        (i) Establish a new final charge to replace a final charge previously established under § 11.17(b)(5); or

        (ii) Revise any variable of the headwater benefits formula that has become a constant in calculating a final charge.

        (3)  (i) The Commission will establish a final charge pursuant to an investigation based on information available to the Commission through the annual data submission requirements of § 11.16, if such information is adequate to establish a reasonably accurate final charge.

        (ii) If the information available to the Commission is not sufficient to provide a reasonably accurate calculation of the final charge, the Commission will request additional data and conduct any studies, including studies of the hydrology of the river basin and project operations, that it determines necessary to establish the charge.

        § 11.16   Filing requirements.

#### § § 11.16

        (a)  (1) Any party subject to a headwater benefits determination under this subpart must supply project-specific data, in accordance with this section, by February 1 of each year for data from the preceding calendar year.

        (2) Within 30 days of notice of initiation of an investigation under § 11.15, a party must supply project-specific data, in accordance with this section, for the years specified in the notice.

        (2) The Commission will notify the project owner that certain data items in paragraphs (b) and (c) are no longer required to be submitted annually if:

        (i) A variable in the headwater benefits formula has become a constant; or

        (ii) A prospective final charge, as described in § 11.17(b)(5), has been established.

        (e)  Owners of headwater projects or downstream projects must furnish any additional data required by the Commission staff under paragraph (a) of this section and may provide other data which they consider relevant.

        § 11.17   Procedures for payment of charges and costs.

#### § § 11.17

        (a)  Any billing procedures and payments determined between a non-Federal headwater project owner and a downstream project owner will occur according to the agreement of those parties.

        (b) —(1)  (i) If the Commission has not established a final charge and an investigation is pending, the Commission will issue a downstream project owner a bill for the interim charge and costs and a staff report explaining the calculation of the interim charge.

        (ii) An interim charge will be a percentage of the estimate by the Commission staff of what the final charge will be, as follows:

        (A) 100 percent of the estimated final charge if the Commission previously has completed an investigation of the project for which it is assessed; or

        (B) 80 percent of the estimated final charge if the Commission has not completed an investigation of the project for which it is assessed.

        (iii) When a final charge is established for a period for which an interim charge was paid, the Commission will apply the amount paid to the final charge.

        (2)  Unless the project owner was assessed a final charge in the previous year, the Commission will issue to the downstream project owner a preliminary assessment of any final charge when it is determined. A staff technical report explaining the basis of the assessment will be enclosed with the preliminary assessment. Copies of the preliminary assessment will be mailed to all parties.

        (3)  After issuance of a preliminary assessment of a final charge, parties may respond in writing within 60 days after the preliminary assessment.

        (4)  (i) After the opportunity for written response by the parties to the preliminary assessment of a final charge, the Commission will issue to the downstream project owner an order establishing the final charge. Copies of the order will be mailed to all parties. A bill will be issued for the amount of the final charge and costs.

        (ii) If a final charge is not established prospectively under paragraph (b)(5) of this section, the Commission will issue an order and a bill for the final charge and costs each year until prospective final charges are established. After the Commission issues an order establishing a prospective final charge, a bill will be issued annually for the amount of the final charge and costs.

        (5)  When the Commission determines that historical data, including the hydrology, development, and other characteristics of the river basin, demonstrate sufficient stability to project average energy gains and section 10(f) costs, the Commission will issue to the downstream project owner an order establishing the final charge from future years. Copies of the order will be mailed to all parties. The prospective final charge will remain in effect until a new investigation is initiated under § 11.15(d)(2).

        (6)  Any payment of a final charge required by this section may be made under protest if a party is also appealing the final charge pursuant to § 385.1902, or requesting rehearing. If payment is made under protest, that party will avoid any penalty for failure to pay under § 11.21.

        (7)  The Commission will retain any payment received for final charges from bills issued pursuant to this section in a special account. No disbursements to the U.S. Treasury will be made from the account until 31 days after the bill is issued. If an appeal under § 385.1902 or a request for rehearing is filed by any party, no disbursements to the U.S. Treasury will be made until final disposition of the appeal or request for rehearing.

        (c)  (1) Any owner of a downstream project that benefits from a Federal headwater project must pay to the United States the cost of making any investigation, study, or determination relating to the assessment of the relevant headwater benefits charge under this subpart.

        (2) If any owner of a headwater or downstream project requests that the Commission determine headwater benefits charges for benefits provided by non-Federal headwater projects, the headwater project owners must pay a pro rata share of 50 percent of the cost of making the investigation and determination, in proportion to the benefits provided by their projects, and the downstream project owners must pay a pro rata share of the remaining 50 percent in proportion to the energy gains received by their projects.

        (3) Any charge assessed under this paragraph is separate from and will be added to, any final or interim charge under this subpart.

    PART 33—APPLICATIONS UNDER FEDERAL POWER ACT SECTION 203

### Part 33

**Authority:** Authority: 16 U.S.C. 791a-825r, 2601-2645; 31 U.S.C. 9701; 42 U.S.C. 7101-7352.

**Source:** Source: Order 642, 65 FR 71014, Nov. 28, 2000, unless otherwise noted.

      § 33.1   Applicability, definitions, and blanket authorizations.

#### § § 33.1

      (a)  (1) The requirements of this part will apply to any public utility seeking authorization under section 203 of the Federal Power Act to:

      (i) Sell, lease, or otherwise dispose of the whole of its facilities subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission, or any part thereof of a value in excess of $10 million;

      (ii) Merge or consolidate, directly or indirectly, its facilities subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission, or any part thereof, with the facilities of any other person, or any part thereof, that are subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission and have a value in excess of $10 million, by any means whatsoever;

      (iii) Purchase, acquire, or take any security with a value in excess of $10 million of any other public utility; or

      (iv) Purchase, lease, or otherwise acquire an existing generation facility:

      (A) That has a value in excess of $10 million; and

      (B) That is used in whole or in part for wholesale sales in interstate commerce by a public utility.

      (2) The requirements of this part shall also apply to any holding company in a holding company system that includes a transmitting utility or an electric utility if such holding company seeks to purchase, acquire, or take any security with a value in excess of $10 million of, or, by any means whatsoever, directly or indirectly, merge or consolidate with, a transmitting utility, an electric utility company, or a holding company in a holding company system that includes a transmitting utility, or an electric utility company, with a value in excess of $10 million.

      (b)  For the purposes of this part, as used in section 203 of the Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C. 824b).

      (1)  means a generation facility that is operational at or before the time the section 203 transaction is consummated. “The time the transaction is consummated” means the point in time when the transaction actually closes and control of the facility changes hands. “Operational” means a generation facility for which construction is complete (, it is capable of producing power). The Commission will rebuttably presume that section 203(a) applies to the transfer of any existing generation facility unless the utility can demonstrate with substantial evidence that the generator is used exclusively for retail sales.

      (2)  means any associate company in a holding company system other than a public utility or electric utility company that has wholesale or retail customers served under cost-based regulation.

      (3)  when applied to:

      (i) Transmission facilities, generation facilities, transmitting utilities, electric utility companies, and holding companies, means the market value of the facilities or companies for transactions between non-affiliated companies; the Commission will rebuttably presume that the market value is the transaction price. For transactions between affiliated companies, value means original cost undepreciated, as defined in the Commission's Uniform System of Accounts prescribed for public utilities and licensees in part 101 of this chapter, or original book cost, as applicable;

      (ii) Wholesale contracts, means the market value for transactions between non-affiliated companies; the Commission will rebuttably presume that the market value is the transaction price. For transactions between affiliated companies, value means total expected nominal contract revenues over the remaining life of the contract; and

      (iii) Securities, means market value for transactions between non-affiliated companies; the Commission will rebuttably presume that the market value is the agreed-upon transaction price. For transactions between affiliated companies, value means market value if the securities are widely traded, in which case the Commission will rebuttably presume that market value is the market price at which the securities are being traded at the time the transaction occurs; if the securities are not widely traded, market value is determined by:

      (A) Determining the value of the company that is the issuer of the equity securities based on the total undepreciated book value of the company's assets;

      (B) Determining the fraction of the securities at issue by dividing the number of equity securities involved in the transaction by the total number of outstanding equity securities for the company; and

      (C) Multiplying the value determined in paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(A) of this section by the value determined in paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(B) of this section (, the value of the company multiplied by the fraction of the equity securities at issue).

      (4) The terms  and  have the meaning given those terms in the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005. The term holding company does not include: A State, any political subdivision of a State, or any agency, authority or instrumentality of a State or political subdivision of a State; or an electric power cooperative.

      (5) For purposes of this part, the term captive customers means any wholesale or retail electric energy customers served by a franchised public utility under cost-based regulation.

      (c)  (1) Any holding company in a holding company system that includes a transmitting utility or an electric utility is granted a blanket authorization under section 203(a)(2) of the Federal Power Act to purchase, acquire, or take any security of:

      (i) A transmitting utility or company that owns, operates, or controls only facilities used solely for transmission in intrastate commerce and/or sales of electric energy in intrastate commerce, provided that if any public utility within the holding company system has captive customers, or owns or provides transmission service over jurisdictional transmission facilities, the holding company must report the acquisition to the Commission, including any state actions or conditions related to the transaction, and shall provide an explanation of why the transaction does not result in cross-subsidization;

      (ii) A transmitting utility or company that owns, operates, or controls only facilities used solely for local distribution and/or sales of electric energy at retail regulated by a state commission, provided that if any public utility within the holding company system has captive customers, or owns or provides transmission service over jurisdictional transmission facilities, the holding company must report the acquisition to the Commission, including any state actions or conditions related to the transaction, and shall provide an explanation of why the transaction does not result in cross-subsidization; or

      (iii) An electric utility company that owns generating facilities that total 100 MW or less and are fundamentally used for its own individual load or for sales to affiliated end-users.

      (2) Any holding company in a holding company system that includes a transmitting utility or an electric utility is granted a blanket authorization under section 203(a)(2) of the Federal Power Act to purchase, acquire, or take:

      (i) Any non-voting security (that does not convey sufficient veto rights over management actions so as to convey control) in a transmitting utility, an electric utility company, or a holding company in a holding company system that includes a transmitting utility or an electric utility company; or

      (ii) Any voting security in a transmitting utility, an electric utility company, or a holding company in a holding company system that includes a transmitting utility or an electric utility company if, after the acquisition, the holding company will own less than 10 percent of the outstanding voting securities; or

      (iii) Any security of a subsidiary company within the holding company system.

      (3) The blanket authorizations granted under paragraph (c)(2) of this section are subject to the conditions that the holding company shall not:

      (i) Borrow from any electric utility company subsidiary in connection with such acquisition; or

      (ii) Pledge or encumber the assets of any electric utility company subsidiary in connection with such acquisition.

      (4) A holding company granted blanket authorizations in paragraph (c)(2) of this section shall provide the Commission copies of any Schedule 13D, Schedule 13G and Form 13F, at the same time and on the same basis, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in connection with any securities purchased, acquired or taken pursuant to this section.

      (5) Any holding company in a holding company system that includes a transmitting utility or an electric utility is granted a blanket authorization under section 203(a)(2) of the Federal Power Act to acquire a foreign utility company. However, if such holding company or any of its affiliates, its subsidiaries, or associate companies within the holding company system has captive customers in the United States, or owns or provides transmission service over jurisdictional transmission facilities in the United States, the authorization is conditioned on the holding company, consistent with 18 CFR 385.2005(b), verifying by a duly authorized corporate official of the holding company that the proposed transaction:

      (i) Will not have any adverse effect on competition, rates, or regulation; and

      (ii) Will not result in, at the time of the transaction or in the future:

      (A) Any transfer of facilities between a traditional public utility associate company that has captive customers or that owns or provides transmission service over jurisdictional transmission facilities, and an associate company;

      (B) Any new issuance of securities by a traditional public utility associate company that has captive customers or that owns or provides transmission service over jurisdictional transmission facilities, for the benefit of an associate company;

      (C) Any new pledge or encumbrance of assets of a traditional public utility associate company that has captive customers or that owns or provides transmission service over jurisdictional transmission facilities, for the benefit of an associate company; or

      (D) Any new affiliate contracts between a non-utility associate company and a traditional public utility associate company that has captive customers or that owns or provides transmission service over jurisdictional transmission facilities, other than non-power goods and services agreements subject to review under sections 205 and 206 of the Federal Power Act.

      (iii) A transaction by a holding company subject to the conditions in paragraphs (c)(5)(i) and (ii) of this section will be deemed approved only upon filing the information required in paragraphs (c)(5)(i) and (ii) of this section.

      (6) Any public utility or any holding company in a holding company system that includes a transmitting utility or an electric utility is granted a blanket authorization under sections 203(a)(1) or 203(a)(2) of the Federal Power Act, as relevant, for internal corporate reorganizations that do not result in the reorganization of a traditional public utility that has captive customers or that owns or provides transmission service over jurisdictional transmission facilities, and that do not present cross-subsidization issues.

      (7) Any public utility in a holding company system that includes a transmitting utility or an electric utility is granted a blanket authorization under section 203(a)(1) of the Federal Power Act to purchase, acquire, or take any security of a public utility in connection with an intra-system cash management program, subject to safeguards to prevent cross-subsidization or pledges or encumbrances of utility assets.

      (8) A person that is a holding company solely with respect to one or more exempt wholesale generators (EWGs), foreign utility companies (FUCOs), or qualifying facilities (QFs) is granted a blanket authorization under section 203(a)(2) of the Federal Power Act to acquire the securities of additional EWGs, FUCOs, or QFs.

      (9) A holding company, or a subsidiary of that company, that is regulated by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve Bank or by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 as amended by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999, is granted a blanket authorization under section 203(a)(2) of the Federal Power Act to acquire and hold an unlimited amount of the securities of holding companies that include a transmitting utility or an electric utility company if such acquisitions and holdings are in the normal course of its business and the securities are held:

      (iii) As collateral for a loan; or

      (iv) Solely for purposes of liquidation and in connection with a loan previously contracted for and owned beneficially for a period of not more than two years, with the following conditions and reporting requirement: The holding does not confer a right to control, positively or negatively, through debt covenants or any other means, the operation or management of the public utility or public utility holding company, except as to customary creditors' rights or as provided under the United States Bankruptcy Code; and the parent holding company files with the Commission on a public basis and within 45 days of the close of each calendar quarter, both its total holdings and its holdings as principal, each by class, unless the holdings within a class are less than one percent of outstanding shares, irrespective of the capacity in which they were held.

      (10) Any holding company, or a subsidiary of that company, is granted a blanket authorization under section 203(a)(2) of the Federal Power Act to acquire any security of a public utility or a holding company that includes a public utility:

      (i) For purposes of conducting underwriting activities, subject to the condition that holdings that the holding company or its subsidiary are unable to sell or otherwise dispose of within 45 days are to be treated as holdings as principal and thus subject to a limitation of 10 percent of the stock of any class unless the holding company or its subsidiary has within that period filed an application under section 203 of the Federal Power Act to retain the securities and has undertaken not to vote the securities during the pendency of such application; and the parent holding company files with the Commission on a public basis and within 45 days of the close of each calendar quarter, both its total holdings and its holdings as principal, each by class, unless the holdings within a class are less than one percent of outstanding shares, irrespective of the capacity in which they were held;

The applicant must fully explain, justify and document any model used and provide descriptions of model formulation, mathematical specifications, solution algorithms, as well as the annotated model code in executable form, and specify the software needed to execute the model. The applicant must explain and document how inputs were developed, the assumptions underlying such inputs and any adjustments made to published data that are used as inputs. The applicant must also explain how it tested the predictive value of the model, for example, using historical data.

      (c) The horizontal Competitive Analysis Screen must be completed using the following steps:

      (1)  Identify and define all wholesale electricity products sold by the merging entities during the two years prior to the date of the application, including, but not limited to, non-firm energy, short-term capacity (or firm energy), long-term capacity (a contractual commitment of more than one year), and ancillary services (specifically spinning reserves, non-spinning reserves, and imbalance energy, identified and defined separately). Because demand and supply conditions for a product can vary substantially over the year, periods corresponding to those distinct conditions must be identified by load level, and analyzed as separate products.

      (2)  Identify each wholesale power sales customer or set of customers (destination market) affected by the proposed transaction. Affected customers are, at a minimum, those entities directly interconnected to any of the merging entities and entities that have purchased electricity at wholesale from any of the merging entities during the two years prior to the date of the application. If the applicant does not identify an entity to whom the merging entities have sold electricity during the last two years as an affected customer, the applicant must provide a full explanation for each exclusion.

      (3)  The applicant must identify potential suppliers to each destination market using the delivered price test described in paragraph (c)(4) of this section. A seller may be included in a geographic market to the extent that it can economically and physically deliver generation services to the destination market.

      (4)  For each destination market, the applicant must calculate the amount of relevant product a potential supplier could deliver to the destination market from owned or controlled capacity at a price, including applicable transmission prices, loss factors and ancillary services costs, that is no more than five (5) percent above the pre-transaction market clearing price in the destination market.

      (i)  The applicant must measure each potential supplier's presence in the destination market in terms of generating capacity, using economic capacity and available economic capacity measures. Additional adjustments to supplier presence may be presented; applicants must support any such adjustment.

      (A)  means the amount of generating capacity owned or controlled by a potential supplier with variable costs low enough that energy from such capacity could be economically delivered to the destination market. Prior to applying the delivered price test, the generating capacity meeting this definition must be adjusted by subtracting capacity committed under long-term firm sales contracts and adding capacity acquired under long-term firm purchase contracts ( contracts with a remaining commitment of more than one year). The capacity associated with any such adjustments must be attributed to the party that has authority to decide when generating resources are available for operation. Other generating capacity may also be attributed to another supplier based on operational control criteria as deemed necessary, but the applicant must explain the reasons for doing so.

      (B)  means the amount of generating capacity meeting the definition of economic capacity less the amount of generating capacity needed to serve the potential supplier's native load commitments, as described in paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section.

      (C)  Each potential supplier's economic capacity and available economic capacity (and any other measure used to determine the amount of relevant product that could be delivered to a destination market) must be adjusted to reflect available transmission capability to deliver each relevant product. The allocation to a potential supplier of limited capability of constrained transmission paths internal to the merging entities' systems or interconnecting the systems with other control areas must recognize both the transmission capability not subject to firm reservations by others and any firm transmission rights held by the potential supplier that are not committed to long-term transactions. For each such instance where limited transmission capability must be allocated among potential suppliers, the applicant must explain the method used and show the results of such allocation.

      (D)  If the proposed transaction would cause an interface that interconnects the transmission systems of the merging entities to become transmission facilities for which the merging entities would have a “native load” priority under their open access transmission tariff ( where the merging entities may reserve existing transmission capacity needed for native load growth and network transmission customer load growth reasonable forecasted within the utility's current planning horizon), all of the unreserved capability of the interface must be allocated to the merging entities for purposes of the horizontal Competitive Analysis Screen, unless the applicant demonstrates one of the following:

      () The merging entities would not have adequate economic capacity to fully use such unreserved transmission capability;

      () The merging entities have committed a portion of the interface capability to third parties; or

      () Suppliers other than the merging entities have purchased a portion of the interface capability.

      (ii) [Reserved]

      (5)  The applicant must calculate the market share, both pre- and post-merger, for each potential supplier, the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) statistic for the market, and the change in the HHI statistic. (The HHI statistic is a measure of market concentration and is a function of the number of firms in a market and their respective market shares. The HHI statistic is calculated by summing the squares of the individual market shares, expressed as percentages, of all potential suppliers to the destination market.) To make these calculations, the applicant must use the amounts of generating capacity ( economic capacity and available economic capacity, and any other relevant measure) determined in paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section, for each product in each destination market.

      (6)  The applicant must provide historical trade data and historical transmission data to corroborate the results of the horizontal Competitive Analysis Screen. The data must cover the two-year period preceding the filing of the application. The applicant may adjust the results of the horizontal Competitive Analysis Screen, if supported by historical trade data or historical transmission service data. Any adjusted results must be shown separately, along with an explanation of all adjustments to the results of the horizontal Competitive Analysis Screen. The applicant must also provide an explanation of any significant differences between results obtained by the horizontal Competitive Analysis Screen and trade patterns in the last two years.

      (d) In support of the delivered price test required by paragraph (c)(4) of this section, the applicant must provide the following data and information used in calculating the economic capacity and available economic capacity that a potential supplier could deliver to a destination market. The transmission data required by paragraphs (d)(7) through (d)(9) of this section must be supplied for the merging entities' systems. The transmission data must also be supplied for other relevant systems, to the extent data are publicly available.

      (1)  For each generating plant or unit owned or controlled by each potential supplier, the applicant must provide:

      (i) Supplier name;

      (ii) Name of the plant or unit;

      (iii) Primary and secondary fuel-types;

      (iv) Nameplate capacity;

      (v) Summer and winter total capacity; and

      (vi) Summer and winter capacity adjusted to reflect planned and forced outages and other factors, such as fuel supply and environmental restrictions.

      (2)  For each generating plant or unit owned or controlled by each potential supplier, the applicant must also provide variable cost components.

      (i) These cost components must include at a minimum:

      (A) Variable operation and maintenance, including both fuel and non-fuel operation and maintenance; and

      (B) Environmental compliance.

      (ii) To the extent costs described in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section are allocated among units at the same plant, allocation methods must be fully described.

      (3)  For each sale and purchase of capacity, the applicant must provide the following information:

      (i) Purchasing entity name;

      (ii) Selling entity name;

      (iii) Duration of the contract;

      (iv) Remaining contract term and any evergreen provisions;

      (v) Provisions regarding renewal of the contract;

      (vi) Priority or degree of interruptibility;

      (vii) FERC rate schedule number, if applicable;

      (viii) Quantity and price of capacity and/or energy purchased or sold under the contract; and

      (ix) Information on provisions of contracts which confer operational control over generation resources to the purchaser.

      (4)  (i) Native load commitments are commitments to serve wholesale and retail power customers on whose behalf the potential supplier, by statute, franchise, regulatory requirement, or contract, has undertaken an obligation to construct and operate its system to meet their reliable electricity needs.

      (ii) The applicant must provide supplier name and hourly native load commitments for the most recent two years. In addition, the applicant must provide this information for each load level, if load-differentiated relevant products are analyzed.

      (iii) If data on native load commitments are not available, the applicant must fully explain and justify any estimates of these commitments.

      (5)  (i) The applicant must use in the horizontal Competitive Analysis Screen the maximum rates stated in the transmission providers' tariffs. If necessary, those rates should be converted to a dollars-per-megawatt hour basis and the conversion method explained.

      (ii) If a regional transmission pricing regime is in effect that departs from system-specific transmission rates, the horizontal Competitive Analysis Screen must reflect the regional pricing regime.

      (iii) The following data must be provided for each transmission system that would be used to deliver energy from each potential supplier to a destination market:

      (A) Supplier name;

      (B) Name of transmission system;

      (C) Firm point-to-point rate;

      (D) Non-firm point-to-point rate;

      (E) Scheduling, system control and dispatch rate;

      (F) Reactive power/voltage control rate;

      (G) Transmission loss factor; and

      (H) Estimated cost of supplying energy losses.

      (iv) The applicant may present additional alternative analysis using discount prices if the applicant can support it with evidence that discounting is and will be available.

      (6)  The applicant must provide, for each relevant product and destination market, market prices for the most recent two years. The applicant may provide suitable proxies for market prices if actual market prices are unavailable. Estimated prices or price ranges must be supported and the data and approach used to estimate the prices must be included with the application. If the applicant relies on price ranges in the analysis, such ranges must be reconciled with any actual market prices that are supplied in the application. Applicants must demonstrate that the results of the analysis do not vary significantly in response to small variations in actual and/or estimated prices.

      (7)  (i) The applicant must provide simultaneous transfer capability data, if available, for each of the transmission paths, interfaces, or other facilities used by suppliers to deliver to the destination markets on an hourly basis for the most recent two years.

      (ii) Transmission capability data must include the following information:

      (A) Transmission path, interface, or facility name;

      (B) Total transfer capability (TTC); and

      (C) Firm available transmission capability (ATC).

      (iii) Any estimated transmission capability must be supported and the data and approach used to make the estimates must be included with the application.

      (8)  (i) For each existing transmission facility that affects supplies to the destination markets and that has been constrained during the most recent two years or is expected to be constrained within the planning horizon, the applicant must provide the following information:

      (A) Name of all paths, interfaces, or facilities affected by the constraint;

      (B) Locations of the constraint and all paths, interfaces, or facilities affected by the constraint;

      (C) Hours of the year when the transmission constraint is binding; and

      (D) The system conditions under which the constraint is binding.

      (ii) The applicant must include information regarding expected changes in loadings on transmission facilities due to the proposed transaction and the consequent effect on transfer capability.

      (iii) To the extent possible, the applicant must provide system maps showing the location of transmission facilities where binding constraints have been known or are expected to occur.

      (9)  For each potential supplier to a destination market that holds firm transmission rights necessary to directly or indirectly deliver energy to that market, or that holds transmission congestion contracts, the applicant must provide the following information:

      (i) Supplier name;

      (ii) Name of transmission path interface, or facility;

      (iii) The FERC rate schedule number, if applicable, under which transmission service is provided; and

      (10)  (i) The applicant must provide a summary table with the following information for each potential supplier for each destination market:

      (A) Potential supplier name;

      (B) The potential supplier's total amount of economic capacity (not subject to transmission constraints); and

        (b) A rate schedule, tariff, or service agreement applicable to a transmission or sale of electric energy, other than that which proposes to supersede, cancel or otherwise change the provisions of a rate schedule, tariff, or service agreement required to be on file with this Commission, shall be filed as an initial rate in accordance with § 35.12.

        (c) A rate schedule, tariff, or service agreement applicable to a transmission or sale of electric energy which proposes to supersede, cancel or otherwise change any of the provisions of a rate schedule, tariff, or service agreement required to be on file with this Commission (such as providing for other or additional rates, charges, classifications or services, or rules, regulations, practices or contracts for a particular customer or customers) shall be filed as a change in rate in accordance with § 35.13, except cancellation or termination which shall be filed as a change in accordance with § 35.15.

        (3) Rate schedules, tariffs or service agreements covered by the terms of paragraph (d)(1) of this section shall contain the following provision when it is the intent of the contracting parties to withhold from the party furnishing service the right to file any unilateral rate changes under section 205 of the Federal Power Act:

        (e) No public utility shall, directly or indirectly, demand, charge, collect or receive any rate, charge or compensation for or in connection with electric service subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission, or impose any classification, practice, rule, regulation or contract with respect thereto, which is different from that provided in a rate schedule required to be on file with this Commission unless otherwise specifically provided by order of the Commission for good cause shown.

        (f) A rate schedule applicable to the sale of electric power by a public utility to the Bonneville Power Administration under section 5(c) of the Pacific Northwest Electric Power Planning and Conservation Act (Pub. L. No. 96-501 (1980)) shall be filed in accordance with subpart D of this part.

        (g) For the purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, any service agreement that conforms to the form of service agreement that is part of the public utility's approved tariff pursuant to § 35.10a of this chapter and any market-based rate service agreement pursuant to a tariff shall not be filed with the Commission. All agreements must, however, be retained and be made available for public inspection and copying at the public utility's business office during regular business hours and provided to the Commission or members of the public upon request. Any individually executed service agreement for transmission, cost-based power sales, or other generally applicable services that deviates in any material respect from the applicable form of service agreement contained in the public utility's tariff and all unexecuted agreements under which service will commence at the request of the customer, are subject to the filing requirements of this part.

      Subpart B—Documents To Be Submitted With a Filing

        § 35.12   Filing of initial rate schedules and tariffs.

#### § § 35.12

        (a) The letter of a public utility transmitting to the Commission for filing an initial rate schedule or tariff shall list the documents submitted with the filing; give the date on which the service under that rate schedule or tariff is expected to commence; state the names and addresses of those to whom the rate schedule or tariff has been mailed; contain a brief description of the kinds of services to be furnished at the rates specified therein; and summarize the circumstances which show that all requisite agreement to the rate schedule or tariff or the filing thereof, including any contract embodied therein, has in fact been obtained. In the case of coordination and interchange arrangements in the nature of power pooling transactions, all supporting data required to be submitted in support of a rate schedule or tariff filing shall also be submitted by parties filing certificates of concurrence, or a representative to file supporting data on behalf of all parties may be designated as provided in § 35.1.

        (b) In addition, the following material shall be submitted:

        (1) Estimates of the transactions and revenues under an initial rate schedule. This shall include estimates, by months and for the year, of the quantities of services to be rendered and of the revenues to be derived therefrom during the 12 months immediately following the month in which those services will commence. Such estimates should be subdivided by classes of service, customers, and delivery points and shall show all billing determinants, e.g., kw, kwh, fuel adjustment, power factor adjustment. These estimates will not be required where they cannot be made with relative accuracy as, for example, in cases of interconnection arrangements containing schedules of rates for emergency energy, spinning reserve or economy energy or in cases of coordination and integration of hydroelectric generating resources whose output cannot be predicted quantitatively due to water conditions.

        (2)(i) Basis of the rate or charge proposed in an initial rate schedule or tariff and an explanation of how the proposed rate or charge was derived. For example, is it a standard rate of the filing public utility; is it a special rate arrived at through negotiations and, if so, were unusual customer requirements or competitive factors involved; and is it designed to produce a return substantially equal to the filing public utility's overall rate of return or is it essentially an increment cost plus a share of the savings rate? Were special cost of service studies prepared in connection with the derivation of the rate?

        (ii) A summary statement of all cost (whether fully distributed, incremental or other) computations involved in arriving at the derivation of the level of the rate, in sufficient detail to justify the rate, shall be submitted with the filing, except that if the filing includes nothing more than service to one or more added customers under an established rate of the utility for a particular class of service, such summary statement of cost computations is not required. In all cases, the Secretary is authorized to require the submission of the complete cost studies as part of the filing and each filing public utility shall submit the same upon request by the Secretary in such form as he or she shall direct.

        (3) A comparison of the proposed initial rate with other rates of the filing public utility for similar wholesale for resale and transmission services.

        (4) If any facilities are installed or modified in order to supply the service to be furnished under the proposed rate schedule or tariff, the filing public utility shall show on an appropriate available map (or sketch) and single line diagram the additions or changes to be made.

        (5) In support of the design of the proposed rate, the filing public utility shall submit the same material required to be furnished pursuant to § 35.13(h)(37) Statement BL. In addition to the summary cost analysis required by Statement BL, the public utility shall also submit a complete explanation as to the method used in arriving at the cost of service allocated to the sales and service for which the rate or charge is proposed, and showing the principal determinants used for allocation purposes. In connection therewith, the following data should be submitted:

        (i) In the event the filing public utility considers certain special facilities as being devoted entirely to the service involved, it shall show the cost of service related to such special facilities.

        (ii) Computations showing the energy responsibility of the service, based upon considerations of energy sales under the proposed rate schedule or tariff and the kWh delivered from the filing public utility's supply system.

        (iii) Computations showing the demand responsibility of the service, and explaining the considerations upon which such responsibility was determined (e.g., coincident or non-coincident peak demands, etc.).

        (F) If the Commission sets the filing for hearing, the Commission will allow the company a specific time period in which to file testimony, exhibits, and supplemental workpapers to complete its case-in-chief. While not required under this subpart, a utility may elect to submit Statements AA through BM for the Test Period in accord with the requirements of paragraphs (d), (g) and (h) of this section.

        (ii)  Any utility that files a rate increase for any service of short duration and of a type for which the need and usage cannot be reasonably forecasted (such as emergency or short-term power), or for service that is an integral part of a coordination and interchange arrangement, may submit with its filing only the information required in paragraphs (b), (c) and (h)(37) of this section and in § 35.12(b)(2) and (b)(5), conforming its submission to any rule of general applicability and to any Commission order specifically applicable to such utility.

        (iii)  Any utility that files a rate change that does not provide for a rate increase or that provides for a rate increase that is based solely on a change in delivery points, a change in delivery voltage, or a similar change in service, must submit with its filing only the information required in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.

        (iv)  For purposes of this subparagraph and paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section, the amount of any rate increase shall be the difference between the total revenues to be recovered under the rate change and the total revenues recovered or recoverable under the rate to be superseded or supplemented and shall be determined by:

        (A) applying the components of the rate to be superseded or supplemented to the billing determinants for the twelve months of Period I;

        (B) Applying the components of the rate change to the billing determinants for the twelve months of Period I; and

        (1)  Statement AA consists of balance sheets as of the beginning and the end of both Period I and Period II, and the most recently available balance sheet, including any applicable notes, and an explanation of any significant accounting changes since the most recent filing by the utility under this section that involves the same wholesale customer rate class. Balance sheets shall be constructed in accordance with the annual report form for electric utilities specified in part 141.

        (2)  Statement AB consists of income statements for both Period I and Period II, and the most recently available income statement, including any applicable notes, and an explanation of any significant accounting changes since the most recent filing by the utility under this section that involves the same wholesale customer rate class. Income statements shall be prepared in accordance with the annual report form for electric utilities specified in part 141.

        (3)  Statement AC consists of retained earnings statements for both Period I and Period II, and the most recently available retained earnings statement, including any notes applicable thereto. Retained earnings statements shall be prepared in accordance with the annual report form for electric utilities specified in part 141.

        (4)  Statement AD is a statement of the original cost of total electric plant in service according to functional classification for Period I and Period II. If the plant functions and subfunctions for Period I and Period II are different, the utility shall explain and justify the differences.

        (i) For each separately identified function and subfunction of production plant or transmission plant, the utility shall state the original cost as of the beginning of the first month and the end of each month of both Period I and Period II, with an average of the thirteen balances for each period. If any of the Period I or Period II thirteen monthly balances is not available or is unrepresentative of the current plan of the utility for plant in service, the utility shall provide an explanation of the relevant circumstances.

        (ii) For each separately identified function and subfunction of plant other than production or transmission, the utility shall state the original cost as of the beginning and the end of both Period I and Period II, with an average of the beginning and end balances for each period. If any of the Period I or Period II balances is not available or is unrepresentative of the current plan of the utility for plant in service, the utility shall provide an explanation of the relevant circumstances.

        (iii) The utility shall show the electric plant in service in accordance with each of the following five major functional classifications:

        (A) Production;

        (B) Transmission;

        (C) Distribution;

        (D) General and Intangible; and

        (E) Common and Other.

        (iv) To the extent feasible, the utility shall show completed construction not classified in accordance with clause (iii) in accordance with tentative classification to major functional accounts. If this is not feasible, the utility shall describe such facilities as other plant under clause (iii)(E).

        (v) If a utility designs its rate change so that subdivision of the major functional classifications is necessary to support the changed rate, the utility shall supply the original cost information for any of the five major functional plant classifications in clause (iii) that are divided into subfunctional categories. If subfunctional original cost information is provided, the utility shall explain the importance of providing such information to support the changed rate. The utility shall describe each subfunctional category in substantive terms, such as  or

        (vi) The utility shall select any subfunctional categories, as appropriate, under the following criteria:

        (A) Production plant categories shall be established as necessary to segregate costs for production services with special characteristics, such as base, intermediate or peaking load. The utility shall provide a description of each such service and shall list a brief descriptive title for each corresponding subfunctional category.

        (B) Transmission plant categories shall be chosen to reflect the extent to which the facilities are proposed to be allocated on a common basis among all or specific segments of utility services. For descriptive purposes, plant may also be categorized according to accounting or engineering terminology, such as  The utility shall provide brief descriptive transmission category titles and explain the basis for the titles. If a utility allocates all transmission plant among utility services on the basis of a single set of allocation data, the utility may show original cost in total without subfunctionalization.

        (C) Distribution plant categories shall be selected according to engineering or use characteristics meaningful for allocations or assignments to wholesale services such as substations, overhead lines, meters, or non-wholesale. The utility shall provide brief descriptive distribution category titles and shall explain the basis for the titles.

        (D) If the utility divides any general, intangible, common, and other plant functional classifications into subfunctional categories, the subfunctional categories shall be chosen to group together facilities that share a common basis for allocation between wholesale and other electric services. The utility shall provide a brief descriptive title for each general and intangible subfunctional category, and for each common and other subfunctional category, with an explanation of the basis of each category selection. A utility need not divide the functional classifications of plant into subfunctional categories if these functions of plant are allocated in Statement BK on the basis of utility labor expenses.

        (E) A separate category shall be provided for each specific assignment of plant reported in Statement BE. Such assignments are applicable principally but not necessarily exclusively to distribution facilities. The utility shall provide brief descriptive titles consistent with Statement BE.

        (F) A separate category shall be provided for each exclusive-use commitment of major power supply facilities as required to be reported at Statement BF. The utility shall provide brief descriptive titles consistent with Statement BF.

        (5)  Statement AE is a statement of the accumulated provision for depreciation and amortization of electric plant for Period I and Period II, provided according to major functional classifications selected by the utility in Statement AD under paragraph (h)(4) and divided into the subfunctional categories selected by the utility in Statement AD, to the extent that subfunctionalized data are available.

        (i) For each function and subfunction of electric production and transmission plant in service identified in Statement AD, the utility shall set forth the accumulated depreciation and amortization as of the beginning of the first month and the end of each month of both Period I and Period II. The utility shall state an average for each period computed as the average of the thirteen balances.

        (ii) For each function and subfunction of electric plant in service other than production or transmission, identified in Statement AD, the utility shall state the accumulated depreciation and amortization as of the beginning and the end of Period I and Period II, with an average of the beginning and end balances for each period.

        (iii) If any of the Period I or Period II balances is not available or is unrepresentative of the current plan of the utility for depreciation reserves, the utility shall provide an explanation of the relevant circumstances.

        (iv) If accumulated depreciation and amortization data are not available for any subfunction selected in Statement AD, the utility shall:

        (A) Provide a comparison of the current depreciation rate of the major functional classification and the depreciation rate estimated to be appropriate to the subfunctional category; and

        (B) State and explain the estimation techniques which the utility proposes to utilize in the absence of subfunctional data, such as the proration of accumulated depreciation and amortization data among the subfunctional categories according to the data for electric plant in service in Statement AD. If any of the proposed estimation techniques require data that are not provided elsewhere in the cost of service statements in paragraph (h) of this section, the utility shall supply the necessary data in Statement AE.

Such summary cost analysis shall be consistent with, derived from, and cross-referenced to the data in cost of service Statement BK. If the rate design is not intended to reflect costs, whether fully distributed, marginal, incremental, or other, the utility shall provide a statement to justify the departure from cost-based rates.

        (ii) If the billing determinants, such as quantities of demand, energy, or delivery points, are on different bases than the cost allocation determinants supporting such charges, the utility shall submit an explanation setting forth the economic or other considerations that warrant such departure. The information shall include at least the following:

        (A) If the individual rate for the demand, energy and customer charges do not correspond to the comparable cost classifications supporting such charges, a detailed explanation stating the reasons for the differences.

        (B) If the changed rate contains more than one demand or energy block, a detailed explanation indicating the rationale for the blocking and the considerations upon which such blocking is based, including adequate cost support for the specified blocking.

        (38)  Statement BM is a summary of data and supporting assumptions relating to the economics of any construction program to replace or expand the utility's power supply that shall be filed if the utility is filing for construction work in progress in rate base under § 35.26(c)(3) of this chapter. The filing utility shall describe generally its program for providing reliable and economic power for the period beginning with the date of the filing and ending with the tenth year after the test period. The statement shall include an assessment of the relative costs of adopting alternative strategies including an analysis of alternative production plant,  cogeneration, small power production, heightened load management and conservation efforts, additions to transmission plant or increased purchases of power, and an explanation of why the program adopted is prudent and consistent with a least-cost energy supply program.

      Subpart C—Other Filing Requirements

        § 35.14   Fuel cost and purchased economic power adjustment clauses.

#### § § 35.14

        (a) Fuel adjustment clauses (fuel clause) which are not in conformity with the principles set out below are not in the public interest. These regulations contemplate that the filing of proposed rate schedules, tariffs or service agreements which embody fuel clauses failing to conform to the following principles may result in suspension of those parts of such rate schedules, tariffs, or service agreements:

        (1) The fuel clause shall be of the form that provides for periodic adjustments per kWh of sales equal to the difference between the fuel and purchased economic power costs per kWh of sales in the base period and in the current period:

        (2) _F_uel and purchased economic power costs () shall be the cost of:

        (i) Fossil and nuclear fuel consumed in the utility's own plants, and the utility's share of fossil and nuclear fuel consumed in jointly owned or leased plants.

        (ii) The actual identifiable fossil and nuclear fuel costs associated with energy purchased for reasons other than identified in paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section.

        (iii) The total cost of the purchase of econo*m*ic power, as defined in paragraph (a)(11) of this section, if the reserve capacity of the *b*uyer is adequate independent of all other purchases where non-fuel charges are included in either  or ;

        (iv) Energy charges for any purchase if the total amount of energy charges incurred for the purchase is less than the buyer's total avoided variable cost;

        (v)  the cost of fossil and nuclear fuel recovered through all inter-system sales.

        (3) Sales (S) must be all kWh's sold, excluding inter-system sales. Where for any reason, billed system sales cannot be coordinated with fuel costs for the billing period, sales may be equated to the sum of: (i) Generation, (ii) purchases, (iii) exchange received, less (iv) energy associated with pumped storage operations, less (v) inter-system sales referred to in paragraph (a)(2)(iv) of this section, less (vi) total system losses.

        (4) The adjustment factor developed according to this procedure shall be modified to properly allow for losses (estimated if necessary) associated only with wholesale sales for resale.

        (5) The adjustment factor developed according to this procedure may be further modified to allow the recovery of gross receipts and other similar revenue based tax charges occasioned by the fuel adjustment revenues.

        (6) The cost of fossil fuel shall include no items other than those listed in Account 151 of the Commission's Uniform System of Accounts for Public Utilities and Licensees. The cost of nuclear fuel shall be that as shown in Account 518, except that if Account 518 also contains any expense for fossil fuel which has already been included in the cost of fossil fuel, it shall be deducted from this account. (Paragraph C of Account 518 includes the cost of other fuels used for ancillary steam facilities.)

        (7) Where the cost of fuel includes fuel from company-owned or controlled   sources, that fact shall be noted and described as part of any filing. Where the utility purchases fuel from a company-owned or controlled source, the price of which is subject to the jurisdiction of a regulatory body, and where the price of such fuel has been approved by that regulatory body, such costs shall be presumed, subject to rebuttal, to be reasonable and includable in the adjustment clause. If the current price, however, is in litigation and is being collected subject to refund, the utility shall so advise the Commission and shall keep a separate account of such amounts paid which are subject to refund, and shall advise the Commission of the final disposition of such matter by the regulatory body having jurisdiction. With respect to the price of fuel purchases from company-owned or controlled sources pursuant to contracts which are not subject to regulatory authority, the utility company shall file such contracts and amendments thereto with the Commission for its acceptance at the time it files its fuel clause or modification thereof. Any subsequent amendment to such contracts shall likewise be filed with the Commission as a rate schedule change and may be subject to suspension under section 205 of the Federal Power Act. Fuel charges by affiliated companies which do not appear to be reasonable may result in the suspension of the fuel adjustment clause or cause an investigation thereof to be made by the Commission on its own motion under section 206 of the Federal Power Act.

        (8) All rate filings which contain a proposed new fuel clause or a change in an existing fuel clause shall conform such clauses with the regulations. Within one year of the effectiveness of this rulemaking, all public utilities with rate schedules that contain a fuel clause should conform such clauses with the regulations. Recognizing that individual public utilities may have special operating characteristics that may warrant granting temporary delays in the implementation of the regulations, the Commission may, upon showing of good cause, waive the requirements of this section of the regulations for an additional one-year period so as to permit the public utilities sufficient time to adjust to the requirements.

        (9) All rate filings containing a proposed new fuel clause or change in an existing fuel clause shall include:

        (i) A description of the fuel clause with detailed cost support for the base cost of fuel and purchased economic power or energy.

        (ii) Full cost of service data unless the utility has had the rate approved by the Commission within a year, provided that such cost of service may not be required when an existing fuel cost adjustment clause is being modified to conform to the Commission's regulations.

        (10) Whenever particular circumstances prevent the use of the standards provided for herein, or the use thereof would result in an undue burden, the Commission may, upon application under § 385.207 of this chapter and for good cause shown, permit deviation from these regulations.

        (11) For the purpose of paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section, the following definitions apply:

        (i)  is power or energy purchased over a period of twelve months or less where the total cost of the purchase is less than the buyer's total avoided variable cost.

        (ii)  is all charges incurred in buying economic power and having such power delivered to the buyer's system. The total cost includes, but is not limited to, capacity or reservation charges, energy charges, adders, and any transmission or wheeling charges associated with the purchase.

        (iii)  is all identified and documented variable costs that would have been incurred by the buyer had a particular purchase not been made. Such costs include, but are not limited to, those associated with fuel, start-up, shut-down or any purchases that would have been made in lieu of the purchase made.

        (12) For the purpose of paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section, the following procedures and instructions apply:

        (i) A utility proposing to include purchase charges other than those for fuel or energy in fuel and purchased economic power costs ( under paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section shall amend its fuel cost adjustment clause so that it is consistent with paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2)(iii) of this section. Such amendment shall state the system reserve capacity criteria by which the system operator decides whether a reliability purchase is required. Where the utility filing the statement is required by a State or local regulatory body (including a plant site licensing board) to file a capacity criteria statement with that body, the system reserve capacity criteria in the statement filed with the Commission shall be identical to those contained in the statement filed with the State or local regulatory body. Any utility that changes its reserve capacity criteria shall, within 45 days of such change, file an amended fuel cost and purchased economic power adjustment clause to incorporate the new criteria.

        (ii) Reserve capacity shall be deemed adequate if, at the time a purchase was initiated, the buyer's system reserve capacity criteria were projected to be satisfied for the duration of the purchase without the purchase at issue.

        (iii) The total cost of the purchase must be projected to be less than total avoided variable cost, at the time a purchase was initiated, before any non-fuel purchase charge may be included in

        (iv) The purchasing utility shall **m**ake a credit to  after a purchase terminates if the total cost of the purchase exceeds the total avoided variable cost. The amount of the credit shall be the difference between the total cost of the purchase and the total avoided variable cost. This credit shall be made in the first adjustment period after the end of the purchase. If a utility fails to make the credit in the first adjustment period after the end of the purchase, it shall, when making the credit, also include in  interest on the amount of the credit. Interest shall be calculated at the rate required by § 35.19a(a)(2)(iii) of this chapter, and shall accrue from the date the credit should have been made under this paragraph until the date the credit is made.

        (v) If a purchase is made of more capacity than is needed to satisfy the buyer's system reserve capacity criteria because the total costs of the extra capacity and associated energy are less than the buyer's total avoided variable costs for the duration of the purchase, the charges associated with the non-reliability portion of the purchase may be included in

        § 35.15   Notices of cancellation or termination.

#### § § 35.15

        (a)  When a rate schedule, tariff or service agreement or part thereof required to be on file with the Commission is proposed to be cancelled or is to terminate by its own terms and no new rate schedule, tariff or service agreement or part thereof is to be filed in its place, a filing must be made to cancel such rate schedule, tariff or service agreement or part thereof at least sixty days but not more than one hundred-twenty days prior to the date such cancellation or termination is proposed to take effect. A copy of such notice to the Commission shall be duly posted. With such notice, each filing party shall submit a statement giving the reasons for the proposed cancellation or termination, and a list of the affected purchasers to whom the notice has been provided. For good cause shown, the Commission may by order provide that the notice of cancellation or termination shall be effective as of a date prior to the date of filing or prior to the date the filing would become effective in accordance with these rules.

        (b)  (1) The provisions of paragraph (a) of this section shall apply to all contracts for unbundled transmission service and all power sale contracts:

        (i) Executed prior to July 9, 1996; or

        (ii) If unexecuted, filed with the Commission prior to July 9, 1996.

        (2) Any power sales contract executed on or after July 9, 1996 that is to terminate by its own terms shall not be subject to the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section.

        (c)  Any public utility providing jurisdictional services under a power sales contract that is not subject to the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section shall notify the Commission of the date of the termination of such contract within 30 days after such termination takes place.

        § 35.17   Withdrawals and amendments of rate schedule, tariff or service agreement filings.

#### § § 35.17

        (a)  (1) A public utility may withdraw in its entirety a rate schedule, tariff or service agreement filing that has not become effective and upon which no Commission or delegated order has been issued by filing a withdrawal motion with the Commission. Upon the filing of such motion, the proposed rate schedule, tariff or service agreement sections will not become effective under section 205(d) of the Federal Power Act in the absence of Commission action making the rate schedule, tariff or service agreement filing effective.

        (2) The withdrawal motion will become effective, and the rate schedule, tariff or service agreement filing will be deemed withdrawn, at the end of 15 days from the date of filing of the withdrawal motion, if no answer in opposition to the withdrawal motion is filed within that period and if no order disallowing the withdrawal is issued within that period. If an answer in opposition is filed within the 15 day period, the withdrawal is not effective until an order accepting the withdrawal is issued.

        (b)  A public utility may file to amend or modify, and may file a settlement that would amend or modify, a rate schedule, tariff or service agreement section contained in a rate schedule, tariff or service agreement filing that has not become effective and upon which no Commission or delegated order has yet been issued. Such filing will toll the notice period in section 205(d) of the Federal Power Act for the original filing, and establish a new date on which the entire filing will become effective, in the absence of Commission action, no earlier than 61 days from the date of the filing of the amendment or modification.

        (c)  Where a rate schedule, tariff, or service agreement, or part thereof has been suspended by the Commission, it may be withdrawn during the period of suspension only by special permission of the Commission granted upon application therefor and for good cause shown. If permitted to be withdrawn, any such rate schedule, tariff, or service agreement may be refiled with the Commission within a one-year period thereafter only with special permission of the Commission for good cause shown.

        (d)  A public utility may not, within the period of suspension, file any change in a rate schedule, tariff, or service agreement, or part thereof, which has been suspended by order of the Commission except by special permission of the Commission granted upon application therefor and for good cause shown.

        (e)  A public utility may not, within the period of suspension, file any change in a rate schedule or tariff or part thereof continued in effect by operation of an order of suspension and which was proposed to be changed by the suspended filing, except by special permission of the Commission granted upon application therefor and for good cause shown.

        § 35.18   Asset retirement obligations.

#### § § 35.18

        (a) A public utility that files a rate schedule, tariff or service agreement under § 35.12 or § 35.13 and has recorded an asset retirement obligation on its books must provide a schedule, as part of the supporting work papers, identifying all cost components related to the asset retirement obligations that are included in the book balances of all accounts reflected in the cost of service computation supporting the proposed rates. However, all cost components related to asset retirement obligations that would impact the calculation of rate base, such as electric plant and related accumulated depreciation and accumulated deferred income taxes, may not be reflected in rates and must be removed from the rate base calculation through a single adjustment.

        (b) A public utility seeking to recover nonrate base costs related to asset retirement costs in rates must provide, with its filing under § 35.12 or § 35.13, a detailed study supporting the amounts proposed to be collected in rates.

        (c) A public utility that has recorded asset retirement obligations on its books, but is not seeking recovery of the asset retirement costs in rates, must remove all asset-retirement-obligations-related cost components from the cost of service supporting its proposed rates.

        § 35.23   General provisions.

#### § § 35.23

        (a)  This subpart applies to any wholesale sale of electric energy in a coordination transaction by a public utility if that sale requires the use of an emissions allowance.

        (b)  (1) If a public utility has a coordination rate schedule on file that expressly provides for the recovery of all incremental or out-of-pocket costs, such utility may make an abbreviated rate filing detailing how it will recover emissions allowance costs. Such filing must include the following: the index or combination of indices to be used; the method by which the emission allowance amounts will be calculated; timing procedures; how inconsistencies, if any, with dispatch criteria will be reconciled; and how any other rate impacts will be addressed. In addition, a utility making an abbreviated filing must:

        (i) Clearly identify the filing as being limited to an amendment to a coordination rate to reflect the cost of emissions allowances, in the first paragraph of the letter of transmittal accompanying the filing;

        (ii) Submit the revisions in accordance with § 35.7; and

        (iii) Identify each rate schedule to which the amendment applies.

        (2) The abbreviated filing must apply consistent treatment to all coordination rate schedules. If the filing does not apply consistent rate treatment, the public utility must explain why it does not do so.

        (3) If a public utility wants to charge incremental costs for emissions allowances, but its rate schedule on file with the Commission does not provide for the recovery of all incremental costs, the selling public utility may submit an abbreviated filing if all customers agree to the rate change. If customers do not agree, the selling public utility must tender its emissions allowance proposal in a separate section 205 rate filing, fully justifying its proposal.

        § 35.24   Tax normalization for public utilities.

#### § § 35.24

        (a)  (1) Except as provided in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph, this section applies, with respect to rate schedules filed under §§ 35.12 and 35.13 of this part, to the ratemaking treatment of the tax effects of all transactions for which there are timing differences.

        (2) This section does not apply to the following timing differences:

        (i) Differences that result from the use of accelerated depreciation;

        (ii) Differences that result from the use of Class Life Asset Depreciation Range (ADR) provisions of the Internal Revenue Code;

        (iii) Differences that result from the use of accelerated amortization provisions on certified defense and pollution control facilities;

        (iv) Differences that arise from recognition of extraordinary property losses as a current expense for tax purposes but as a deferred and amortized expense for book purposes;

        (v) Differences that arise from recognition of research, development, and demonstration expenditures as a current expense for tax purposes but as a deferred and amortized expense for book purposes;

        (vi) Differences that result from different tax and book reporting of deferred gains or losses from disposition of utility plant;

        (vii) Differences that result from the use of the Asset Guideline Class “Repair Allowance” provision of the Internal Revenue Code;

        (viii) Differences that result from recognition of purchased gas costs as a current expense for tax purposes but as a deferred expense for book purposes.

        (b) —(1)  (i) A public utility must compute the income tax component of its cost of service by using tax normalization for all transactions to which this section applies.

        (ii) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, application of tax normalization by a public utility under this section to compute the income tax component will not be subject to case-by-case adjudication.

        (2)  (i) The rate base of a public utility using tax normalization under this section must be reduced by the balances that are properly recordable in Account 281, “Accumulated deferred income taxes-accelerated amortization property;” Account 282, “Accumulated deferred income taxes—other property;” and Account 283, “Accumulated deferred income taxes—other.” Balances that are properly recordable in Account 190, “Accumulated deferred income taxes,” must be treated as an addition to rate base.

        (ii) Such rate base reductions or additions must be limited to deferred taxes related to rate base, construction or other jurisdictional activities.

        (iii) If a public utility uses an approved purchased gas adjustment clause or a research, development and demonstration tracking clause, the rate base reductions or additions required under this subparagraph must apply only to the extent that the balances in Account 190 and Accounts 281 through 283 are not used, for purposes of calculating carrying charges, as an offset to balances properly recordable in Account 188, “Research development and demonstration expenditures,” or Account 191, “Unrecovered purchased gas costs.”

        (c)  (1) This paragraph applies:

        (i) If the public utility has not provided deferred taxes in the same amount that would have accrued had tax normalization been applied for the tax effects of timing difference transactions originating at any time prior to the test period; or

        (ii) If, as a result of changes in tax rates, the accumulated provision for deferred taxes becomes deficient in or in excess of amounts necessary to meet future tax liabilities as determined by application of the current tax rate to all timing difference transactions originating in the test period and prior to the test period.

        (2) The public utility must compute the income tax component in its cost of service by making provision for any excess or deficiency in deferred taxes described in subparagraphs (1)(i) or (1)(ii) of this paragraph.

        (3) The public utility must apply a Commission-approved ratemaking method made specifically applicable to the public utility for determining the cost of service provision described in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph. If no Commission-approved ratemaking method has been made specifically applicable to the public utility, then the public utility must use some ratemaking method for making such provision, and the appropriateness of this method will be subject to case-by-case determination.

        (d)  For purposes of this section, the term:

        (1)  means computing the income tax component as if the amounts of timing difference transactions recognized in each period for ratemaking purposes were also recognized in the same amount in each such period for income tax purposes.

        (2)  means differences between amounts of expenses or revenues recognized for income tax purposes and amounts of expenses or revenues recognized for ratemaking purposes, which differences arise in one time period and reverse in one or more other time periods so that the total amounts of expenses or revenues recognized for income tax purposes and for ratemaking purposes are equal.

        (3)  means a ratemaking method approved by the Commission in a final decision including approval of a settlement agreement containing a ratemaking method only if such settlement agreement applies that method beyond the effective term of the settlement agreement.

        (4)  means for the purpose of computing income tax under the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code or the income tax provisions of the laws of a State or political subdivision of a State (including franchise taxes).

        (5)  means that part of the cost of service that covers income tax expenses allowable by the Commission.

        (6)  means for the purpose of fixing, modifying, approving, disapproving or rejecting rates under the Federal Power Act or the Natural Gas Act.

        (7)  means the tax reduction or addition associated with a specific expense or revenue transaction.

        (8)  means an activity or event that gives rise to an accounting entry that is used in determining revenues or expenses.

        § 35.25   Construction work in progress.

#### § § 35.25

        (a)  This section applies to any rate schedule filed under this part by any public utility as defined in subsection 201(e) of the Federal Power Act.

        (b)  For purposes of this section:

        (1)  or  means any expenditure for public utility plant in process of construction that is properly included in Accounts 107 (construction work in progress) and 120.1 (nuclear fuel in process of refinement, conversion, enrichment, and fabrication) of part 101 of this chapter, the Uniform System of Accounts Prescribed for Public Utilities and Licensees Subject to the Provisions of the Federal Power Act (Major and Nonmajor), that would otherwise be eligible for allowance for funds used during construction (AFUDC) treatment.

        (2)  means a situation which may arise when a wholesale electric rate customer embarks upon its own or participates in a construction program to supply itself with all or a portion of its future power needs, thereby reducing its future dependence on the CWIP of the rate applicant, but is simultaneously forced to pay to the CWIP public utility rate applicant the CWIP portion of the wholesale rates that reflects existing levels of service or a different anticipated service level.

        (3)  means any addition to public utility plant that enables a natural gas-burning plant to convert to the use of other fuels, or that enables an oil-burning plant to convert to the use of other fuels, other than natural gas. Such facilities include those that alter internal plant workings, such as oil or coal burners, soot blowers, bottom ash removal systems and concomitant air pollution control facilities, and any facility needed for receiving and storing the fuel to which the plant is being converted, which facility would not be necessary if the plant continued to burn gas or oil.

        (4)  means an identifiable structure or portions of a structure that is designed to reduce the amount of pollution produced by the power plant, but does not include any facility that reduces pollution by substituting a different method of generation or that generates the additional power necessitated by the operation of a pollution control facility.

        (c)  For purposes of any initial rate schedule or any rate schedule change filed under § 35.12 or § 35.13 of this part, a public utility may include in its rate base any costs of construction work in progress (CWIP), including allowance for funds used during construction (AFUDC), as provided in this section.

        (1) —(i)  Any CWIP for pollution control facilities allocable to electric power sales for resale may be included in the rate base of the public utility.

        (ii)  In determining whether a facility is a pollution control facility for purposes of this section, the Commission will consider:

        (A) Whether such facility is the type facility described in the Internal Revenue Service laws, 26 U.S.C. 169(d)(1), as follows:

        (B) Whether such facility has been certified by a local, state, or federal agency as being in conformity with, or required by, a program of pollution control;

        (C) Other evidence showing that such facilities are for pollution control.

        (2)  Any CWIP for fuel conversion facilities allocable to electric power sales for resale may be included in the rate base of the public utility.

        (3)  No more than 50 percent of any CWIP allocable to electric power sales for resale not otherwise included in rate base under paragraphs (c) (1) and (2) of this section, may be included in the rate base of the public utility.

        (4)  Every test period CWIP project requested for wholesale rate base treatment pursuant to § 35.26(c)(1), (2), and (3) of this part will be allocated to the customer classes on the basis of forward looking allocation ratios reflecting the anticipated average annual use the wholesale customers will make of the system over the estimated service life of the project. Supporting documentation, as required by §§ 35.12 and 35.13 of this part, must be in sufficient detail to permit examination and verification of the forward looking allocation ratio's recognition of each wholesale customer's plans, if any, for future alternative or supplementary power supplies. For the purpose of preventing anticompetitive effects, including CWIP-induced price squeeze and double whammy, sufficient recognition of such plans may require the public utility applicant to provide for separate customer groups or provide for a rate design incorporating selected CWIP project credits.

        (d)  If a public utility proposes in its filed rates to include CWIP in rate base under this section, that portion of the rate related to CWIP is collectible at the time the general rates become effective pursuant to Commission order, whether or not subject to refund, except as provided in paragraph (g) of this section.

        (e)  On the date that any proposed rate that includes CWIP in rate base becomes effective, a public utility that has included CWIP in rate base must discontinue the capitalization of any AFUDC related to those amounts of CWIP is rate base.

        (f)  When a public utility files to include CWIP in its rate base pursuant to this section, it must propose accounting procedures in that rate schedule filing that:

        (1) Ensure that wholesale customers will not be charged for both capitalized AFUDC and corresponding amounts of CWIP proposed to be included in rate base; and

        (2) Ensure that wholesale customers will not be charged for any corresponding AFUDC capitalized as a result of different accounting or ratemaking treatments accorded CWIP by state or local regulatory authorities.

        (g) —(1)  In order to facilitate Commission review of the anticompetitive effects of applications for CWIP pursuant to § 35.26(c)(3), a public utility applying for rates based upon inclusion of such CWIP in rate base must include the following information in its filing:

        (i) The percentage of the proposed increase in the jurisdictional rate level attributable to non-pollution control/fuel conversion CWIP and the percentage of non-pollution control/fuel conversion CWIP supporting the proposed rate level;

        (ii) The percentage of non-pollution control/fuel conversion CWIP permitted by the state or local commission supporting the current retail rates of the public utility against which the relevant wholesale customers compete; and

        (iii) Individual earned rate of return analyses of each of the competing retail rates developed on a basis fully consistent with the wholesale cost of service for the same test period if the requested percentage of wholesale non-pollution control/fuel conversion CWIP exceeds that permitted by the relevant state or local authority to support the currently competing retail rates.

        (2)  (i) If an intervenor in its initial pleading alleges that a price squeeze will occur as a direct result of the public utility's request for CWIP pursuant to § 35.26(c)(3), makes a showing that it is likely to incur harm if such CWIP is allowed subject to refund, and makes a showing of how the harm to the intervenor would be mitigated or eliminated by the types of preliminary relief requested, the Commission will consider preliminary relief at the suspension stage of the case pursuant to paragraph (g)(4) of this section. In determining whether to grant preliminary relief, the Commission will balance the following public interest considerations:

        (A) The harm to the intervenor if it is not granted preliminary relief from the requested CWIP;

        (B) The harm to the public utility if, during the interim period of preliminary relief, the public utility is required to recover its financing charges later through AFUDC rather than immediately through CWIP; and

        (C) Mitigating bias against investment in new plants, ensuring accurate price signals, and fostering rate stability.

        (ii) Whether or not preliminary relief is granted at the suspension stage will not preclude consideration of further interim or final remedies later in the proceedings, if warranted.

        (3) If the Commission makes a final determination that a price squeeze due solely to allowance of a lower percentage of non-pollution control/fuel conversion CWIP in the public utility's retail rate base than allowed by this Commission, the Commission will consider an adjustment to non-pollution control/fuel conversion CWIP in order to eliminate or mitigate the price squeeze.

        (4) If an intervenor meets the requirements of paragraph (g)(2) of this section, the Commission, depending on the type of showing made including the likelihood, immediacy, and severity of any anticompetitive harm, may:

        (i) Suspend the entire rate increase or all or a portion of the non-pollution control/fuel conversion CWIP component for up to five months;

        (ii) Allow all or a portion of the non-pollution control/fuel conversion CWIP only prospectively from the issuance of the Commission's final order on rehearing on the matter; or

        (iii) Take such other action as is proper under the circumstances.

        § 35.26   Recovery of stranded costs by public utilities and transmitting utilities.

#### § § 35.26

        (a)  This section establishes the standards that a public utility or transmitting utility must satisfy in order to recover stranded costs.

        (b)  (1)  means any legitimate, prudent and verifiable cost incurred by a public utility or a transmitting utility to provide service to:

        (i) A wholesale requirements customer that subsequently becomes, in whole or in part, an unbundled wholesale transmission services customer of such public utility or transmitting utility; or

        (ii) A retail customer that subsequently becomes, either directly or through another wholesale transmission purchaser, an unbundled wholesale transmission services customer of such public utility or transmitting utility.

        (2)  means a customer for whom a public utility or transmitting utility provides by contract any portion of its bundled wholesale power requirements.

        (3)  means the transmission of electric energy sold, or to be sold, at wholesale in interstate commerce or ordered pursuant to section 211 of the Federal Power Act (FPA).

        (4)  means a contract under which a public utility or transmitting utility provides any portion of a customer's bundled wholesale power requirements.

        (5)  means any legitimate, prudent and verifiable cost incurred by a public utility to provide service to a retail customer that subsequently becomes, in whole or in part, an unbundled retail transmission services customer of that public utility.

        (6)  means the transmission of electric energy sold, or to be sold, in interstate commerce directly to a retail customer.

        (7)  means any  contract executed after July 11, 1994, or extended or renegotiated to be effective after July 11, 1994.

        (8)  contract means any  contract executed on or before July 11, 1994.

        (c) —(1)  A public utility or transmitting utility will be allowed to seek recovery of wholesale stranded costs only as follows:

        (i) No public utility or transmitting utility may seek recovery of wholesale stranded costs if such recovery is explicitly prohibited by a contract or settlement agreement, or by any power sales or transmission rate schedule or tariff.

        (ii) No public utility or transmitting utility may seek recovery of stranded costs associated with a new wholesale requirements contract if such contract does not contain an exit fee or other explicit stranded cost provision.

        (iii) If wholesale stranded costs are associated with a new wholesale requirements contract containing an exit fee or other explicit stranded cost provision, and the seller under the contract is a public utility, the public utility may seek recovery of such costs, in accordance with the contract, through rates for electric energy under sections 205-206 of the FPA. The public utility may not seek recovery of such costs through any transmission rate for FPA section 205 or 211 transmission services.

        (iv) If wholesale stranded costs are associated with a new wholesale requirements contract, and the seller under the contract is a transmitting utility but not also a public utility, the transmitting utility may not seek an order from the Commission allowing recovery of such costs.

        (v) If wholesale stranded costs are associated with an existing wholesale requirements contract, if the seller under such contract is a public utility, and if the contract does not contain an exit fee or other explicit stranded cost provision, the public utility may seek recovery of stranded costs only as follows:

        (A) If either party to the contract seeks a stranded cost amendment pursuant to a section 205 or section 206 filing under the FPA made prior to the expiration of the contract, and the Commission accepts or approves an amendment permitting recovery of stranded costs, the public utility may seek recovery of such costs through FPA section 205-206 rates for electric energy.

        (B) If the contract is not amended to permit recovery of stranded costs as described in paragraph (c)(1)(v)(A) of this section, the public utility may file a proposal, prior to the expiration of the contract, to recover stranded costs through FPA section 205-206 or section 211-212 rates for wholesale transmission services to the customer.

        (vi) If wholesale stranded costs are associated with an existing wholesale requirements contract, if the seller under such contract is a transmitting utility but not also a public utility, and if the contract does not contain an exit fee or other explicit stranded cost provision, the transmitting utility may seek recovery of stranded costs through FPA section 211-212 transmission rates.

        (vii) If a retail customer becomes a legitimate wholesale transmission customer of a public utility or transmitting utility,  through municipalization, and costs are stranded as a result of the retail-turned-wholesale customer's access to wholesale transmission, the utility may seek recovery of such costs through FPA section 205-206 or section 211-212 rates for wholesale transmission services to that customer.

        (2)  A public utility or transmitting utility seeking to recover wholesale stranded costs in accordance with paragraphs (c)(1) (v) through (vii) of this section must demonstrate that:

        (i) It incurred costs to provide service to a wholesale requirements customer or retail customer based on a reasonable expectation that the utility would continue to serve the customer;

        (ii) The stranded costs are not more than the customer would have contributed to the utility had the customer remained a wholesale requirements customer of the utility, or, in the case of a retail-turned-wholesale customer, had the customer remained a retail customer of the utility; and

        (iii) The stranded costs are derived using the following formula: Stranded Cost Obligation = (Revenue Stream Estimate—Competitive Market Value Estimate) × Length of Obligation (reasonable expectation period).

        (3)  If a public utility or transmitting utility seeks recovery of wholesale stranded costs associated with an existing wholesale requirements contract, as permitted in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, and the existing wholesale requirements contract contains a notice provision, there will be a rebuttable presumption that the utility had no reasonable expectation of continuing to serve the customer beyond the term of the notice provision.

        (4)  A customer under an existing wholesale requirements contract with a public utility seller may obtain from the seller an estimate of the customer's stranded cost obligation if it were to leave the public utility's generation supply system by filing with the public utility a request for an estimate at any time prior to the termination date specified in its contract.

        (i) The public utility must provide a response within 30 days of receiving the request. The response must include:

        (A) An estimate of the customer's stranded cost obligation based on the formula in paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section;

        (B) Supporting detail indicating how each element in the formula was derived;

        (C) A detailed rationale justifying the basis for the utility's reasonable expectation of continuing to serve the customer beyond the termination date in the contract;

        (D) An estimate of the amount of released capacity and associated energy that would result from the customer's departure; and

        (E) The utility's proposal for any contract amendment needed to implement the customer's payment of stranded costs.

        (ii) If the customer disagrees with the utility's response, it must respond to the utility within 30 days explaining why it disagrees. If the parties cannot work out a mutually agreeable resolution, they may exercise their rights to Commission resolution under the FPA.

        (5) A customer must be given the option to market or broker a portion or all of the capacity and energy associated with any stranded costs claimed by the public utility.

        (i) To exercise the option, the customer must so notify the utility in writing no later than 30 days after the public utility files its estimate of stranded costs for the customer with the Commission.

        (A) Before marketing or brokering can begin, the utility and customer must execute an agreement identifying, at a minimum, the amount and the price of capacity and associated energy the customer is entitled to schedule, and the duration of the customer's marketing or brokering of such capacity and energy.

        (ii) If agreement over marketing or brokering cannot be reached, and the parties seek Commission resolution of disputed issues, upon issuance of a Commission order resolving the disputed issues, the customer may reevaluate its decision in paragraph (c)(5)(i) of this section to exercise the marketing or brokering option. The customer must notify the utility in writing within 30 days of issuance of the Commission's order resolving the disputed issues whether the customer will market or broker a portion or all of the capacity and energy associated with stranded costs allowed by the Commission.

        (iii) If a customer undertakes the brokering option, and the customer's brokering efforts fail to produce a buyer within 60 days of the date of the brokering agreement entered into between the customer and the utility, the customer shall relinquish all rights to broker the released capacity and associated energy and will pay stranded costs as determined by the formula in paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section.

        (d) —(1)  A public utility may seek to recover retail stranded costs through rates for retail transmission services only if the state regulatory authority does not have authority under state law to address stranded costs at the time the retail wheeling is required.

        (2)  A public utility seeking to recover retail stranded costs in accordance with paragraph (d)(1) of this section must demonstrate that:

        (i) It incurred costs to provide service to a retail customer that obtains retail wheeling based on a reasonable expectation that the utility would continue to serve the customer; and

        (ii) The stranded costs are not more than the customer would have contributed to the utility had the customer remained a retail customer of the utility.

        (2)  means a contract, or service schedule thereunder, that provides for trading of electric energy on an “if, as and when available” basis, but does not require either the seller or the buyer to engage in a particular transaction.

        (3)  means any non-requirements service agreement, except an economy energy coordination agreement as defined in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.

        (4)  means a reduction in the consumption of electric energy by customers from their expected consumption in response to an increase in the price of electric energy or to incentive payments designed to induce lower consumption of electric energy.

        (5)  means a resource capable of providing demand response.

        (6)  means a period when the amount of available supply falls short of demand plus the operating reserve requirement.

        (7)  means the person or entity responsible for carrying out the market monitoring functions that the Commission has ordered Commission-approved independent system operators and regional transmission organizations to perform.

        (13)  means a transmission line rating that reflects operation for a specified, finite period, rather than reflecting continuous operation. An emergency rating may assume an acceptable loss of equipment life or other physical or safety limitations for the equipment involved.

        (14)  means a transmission line rating that applies to a time period of not greater than one hour and reflects up-to-date forecasts of inputs such as (but not limited to) ambient air temperature, wind, solar heating intensity, transmission line tension, or transmission line sag.

        (15)  (EMS) means a computer control system used by electric utility dispatchers to monitor the real-time performance of the various elements of an electric system and to dispatch, schedule, and/or control generation and transmission facilities.

        (16)  (SCADA) means a computer system that allows an electric system operator to remotely monitor and control elements of an electric system.

        (c)  (1) Every public utility that owns, controls, or operates facilities used for the transmission of electric energy in interstate commerce must have on file with the Commission an open access transmission tariff of general applicability for transmission services, including ancillary services, over such facilities. Such tariff must be the  tariff promulgated by the Commission, as amended from time to time, or such other tariff as may be approved by the Commission consistent with the principles set forth in Commission rulemaking proceedings promulgating and amending the  tariff.

        (i) Subject to the exceptions in paragraphs (c)(1)(ii), (c)(1)(iii), (c)(1)(iv), and (c)(1)(v) of this section, the open access transmission tariff, which tariff must be the  tariff required by Commission rulemaking proceedings promulgating and amending the  tariff, and accompanying rates must be filed no later than 60 days prior to the date on which a public utility would engage in a sale of electric energy at wholesale in interstate commerce or in the transmission of electric energy in interstate commerce.

        (i) For any power pool, public utility holding company or other multi-lateral arrangement or agreement that contains transmission rates, terms or conditions and that is executed after October 11, 2011, this requirement is effective on the date that transactions begin under the arrangement or agreement.

        (ii) For any power pool, public utility holding company or other multi-lateral arrangement or agreement that contains transmission rates, terms or conditions and that is executed on or before May 14, 2007, a public utility member of such power pool, public utility holding company or other multi-lateral arrangement or agreement that owns, controls, or operates facilities used for the transmission of electric energy in interstate commerce must file the revisions to its joint pool-wide or system-wide open access transmission tariff required by Commission rulemaking proceedings promulgating and amending the  tariff pursuant to section 206 of the FPA and accompanying rates pursuant to section 205 of the FPA in accordance with the procedures set forth in Commission rulemaking proceedings promulgating and amending the  tariff.

        (iii) A public utility member of a power pool, public utility holding company or other multi-lateral arrangement or agreement that contains transmission rates, terms or conditions and that is executed on or before July 9, 1996 must take transmission service under a joint pool-wide or system-wide open access transmission tariff filed pursuant to this section for wholesale trades among the pool or system members.

        (4) Consistent with paragraph (c)(1) of this section, every Commission-approved ISO or RTO must have on file with the Commission an open access transmission tariff of general applicability for transmission services, including ancillary services, over such facilities. Such tariff must be the  tariff promulgated by the Commission, as amended from time to time, or such other tariff as may be approved by the Commission consistent with the principles set forth in Commission rulemaking proceedings promulgating and amending the  tariff.

        (i) Subject to paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section, a Commission-approved ISO or RTO must file the revisions to its open access transmission tariff required by Commission rulemaking proceedings promulgating and amending the  tariff pursuant to section 206 of the FPA and accompanying rates pursuant to section 205 of the FPA in accordance with the procedures set forth in Commission rulemaking proceedings promulgating and amending the  tariff.

        (ii) If a Commission-approved ISO or RTO can demonstrate that its existing open access transmission tariff is consistent with or superior to the  tariff promulgated by the Commission, as amended from time to time, the Commission-approved ISO or RTO may instead set forth such demonstration in its filing pursuant to section 206 in accordance with the procedures set forth in Commission rulemaking proceedings promulgating and amending the  tariff.

        (5) Any public utility that owns transmission facilities that are not under the public utility's control must, consistent with the pro forma tariff required by paragraph (c)(1) of this section, share with the public utility that controls such facilities (and its Market Monitoring Unit(s), if applicable):

        (i) Transmission line ratings for each period for which transmission line ratings are calculated for such facilities (with updated ratings shared each time ratings are calculated); and

        (ii) Written transmission line rating methodologies used to calculate the transmission line ratings for such facilities provided under subparagraph (i).

        (d)  (1) A public utility subject to the requirements of this section and 18 CFR parts 37 (Open Access Same-Time Information System) and 358 (Standards of Conduct for Transmission Providers) may file a request for waiver of all or part of such requirements for good cause shown. Except as provided in paragraph (f) of this section, an application for waiver must be filed no later than 60 days prior to the time the public utility would have to comply with the requirement.

        (2) The requirements of this section, 18 CFR parts 37 (Open Access Same-Time Information System) and 358 (Standards of Conduct for Transmission Providers) are waived for any public utility that is or becomes subject to such requirements solely because it owns, controls, or operates Interconnection Customer's Interconnection Facilities, in whole or in part, as that term is defined in the standard generator interconnection procedures and agreements referenced in paragraph (f) of this section, or comparable jurisdictional interconnection facilities that are the subject of interconnection agreements other than the standard generator interconnection procedures and agreements referenced in paragraph (f) of this section, if the entity that owns, operates, or controls such facilities either sells electric energy, or files a statement with the Commission that it commits to comply with and be bound by the obligations and procedures applicable to electric utilities under section 210 of the Federal Power Act.

        (i) The waivers referenced in this paragraph (d)(2) shall be deemed to be revoked as of the date the public utility ceases to satisfy the qualifications of this paragraph (d)(2), and may be revoked by the Commission if the Commission determines that it is in the public interest to do so. After revocation of its waivers, the public utility must comply with the requirements that had been waived within 60 days of revocation.

        (ii) Any eligible entity that seeks interconnection or transmission services with respect to the interconnection facilities for which a waiver is in effect pursuant to this paragraph (d)(2) may follow the procedures in sections 210, 211, and 212 of the Federal Power Act, 18 CFR 2.20, and 18 CFR part 36. In any proceeding pursuant to this paragraph (d)(2)(ii):

        (A) The Commission will consider it to be in the public interest to grant priority rights to the owner and/or operator of interconnection facilities specified in this paragraph (d)(2) to use capacity thereon when such owner and/or operator can demonstrate that it has specific plans with milestones to use such capacity to interconnect its or its affiliate's future generation projects.

        (B) For the first five years after the commercial operation date of the interconnection facilities specified in this paragraph (d)(2), the Commission will apply the rebuttable presumption that the owner and/or operator of such facilities has definitive plans to use the capacity thereon, and it is thus in the public interest to grant priority rights to the owner and/or operator of such facilities to use capacity thereon.

        (e)  (1) A non-public utility may submit an open access transmission tariff and a request for declaratory order that its voluntary transmission tariff meets the requirements of Commission rulemaking proceedings promulgating and amending the  tariff.

        (i) Any submittal and request for declaratory order submitted by a non-public utility will be provided an NJ (non-jurisdictional) docket designation.

        (ii) If the submittal is found to be an acceptable open access transmission tariff, an applicant in a Federal Power Act (FPA) section 211 or 211A proceeding against the non-public utility shall have the burden of proof to show why service under the open access transmission tariff is not sufficient and why a section 211 or 211A order should be granted.

        (2) A non-public utility may file a request for waiver of all or part of the reciprocity conditions contained in a public utility open access transmission tariff, for good cause shown. An application for waiver may be filed at any time.

        (f)  (1) Every public utility that is required to have on file a non-discriminatory open access transmission tariff under this section must amend such tariff by adding the standard interconnection procedures and agreement and the standard small generator interconnection procedures and agreement required by Commission rulemaking proceedings promulgating and amending such interconnection procedures and agreements, or such other interconnection procedures and agreements as may be required by Commission rulemaking proceedings promulgating and amending the standard interconnection procedures and agreement and the standard small generator interconnection procedures and agreement.

        (i) Any public utility that seeks a deviation from the standard interconnection procedures and agreement or the standard small generator interconnection procedures and agreement required by Commission rulemaking proceedings promulgating and amending such interconnection procedures and agreements, must demonstrate that the deviation is consistent with the principles set forth in Commission rulemaking proceedings promulgating and amending such interconnection procedures and agreements.

        (ii) Any public utility that conducts interconnection studies shall be liable for and eligible to appeal certain penalties under the interconnection procedures and agreements adopted by the Commission-approved independent system operator or regional transmission organization under paragraph (f)(1) of this section following that public utility's failure to complete an interconnection study by the appropriate deadline.

        (iii)-(iv) [Reserved]

        (2) The non-public utility procedures for tariff reciprocity compliance described in paragraph (e) of this section are applicable to the standard interconnection procedures and agreements.

        (3) A public utility subject to the requirements of this paragraph (f) may file a request for waiver of all or part of the requirements of this paragraph (f), for good cause shown.

        (g) (1) (i)  (A) Every Commission-approved independent system operator or regional transmission organization that operates organized markets based on competitive bidding for energy imbalance, spinning reserves,supplemental reserves, reactive power and voltage control, or regulation and frequency response ancillary services (or its functional equivalent in the Commission-approved independent system operator's or regional transmission organization's tariff) must accept bids from demand response resources in these markets for that product on a basis comparable to any other resources, if the demand response resource meets the necessary technical requirements under the tariff, and submits a bid under the Commission-approved independent system operator's or regional transmission organization's bidding rules at or below the market-clearing price, unless not permitted by the laws or regulations of the relevant electric retail regulatory authority.

        (B) Each Commission-approved independent system operator or regional transmission organization must allow providers of a demand response resource to specify the following in their bids:

        () A maximum duration in hours that the demand response resource may be dispatched;

        () A maximum number of times that the demand response resource may be dispatched during a day; and

        () A maximum amount of electric energy reduction that the demand response resource may be required to provide either daily or weekly.

        (ii)  A Commission-approved independent system operator or regional transmission organization with a tariff that contains a day-ahead and a real-time market may not assess charge to a purchaser of electric energy in its day-ahead market for purchasing less power in the real-time market during a real-time market period for which the Commission-approved independent system operator or regional transmission organization declares an operating reserve shortage or makes a generic request to reduce load to avoid an operating reserve shortage.

        (iii)  Each Commission-approved independent system operator and regional transmission organization must accept bids from an aggregator of retail customers that aggregates the demand response of the customers of utilities that distributed more than 4 million megawatt-hours in the previous fiscal year, and the customers of utilities that distributed 4 million megawatt-hours or less in the previous fiscal year, where the relevant electric retail regulatory authority permits such customers' demand response to be bid into organized markets by an aggregator of retail customers. An independent system operator or regional transmission organization must not accept bids from an aggregator of retail customers that aggregates the demand response of the customers of utilities that distributed more than 4 million megawatt-hours in the previous fiscal year, where the relevant electric retail regulatory authority prohibits such customers' demand response to be bid into organized markets by an aggregator of retail customers, or the customers of utilities that distributed 4 million megawatt-hours or less in the previous fiscal year, unless the relevant electric retail regulatory authority permits such customers' demand response to be bid into organized markets by an aggregator of retail customers.

        (iv)  (A) Each Commission-approved independent system operator and regional transmission organization must modify its market rules to allow the market-clearing price during periods of operating reserve shortage to reach a level that rebalances supply and demand so as to maintain reliability while providing sufficient provisions for mitigating market power. Each Commission-approved independent system operator and regional transmission organization must trigger shortage pricing for any interval in which a shortage of energy or operating reserves is indicated during the pricing of resources for that interval.

        (B) A Commission-approved independent system operator or regional transmission organization may phase in this modification of its market rules.

        (v)  Each Commission-approved independent system operator or regional transmission organization that has a tariff provision permitting demand response resources to participate as a resource in the energy market by reducing consumption of electric energy from their expected levels in response to price signals must:

        (A) Pay to those demand response resources the market price for energy for these reductions when these demand response resources have the capability to balance supply and demand and when payment of the market price for energy to these resources is cost-effective as determined by a net benefits test accepted by the Commission;

        (B) Allocate the costs associated with demand response compensation proportionally to all entities that purchase from the relevant energy market in the area(s) where the demand response reduces the market price for energy at the time when the demand response resource is committed or dispatched.

        (vi)  Each Commission-approved independent system operator and regional transmission organization must settle energy transactions in its real-time markets at the same time interval it dispatches energy, must settle operating reserves transactions in its real-time markets at the same time interval it prices operating reserves, and must settle intertie transactions at the same time interval it schedules intertie transactions.

        (2)  Each Commission-approved independent system operator or regional transmission organization must provide a portion of its Web site for market participants to post offers to buy or sell power on a long-term basis.

        (3)  (i) Each Commission-approved independent system operator or regional transmission organization must modify its tariff provisions governing its Market Monitoring Unit to reflect the directives provided in Order No. 719, including the following:

        (A) Each Commission-approved independent system operator or regional transmission organization must include in its tariff a provision to provide its Market Monitoring Unit access to Commission-approved independent system operator and regional transmission organization market data, resources and personnel to enable the MarketMonitoring Unit to carry out its functions.

        (B) The tariff provision must provide the Market Monitoring Unit complete access to the Commission-approved independent system operator's and regional transmission organization's databases of market information.

        (C) The tariff provision must provide that any data created by the Market Monitoring Unit, including, but not limited to, reconfiguring of the Commission-approved independent system operator's and regional transmission organization's data, will be kept within the exclusive control of the Market Monitoring Unit.

        (D) The Market Monitoring Unit must report to the Commission-approved independent system operator's or regional transmission organization's board of directors, with its management members removed, or to an independent committee of the Commission-approved independent system operator's or regional transmission organization's board of directors. A Commission-approved independent system operator or regional transmission organization that has both an internal Market Monitoring Unit and an external Market Monitoring Unit may permit the internal Market Monitoring Unit to report to management and the external Market Monitoring Unit to report to the Commission-approved independent system operator's or regional transmission organization's board of directors with its management members removed, or to an independent committee of the Commission-approved independent system operator or regional transmission organization board of directors. If the internal market monitor is responsible for carrying out any or all of the core Market Monitoring Unit functions identified in paragraph (g)(3)(ii) of this section, the internal market monitor must report to the independent system operator's or regional transmission organization's board of directors.

        (E) A Commission-approved independent system operator or regional transmission organization may not alter the reports generated by the Market Monitoring Unit, or dictate the conclusions reached by the Market Monitoring Unit.

        (F) Each Commission-approved independent system operator or regional transmission organization must consolidate the core Market Monitoring Unit provisions into one section of its tariff. Each independent system operator or regional transmission organization must include a mission statement in the introduction to the Market Monitoring Unit provisions that identifies the Market Monitoring Unit's goals, including the protection of consumers and market participants by the identification and reporting of market design flaws and market power abuses.

        (ii)  The Market Monitoring Unit must perform the following core functions:

        (A) Evaluate existing and proposed market rules, tariff provisions and market design elements and recommend proposed rule and tariff changes to the Commission-approved independent system operator or regional transmission organization, to the Commission's Office of Energy Market Regulation staff and to other interested entities such as state commissions and market participants, provided that:

        () The Market Monitoring Unit is not to effectuate its proposed market design itself, and

        () The Market Monitoring Unit must limit distribution of its identifications and recommendations to the independent system operator or regional transmission organization and to Commission staff in the event it believes broader dissemination could lead to exploitation, with an explanation of why further dissemination should be avoided at that time.

        (B) Review and report on the performance of the wholesale markets to the Commission-approved independent system operator or regional transmission organization, the Commission, and other interested entities such as state commissions and market participants, on at least a quarterly basis and submit a more comprehensive annual state of the market report. The Market Monitoring Unit may issue additional reports as necessary.

        (C) Identify and notify the Commission's Office of Enforcement staff of instances in which a market participant's or the Commission-approved independent system operator's or regional transmission organization's behavior may require investigation, including, but not limited to, suspected Market Violations.

        (iii)  (A) A Commission-approved independent system operator or regional transmission organization may not permit its Market Monitoring Unit, whether internal or external, to participate in the administration of the Commission-approved independent system operator's or regional transmission organization's tariff or, except as provided in paragraph (g)(3)(iii)(D) of this section, to conduct prospective mitigation.

        (B) A Commission-approved independent system operator or regional transmission organization may permit its Market Monitoring Unit to provide the inputs required for the Commission-approved independent system operator or regional transmission organization to conduct prospective mitigation, including, but not limited to, reference levels, identification of system constraints, and cost calculations.

        (C) A Commission-approved independent system operator or regional transmission organization may allow its Market Monitoring Unit to conduct retrospective mitigation.

        (D) A Commission-approved independent system operator or regional transmission organization with a hybrid Market Monitoring Unit structure may permit its internal market monitor to conduct prospective and/or retrospective mitigation, in which case it must assign to its external market monitor the responsibility and the tools to monitor the quality and appropriateness of the mitigation.

        (E) Each Commission-approved independent system operator or regional transmission organization must identify in its tariff the functions the Market Monitoring Unit will perform and the functions the Commission-approved independent system operator or regional transmission organization will perform.

        (iv)  (A) A Market Monitoring Unit is to make a non-public referral to the Commission in all instances where the Market Monitoring Unit has reason to believe that a Market Violation has occurred. While the Market Monitoring Unit need not be able to prove that a Market Violation has occurred, the Market Monitoring Unit is to provide sufficient credible information to warrant further investigation by the Commission. Once the Market Monitoring Unit has obtained sufficient credible information to warrant referral to the Commission, the Market Monitoring Unit is to immediately refer the matter to the Commission and desist from independent action related to the alleged Market Violation. This does not preclude the Market Monitoring Unit from continuing to monitor for any repeated instances of the activity by the same or other entities, which would constitute new Market Violations. The Market Monitoring Unit is to respond to requests from the Commission for any additional information in connection with the alleged Market Violation it has referred.

        (B) All referrals to the Commission of alleged Market Violations are to be in writing, whether transmitted electronically, by fax, mail, or courier. The Market Monitoring Unit may alert the Commission orally in advance of the written referral.

        (C) The referral is to be addressed to the Commission's Director of the Office of Enforcement, with a copy also directed to both the Director of the Office of Energy Market Regulation and the General Counsel.

        (D) The referral is to include, but need not be limited to, the following information.

        () The name[s] of and, if possible, the contact information for, the entity[ies] that allegedly took the action[s] that constituted the alleged Market Violation[s];

        () The date[s] or time period during which the alleged Market Violation[s] occurred and whether the alleged wrongful conduct is ongoing;

        () The specific rule or regulation, and/or tariff provision, that was allegedly violated, or the nature of any inappropriate dispatch that may have occurred;

        () The specific act[s] or conduct that allegedly constituted the Market Violation;

        () The consequences to the market resulting from the acts or conduct, including, if known, an estimate of economic impact on the market;

        () If the Market Monitoring Unit believes that the act[s] or conduct constituted a violation of the anti-manipulation rule of Part 1c, a description of the alleged manipulative effect on market prices, market conditions, or market rules;

        () Any other information the Market Monitoring Unit believes is relevant and may be helpful to the Commission.

        (E) Following a referral to the Commission, the Market Monitoring Unit is to continue to notify and inform the Commission of any information that the Market Monitoring Unit learns of that may be related to the referral, but the Market Monitoring Unit is not to undertake any investigative steps regarding the referral except at the express direction of the Commission or Commission Staff.

        (v)  (A) A Market Monitoring Unit is to make a referral to the Commission in all instances where the Market Monitoring Unit has reason to believe market design flaws exist that it believes could effectively be remedied by rule or tariff changes. The Market Monitoring Unit must limit distribution of its identifications and recommendations to the independent system operator or regional transmission organization and to the Commission in the event it believes broader dissemination could lead to exploitation, with an explanation of why further dissemination should be avoided at that time.

        (B) All referrals to the Commission relating to perceived market design flaws and recommended tariff changes are to be in writing, whether transmitted electronically, by fax, mail, or courier. The Market Monitoring Unit may alert the Commission orally in advance of the written referral.

        (C) The referral should be addressed to the Commission's Director of the Office of Energy Market Regulation, with copies directed to both the Director of the Office of Enforcement and the General Counsel.

        (D) The referral is to include, but need not be limited to, the following information.

        () A detailed narrative describing the perceived market design flaw[s];

        () The consequences of the perceived market design flaw[s], including, if known, an estimate of economic impact on the market;

        () The rule or tariff change(s) that the Market Monitoring Unit believes could remedy the perceived market design flaw;

        () Any other information the Market Monitoring Unit believes is relevant and may be helpful to the Commission.

        (E) Following a referral to the Commission, the Market Monitoring Unit is to continue to notify and inform the Commission of any additional information regarding the perceived market design flaw, its effects on the market, any additional or modified observations concerning the rule or tariff changes that could remedy the perceived design flaw, any recommendations made by the Market Monitoring Unit to the regional transmission organization or independent system operator, stakeholders, market participants or state commissions regarding the perceived design flaw, and any actions taken by the regional transmission organization or independent system operator regarding the perceived design flaw.

        (vi)  Each Commission-approved independent system operator or regional transmission organization must include in its tariff ethical standards for its Market Monitoring Unit and the employees of its Market Monitoring Unit. At a minimum, the ethics standards must include the following requirements:

        (A) The Market Monitoring Unit and its employees must have no material affiliation with any market participant or affiliate.

        (B) The Market Monitoring Unit and its employees must not serve as an officer, employee, or partner of a market participant.

        (C) The Market Monitoring Unit and its employees must have no material financial interest in any market participant or affiliate with potential exceptions for mutual funds and non-directed investments.

        (D) The Market Monitoring Unit and its employees must not engage in any market transactions other than the performance of their duties under the tariff.

        (E) The Market Monitoring Unit and its employees must not be compensated, other than by the Commission-approved independent system operator or regional transmission organization that retains or employs it, for any expert witness testimony or other commercial services, either to the Commission-approved independent system operator or regional transmission organization or to any other party, in connection with any legal or regulatory proceeding or commercial transaction relating to the Commission-approved independent system operator or regional transmission organization or to the Commission-approved independent system operator's or regional transmission organization's markets.

        (F) The Market Monitoring Unit and its employees may not accept anything of value from a market participant in excess of a  amount.

        (G) The Market Monitoring Unit and its employees must advise a supervisor in the event they seek employment with a market participant, and must disqualify themselves from participating in any matter that would have an effect on the financial interest of the market participant.

        (4)  Each Commission-approved regional transmission organization and independent system operator must electronically deliver to the Commission, on an ongoing basis and in a form and manner consistent with its own collection of data and in a form and manner acceptable to the Commission, data related to the markets that the regional transmission organization or independent system operator administers.

        (5)  (i) Unless a Commission-approved independent system operator or regional transmission organization obtains Commission approval for a different period, each Commission-approved independent system operator and regional transmission organization must release its offer and bid data within three months.

        (ii) A Commission-approved independent system operator or regional transmission organization must mask the identity of market participants when releasing offer and bid data. The Commission-approved independent system operators and regional transmission organization may propose a time period for eventual unmasking.

        (6)  Each Commission-approved independent system operator or regional transmission organization must adopt business practices and procedures that achieve Commission-approved independent system operator and regional transmission organization board of directors' responsiveness to customers and other stakeholders and satisfy the following criteria:

        (i)  The business practices and procedures must ensure that any customer or other stakeholder affected by the operation of the Commission-approved independent system operator or regional transmission organization, or its representative, is permitted to communicate the customer's or other stakeholder's views to the independent system operator's or regional transmission organization's board of directors;

        (ii)  The business practices and procedures must ensure that the interests of customers or other stakeholders are equitably considered, and that deliberation and consideration of Commission-approved independent system operator's and regional transmission organization's issues are not dominated by any single stakeholder category;

        (iii)  The business practices and procedures must ensure that, in instances where stakeholders are not in total agreement on a particular issue, minority positions are communicated to the Commission-approved independent system operator's and regional transmission organization's board of directors at the same time as majority positions; and

        (iv)  The business practices and procedures must provide for stakeholder input into the Commission-approved independent system operator's or regional transmission organization's decisions as well as mechanisms to provide feedback to stakeholders to ensure that information exchange and communication continue over time.

        (7)  All Commission-approved independent system operators and regional transmission organizations must make a compliance filing with the Commission as described in Order No. 719 under the following schedule:

        (i) The compliance filing addressing the accepting of bids from demand response resources in markets for ancillary services on a basis comparable to other resources, removal of deviation charges, aggregation of retail customers, shortage pricing during periods of operating reserve shortage, long-term power contracting in organized markets, Market Monitoring Units, Commission-approved independent system operators' and regional transmission organizations' board of directors' responsiveness, and reporting on the study of the need for further reforms to remove barriers to comparable treatment of demand response resources must be submitted on or before April 28, 2009.

        (ii) A public utility that is approved as a regional transmission organization under § 35.34, or that is not approved but begins to operate regional markets for electric energy or ancillary services after December 29, 2008, must comply with Order No. 719 and the provisions of paragraphs (g)(1) through (g)(5) of this section before beginning operations.

        (8)  Each Commission-approved independent system operator or regional transmission organization that has a tariff that provides for the compensation for frequency regulation service must provide such compensation based on the actual service provided, including a capacity payment that includes the marginal unit's opportunity costs and a payment for performance that reflects the quantity of frequency regulation service provided by a resource when the resource is accurately following the dispatch signal.

        (9)  (i) Each Commission-approved independent system operator and regional transmission organization must have tariff provisions providing a participation model for electric storage resources that:

        (A) Ensures that a resource using the participation model for electric storage resources in an independent system operator or regional transmission organization market is eligible to provide all capacity, energy, and ancillary services that it is technically capable of providing;

        (B) Enables a resource using the participation model for electric storage resources to be dispatched and ensures that such a dispatchable resource can set the wholesale market clearing price as both a wholesale seller and wholesale buyer consistent with rules that govern the conditions under which a resource can set the wholesale price;

        (C) Accounts for the physical and operational characteristics of electric storage resources through bidding parameters or other means; and

        (D) Establishes a minimum size requirement for resources using the participation model for electric storage resources that does not exceed 100 kW.

        (ii) The sale of electric energy from an independent system operator or regional transmission organization market to an electric storage resource that the resource then resells back to that market must be at the wholesale locational marginal price.

        (10) —(i)  Each Commission-approved independent system operator or regional transmission organization must post two reports, at minimum, regarding uplift on a publicly accessible portion of its website. First, each Commission-approved independent system operator or regional transmission organization must post uplift, paid in dollars, and categorized by transmission zone, day, and uplift category. Transmission zone shall be defined as the geographic area that is used for the local allocation of charges. Transmission zones with fewer than four resources may be aggregated with one or more neighboring transmission zones, until each aggregated zone contains at least four resources, and reported collectively. This report shall be posted within 20 calendar days of the end of each month. Second, each Commission-approved independent system operator or regional transmission organization must post the resource name and the total amount of uplift paid in dollars aggregated across the month to each resource that received uplift payments within the calendar month. This report shall be posted within 90 calendar days of the end of each month.

        (ii)  Each Commission-approved independent system operator or regional transmission organization must post a report of each operator-initiated commitment listing the size of the commitment, transmission zone, commitment reason, and commitment start time on a publicly accessible portion of its website within 30 calendar days of the end of each month. Transmission zone shall be defined as a geographic area that is used for the local allocation of charges. Commitment reasons shall include, but are not limited to, system-wide capacity, constraint management, and voltage support.

        (iii)  Each Commission-approved independent system operator or regional transmission organization must include, in its tariff, its transmission constraint penalty factor values; the circumstances, if any, under which the transmission constraint penalty factors can set locational marginal prices; and the procedure, if any, for temporarily changing the transmission constraint penalty factor values. Any procedure for temporarily changing transmission constraint penalty factor values must provide for notice of the change to market participants.

        (11) A resource's incremental energy offer must be capped at the higher of $1,000/MWh or that resource's cost-based incremental energy offer. For the purpose of calculating Locational Marginal Prices, Regional Transmission Organizations and Independent System Operators must cap cost-based incremental energy offers at $2,000/MWh. The actual or expected costs underlying a resource's cost-based incremental energy offer above $1,000/MWh must be verified before that offer can be used for purposes of calculating Locational Marginal Prices. If a resource submits an incremental energy offer above $1,000/MWh and the actual or expected costs underlying that offer cannot be verified before the market clearing process begins, that offer may not be used to calculate Locational Marginal Prices and the resource would be eligible for a make-whole payment if that resource is dispatched and the resource's actual costs are verified after-the-fact. A resource would also be eligible for a make-whole payment if it is dispatched and its verified cost-based incremental energy offer exceeds $2,000/MWh. All resources, regardless of type, are eligible to submit cost-based incremental energy offers in excess of $1,000/MWh.

        (12)  (i) Each independent system operator and regional transmission organization must have tariff provisions that allow distributed energy resource aggregations to participate directly in the independent system operator or regional transmission organization markets.

        (ii) Each regional transmission organization and independent system operator, to accommodate the participation of distributed energy resource aggregations, must establish market rules that address:

        (A) Eligibility to participate in the independent system operator or regional transmission organization markets through a distributed energy resource aggregation;

        (B) Locational requirements for distributed energy resource aggregations;

        (C) Distribution factors and bidding parameters for distributed energy resource aggregations;

        (D) Information and data requirements for distributed energy resource aggregations;

        (E) Modification to the list of resources in a distributed energy resource aggregation;

        (F) Metering and telemetry system requirements for distributed energy resource aggregations;

**Authority:** Authority: Federal Power Act, 16 U.S.C. 792-828c (1976 and Supp. IV 1980) and Pacific Northwest Electric Power Planning and Conservation Act, 16 U.S.C. 830-839h (Supp. IV (1980)).

        § 35.30   General provisions.

#### § § 35.30

        (a)  This subpart applies to any sales of electric power subject to the Commission's jurisdiction under Part II of the Federal Power Act from public utilities to the Administrator of the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) at the average system cost (ASC) of that utility's resources (electric power generation by the utility) pursuant to section 5(c) of the Pacific Northwest Electric Power Planning and Conservation Act, 16 U.S.C. 830-839h. The ASC is determined by BPA in accordance with 18 CFR part 301.

        (b)  (1) During the period between the date of BPA's determination of ASC and the date of the final order issued by the Commission, the utility may charge the rate based on the ASC determined by BPA, subject to § 35.31(c) of this part.

        (2) Except as otherwise provided under this section, the ASC ordered by the Commission will be deemed in effect from the beginning of the relevant exchange period, as defined in § 301.1(b)(95) of this chapter. For any initial exchange period after the Commission approves a new ASC methodology, the ASC will be effective retroactively under this paragraph only if the utility files its new ASC within the time allowed under BPA procedures. Any utility that files a revised ASC with BPA in accordance with this paragraph must promptly file with the Commission a notice of timely filing of the new ASC.

        (c)  Within 15 business days of the date of issuance of the BPA report on a utility's ASC, the utility must file with the Commission the ASC determined by BPA, the BPA written report, the utility's ASC schedules, material necessary to comply with 18 CFR 35.13(c), and any other material requested by the Commission or its staff.

        (b)  With respect to any filing under this subpart, the Commission will determine whether the ASC set by BPA for the applicable exchange period was determined in accordance with the ASC methodology set forth at 18 CFR 301.1. If the ASC is not in accord with the methodology, the Commission will order that BPA amend the ASC to conform with the methodology. If the ASC is in accord with the methodology, the rate is deemed just and reasonable.

        (c)  (1) Any ASC-based rate charged by a public utility under this subpart pending Commission order is subject to refund or to adjustment that increases the ASC-based rate.

        (2) Any interest on refunds ordered by the Commission under this subpart is computed in accordance with 18 CFR 35.19a. Interest on any increase ordered by the Commission will be at the rate charged to BPA by the U.S. Treasury during that period, unless the Commission orders another interest rate.

      Subpart E—Regulations Governing Nuclear Plant Decommissioning Trust Funds

        § 35.32   General provisions.

#### § § 35.32

        (a) If a public utility has elected to provide for the decommissioning of a nuclear power plant through a nuclear plant decommissioning trust fund (Fund), the Fund must meet the following criteria:

        (1) The Fund must be an external trust fund in the United States, established pursuant to a written trust agreement, that is independent of the utility, its subsidiaries, affiliates or associates. If the trust fund includes monies collected both in Commission-jurisdictional rates and in non-Commission-jurisdictional rates, then a separate account of the Commission-jurisdictional monies shall be maintained.

        (2) The utility may provide overall investment policy to the Trustee or Investment Manager, but it may do so only in writing, and neither the utility nor its subsidiaries, affiliates or associates may serve as Investment Manager or otherwise engage in day-to-day management of the Fund or mandate individual investment decisions.

        (3) The Fund's Investment Manager must exercise the standard of care, whether in investing or otherwise, that a prudent investor would use in the same circumstances. The term “prudent investor” means a prudent investor as described in Restatement of the Law (Third), Trusts § 227, including general comments and reporter's notes, pages 8-101. St. Paul, MN: American Law Institute Publishers, (1992). ISBN 0-314-84246-2. This incorporation by reference was approved by the Director of the Federal Register in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51. Copies may be obtained from the American Law Institute, 4025 Chestnut Street, Philadelphia, PA 19104, and are also available in local law libraries. Copies may be inspected at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's Library, Room 95-01, 888 First Street, NE. Washington, DC or at the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA). For information on the availability of this material at NARA, call 202-741-6030, or go to:

        (4) The Trustee shall have a net worth of at least $100 million. In calculating the $100 million net worth requirement, the net worth of the Trustee's parent corporation and/or affiliates may be taken into account only if such entities guarantee the Trustee's responsibilities to the Fund.

        (5) The Trustee or Investment Manager shall keep accurate and detailed accounts of all investments, receipts, disbursements and transactions of the Fund. All accounts, books and records relating to the Fund shall be open to inspection and audit at reasonable times by the utility or its designee or by the Commission or its designee. The utility or its designee must notify the Commission prior to performing any such inspection or audit. The Commission may direct the utility to conduct an audit or inspection.

        (6) Absent the express authorization of the Commission, no part of the assets of the Fund may be used for, or diverted to, any purpose other than to fund the costs of decommissioning the nuclear power plant to which the Fund relates, and to pay administrative costs and other incidental expenses, including taxes, of the Fund.

        (7) If the Fund balances exceed the amount actually expended for decommissioning after decommissioning has been completed, the utility shall return the excess jurisdictional amount to ratepayers, in a manner the Commission determines.

        (8) Except for investments tied to market indexes or other mutual funds, the Investment Manager shall not invest in any securities of the utility for which it manages the funds or in that utility's subsidiaries, affiliates, or associates or their successors or assigns.

        (9) The utility and the Fiduciary shall seek to obtain the best possible tax treatment of amounts collected for nuclear plant decommissioning. In this regard, the utility and the Fiduciary shall take maximum advantage of tax deductions and credits, when it is consistent with sound business practices to do so.

        (10) Each utility shall deposit in the Fund at least quarterly all amounts included in Commission-jurisdictional rates to fund nuclear power plant decommissioning.

        (b) The establishment, organization, and maintenance of the Fund shall not relieve the utility or its subsidiaries, affiliates or associates of any obligations it may have as to the decommissioning of the nuclear power plant. It is not the responsibility of the Fiduciary to ensure that the amount of monies that a Fund contains are adequate to pay for a nuclear unit's decommissioning.

        (c) A utility may establish both qualified and non-qualified Funds with respect to a utility's interest in a specific nuclear plant. This section applies to both “qualified” (under the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. 468A, or any successor section) and non-qualified Funds.

        (d) A utility must regularly supply to the Fund's Investment Manager, and regularly update, essential information about the nuclear unit covered by the Trust Fund Agreement, including its description, location, expected remaining useful life, the decommissioning plan the utility proposes to follow, the utility's liquidity needs once decommissioning begins, and any other information that the Fund's Investment Manager would need to construct and maintain, over time, a sound investment plan.

        (e) A utility should monitor the performance of all Fiduciaries of the Fund and, if necessary, replace them if they are not properly performing assigned responsibilities.

#### § § 35.33

        (a) In addition to the general provisions of § 35.32, the Trustee must observe the provisions of this section.

        (b) The Trustee may use Fund assets only to:

        (1) Satisfy the liability of a utility for decommissioning costs of the nuclear power plant to which the Fund relates as provided by § 35.32; and

        (2) Pay administrative costs and other incidental expenses, including taxes, of the Fund as provided by § 35.32.

        (c) To the extent that the Trustee does not currently require the assets of the Fund for the purposes described in paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section, the Investment Manager, when investing Fund assets, must exercise the same standard of care that a reasonable person would exercise in the same circumstances. In this context, a “reasonable person” means a prudent investor as described in Restatement of the Law (Third), Trusts § 227, including general comments and reporter's notes, pages 8-101.

For information on the availability of this material at NARA, call 202-741-6030, or go to:

        (d) The utility must submit to the Commission by March 31 of each year, one original and three conformed copies of the financial report furnished to the utility by the Fund's Trustee that shows for the previous calendar year:

        (1) Fund assets and liabilities at the beginning of the period;

        (2) Activity of the Fund during the period, including amounts received from the utility, a summary amount for purchases of fund investments and a summary amount for sales of fund investments, gains and losses from investment activity, disbursements from the Fund for decommissioning activity and payment of Fund expenses, including taxes; and

        (3) Fund assets and liabilities at the end of the period. The report should not include the liability for decommissioning.

        (4) Public utilities owning nuclear plants must maintain records of individual purchase and sales transactions until after decommissioning has been completed and any excess jurisdictional amounts have been returned to ratepayers in a manner that the Commission determines. The public utility need not include these records in the financial report that it furnishes to the Commission by March 31 of each year.

        (e) The utility must also mail a copy of the financial report provided to the Commission pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section to anyone who requests it.

        (f) If an independent public accountant has expressed an opinion on the report or on any portion of the report, then that opinion must accompany the report.

        (ii) The Regional Transmission Organization must have the authority to decide the minimum required amounts of each ancillary service and, if necessary, the locations at which these services must be provided. All ancillary service providers must be subject to direct or indirect operational control by the Regional Transmission Organization. The Regional Transmission Organization must promote the development of competitive markets for ancillary services whenever feasible.

        (iii) The Regional Transmission Organization must ensure that its transmission customers have access to a real-time balancing market. The Regional Transmission Organization must either develop and operate this market itself or ensure that this task is performed by another entity that is not affiliated with any market participant.

        (5)  The Regional Transmission Organization must be the single OASIS site administrator for all transmission facilities under its control and independently calculate TTC and ATC.

        (6)  To ensure that the Regional Transmission Organization provides reliable, efficient and not unduly discriminatory transmission service, the Regional Transmission Organization must provide for objective monitoring of markets it operates or administers to identify market design flaws, market power abuses and opportunities for efficiency improvements, and propose appropriate actions. As part of its demonstration with respect to market monitoring, the Regional Transmission Organization must satisfy the standards listed in paragraphs (k)(6)(i) through (k)(6)(iii) of this section, or demonstrate that an alternative proposal is consistent with or superior to satisfying such standards.

        (i) Market monitoring must include monitoring the behavior of market participants in the region, including transmission owners other than the Regional Transmission Organization, if any, to determine if their actions hinder the Regional Transmission Organization in providing reliable, efficient and not unduly discriminatory transmission service.

        (ii) With respect to markets the Regional Transmission Organization operates or administers, there must be a periodic assessment of how behavior in markets operated by others ( bilateral power sales markets and power markets operated by unaffiliated power exchanges) affects Regional Transmission Organization operations and how Regional Transmission Organization operations affect the efficiency of power markets operated by others.

        (iii) Reports on opportunities for efficiency improvement, market power abuses and market design flaws must be filed with the Commission and affected regulatory authorities.

        (7)  The Regional Transmission Organization must be responsible for planning, and for directing or arranging, necessary transmission expansions, additions, and upgrades that will enable it to provide efficient, reliable and non-discriminatory transmission service and coordinate such efforts with the appropriate state authorities. As part of its demonstration with respect to planning and expansion, the Regional Transmission Organization must satisfy the standards listed in paragraphs (k)(7)(i) and (ii) of this section, or demonstrate that an alternative proposal is consistent with or superior to satisfying such standards.

        (i) The Regional Transmission Organization planning and expansion process must encourage market-driven operating and investment actions for preventing and relieving congestion.

        (ii) The Regional Transmission Organization's planning and expansion process must accommodate efforts by state regulatory commissions to create multi-state agreements to review and approve new transmission facilities. The Regional Transmission Organization's planning and expansion process must be coordinated with programs of existing Regional Transmission Groups (See § 2.21 of this chapter) where appropriate.

        (iii) If the Regional Transmission Organization is unable to satisfy this requirement when it commences operation, it must file with the Commission a plan with specified milestones that will ensure that it meets this requirement no later than three years after initial operation.

        (8)  The Regional Transmission Organization must ensure the integration of reliability practices within an interconnection and market interface practices among regions.

        (l)  (1) Any proposal to participate in a Regional Transmission Organization must not contain any provision that would limit the capability of the Regional Transmission Organization to evolve in ways that would improve its efficiency, consistent with the requirements in paragraphs (j) and (k) of this section.

        (2) Nothing in this regulation precludes an approved Regional Transmission Organization from seeking to evolve with respect to its organizational design, market design, geographic scope, ownership arrangements, or methods of operational control, or in other appropriate ways if the change is consistent with the requirements of this section. Any future filing seeking approval of such changes must demonstrate that the proposed changes will meet the requirements of paragraphs (j), (k) and (l) of this section.

      Subpart G—Transmission Infrastructure Investment Provisions

        § 35.35   Transmission infrastructure investment.

#### § § 35.35

        (a)  This section establishes rules for incentive-based (including performance-based) rate treatments for transmission of electric energy in interstate commerce by public utilities for the purpose of benefiting consumers by ensuring reliability and reducing the cost of delivered power by reducing transmission congestion.

        (b)  (1)  means a stand-alone transmission company that has been approved by the Commission and that sells transmission services at wholesale and/or on an unbundled retail basis, regardless of whether it is affiliated with another public utility.

        (2)  means a Regional _Transmission Organization_, Independent System Operator, independent transmission provider, or other transmission organization finally approved by the Commission for the operation of transmission facilities.

        (c)  All rates approved under the rules of this section, including any revisions to the rules, are subject to the filing requirements of sections 205 and 206 of the Federal Power Act and to the substantive requirements of sections 205 and 206 of the Federal Power Act that all rates, charges, terms and conditions be just and reasonable and not unduly discriminatory or preferential.

        (d)  The Commission will authorize any incentive-based rate treatment, as discussed in this paragraph (d), for transmission infrastructure investment, provided that the proposed incentive-based rate treatment is just and reasonable and not unduly discriminatory or preferential. A public utility's request for one or more incentive-based rate treatments, to be made in a filing pursuant to section 205 of the Federal Power Act, or in a petition for a declaratory order that precedes a filing pursuant to section 205, must include a detailed explanation of how the proposed rate treatment complies with the requirements of section 219 of the Federal Power Act and a demonstration that the proposed rate treatment is just, reasonable, and not unduly discriminatory or preferential. The applicant must demonstrate that the facilities for which it seeks incentives either ensure reliability or reduce the cost of delivered power by reducing transmission congestion consistent with the requirements of section 219, that the  package of incentives is tailored to address the demonstrable risks or challenges faced by the applicant in undertaking the project, and that resulting rates are just and reasonable. For purposes of this paragraph (d), incentive-based rate treatment means any of the following:

        (1) For purposes of this paragraph (d), incentive-based rate treatment means any of the following:

        (i) A rate of return on equity sufficient to attract new investment in transmission facilities;

        (ii) 100 percent of prudently incurred Construction Work in Progress (CWIP) in rate base;

        (iii) Recovery of prudently incurred pre-commercial operations costs;

        (iv) Hypothetical capital structure;

        (v) Accelerated depreciation used for rate recovery;

        (vi) Recovery of 100 percent of prudently incurred costs of transmission facilities that are cancelled or abandoned due to factors beyond the control of the public utility;

        (vii) Deferred cost recovery; and

        (viii) Any other incentives approved by the Commission, pursuant to the requirements of this paragraph, that are determined to be just and reasonable and not unduly discriminatory or preferential.

        (2) In addition to the incentives in § 35.35(d)(1), the Commission will authorize the following incentive-based rate treatments for Transcos, provided that the proposed incentive-based rate treatment is just and reasonable and not unduly discriminatory or preferential:

        (i) A return on equity that both encourages Transco formation and is sufficient to attract investment; and

        (ii) An adjustment to the book value of transmission assets being sold to a Transco to remove the disincentive associated with the impact of accelerated depreciation on federal capital gains tax liabilities.

        (e)  The Commission will authorize an incentive-based rate treatment, as discussed in this paragraph (e), for public utilities that join a Transmission Organization, if the applicant demonstrates that the proposed incentive-based rate treatment is just and reasonable and not unduly discriminatory or preferential. Applicants for the incentive-based rate treatment must make a filing with the Commission under section 205 of the Federal Power Act. For purposes of this paragraph (e), an incentive-based rate treatment means a return on equity that is higher than the return on equity the Commission might otherwise allow if the public utility did not join a Transmission Organization. The Commission will also permit transmitting utilities or electric utilities that join a Transmission Organization the ability to recover prudently incurred costs associated with joining the Transmission Organization, either through transmission rates charged by transmitting utilities or electric utilities or through transmission rates charged by the Transmission Organization that provides services to such utilities.

        (f)  The Commission will approve recovery of prudently-incurred costs necessary to comply with the mandatory reliability standards pursuant to section 215 of the Federal Power Act, provided that the proposed rates are just and reasonable and not unduly discriminatory or preferential.

        (g)  The Commission will approve recovery of prudently-incurred costs related to transmission infrastructure development pursuant to section 216 of the Federal Power Act, provided that the proposed rates are just and reasonable and not unduly discriminatory or preferential.

        (h)  Public utilities that have been granted incentive rate treatment for specific transmission projects must file FERC-730 on an annual basis beginning with the calendar year incentive rate treatment is granted by the Commission. Such filings are due by April 18 of the following calendar year and are due April 18 each year thereafter. The following information must be filed:

        (1) In dollar terms, actual transmission investment for the most recent calendar year, and projected, incremental investments for the next five calendar years;

        (2) For all current and projected investments over the next five calendar years, a project by project listing that specifies for each project the most up-to-date, expected completion date, percentage completion as of the date of filing, and reasons for delays. Exclude from this listing projects with projected costs less than $20 million; and

        (3) For good cause shown, the Commission may extend the time within which any FERC-730 filing is to be filed or waive the requirements applicable to any such filing.

        (i)  (1) The Commission will apply a rebuttable presumption that an applicant has demonstrated that its project is needed to ensure reliability or reduces the cost of delivered power by reducing congestion for:

        (i) A transmission project that results from a fair and open regional planning process that considers and evaluates projects for reliability and/or congestion and is found to be acceptable to the Commission; or

        (ii) A project that has received construction approval from an appropriate state commission or state siting authority.

        (2) To the extent these approval processes do not require that a project ensures reliability or reduce the cost of delivered power by reducing congestion, the applicant bears the burden of demonstrating that its project satisfies these criteria.

        (j)  If the Commission pursuant to its authority under section 216 of the Federal Power Act and its regulations thereunder has issued one or more permits for the construction or modification of transmission facilities in a national interest electric transmission corridor designated by the Secretary, such facilities shall be deemed to either ensure reliability or reduce the cost of delivered power by reducing congestion for purposes of section 219(a).

      Subpart H—Wholesale Sales of Electric Energy, Capacity and Ancillary Services at Market-Based Rates

**Source:** Source: Order 697, 72 FR 40038, July 20, 2007, unless otherwise noted.

        § 35.36   Generally.

#### § § 35.36

        (a) For purposes of this subpart:

        (1)  means any person that has authorization to or seeks authorization to engage in sales for resale of electric energy, capacity or ancillary services at market-based rates under section 205 of the Federal Power Act.

        (2)  means a Seller that:

        (i) Is either a wholesale power marketer that controls or is affiliated with 500 MW or less of generation in aggregate per region or a wholesale power producer that owns, controls or is affiliated with 500 MW or less of generation in aggregate in the same region as its generation assets;

        (ii) Does not own, operate or control transmission facilities other than limited equipment necessary to connect individual generating facilities to the transmission grid (or has been granted waiver of the requirements of Order No. 888, FERC Stats. & Regs. ¶ 31,036);

        (iii) Is not affiliated with anyone that owns, operates or controls transmission facilities in the same region as the Seller's generation assets;

        (iv) Is not affiliated with a franchised public utility in the same region as the Seller's generation assets; and

        (v) Does not raise other vertical market power issues.

        (3)  means any Sellers not in Category 1.

        (4)  means intrastate natural gas transportation, intrastate natural gas storage or distribution facilities; physical coal supply sources and ownership of or control over who may access transportation of coal supplies;

        (5)  means a public utility with a franchised service obligation under State law.

        (6)  means any wholesale or retail electric energy customers served by a franchised public utility under cost-based regulation.

        (7)  means any power seller affiliate other than a franchised public utility, including a power marketer, exempt wholesale generator, qualifying facility or other power seller affiliate, whose power sales are regulated in whole or in part on a market-rate basis.

        (8)  means non-public information related to the electric energy and power business including, but not limited to, information regarding sales, cost of production, generator outages, generator heat rates, unconsummated transactions, or historical generator volumes. _Market information_ includes information from either affiliates or non-affiliates.

        (9)  of a specified company means:

        (i) Any person that directly or indirectly owns, controls, or holds with power to vote, 10 percent or more of the outstanding voting securities of the specified company;

        (ii) Any company 10 percent or more of whose outstanding voting securities are owned, controlled, or held with power to vote, directly or indirectly, by the specified company;

        (iii) Any person or class of persons that the Commission determines, after appropriate notice and opportunity for hearing, to stand in such relation to the specified company that there is liable to be an absence of arm's-length bargaining in transactions between them as to make it necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors or consumers that the person be treated as an affiliate; and

        (iv) Any person that is under common control with the specified company.

        (v) For purposes of paragraph (a)(9), owning, controlling or holding with power to vote, less than 10 percent of the outstanding voting securities of a specified company creates a rebuttable presumption of lack of control.

        § 35.37   Market power analysis required.

#### § § 35.37

        (a)(1) In addition to other requirements in subparts A and B, a Seller must submit a market power analysis in the following circumstances: When seeking market-based rate authority; for Category 2 Sellers, every three years, according to the schedule posted on the Commission's website; or any other time the Commission directs a Seller to submit one. Failure to timely file an updated market power analysis will constitute a violation of Seller's market-based rate tariff. The market power analysis must be preceded by a submission of information into a relational database that will include a list of the Seller's own assets, the assets of its non-market-based rate affiliate(s) and identification of its ultimate upstream affiliate(s). The relational database submission will also include information necessary to generate the indicative screens, if necessary, as discussed in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. When seeking market-based rate authority, the relational database submission must also include other market-based information concerning category status, operating reserves authorization, mitigation, and other limitations.

        (2) When submitting a market power analysis, whether as part of an initial application or an update, a Seller must include a description of its ownership structure that identifies all ultimate upstream affiliate(s). With respect to any investors or owners that a Seller represents to be passive, the Seller must affirm in its narrative that the ownership interests consist solely of passive rights that are necessary to protect the passive investors' or owners' investments and do not confer control. The Seller must also include an appendix of assets and, if necessary, indicative screens as discussed in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. A Seller must include all supporting materials referenced in the indicative screens. The appendix of assets and indicative screens are derived from the information submitted by a Seller and its affiliates into the relational database and retrievable in conformance with the instructions posted on the Commission's website.

        (b) A market power analysis must address whether a Seller has horizontal and vertical market power.

        (c)(1) There will be a rebuttable presumption that a Seller lacks horizontal market power with respect to sales of energy, capacity, energy imbalance service, generation imbalance service, and primary frequency response service if it passes two indicative market power screens: a pivotal supplier analysis based on annual peak demand of the relevant market, and a market share analysis applied on a seasonal basis. There will be a rebuttable presumption that a Seller lacks horizontal market power with respect to sales of operating reserve-spinning and operating reserve-supplemental services if the Seller passes these two indicative market power screens and demonstrates in its market-based rate application how the scheduling practices in its region support the delivery of operating reserve resources from one balancing authority area to another. There will be a rebuttable presumption that a Seller possesses horizontal market power with respect to sales of energy, capacity, energy imbalance service, generation imbalance service, operating reserve-spinning service, operating reserve-supplemental service, and primary frequency response service if it fails either screen.

        (2) Sellers and intervenors may also file alternative evidence to support or rebut the results of the indicative screens. Sellers may file such evidence at the time they file their indicative screens. Intervenors may file such evidence in response to a Seller's submissions.

        (3) If a Seller does not pass one or both screens, the Seller may rebut a presumption of horizontal market power by submitting a Delivered Price Test analysis. A Seller that does not rebut a presumption of horizontal market power or that concedes market power, is subject to mitigation, as described in § 35.38.

        (4) In lieu of submitting the indicative market power screens, Sellers studying regional transmission organization (RTO) or independent system operator (ISO) markets that operate RTO/ISO-administered energy, ancillary services, and capacity markets may state that they are relying on Commission-approved market monitoring and mitigation to address potential horizontal market power Sellers may have in those markets.

        (5) In lieu of submitting the indicative market power screens, Sellers studying RTO or ISO markets that operate RTO/ISO-administered energy and ancillary services markets, but not capacity markets, may state that they are relying on Commission-approved market monitoring and mitigation to address potential horizontal market power that Sellers may have in energy and ancillary services. However, Sellers studying such RTOs/ISOs would need to submit indicative market power screens if they wish to obtain market-based rate authority for wholesale sales of capacity in these markets.

        (6) Sellers submitting simultaneous transmission import limit studies must file Submittal 1, and, if applicable, Submittal 2, in the electronic spreadsheet format provided on the Commission's Web site.

        (d) To demonstrate a lack of vertical market power, a Seller that owns, operates or controls transmission facilities, or whose affiliates own, operate or control transmission facilities, must have on file with the Commission an Open Access Transmission Tariff, as described in § 35.28; provided, however, that a Seller whose foreign affiliate(s) own, operate or control transmission facilities outside of the United States that can be used by competitors of the Seller to reach United States markets must demonstrate that such affiliate either has adopted and is implementing an Open Access Transmission Tariff as described in § 35.28, or otherwise offers comparable, non-discriminatory access to such transmission facilities.

        (e) To demonstrate a lack of vertical market power in wholesale energy markets through the affiliation, ownership or control of inputs to electric power production, such as the transportation or distribution of the inputs to electric power production, a Seller must provide the following information:

        (1) A description of its ownership or control of, or affiliation with an entity that owns or controls, intrastate natural gas transportation, intrastate natural gas storage or distribution facilities;

        (2) Physical coal supply sources and ownership or control over who may access transportation of coal supplies; and

        (3) A Seller must ensure that this information is included in the record of each new application for market-based rates and each updated market power analysis. In addition, a Seller is required to make an affirmative statement that it and its affiliates have not erected barriers to entry into the relevant market and will not erect barriers to entry into the relevant market.

        (f) If the Seller seeks to protect any portion of a filing from public disclosure, the Seller must make its filing in accordance with the Commission's instructions for filing privileged materials and critical energy infrastructure information in § 388.112 of this chapter.

> [Order 697, 72 FR 40038, July 20, 2007, as amended by Order 697-B, 73 FR 79627, Dec. 30, 2008; Order 769, 77 FR 65475, Oct. 29, 2012; Order 784, 78 FR 46209, July 30, 2013; Order 816, 80 FR 67108, Oct. 30, 2015; Order 819, 80 FR 73977, Nov. 27, 2015; Order 861, 84 FR 36386, July 26, 2019; Order 860, 84 FR 36428, July 26, 2019]

        § 35.38   Mitigation.

#### § § 35.38

        (a) A Seller that has been found to have market power in generation or ancillary services, or that is presumed to have horizontal market power in generation or ancillary services by virtue of failing or foregoing the relevant market power screens, as described in 35.37(c), may adopt the default mitigation detailed in paragraph (b) of this section for sales of energy or capacity or paragraph (c) of this section for sales of ancillary services or may propose mitigation tailored to its own particular circumstances to eliminate its ability to exercise market power. Mitigation will apply only to the market(s) in which the Seller is found, or presumed, to have market power.

        (b) Default mitigation for sales of energy or capacity consists of three distinct products:

        (1) Sales of power of one week or less priced at the Seller's incremental cost plus a 10 percent adder;

        (2) Sales of power of more than one week but less than one year priced at no higher than a cost-based ceiling reflecting the costs of the unit(s) expected to provide the service; and

        (3) New contracts filed for review under section 205 of the Federal Power Act for sales of power for one year or more priced at a rate not to exceed embedded cost of service.

        (c) Default mitigation for sales of ancillary services consist of: (1) A cap based on the relevant OATT ancillary service rate of the purchasing transmission operator; or (2) the results of a competitive solicitation that meets the Commission's requirements for transparency, definition, evaluation, and competitiveness.

        § 35.39   Affiliate restrictions.

#### § § 35.39

        (a)  As a condition of obtaining and retaining market-based rate authority, the conditions provided in this section, including the restriction on affiliate sales of electric energy and all other affiliate provisions, must be satisfied on an ongoing basis, unless otherwise authorized by Commission rule or order. Failure to satisfy these conditions will constitute a violation of the Seller's market-based rate tariff.

        (b)  As a condition of obtaining and retaining market-based rate authority, no wholesale sale of electric energy or capacity may be made between a franchised public utility with captive customers and a market-regulated power sales affiliate without first receiving Commission authorization for the transaction under section 205 of the Federal Power Act. All authorizations to engage in affiliate wholesale sales of electric energy or capacity must be listed in a Seller's market-based rate tariff.

        (c)  (1) For the purpose of this paragraph, entities acting on behalf of and for the benefit of a franchised public utility with captive customers (such as entities controlling or marketing power from the electrical generation assets of the franchised public utility) are considered part of the franchised public utility. Entities acting on behalf of and for the benefit of the market-regulated power sales affiliates of a franchised public utility with captive customers are considered part of the market-regulated power sales affiliates.

        (2) (i) To the maximum extent practical, the employees of a market-regulated power sales affiliate must operate separately from the employees of any affiliated franchised public utility with captive customers.

        (ii) Franchised public utilities with captive customers are permitted to share support employees, and field and maintenance employees with their market-regulated power sales affiliates. Franchised public utilities with captive customers are also permitted to share senior officers and boards of directors with their market-regulated power sales affiliates; provided, however, that the shared officers and boards of directors must not participate in directing, organizing or executing generation or market functions.

        (iii) Notwithstanding any other restrictions in this section, in emergency circumstances affecting system reliability, a market-regulated power sales affiliate and a franchised public utility with captive customers may take steps necessary to keep the bulk power system in operation. A franchised public utility with captive customers or the market-regulated power sales affiliate must report to the Commission and disclose to the public on its Web site, each emergency that resulted in any deviation from the restrictions of section 35.39, within 24 hours of such deviation.

        (d)  (1) A franchised public utility with captive customers may not share market information with a market-regulated power sales affiliate if the sharing could be used to the detriment of captive customers, unless simultaneously disclosed to the public.

        (2) Permissibly shared support employees, field and maintenance employees and senior officers and board of directors under §§ 35.39(c)(2)(ii) may have access to information covered by the prohibition of § 35.39(d)(1), subject to the no-conduit provision in § 35.39(g).

        (e)  (1) Unless otherwise permitted by Commission rule or order, sales of any non-power goods or services by a franchised public utility with captive customers, to a market-regulated power sales affiliate must be at the higher of cost or market price.

        (2) Unless otherwise permitted by Commission rule or order, sales of any non-power goods or services by a market-regulated power sales affiliate to an affiliated franchised public utility with captive customers may not be at a price above market.

        (f)  (1) Unless otherwise permitted by Commission rule or order, to the extent a market-regulated power sales affiliate seeks to broker power for an affiliated franchised public utility with captive customers:

        (i) The market-regulated power sales affiliate must offer the franchised public utility's power first;

        (ii) The arrangement between the market-regulated power sales affiliate and the franchised public utility must be non-exclusive; and

        (iii) The market-regulated power sales affiliate may not accept any fees in conjunction with any brokering services it performs for an affiliated franchised public utility.

        (2) Unless otherwise permitted by Commission rule or order, to the extent a franchised public utility with captive customers seeks to broker power for a market-regulated power sales affiliate:

        (i) The franchised public utility must charge the higher of its costs for the service or the market price for such services;

        (ii) The franchised public utility must market its own power first, and simultaneously make public (on the Internet) any market information shared with its affiliate during the brokering; and

        (iii) The franchised public utility must post on the Internet the actual brokering charges imposed.

        (g)  A franchised public utility with captive customers and a market-regulated power sales affiliate are prohibited from using anyone, including asset managers, as a conduit to circumvent the affiliate restrictions in §§ 35.39(a) through (g).

        (h)  If necessary, any affiliate restrictions regarding separation of functions, power sales or non-power goods and services transactions, or brokering involving two or more franchised public utilities, one or more of whom has captive customers and one or more of whom does not have captive customers, will be imposed on a case-by-case basis.

        § 35.40   Ancillary services.

#### § § 35.40

        A Seller may make sales of ancillary services at market-based rates only if it has been authorized by the Commission and only in specific geographic markets as the Commission has authorized.

        § 35.41   Market behavior rules.

#### § § 35.41

        (a)  Where a Seller participates in a Commission-approved organized market, Seller must operate and schedule generating facilities, undertake maintenance, declare outages, and commit or otherwise bid supply in a manner that complies with the Commission-approved rules and regulations of the applicable market. A Seller is not required to bid or supply electric energy or other electricity products unless such requirement is a part of a separate Commission-approved tariff or is a requirement applicable to Seller through Seller's participation in a Commission-approved organized market.

        (b)  A Seller must provide accurate and factual information and not submit false or misleading information, or omit material information, in any communication with the Commission, Commission-approved market monitors, Commission-approved regional transmission organizations, Commission-approved independent system operators, or jurisdictional transmission providers, unless Seller exercises due diligence to prevent such occurrences.

        (c)  To the extent a Seller engages in reporting of transactions to publishers of electric or natural gas price indices, Seller must provide accurate and factual information, and not knowingly submit false or misleading information or omit material information to any such publisher, by reporting its transactions in a manner consistent with the procedures set forth in the  issued by the Commission in Docket No. PL03-3-000, and any clarifications thereto. Seller must identify as part of its Electric Quarterly Report filing requirement in § 35.10b of this chapter the publishers of electricity and natural gas indices to which it reports its transactions. In addition, Seller must adhere to any other standards and requirements for price reporting as the Commission may order.

        (d)  A Seller must retain, for a period of five years, all data and information upon which it billed the prices it charged for the electric energy or electric energy products it sold pursuant to Seller's market-based rate tariff, and the prices it reported for use in price indices.

        § 35.42   Change in status reporting requirement.

#### § § 35.42

        (a) As a condition of obtaining and retaining market-based rate authority, a Seller must timely report to the Commission any change in status that would reflect a departure from the characteristics the Commission relied upon in granting market-based rate authority. A change in status includes, but is not limited to, the following:

        (1) Ownership or control of generation capacity or long-term firm purchases of capacity and/or energy that results in cumulative net increases ( the difference between increases and decreases in affiliated generation capacity) of 100 MW or more of capacity based on nameplate or seasonal capacity ratings, or, for solar photovoltaic facilities, nameplate capacity, or, for other energy-limited resources, nameplate or five-year average capacity factors, in any individual relevant geographic market, or of inputs to electric power production, or ownership, operation or control of transmission facilities; or

        (2) Affiliation with any entity not disclosed in the application for market-based rate authority that:

        (i) Owns or controls generation facilities or has long-term firm purchases of capacity and/or energy that results in cumulative net increases ( the difference between increases and decreases in affiliated generation capacity) of 100 MW or more of capacity based on nameplate or seasonal capacity ratings, or, for solar photovoltaic facilities, nameplate capacity, or, for other energy-limited resources, nameplate or five-year average capacity factors, in any individual relevant geographic market;

        (ii) Owns or controls inputs to electric power production;

        (iii) Owns, operates or controls transmission facilities;

        (iv) Has a franchised service area; or

        (v) Is an ultimate upstream affiliate.

        (b) Any change in status subject to paragraph (a) of this section must be filed quarterly. Power sales contracts with future delivery are reportable once the physical delivery has begun. Sellers shall file change in status in accordance with the following schedule: For the period from January 1 through March 31, file by April 30; for the period from April 1 through June 30, file by July 31; for the period July 1 through September 30, file by October 31; and for the period October 1 through December 31, file by January 31. Failure to timely file a change in status constitutes a tariff violation.

        (c) Changes in status must be prepared in conformance with the instructions posted on the Commission's website.

        (d) A Seller must report on a monthly basis changes to its previously-submitted relational database information, excluding updates to the horizontal market power screens. These submissions must be made by the 15th day of the month following the change. The submission must be prepared in conformance with the instructions posted on the Commission's website.

        § 35.43   Generally.

#### § § 35.43

        (a) For purposes of this subpart:

        (1)  of a specified company means:

        (i) For any person other than an exempt wholesale generator:

        (A) Any person that directly or indirectly owns, controls, or holds with power to vote, 10 percent or more of the outstanding voting securities of the specified company;

        (B) Any company 10 percent or more of whose outstanding voting securities are owned, controlled, or held with power to vote, directly or indirectly, by the specified company;

        (C) Any person or class of persons that the Commission determines, after appropriate notice and opportunity for hearing, to stand in such relation to the specified company that there is liable to be an absence of arm's-length bargaining in transactions between them as to make it necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors or consumers that the person be treated as an affiliate; and

        (D) Any person that is under common control with the specified company.

        (E) For purposes of paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section, owning, controlling or holding with power to vote, less than 10 percent of the outstanding voting securities of a specified company creates a rebuttable presumption of lack of control.

        (ii) For any exempt wholesale generator (as defined under § 366.1 of this chapter), consistent with section 214 of the Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C. 824m), which provides that “affiliate” will have the same meaning as provided in section 2(a) of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 (15 U.S.C. 79b(a)(11)):

        (A) Any person that directly or indirectly owns, controls, or holds with power to vote, 5 percent or more of the outstanding voting securities of the specified company;

        (B) Any company 5 percent or more of whose outstanding voting securities are owned, controlled, or held with power to vote, directly or indirectly, by the specified company;

        (C) Any individual who is an officer or director of the specified company, or of any company which is an affiliate thereof under paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(A) of this section; and

        (D) Any person or class of persons that the Commission determines, after appropriate notice and opportunity for hearing, to stand in such relation to the specified company that there is liable to be an absence of arm's-length bargaining in transactions between them as to make it necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors or consumers that the person be treated as an affiliate.

        (2)  means any wholesale or retail electric energy customers served by a franchised public utility under cost-based regulation.

        (3)  means a public utility with a franchised service obligation under state law.

        (4)  means any power seller affiliate other than a franchised public utility, including a power marketer, exempt wholesale generator, qualifying facility or other power seller affiliate, whose power sales are regulated in whole or in part on a market-rate basis.

        (5)  means any affiliate that is not in the power sales or transmission business, other than a local gas distribution company or an interstate natural gas pipeline.

        (b) The provisions of this subpart apply to all franchised public utilities that have captive customers or that own or provide transmission service over jurisdictional transmission facilities.

        § 35.44   Protections against affiliate cross-subsidization.

#### § § 35.44

        (a)  No wholesale sale of electric energy may be made between a franchised public utility with captive customers and a market-regulated power sales affiliate without first receiving Commission authorization for the transaction under section 205 of the Federal Power Act. This requirement does not apply to energy sales from a qualifying facility, as defined by 18 CFR 292.101, made under market-based rate authority granted by the Commission.

        (b)  (1) Unless otherwise permitted by Commission rule or order, and except as permitted by paragraph (b)(4) of this section, sales of any non-power goods or services by a franchised public utility that has captive customers or that owns or provides transmission service over jurisdictional transmission facilities, including sales made to or through its affiliated exempt wholesale generators or qualifying facilities, to a market-regulated power sales affiliate or non-utility affiliate must be at the higher of cost or market price.

        (2) Unless otherwise permitted by Commission rule or order, and except as permitted by paragraphs (b)(3) and (b)(4) of this section, a franchised public utility that has captive customers or that owns or provides transmission service over jurisdictional transmission facilities, may not purchase or receive non-power goods and services from a market-regulated power sales affiliate or a non-utility affiliate at a price above market.

        (3) A franchised public utility that has captive customers or that owns or provides transmission service over jurisdictional transmission facilities, may only purchase or receive non-power goods and services from a centralized service company at cost.

        (4) A company in a single-state holding company system, as defined in § 366.3(c)(1) of this chapter, may provide general administrative and management non-power goods and services to, or receive such goods and services from, other companies in the same holding company system, at cost, provided that the only parties to transactions involving these non-power goods and services are affiliates or associate companies, as defined in § 366.1 of this chapter, of a holding company in the holding company system.

        (c)  Where the price of fuel from a company-owned or controlled source is found or presumed under § 35.14 to be reasonable and includable in the adjustment clause, transactions involving that fuel shall be exempt from the affiliate price restrictions in § 35.44(b).

      Subpart K—Cybersecurity Investment Provisions

**Source:** Source: 88 FR 28377, May 3, 2023, unless otherwise noted.

        § 35.48   Cybersecurity investment.

#### § § 35.48

        (a)  This section establishes rules for incentive-based rate treatments for utilities with rates on file with the Commission that voluntarily make cybersecurity investments as described in this section.

        (b)  As used in this section:

        means any technology, operational capability, or service, including computer hardware, software, or a related asset, that enhances the security posture of public utilities through improvements in the ability to protect against, detect, respond to, or recover from a cybersecurity threat (as defined in section 102 of the Cybersecurity Act of 2015 (6 U.S.C. 1501)).

        means information relating to Advanced Cybersecurity Technology or proposed Advanced Cybersecurity Technology that is generated by or provided to the Commission or another Federal agency. Pursuant to FPA section 219A(g), _Advanced Cybersecurity Technology Information_ is considered to be Critical Electric Infrastructure Information.

        has the same meaning as defined in 18 CFR 388.113.

        has the same meaning as defined in § 39.1 of this subchapter.

        has the same meaning as defined in § 39.1 of this subchapter.

        (c)  The Commission will authorize incentive-based rate treatment for a utility that voluntarily makes an investment in Advanced Cybersecurity Technology and for a utility that voluntarily participates in a cybersecurity threat information sharing program under this section, provided that the utility meets the requirements of this section and the utility demonstrates that the resulting rate is just and reasonable and not unduly discriminatory or preferential, as required by sections 205 and 206 of the Federal Power Act. Incentive-based rate treatment is available to both public and non-public utilities that have or will have a rate on file with the Commission. A utility may request a single incentive-based rate treatment as specified in paragraph (f) of this section for an eligible cybersecurity investment that meets the eligibility criteria set forth in paragraph (d) of this section.

        (d)  Pursuant to paragraphs (e) through (j) of this section, a utility may receive incentive-based rate treatment for a cybersecurity investment that:

        (1) Materially improves cybersecurity through either Advanced Cybersecurity Technology or participation in a cybersecurity threat information sharing program; and

        (2) Is not already mandated by the Reliability Standards as maintained by the Electric Reliability Organization, or otherwise mandated by local, State, or Federal law, decision, or directive; otherwise legally mandated; or an action taken in response to a Federal or State agency merger condition, consent decree from Federal or State agency, or settlement agreement that resolves a dispute between a utility and a public or private party.

        (e)  A utility shall demonstrate to the Commission that a proposed cybersecurity investment satisfies the eligibility criteria in paragraph (d) of this section. Such demonstration shall show that the cybersecurity investment fulfills at least one of the provisions in the following paragraphs (e)(1) through (3):

        (1) A utility shall demonstrate that a cybersecurity investment qualifies as one or more of the pre-qualified cybersecurity investments. The Commission shall rebuttably presume that pre-qualified cybersecurity investments satisfy the eligibility criteria. The Commission shall maintain a list on its website of pre-qualified cybersecurity investments and shall update such list from time to time either subject to notice and comment procedures or in a rulemaking.

        (2) A utility shall demonstrate that a cybersecurity investment satisfies each of the eligibility criteria in paragraph (d) of this section. The Commission shall not presume that such demonstration satisfies the eligibility criteria.

        (3) A utility shall demonstrate that it will make cybersecurity investments to comply with a Reliability Standard that is approved by the Commission but has not yet taken effect as approved by the Commission. The Commission shall not presume that such demonstration satisfies the eligibility criteria. Any incentives authorized by the Commission pursuant to this section shall terminate when the Reliability Standard takes effect.

        (f)  For purposes of this section, incentive-based rate treatment shall mean deferral of expenses as a regulatory asset.

        (g)  (1) A deferred Advanced Cybersecurity Technology regulatory asset whose costs are typically expensed shall be:

        (i) Amortized over a period of up to five years;

        (ii) Limited to expenses incurred in the first five years following Commission approval of the incentive;

        (iii) Limited to ongoing expenses that the applicable utility was not already undertaking more than three months prior to filing an incentive request; and

        (iv) Terminated when the cybersecurity investment or activity that serves as the basis of that incentive becomes mandatory.

        (2) An incentive granted for participation in a qualified cybersecurity threat information sharing program will not be subject to the five-year duration limitation provisions of paragraph (g)(1)(ii) of this section for as long as the utility participates in the qualified cybersecurity threat information sharing program and such participation is not mandatory as to the utility. A utility participating in a qualified cybersecurity threat information sharing program is eligible to continue deferring expenses associated with such participation, which for each year would be amortized over the next five years.

        (h)  For the purpose of this section, a utility's request for incentive based-rate treatments for one or more cybersecurity investments must be made in a filing pursuant to section 205 of the Federal Power Act, or in a petition for a declaratory order that precedes a filing pursuant to section 205 of the Federal Power Act. Utilities may file such a request either as a part of a general rate request or on a single-issue basis. Such a request shall include a detailed explanation to include the following information:

        (1) A demonstration that the cybersecurity investment satisfies the eligibility criteria, which includes an attestation that cybersecurity investment is not mandatory, as required by paragraph (d)(2) of this section, and that the resulting rate is just and reasonable and not unduly discriminatory or preferential;

        (2) A detailed description of relevant cybersecurity expenses, including whether such cybersecurity expenses are:

        (i) Associated with third-party provision of hardware, software, computing networking services, and/or cybersecurity monitoring services;

        (ii) For training to implement network analysis and monitoring programs, and/or other cybersecurity protocols; and/or

        (iii) Other cybersecurity expenses;

        (3) Estimates of the cost of such cybersecurity expenses;

        (4) When the cybersecurity expenses are expected to be incurred; and

        (5) An attestation that the utility either has not already been undertaking duplicative or materially the same expenses for more than three months or that the utility is participating in a cybersecurity threat information-sharing program for the expense at issue. In the case of cybersecurity investments made to comply with a Reliability Standard that is approved by the Commission but has not yet taken effect as approved by the Commission pursuant to paragraph (e)(3) of this section, the utility must attest that it has not already been undertaking duplicative or materially the same expenses for more than three months prior to the date that the Commission's approval of the Reliability Standard becomes effective.

        (i)  A utility that has received Commission approval for incentive-based rate treatment under this section shall make an annual informational filing on June 1, provided that the utility has received such Commission approval at least 60 days prior to June 1 of that year. A utility that receives Commission approval of an incentive-based rate treatment under this section later than 60 days prior to June 1 shall submit an annual informational filing beginning on June 1 of the following year. The annual filing shall detail the specific cybersecurity investments that were made pursuant to the Commission's approval and the corresponding FERC account used. The annual informational filing shall describe the deferred expenses in sufficient detail to demonstrate that such expenses are specifically related to the cybersecurity investment granted incentives and not for ongoing services including system maintenance, surveillance, and other labor costs. Utilities shall provide a detailed description of any material changes in the nature of such expenses from prior year informational filings.

        (j)  As appropriate, any CEII submitted to the Commission in a utility's incentive application made pursuant to paragraph (h) of this section or contained in its reporting requirements made pursuant to paragraph (i) of this section shall be filed consistent with part 388 of this title.

#### § § 37.4

      § 37.5   Obligations of Transmission Providers and Responsible Parties.

#### § § 37.5

      (a) Each Transmission Provider is required to provide for the operation of an OASIS, either individually or jointly with other Transmission Providers, in accordance with the requirements of this Part. The Transmission Provider may delegate this responsibility to a Responsible Party such as another Transmission Provider, an Independent System Operator, a Regional Transmission Group, or a Regional Reliability Council.

      (b) A Responsible Party must provide access to an OASIS providing standardized information relevant to the availability of transmission capacity, prices, and other information (as described in this part) pertaining to the transmission system for which it is responsible.

      (c) A Responsible Party may not deny or restrict access to an OASIS user merely because that user makes automated computer-to-computer file transfers or queries, or extensive requests for data.

      (d) In the event that an OASIS user's grossly inefficient method of accessing an OASIS node or obtaining information from the node seriously degrades the performance of the node, a Responsible Party may limit a user's access to the OASIS node without prior Commission approval. The Responsible Party must immediately contact the OASIS user to resolve the problem. Notification of the restriction must be made to the Commission within two business days of the incident and include a description of the problem. A closure report describing how the problem was resolved must be filed with the Commission within one week of the incident.

      (e) In the event that an OASIS user makes an error in a query, the Responsible Party can block the affected query and notify the user of the nature of the error. The OASIS user must correct the error before making any additional queries. If there is a dispute over whether an error has occurred, the procedures in paragraph (d) of this section apply.

      (f) Transmission Providers must provide “read only” access to the OASIS to Commission staff and the staffs of State regulatory authorities, at no cost, after such staff members have complied with the requisite registration procedures.

      (1) Make requests for transmission services offered by Transmission Providers, Resellers and other providers of ancillary services, request the designation of a network resource, and request the termination of the designation of a network resource;

      (2) View and download in standard formats, using standard protocols, information regarding the transmission system necessary to enable prudent business decision making;

      (3) Post, view, upload and download information regarding available products and desired services;

      (4) Clearly identify the degree to which transmission service requests or schedules were denied or interrupted;

      (5) Obtain access, in electronic format, to information to support available transmission capability calculations and historical transmission service requests and schedules for various audit purposes; and

      (6) Make file transfers and automated computer-to-computer file transfers and queries as defined by the Standards and Communications Protocols Document.

      (b)  The available transfer capability on the Transmission Provider's system (ATC) and the total transfer capability (TTC) of that system shall be calculated and posted for each Posted Path as set out in this section.

      (1)  For purposes of this section the terms listed below have the following meanings:

      (i)  means any control area to control area interconnection; any path for which service is denied, curtailed or interrupted for more than 24 hours in the past 12 months; and any path for which a customer requests to have ATC or TTC posted. For this last category, the posting must continue for 180 days and thereafter until 180 days have elapsed from the most recent request for service over the requested path. For purposes of this definition, an hour includes any part of an hour during which service was denied, curtailed or interrupted.

      (ii)  means any posted path having an ATC less than or equal to 25 percent of TTC at any time during the preceding 168 hours or for which ATC has been calculated to be less than or equal to 25 percent of TTC for any period during the current hour or the next 168 hours.

      (iii)  means any posted path not determined to be a constrained posted path.

      (iv) The word  as used in the definition of “posted path”, means all facilities connecting two adjacent systems or control areas.

      (v)  or  means the transfer capability remaining in the physical transmission network for further commercial activity over and above already committed uses, or such definition as contained in Commission-approved Reliability Standards.

      (vi)  or  means the amount of electric power that can be moved or transferred reliably from one area to another area of the interconnected transmission systems by way of all transmission lines (or paths) between those areas under specified system conditions, or such definition as contained in Commission-approved Reliability Standards.

      (vii)  or  means the amount of TTC preserved by the Transmission Provider for load-serving entities, whose loads are located on that Transmission Provider's system, to enable access by the load-serving entities to generation from interconnected systems to meet generation reliability requirements, or such definition as contained in Commission-approved Reliability Standards.

      (viii)  or  means the amount of TTC necessary to provide reasonable assurance that the interconnected transmission network will be secure, or such definition as contained in Commission-approved Reliability Standards.

      (2)  (i) Information used to calculate any posting of ATC and TTC must be dated and time-stamped and all calculations shall be performed according to consistently applied methodologies referenced in the Transmission Provider's transmission tariff and shall be based on Commission-approved Reliability Standards, business practice and electronic communication standards, and related implementation documents, as well as current industry practices, standards and criteria. Such calculations shall be conducted in a manner that is transparent, consistent with anticipated system conditions and outages for the relevant timeframe, and not unduly discriminatory or preferential.

      (ii) On request, the Responsible Party must make all data used to calculate ATC, TTC, CBM, and TRM for any constrained posted paths publicly available (including the limiting element(s) and the cause of the limit (, thermal, voltage, stability), as well as load forecast assumptions) in electronic form within one week of the posting. The information is required to be provided only in the electronic format in which it was created, along with any necessary decoding instructions, at a cost limited to the cost of reproducing the material. This information is to be retained for six months after the applicable posting period.

      (iii) System planning studies, facilities studies, and specific network impact studies performed for customers or the Transmission Provider's own network resources are to be made publicly available in electronic form on request and a list of such studies shall be posted on the OASIS. A study is required to be provided only in the electronic format in which it was created, along with any necessary decoding instructions, at a cost limited to the cost of reproducing the material. These studies are to be retained for five years.

      (3)  The ATC, TTC, CBM, and TRM for all Posted Paths must be posted in megawatts by specific direction and in the manner prescribed in this subsection.

      (i) —(A)

      () The posting shall show ATC, TTC, CBM, and TRM for a 30-day period. For this period postings shall be: by the hour, for the current hour and the _1_68 hours next following; and thereafter, by the day. If the Transmission Provider charges separately for on-peak and off-peak periods in its tariff, ATC, TTC, CBM, and TRM will be posted daily for each period.

      () Postings shall also be made by the month, showing for the current month and the 1_2_ months next following.

      () If planning and specific requested transmission studies have been done, seasonal capability shall be posted for the year following the current year and for each year following to the end of the planning horizon but not to exceed 10 years.

      (B)  The posting shall show ATC, TTC, CBM and TRM for a _3_0-day period by the hour and days prescribed under paragraph (b)(3)(i)(A)() of this section and, if so requested, by the month and year as prescribed under paragraph (b)(3)(i)(A) () and () of this section. The posting of non-firm ATC and TTC shall show CBM as zero.

      (C)

      () The capability posted under paragraphs (b)(3)(i)(A) and (B) of this section must be updated when transactions are reserved or service ends or whenever the estimate for the path changes by more than _1_0 percent.

      () All updating of hourly information shall be made on the hour.

      () When the monthly and yearly capability posted under paragraphs (b)(_3_)(i)(A) and (B) of this section are updated because of a change in TTC by more than 10 percent, the Transmission Provider shall post a brief, but specific, narrative explanation of the reason for the update. This narrative should include, the specific events which gave rise to the update (, scheduling of planned outages and occurrence of forced transmission outages, de-ratings of transmission facilities, scheduling of planned generation outages and occurrence of forced generation outages, changes in load forecast, changes in new facilities' in-service dates, or other events or assumption changes) and new values for ATC on the path (as opposed to all points on the network).

      () When the monthly and yearly capability posted under paragraphs (b)(3)(i)(A) and (B) of this section remain unchanged at a value of zero for a period of six months, the Transmission Provider shall post a brief, but specific, narrative explanation of the reason for the unavailability of ATC.

      (ii)

      (A) Postings of firm and nonfirm ATC, TTC, CBM, and TRM shall be posted separately by the day, showing for the current day and the next six days following and thereafter, by the month for the 12 months next following. If the Transmission Provider charges separately for on-peak and off-peak periods in its tariff, ATC, TTC, CBM, and TRM will be posted separately for the current day and the next six days following for each period. These postings are to be updated whenever the ATC changes by more than 20 percent of the Path's TTC.

      (2) Transmission Providers must provide a downloadable file of their complete tariffs in the same electronic format as the tariff that is filed with the Commission. Transmission Providers also must provide a link to all of the rules, standards and practices that relate to transmission services posted on the Transmission Providers' public Web sites.

      (3) Any offer of a discount for any transmission service made by the Transmission Provider must be announced to all potential customers solely by posting on the OASIS.

      (4) For any transaction for transmission service agreed to by the Transmission Provider and a customer, the Transmission Provider (at the time when ATC must be adjusted in response to the transaction), must post on the OASIS (and make available for download) information describing the transaction (including: price; quantity; points of receipt and delivery; length and type of service; identification of whether the transaction involves the Transmission Provider's wholesale merchant function or any affiliate; identification of what, if any, ancillary service transactions are associated with this transmission service transaction; and any other relevant terms and conditions) and shall keep such information posted on the OASIS for at least 30 days. A record of the transaction must be retained and kept available as part of the audit log required in § 37.7.

      (5) Customers choosing to use the OASIS to offer for resale transmission capacity they have purchased must post relevant information to the same OASIS as used by the Transmission Provider from whom the Reseller purchased the transmission capacity. This information must be posted on the same display page, using the same tables, as similar capability being sold by the Transmission Provider, and the information must be contained in the same downloadable files as the Transmission Provider's own available capability.

      (d)  (1) Any ancillary service required to be provided or offered under the  tariff prescribed by part 35 of this chapter must be posted with the price of that service.

A record of the transaction must be retained and kept available as part of the audit log required in § 37.7.

      (4) Any other interconnected operations service offered by the Transmission Provider may be posted, with the price for that service.

      (5) Any entity offering an ancillary service shall have the right to post the offering of that service on the OASIS if the service is one required to be offered by the Transmission Provider under the  tariff prescribed by part 35 of this chapter. Any entity may also post any other interconnected operations service voluntarily offered by the Transmission Provider. Postings by customers and third parties must be on the same page, and in the same format, as postings of the Transmission Provider.

      (e) —(1)  (i) All requests for transmission and ancillary service offered by Transmission Providers under the  tariff, including requests for discounts, and all requests to designate or terminate a network resource, must be made on the OASIS and posted prior to the Transmission Provider responding to the request, except as discussed in paragraphs (e)(1)(ii) and (iii) of this section. The Transmission Provider must post all requests for transmission service, for ancillary service, and for the designation or termination of a network resource comparably. Requests for transmission service, ancillary service, and to designate and terminate a network resource, as well as the responses to such requests, must be conducted in accordance with the Transmission Provider's tariff, the Federal Power Act, and Commission regulations.

      (ii) The requirement in paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section, to post requests for transmission and ancillary service offered by Transmission Providers under the  tariff, including requests for discounts, prior to the Transmission Provider responding to the request, does not apply to requests for next-hour service made during Phase I.

      (iii) In the event that a discount is being requested for ancillary services that are not in support of basic transmission service provided by the Transmission Provider, such request need not be posted on the OASIS.

      (iv) In processing a request for transmission or ancillary service, the Responsible Party shall post the same information as required in paragraphs (c)(4) and (d)(3) of this section, and the following information: the date and time when the request is made, its place in any queue, the status of that request, and the result (accepted, denied, withdrawn). In processing a request to designate or terminate the designation of a network resource, the Responsible Party shall post the date and time when the request is made.

      (v) For any request to designate or terminate a network resource, the Transmission Provider (at the time when the request is received), must post on the OASIS (and make available for download) information describing the request (including: name of requestor, identification of the resource, effective time for the designation or termination, identification of whether the transaction involves the Transmission Provider's wholesale merchant function or any affiliate; and any other relevant terms and conditions) and shall keep such information posted on the OASIS for at least 30 days. A record of the transaction must be retained and kept available as part of the audit log required in § 37.7.

      (vi) The Transmission Provider shall post a list of its current designated network resources and all network customers' current designated network resources on OASIS. The list of network resources should include the name of the resource, its geographic and electrical location, its total installed capacity, and the amount of capacity to be designated as a network resource.

      (iii) Any offer to adjust operation of the Transmission Provider's System to accommodate the denied request must be posted and made available to all Transmission Customers at the same time.

      (3)  (i) When any transaction is curtailed or interrupted, the Transmission Provider must post notice of the curtailment or interruption on the OASIS, and the Transmission Provider must state on the OASIS the reason why the transaction could not be continued or completed.

      (ii) Information to support any such curtailment or interruption, including the operating status of the facilities involved in the constraint or interruption, must be maintained and made available upon request, to the curtailed or interrupted customer, the Commission's Staff, and any other person who requests it, for five years.

      (iii) Any offer to adjust the operation of the Transmission Provider's system to restore a curtailed or interrupted transaction must be posted and made available to all curtailed and interrupted Transmission Customers at the same time.

      (f)  Information on transmission service schedules must be recorded by the entity scheduling the transmission service and must be available on the OASIS for download. Transmission service schedules must be posted no later than seven calendar days from the start of the transmission service.

      (g)  (1) The posting of other communications related to transmission services must be provided for by the Responsible Party. These communications may include “want ads” and “other communications” (such as using the OASIS as a Transmission-related conference space or to provide transmission-related messaging services between OASIS users). Such postings carry no obligation to respond on the part of any market participant.

      (2) The Responsible Party is responsible for posting other transmission-related communications in conformance with the instructions provided by the third party on whose behalf the communication is posted. It is the responsibility of the third party requesting such a posting to ensure the accuracy of the information to be posted.

      (3) Notices of transfers of personnel shall be posted as described in § 358.4(c). The posting requirements are the same as those provided in § 37.7 for audit data postings.

      (4) Logs detailing the circumstances and manner in which a Transmission Provider or Responsible Party exercised its discretion under any terms of the tariff shall be posted as described in § 358.5(c)(4). The posting requirements are the same as those provided in § 37.7 for audit data postings.

      (h)  (1) For each calendar quarter, the Responsible Party must post the set of measures detailed in paragraph (h)(1)(i) through paragraph (h)(1)(vi) of this section related to the Responsible Party's processing of transmission service request system impact studies and facilities studies.

      (2) Within ninety (90) days of the application of the Electric Reliability Organization, the Regional Entity, or other affected person, and after notice and opportunity for public comment, the Commission will issue a final order determining whether the state action is inconsistent with a Reliability Standard, taking into consideration any recommendation of the Electric Reliability Organization and the state.

      (c) The Commission, after consultation with the Electric Reliability Organization and the state taking action, may stay the effectiveness of the state action, pending the Commission's issuance of a final order.

      § 39.13   Regional Advisory Bodies.

#### § § 39.13

      (a) The Commission will establish a Regional Advisory Body on the petition of at least two-thirds of the states within a region that have more than one-half of their electric load served within the region.

      (b) A petition to establish a Regional Advisory Body shall include a statement that the Regional Advisory Body is composed of one member from each participating state in the region, appointed by the governor of each state, and may include representatives of agencies, states and provinces outside the United States.

      (2) Whether a Reliability Standard proposed to apply within the region is just, reasonable, not unduly discriminatory or preferential, and in the public interest;

      (3) Whether fees for all activities under this part proposed to be assessed within the region are just, reasonable, not unduly discriminatory or preferential, and in the public interest; and

      (4) Any other responsibilities requested by the Commission.

#### § § 41.1

        (a)  This part applies to all audits conducted by the Commission or its staff under authority of the Federal Power Act except for Electric Reliability Organization audits conducted pursuant to the authority of part 39 of the Commission's regulations.

        (b)  An audit conducted by the Commission's staff under authority of the Federal Power Act may result in a notice of deficiency or audit report or similar document containing a finding or findings that the audited person has not complied with a requirement of the Commission with respect to, but not limited to, the following: A filed tariff or tariffs, contracts, data, records, accounts, books, communications or papers relevant to the audit of the audited person; matters under the Standards of Conduct or the Code of Conduct; and the activities or operations of the audited person. The notice of deficiency, audit report or similar document may also contain one or more proposed remedies that address findings of noncompliance. Where such findings, with or without proposed remedies, appear in a notice of deficiency, audit report or similar document, such document shall be provided to the audited person, and the finding or findings, and any proposed remedies, shall be noted and explained. The audited person shall timely indicate in a written response any and all findings or proposed remedies, or both, in any combination, with which the audited person disagrees. The audited person shall have 15 days from the date it is sent the notice of deficiency, audit report or similar document to provide a written response to the audit staff indicating any and all findings or proposed remedies, or both, in any combination, with which the audited person disagrees, and such further time as the audit staff may provide in writing to the audited person at the time the document is sent to the audited person.

Any initial order that the Commission subsequently may issue with respect to the notice of deficiency, audit report or similar document shall note, but not address on the merits, the finding or findings, or the proposed remedy or remedies, or both, in any combination, with which the audited person disagreed. The Commission shall provide the audited person 30 days to respond to the initial Commission order concerning a notice of deficiency, audit report or similar document with respect to the finding or findings or any proposed remedy or remedies, or both, in any combination, with which it disagreed.

The Commission expects that identification of questionable matters by the independent accountant will facilitate their early resolution and that the independent accountant will seek advisory rulings by the Commission on such items. This examination shall be deemed supplementary to periodic Commission examinations of compliance.

        (b) Beginning January 1, 1976, and each year thereafter, only independent certified public accountants, or independent licensed public accountants who were licensed on or before December 31, 1970, will be authorized to conduct annual audits and to certify to compliance in all material respects, of those schedules as are indicated in the General Instructions set out in the Annual Report, Form No. 1, with the Commission's applicable Uniform System of Accounts, published accounting releases and all other regulatory matters.

For such utility or licensee operating on a non-calendar fiscal year, the letter or report of the independent accountant certifying approval must be filed within 150 days of the close of the company's fiscal year; the letter or report must also identify which, if any, of the examined schedules do not conform to the Commission's requirements and shall describe the discrepancies that exist. The Commission will not be bound by a certification of compliance made by an independent accountant pursuant to this paragraph.

        The Commission will not recognize any certified public accountant or public accountant through December 31, 1975, who is not in fact independent. Beginning January 1, 1976, and each year thereafter, the Commission will recognize only independent certified public accountants, or independent licensed public accountants who were licensed on or before December 31, 1970, who are in fact independent. For example, an accountant will not be considered independent with respect to any person or any of its parents or subsidiaries in whom he has, or had during the period of report, any direct financial interest. The Commission will determine the fact of independence by considering all the relevant circumstances including evidence bearing on the relationships between the accountant and that person or any affiliate thereof.

    PART 42—LONG-TERM FIRM TRANSMISSION RIGHTS IN ORGANIZED ELECTRICITY MARKETS

### Part 42

**Authority:** Authority: 16 U.S.C. 791a-825r and section 217 of the Federal Power Act, 16 U.S.C. 824q.

**Source:** Source: Order 681, 71 FR 43619, Aug. 1, 2006, unless otherwise noted.

      § 42.1   Requirement that Transmission Organizations with Organized Electricity Markets Offer Long-Term Firm Transmission Rights.

#### § § 42.1

      (a)  This section requires a transmission organization with one or more organized electricity markets (administered either by it or by another entity) to make available long-term firm transmission rights, pursuant to section 217(b)(4) of the Federal Power Act, that satisfy each of the guidelines set forth in paragraph (d) of this section. This section does not require that a specific type of long-term firm transmission right be made available, and is intended to permit transmission organizations flexibility in satisfying the guidelines set forth in paragraph (d) of this section.

      (b)  As used in this section:

      (1)  means a Regional _Transmission Organization_, Independent System Operator, independent transmission provider, or other independent transmission organization finally approved by the Commission for the operation of transmission facilities.

      (2)  means a distribution utility or an electric utility that has a service obligation.

      (3)  means a requirement applicable to, or the exercise of authority granted to, an electric utility under Federal, State, or local law or under long-term contracts to provide electric service to end-users or to a distribution utility.

      (4)  means an auction-based day ahead and real time wholesale market where a single entity receives offers to sell and bids to buy electric energy and/or ancillary services from multiple sellers and buyers and determines which sales and purchases are completed and at what prices, based on formal rules contained in Commission-approved tariffs, and where the prices are used by a transmission organization for establishing transmission usage charges.

      (c)  (1) Every public utility that is a transmission organization and that owns, operates or controls facilities used for the transmission of electric energy in interstate commerce and has one or more organized electricity markets (administered either by it or by another entity) must file with the Commission, no later than January 29, 2007, one of the following:

      (i) Tariff sheets and rate schedules that make available long-term firm transmission rights that satisfy each of the guidelines set forth in paragraph (d) of this section; or

      (ii) An explanation of how its current tariff and rate schedules already provide for long-term firm transmission rights that satisfy each of the guidelines set forth in paragraph (d) of this section.

      (2) Any transmission organization approved by the Commission for operation after January 29, 2007 that has one or more organized electricity markets (administered either by it or by another entity) will be required to satisfy this general rule.

      (3) Filings made in compliance with this paragraph (c) must explain how the transmission organization's transmission planning and expansion procedures will accommodate long-term firm transmission rights, including but not limited to how the transmission organization will ensure that allocated long-term firm transmission rights remain feasible over their entire term.

      (4) Each transmission organization subject to this general rule must also make its transmission planning and expansion procedures and plans publicly available, including (but not limited to) both the actual plans and any underlying information used to develop the plans.

      (d)  Transmission organizations subject to paragraph (c) of this section must make available long-term firm transmission rights that satisfy the following guidelines:

      (1) The long-term firm transmission right should specify a source (injection node or nodes) and sink (withdrawal node or nodes), and a quantity (MW).

      (2) The long-term firm transmission right must provide a hedge against day-ahead locational marginal pricing congestion charges or other direct assignment of congestion costs for the period covered and quantity specified. Once allocated, the financial coverage provided by a financial long-term right should not be modified during its term (the “full funding” requirement) except in the case of extraordinary circumstances or through voluntary agreement of both the holder of the right and the transmission organization.

      (3) Long-term firm transmission rights made feasible by transmission upgrades or expansions must be available upon request to any party that pays for such upgrades or expansions in accordance with the transmission organization's prevailing cost allocation methods for upgrades or expansions.

      (4) Long-term firm transmission rights must be made available with term lengths (and/or rights to renewal) that are sufficient to meet the needs of load serving entities to hedge long-term power supply arrangements made or planned to satisfy a service obligation. The length of term of renewals may be different from the original term. Transmission organizations may propose rules specifying the length of terms and use of renewal rights to provide long-term coverage, but must be able to offer firm coverage for at least a 10 year period.

      (5) Load serving entities must have priority over non-load serving entities in the allocation of long-term firm transmission rights that are supported by existing capacity. The transmission organization may propose reasonable limits on the amount of existing capacity used to support long-term firm transmission rights.

      (6) A long-term transmission right held by a load serving entity to support a service obligation should be re-assignable to another entity that acquires that service obligation.

      (7) The initial allocation of the long-term firm transmission rights shall not require recipients to participate in an auction.

      § 50.12   Applicant code of conduct for landowner engagement.

#### § § 50.12

      Under section 216(e)(1) of the Federal Power Act, any applicant that may, upon receipt of a permit, seek to acquire the necessary right-of-way by the exercise of the right of eminent domain must demonstrate to the Commission that it has made good faith efforts to engage with landowners and other stakeholders early in the applicable permitting process. An applicant's commitment to and compliance with the Applicant Code of Conduct during the permitting process is one way to demonstrate to the Commission that such good faith efforts have been made with respect to affected landowners.

      (a)  To promote good faith engagement with affected landowners, applicants committing to comply with the Applicant Code of Conduct must for the duration of the pre-filing and application review processes:

      (1) Develop and maintain a log of discussions with affected landowners, organized by name and property address, that includes:

      (i) The name of the affected landowner;

      (ii) The substance of the items discussed;

      (iii) The nature of the contact (such as in-person, virtual meeting, telephone, electronic mail);

      (iv) The date of the contact; and

      (v) The status of discussions with the affected landowner following the contact, including any permissions granted, negotiations, or future meetings scheduled.

      (2) In addition to the Pre-filing Notification required by § 50.4(c)(1)(i) and (ii), provide to each affected landowner, prior to, during, or within 3 business days of the first contact, a document that, at a minimum, includes: a description of the project, a description of the Commission and its role, a map of the project route, an explanation that affected landowners may request from applicants copies of discussion log entries that pertain to their property and how to make such requests, and the Landowner Bill of Rights in the form described in § 50.4(c)(2)(ii)(B). If the first contact with the affected landowner is in-person, the applicant must offer to provide the affected landowner at least one paper copy of the document. If the first contact with the affected landowner is by telephone, text, or electronic mail, the applicant may provide the affected landowner with a copy of the document by electronic means or by first class mail, at the affected landowner's preference. The applicant must review the provisions of the document with the affected landowner upon request.

      (3) Ensure that any representative acting on the applicant's behalf states their full name, title, and employer, as well as the name of the applicant that they represent, and presents a photo identification badge at the beginning of any discussion with an affected landowner, and provides the representative's and applicant's contact information, including mailing address, telephone number, and electronic mail address, prior to the end of the discussion.

      (4) Ensure that all communications with affected landowners are factually correct. The applicant must correct any statements made by it or any representative acting on its behalf that it becomes aware were:

      (i) Inaccurate when made; or

      (ii) Have been rendered inaccurate based on subsequent events, within three business days of discovery of any such inaccuracy.

      (5) Ensure that communications with affected landowners do not misrepresent the status of the discussions or negotiations between the parties. Provide an affected landowner upon request a copy of any discussion log entries that pertain to that affected landowner's property.

      (6) Provide affected landowners with updated contact information whenever an applicant's contact information changes.

      (7) Communicate respectfully with affected landowners and avoid harassing, coercive, manipulative, or intimidating communications or high-pressure tactics.

      (8) Except as otherwise provided by State, Tribal, or local law, abide by an affected landowner's request to end the communication or for the applicant or its representative to leave the affected landowner's property.

      (9) Except as otherwise provided by State, Tribal, or local law, obtain an affected landowner's permission prior to entering the property, including for survey or environmental assessment, and leave the property without argument or delay if the affected landowner revokes permission.

      (10) Refrain from discussing an affected landowner's communications or negotiations status with any other affected landowner.

      (11) Provide the affected landowner with a copy of any appraisal that has been prepared by, or on behalf of, the applicant for that affected landowner's property, if any, before discussing the value of the property in question.

      (12) Ensure that any representative acting on the applicant's behalf complies with all provisions of the Applicant Code of Conduct described in this paragraph (a).

      (b)  Applicants committing to comply with the Applicant Code of Conduct must:

      (1) File, as part of the pre-filing request required by § 50.5(c), an affirmative statement that the applicant intends to comply with the Applicant Code of Conduct.

      (2) Include, as part of the monthly status reports required by § 50.5(e)(11):

      (i) An affirmation that the applicant and its representatives have, to the best of their knowledge, complied with the Applicant Code of Conduct during the month in question; or

      (ii) A detailed explanation of any instances of non-compliance with the Applicant Code of Conduct during the month in question and any remedial actions taken or planned.

      (3) Identify, in a filing with the Commission or as part of the monthly status reports required by § 50.5(e)(11), any known instances of non-compliance that were not disclosed in prior monthly status reports and explain any remedial actions taken in the current month to address instances of non-compliance occurring in prior months.

      (4) File monthly status reports providing the information required in paragraphs (b)(2) and (3) of this section, for the duration of the application review process.

      (c)  Applicants not committing to comply with the Applicant Code of Conduct must:

      (1) File, as part of the pre-filing request required by § 50.5(c):

      (i) An affirmative statement that the applicant intends to rely on an alternative method of demonstrating that it meets the good faith efforts standard;

      (ii) A detailed explanation of the alternative method of demonstrating that it meets the good faith efforts standard, including any commitments to recordkeeping, information-sharing, or other conduct;

      (iii) An explanation of how the alternative method is equal to or better than compliance with the Applicant Code of Conduct as a means to ensure the good faith efforts standard is met;

      (iv) An explanation, for each component of the Applicant Code of Conduct with which it does not comply, why it did not follow that component; and

      (v) An explanation, for each component of the Applicant Code of Conduct with which it does not comply, why the alternative method is an equal or better means to ensure the good faith standard is met notwithstanding that deviation from the Applicant Code of Conduct.

    31.  are assets and liabilities that result from rate actions of regulatory agencies. Regulatory assets and liabilities arise from specific revenues, expenses, gains, or losses that would have been included in net income determination in one period under the general requirements of the Uniform System of Accounts but for it being probable:

    A. that such items will be included in a different period(s) for purposes of developing the rates the utility is authorized to charge for its utility services; or

    B.  (RD&D) in the case of Major utilities means expenditures incurred by public utilities and licensees either directly or through another person or organization (such as research institute, industry association, foundation, university, engineering company or similar contractor) in pursuing research, development, and demonstration activities including experiment, design, installation, construction, or operation. This definition includes expenditures for the implementation or development of new and/or existing concepts until technically feasible and commercially feasible operations are verified. Such research, development, and demonstration costs should be reasonably related to the existing or future utility business, broadly defined, of the public utility or licensee or in the environment in which it operates or expects to operate. The term includes, but is not limited to: All such costs incidental to the design, development or implementation of an experimental facility, a plant process, a product, a formula, an invention, a system or similar items, and the improvement of already existing items of a like nature; amounts expended in connection with the proposed development and/or proposed delivery of alternate sources of electricity; and the costs of obtaining its own patent, such as attorney's fees expended in making and perfecting a patent application. The term includes preliminary investigations and detailed planning of specific projects for securing for customers non-conventional electric power supplies that rely on technology that has not been verified previously to be feasible. The term does not include expenditures for efficiency surveys; studies of management, management techniques and organization; consumer surveys, advertising, promotions, or items of a like nature.

    33.  (formerly earned surplus) means the accumulated net income of the utility less distribution to stockholders and transfers to other capital accounts.

    36.  means the time between the date electric plant is includible in electric plant in service, or electric plant leased to others, and the date of its retirement. If depreciation is accounted for on a production basis rather than on a time basis, then service life should be measured in terms of the appropriate unit of production.

    37.  means the difference between original cost and net salvage value of electric plant.

    38.  means a _State_ admitted to the Union, the District of Columbia, and any organized Territory of the United States.

    39.  in the case of Major utilities means a company which is controlled by the utility through ownership of voting stock. (See  item 5B, ). A corporate joint venture in which a corporation is owned by a small group of businesses as a separate and specific business or project for the mutual benefit of the members of the group is a subsidiary company for the purposes of this system of accounts.

    40.  as used herein and when not otherwise indicated in the context, means any public utility or licensee to which this system of accounts is applicable.

    1.

    A. For purpose of applying the system of accounts prescribed by the Commission, electric utilities and licensees are divided into classes, as follows:

    (1)  Utilities and licensees that had, in each of the last three consecutive years, sales or transmission service that exceeded any one or more of the following:

    (a) One million megawatt-hours of total sales;

    (b) 100 megawatt-hours of sales for resale;

    (c) 500 megawatt-hours of power exchanges delivered; or

    (d) 500 megawatt-hours of wheeling for others (deliveries plus losses).

    (2)  Utilities and licensees that are not classified as  (as defined above), and had total sales in each of the last three consecutive years of 10,000 megawatt-hours or more.

    (3)  Utilities and licensees formerly designated as Major or Nonmajor that have ceased operation but continue to collect amounts pursuant to a Commission-accepted tariff or rate schedule, or a Commission order.

    B. This system applies to _Major_, _Nonmajor_, and Nonoperating utilities and licensees. Provisions have been incorporated into this system for those entities which, prior to January 1, 1984, were applying the Commission's Uniform System of Accounts Prescribed for Public Utilities and Licensees subject to the Provisions of the Federal Power Act (Class C and Class D) [part 104 of this chapter, now revoked]. The notations () and () have been used to indicate those instructions and accounts from previous systems and classifications, which by definition, are not interchangeable without causing a loss of detail for the Major (previously Class A and Class B) or an increase in detail burden on the Nonmajor (previously Class C and Class D).

    C. The class to which any utility or licensee belongs will originally be determined by its annual megawatt hours in each of the last three consecutive years, or in the case of a newly established entity, the projected data shall be the basis. Subsequent changes in classification shall be made as necessary when the megawatt-hours for each of the three immediately preceding years shall exceed the upper limit, or be less than the lower limit of the classification previously applicable to the utility.

    D. Any utility may, at its option, adopt the system of accounts prescribed by the Commission for any larger class of utilities.

    2.

    A. Each utility shall keep its books of account, and all other books, records, and memoranda which support the entries in such books of account so as to be able to furnish readily full information as to any item included in any account. Each entry shall be supported by such detailed information as will permit ready identification, analysis, and verification of all facts relevant thereto.

    B. The books and records referred to herein include not only accounting records in a limited technical sense, but all other records, such as minute books, stock books, reports, correspondence, memoranda, etc., which may be useful in developing the history of or facts regarding any transaction.

    C. No utility shall destroy any such books or records unless the destruction thereof is permitted by rules and regulations of the Commission.

    D. In addition to prescribed accounts, clearing accounts, temporary or experimental accounts, and subdivisions of any accounts, may be kept, provided the integrity of the prescribed accounts is not impaired.

    E. All amounts included in the accounts prescribed herein for electric plant and operating expenses shall be just and reasonable and any payments or accruals by the utility in excess of just and reasonable charges shall be included in account 426.5, Other Deductions.

    F. The arrangement or sequence of the accounts prescribed herein shall not be controlling as to the arrangement or sequence in report forms which may be prescribed by the Commission.

    3.

    A. The account numbering plan used herein consists of a system of three-digit whole numbers as follows:

    B. In certain instances, numbers have been skipped in order to allow for possible later expansion or to permit better coordination with the numbering system for other utility departments.

    C. The numbers prefixed to account titles are to be considered as parts of the titles. Each utility, however, may adopt for its own purposes a different system of account numbers (see also general instruction 2D) provided that the numbers herein prescribed shall appear in the descriptive headings of the ledger accounts and in the various sources of original entry; however, if a utility uses a different group of account numbers and it is not practicable to show the prescribed account numbers in the various sources of original entry, such reference to the prescribed account numbers may be omitted from the various sources of original entry. Moreover, each utility using different account numbers for its own purposes shall keep readily available a list of such account numbers which it uses and a reconciliation of such account numbers with the account numbers provided herein. It is intended that the utility's records shall be so kept as to permit ready analysis by prescribed accounts (by direct reference to sources of original entry to the extent practicable) and to permit preparation of financial and operating statements directly from such records at the end of each accounting period according to the prescribed accounts.

    4.

    Each utility shall keep its books on a monthly basis so that for each month all transactions applicable thereto, as nearly as may be ascertained, shall be entered in the books of the utility. Amounts applicable or assignable to specific utility departments shall be so segregated monthly. Each utility shall close its books at the end of each calendar year unless otherwise authorized by the Commission.

    5.

    To maintain uniformity of accounting, utilities shall submit questions of doubtful interpretation to the Commission for consideration and decision.

    6.

    Lists of  appearing in the texts of the accounts or elsewhere herein are for the purpose of more clearly indicating the application of the prescribed accounting. The lists are intended to be representative, but not exhaustive. The appearance of an item in a list warrants the inclusion of the item in the account mentioned only when the text of the account also indicates inclusion inasmuch as the same item frequently appears in more than one list. The proper entry in each instance must be determined by the texts of the accounts.

    7.

    It is the intent that net income shall reflect all items of profit and loss during the period with the exception of prior period adjustments as described in paragraph 7.1 and long-term debt as described in paragraph 17 below. Those items related to the effects of events and transactions which have occurred during the current period and which are of unusual nature and infrequent occurrence shall be considered extraordinary items. Accordingly, they will be events and transactions of significant effect which are abnormal and significantly different from the ordinary and typical activities of the company, and which would not reasonably be expected to recur in the forseeable future. (In determining significance, items should be considered individually and not in the aggregate. However, the effects of a series of related transactions arising from a single specific and identifiable event or plan of action should be considered in the aggregate. To be considered as extraordinary under the above guidelines, an item should be more than approximately 5 percent of income, computed before extraordinary items. Commission approval must be obtained to treat an item of less than 5 percent, as extraordinary. (See accounts 434 and 435.)

    7.1

    A. Items of profit and loss related to the following shall be accounted for as prior period adjustments and excluded from the determination of net income for the current year:

    (1) Correction of an error in the financial statements of a prior year.

    (2) Adjustments that result from realization of income tax benefits of pre-acquisition operating loss carryforwards of purchased subsidiaries.

    B. All other items of profit and loss recognized during the year shall be included in the determination of net income for that year.

    8.

    Whenever a financial statement is required by the Commission, if it is known that a transaction has occurred which affects the accounts but the amount involved in the transaction and its effect upon the accounts cannot be determined with absolute accuracy, the amount shall be estimated and such estimated amount included in the proper accounts. The utility is not required to anticipate minor items which would not appreciably affect the accounts.

    9.

    The charges to electric plant, operating expense and other accounts for services and expenses of employees engaged in activities chargeable to various accounts, such as construction, maintenance, and operations, shall be based upon the actual time engaged in the respective classes of work, or in case that method is impracticable, upon the basis of a study of the time actually engaged during a representative period.

    10.

    Underlying accounting data shall be maintained so that the distribution of the cost of labor charged direct to the various accounts will be readily available. Such underlying data shall permit a reasonably accurate distribution to be made of the cost of labor charged initially to clearing accounts so that the total labor cost may be classified among construction, cost of removal, electric operating functions (steam generation, nuclear generation, hydraulic generation, transmission, distribution, etc.) and nonutility operations.

    11.

    A. The utility is required to keep its accounts on the accrual basis. This requires the inclusion in its accounts of all known transactions of appreciable amount which affect the accounts. If bills covering such transactions have not been received or rendered, the amounts shall be estimated and appropriate adjustments made when the bills are received.

    B. When payments are made in advance for items such as insurance, rents, taxes or interest the amount applicable to future periods shall be charged to account 165, Prepayments, and spread over the periods to which applicable by credits to account 165, and charges to the accounts appropriate for the expenditure.

    12.

    Separate records shall be maintained by electric _plant_ accounts of the book cost of each plant owned, including additions by the utility to plant leased from others, and of the cost of operating and maintaining each plant owned or operated. The term  as here used means each generating station and each transmission line or appropriate group of transmission lines.

    13.

    If the utility also operates other utility departments, such as gas, water, etc., it shall keep such accounts for the other departments as may be prescribed by proper authority and in the absence of prescribed accounts, it shall keep such accounts as are proper or necessary to reflect the results of operating each such department. It is not intended that proprietary and similar accounts which apply to the utility as a whole shall be departmentalized.

    14.

    Each utility shall keep its accounts and records so as to be able to furnish accurately and expeditiously statements of all transactions with associated companies. The statements may be required to show the general nature of the transactions, the amounts involved therein and the amounts included in each account prescribed herein with respect to such transactions. Transactions with associated companies shall be recorded in the appropriate accounts for transactions of the same nature. Nothing herein contained, however, shall be construed as restraining the utility from subdividing accounts for the purpose of recording separately transactions with associated companies.

    15.

    Contingent assets represent a possible source of value to the utility contingent upon the fulfillment of conditions regarded as uncertain. Contingent liabilities include items which may under certain conditions become obligations of the utility but which are neither direct nor assumed liabilities at the date of the balance sheet. The utility shall be prepared to give a complete statement of significant contingent assets and liabilities (including cumulative dividends on preference stock) in its annual report and at such other times as may be requested by the Commission.

    16.

    The accounts or records of each licensee shall be so kept as to show for each project (including pumped storage) under license;

    (a) The actual legitimate original cost of the project, including the original cost (or fair value, as determined under section 23 of the Federal Power Act) of the original project, the original cost of additions thereto and betterments thereof and credits for property retired from service, as determined under the Commission's regulations;

    (b) The charges for operation and maintenance of the project property directly assignable to the project;

    (c) The credits and debits to the depreciation and amortization accounts, and the balances in such accounts;

    (d) The credits and debits to operating revenue, income, and retained earnings accounts that can be identified with and directly assigned to the project.

    17.

    A.  A separate premium, discount and expense account shall be maintained for each class and series of long-term debt (including receivers' certificates) is- sued or assumed by the utility. The premium will be recorded in account 225, Unamortized Premium on Long-Term Debt, the discount will be recorded in account 226, Unamortized Discount on Long-Term Debt—Debit, and the expense of issuance shall be recorded in account 181, Unamortized Debt Expense.

    The premium, discount and expense shall be amortized over the life of the respective issues under a plan which will distribute the amounts equitably over the life of the securities. The amortization shall be on a monthly basis, and amounts thereof relating to discount and expense shall be charged to account 428, Amortization of Debt Discount and Expense. The amounts relating to premium shall be credited to account 429, Amortization of Premium on Debt—Credit.

    B.  When long-term debt is reacquired or redeemed without being converted into another form of long-term debt and when the transaction is not in connection with a refunding operation (primarily redemptions for sinking fund purposes), the difference between the amount paid upon reacquisition and the face value; plus any un- amortized premium less any related unamortized debt expense and reacquisition costs; or less any unamortized discount, related debt expense and reacquisition costs applicable to the debt redeemed, retired and canceled, shall be included in account 189, Unamortized Loss on Reacquired Debt, or account 257, Unamortized Gain on Reacquired Debt, as appropriate. The utility shall amortize the recorded amounts equally on a monthly basis over the remaining life of the respective security issues (old original debt). The amounts so amortized shall be charged to account 428.1, Amortization of Loss on Reacquired Debt, or credited to account 429.1, Amortization of Gain on Reacquired Debt—Credit, as appropriate.

    C.  When the redemption of one issue or series of bonds or other long-term obligations is financed by another issue or series before the maturity date of the first issue, the difference between the amount paid upon refunding and the face value; plus any unamortized premium less related debt expense or less any unamortized discount and related debt expense, applicable to the debt refunded, shall be included in account 189, Unamortized Loss on Reacquired Debt, or account 257, Unamortized Gain on Reacquired Debt, as appropriate. The utility may elect to account for such amounts as follows:

    (1) Write them off immediately when the amounts are insignificant.

    (2) Amortize them by equal monthly amounts over the remainder of the original life of the issue retired, or

    (3) Amortize them by equal monthly amounts over the life of the new issue.

    Once an election is made, it shall be applied on a consistent basis. The amounts in (1), (2) or (3) above shall be charged to account 428.1. Amortization of Loss on Reacquired Debt, or credited to account 429.1, Amortization of Gain on Reacquired Debt—Credit, as appropriate.

    D. Under methods (2) and (3) above, the increase or reduction in current income taxes resulting from the reacquisition should be apportioned over the remainder of the original life of the issue retired or over the life of the new issue, as appropriate, as directed more specifically in paragraphs E and F below.

    E. When the utility recognizes the loss in the year of reacquisition as a tax deduction, account 410.1, Provision for Deferred Income Taxes, Utility Operating Income, shall be debited and account 283, Accumulated Deferred Income Taxes—Other, shall be credited with the amount of the related tax effect, such amount to be allocated to the periods affected in accordance with the provisions of account 283.

    F. When the utility chooses to recognize the gain in the year of reacquisition as a taxable gain, account 411.1, Provision for Deferred Income Taxes—Credit, Utility Operating Income, shall be credited and account 190, Accumulated Deferred Income Taxes, shall be debited with the amount of the related tax effect, such amount to be allocated to the periods affected in accordance with the provisions of account 190.

    G. When the utility chooses to use the optional privilege of deferring the tax on the gain attributable to the reacquisition of debt by reducing the depreciable basis of utility property for tax purposes, pursuant to section 108 of the Internal Revenue Code, the related tax effects shall be deferred as the income is recognized for accounting purposes, and the deferred amounts shall be amortized over the life of the associated property on a vintage year basis. Account 410.1, Provision for Deferred Income Taxes, Utility Operating Income, shall be debited, and account 282, Accumulated Deferred Income Taxes—Other Property shall be credited with an amount equal to the estimated income tax effect applicable to the portion of the income, attributable to reacquired debt, recognized for accounting purposes during the period. Account 282 shall be debited and account 411.1, Provision for Deferred Income Taxes—Credit, Utility Operating Income, shall be credited with an amount equal to the estimated income tax effects, during the life of the property, attributable to the reduction in the depreciable basis for tax purposes.

    H. The tax effects relating to gain or loss shall be allocated as above to utility operations except in cases where a portion of the debt reacquired is directly applicable to nonutility operations. In that event, the related portion of the tax effects shall be allocated to nonutility operations. Where it can be established that reacquired debt is generally applicable to both utility and nonutility operations, the tax effects shall be allocated between utility and nonutility operations based on the ratio of net investment in utility plant to net investment in nonutility plant.

    I. Premium, discount, or expense on debt shall not be included as an element in the cost of construction or acquisition of property (tangible or intangible), except under the provisions of account 432, Allowance for Borrowed Funds Used During Construction—Credit.

    J.  Where a regulatory authority or a group of regulatory authorities having prime rate jurisdiction over the utility specifically disallows the rate principle of amortizing gains or losses on reacquisition of long-term debt without refunding, and does not apply the gain or loss to reduce interest charges in computing the allowed rate of return for rate purposes, then the following alternate method may be used to account for gains or losses relating to reacquisition of long-term debt, with or without refunding.

    (1) The difference between the amount paid upon reacquisition of any long-term debt and the face value, adjusted for unamortized discount, expenses or premium, as the case may be, applicable to the debt redeemed shall be recognized currently in income and recorded in account 421, Miscellaneous Nonoperating Income, or account 426.5, Other Deductions.

    (2) When this alternate method of accounting is used, the utility shall include a footnote to each financial statement, prepared for public use, explaining why this method is being used along with the treatment given for ratemaking purposes.

    18.

    A. Where there are timing differences between the periods in which transactions affect taxable income and the periods in which they enter into the determination of pretax accounting income, the income tax effects of such transactions are to be recognized in the periods in which the differences between book accounting income and taxable income arise and in the periods in which the differences reverse using the deferred tax method. In general, comprehensive interperiod tax allocation should be followed whenever transactions enter into the determination of pretax accounting income for the period even though some transactions may affect the determination of taxes payable in a different period, as further qualified below.

    B. Utilities are not required to utilize comprehensive interperiod income tax allocation until the deferred income taxes are included as an expense in the rate level by the regulatory authority having rate jurisdiction over the utility. Where comprehensive interperiod tax allocation accounting is not practiced the utility shall include as a note to each financial statement, prepared for public use, a footnote explanation setting forth the utility's accounting policies with respect to interperiod tax allocation and describing the treatment for ratemaking purposes of the tax timing differences by regulatory authorities having rate jurisdiction.

    C. Should the utility be subject to more than one agency having rate jurisdiction, its accounts shall appropriately reflect the ratemaking treatment (deferral or flow through) of each jurisdiction.

    D. Once comprehensive interperiod tax allocation has been initiated either in whole or in part it shall be practiced on a consistent basis and shall not be changed or discontinued without prior Commission approval.

    E. Tax effects deferred currently will be recorded as deferred debits or deferred credits in accounts 190, Accumulated Deferred Income Taxes, 281, Accumulated Deferred Income Tax- es—Accelerated Amortization Property, 282, Accumulated Deferred Income Taxes—Other Property, and 283, Accumulated Deferred Income Taxes—Other, as appropriate. The resulting amounts recorded in these accounts shall be disposed of as prescribed in this system of accounts or as otherwise authorized by the Commission.

    19.

    A. If at its inception a lease meets one or more of the following criteria, the lease shall be classified as a capital lease. Otherwise, it shall be classified as an operating lease.

    (1) The lease transfers ownership of the property to the lessee by the end of the lease term

    (2) The lease contains a bargain purchase option.

    (3) The lease term is equal to 75 percent or more of the estimated economic life of the leased property. However, if the beginning of the lease term falls within the last 25 percent of the total estimated economic life of the leased property, including earlier years of use, this criterion shall not be used for purposes of classifying the lease.

    (4) The present value at the beginning of the lease term of the minimum lease payments, excluding that portion of the payments representing executory costs such as insurance, maintenance, and taxes to be paid by the lessor, including any profit thereon, equals or exceeds 90 percent of the excess of the fair value of the leased property to the lessor at the inception of the lease over any related investment tax credit retained by the lessor and expected to be realized by the lessor. However, if the beginning of the lease term falls within the last 25 percent of the total estimated economic life of the leased property, including earlier years of use, this criterion shall not be used for purposes of classifying the lease. The lessee utility shall compute the present value of the minimum lease payments using its incremental borrowing rate, unless (A) it is practicable for the utility to learn the implicit rate computed by the lessor, and (B) the implicit rate computed by the lessor is less than the lessee's incremental borrowing rate. If both of those conditions are met, the lessee shall use the implicit rate.

    B. If at any time the lessee and lessor agree to change the provisions of the lease, other than by renewing the lease or extending its term, in a manner that would have resulted in a different classification of the lease under the criteria in paragraph A had the changed terms been in effect at the inception of the lease, the revised agreement shall be considered as a new agreement over its term, and the criteria in paragraph A shall be applied for purposes of classifying the new lease. Likewise, any action that extends the lease beyond the expiration of the existing lease term, such as the exercise of a lease renewal option other than those already included in the lease term, shall be considered as a new agreement and shall be classified according to the above provisions. Changes in estimates (for example, changes in estimates of the economic life or of the residual value of the leased property) or changes in circumstances (for example, default by the lessee) shall not give rise to a new classification of a lease for accounting purposes.

    20.

    A. All leases shall be classified as either capital or operating leases. The accounting for capitalized leases is effective January 1, 1984, except for the retroactive classification of certain leases which, in accordance with FASB No. 71, will not be required to be capitalized until after a three year transition period. For the purpose of reporting to the FERC, the transition period shall be deemed to end December 31, 1986.

    B. The utility shall record a capital lease as an asset in account 101.1, Property under Capital Leases, Account 120.6, Nuclear Fuel under Capital Leases, or account 121, Nonutility Property, as appropriate, and an obligation in account 227, Obligations under Capital Leases—Noncurrent, or account 243, Obligations under Capital Leases—Current, at an amount equal to the present value at the beginning of the lease term of minimum lease payments during the lease term, excluding that portion of the payments representing executory costs such as insurance, maintenance, and taxes to be paid by the lessor, together with any profit thereon. However, if the amount so determined exceeds the fair value of the leased property at the inception of the lease, the amount recorded as the asset and obligation shall be the fair value.

    C. The utility, as a lessee, shall recognize an asset retirement obligation ( General Instruction 25) arising from the plant under a capital lease unless the obligation is recorded as an asset and liability under a capital lease. The utility shall record the asset retirement cost by debiting account 101.1, Property under capital leases, or account 120.6, Nuclear fuel under capital leases, or account 121, Nonutility property, as appropriate, and crediting the liability for the asset retirement obligation in account 230, Asset retirement obligations. Asset retirement costs recorded in account 101.1, account 120.6, or account 121 shall be amortized by charging rent expense ( Operating Expense Instruction 3), or account 518, Nuclear fuel expense (Major only), or account 421, Miscellaneous nonoperating income, as appropriate, and crediting a separate subaccount of the account in which the asset retirement costs are recorded. Charges for the periodic accretion of the liability in account 230, Asset retirement obligations, shall be recorded by a charge to account 411.10, Accretion expense, for electric utility plant, and account 421, Miscellaneous nonoperating income, for nonutility plant and a credit to account 230, Asset retirement obligations.

    D. Rental payments on all leases shall be charged to rent expense, fuel expense, construction work in progress, or other appropriate accounts as they become payable.

    E. For a capital lease, for each period during the lease term, the amounts recorded for the asset and obligation shall be reduced by an amount equal to the portion of each lease payment that would have been allocated to the reduction of the obligation, if the payment had been treated as a payment on an installment obligation (liability) and allocated between interest expense and a reduction of the obligation so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance.

    21.

    A. Public utilities owning allowances and environmental credits for operational purposes, shall account for such allowances and environmental credits at historical cost in account 158.1, Allowance Inventory, account 158.2, Allowances Withheld, account 158.3, Bundled Environmental Credits Inventory, or account 158.4, Unbundled Environmental Credits Inventory, as appropriate.

    B. Allowances and environmental credits acquired for speculative purposes shall be accounted for in account 124, Other Investments. When purchased allowances and environmental credits acquired for speculative purposes become eligible for use in different years, and the allocation of the purchase cost cannot be determined by fair value, the purchase cost allocated to allowances and environmental credits of each vintage shall be determined through use of a present-value based measurement. The interest rate used in the present-value measurement shall be the utility's incremental borrowing rate, in the month in which the allowances and environmental credits are acquired, for a loan with a term similar to the period that it will hold the allowances and environmental credits and in an amount equal to the purchase price.

    C. The underlying records supporting operational allowances and environmental credits recorded in account 158.1, account 158.2, account 158.3, and account 158.4 shall be maintained in sufficient detail at historical costs and provide the number of allowances and environmental credits and the related cost by vintage year, including allowances and environmental credits acquired at zero cost.

    D. Issuances from inventory included in account 158.1, account 158.2, account 158.3, and account 158.4 shall be accounted for on a vintage basis using a monthly weighted-average method of historical cost determination. The cost of eligible allowances and environmental credits not used in the current year, shall be transferred to the vintage for the immediately following year.

    E. Account 158.1 shall be credited and account 509, Allowances, debited concurrent with the monthly remittance of the allowances to be charged to expense based on each month's emissions. Account 158.3 and account 158.4 shall be credited and account 555.2, Bundled Environmental Credits, and account 555.3, Unbundled Environmental Credits, debited, respectively, so that the cost of the environmental credits to be remitted for the year is charged to expense based on each month's usage. This may, in certain circumstances, require allocation of the cost between months on a fractional basis.

    F. In any period in which actual emissions exceed the amount allowable based on eligible allowances owned, the utility shall estimate the cost to acquire the additional allowances needed and charge account 158.1 with the estimated cost and credit the proper liability account. In any period in which a utility records its estimated amount of required environmental credits, the utility shall debit account 158.3 or account 158.4 with the estimated cost and credit the proper liability account. When differences between the estimated and actual costs become known, the adjustments should be made through account 158.1, account 158.3, and account 158.4, as well as account 509, account 555.2, and account 555.3 within a single month, as appropriate.

    G. When a prepayment is made for allowances or environmental credits, the payment is debited to account 165, Prepayments. This accounting is not intended to influence the outcome of any rate treatment.

    H. Penalties assessed by any authoritative agencies shall be charged to account 426.3, Penalties.

    I. Gains on dispositions of allowances and environmental credits, other than those held for speculative purposes, shall be accounted for as follows. First, if there is uncertainty as to the regulatory treatment, the gain shall be deferred in account 254, Other Regulatory Liabilities, pending resolution of the uncertainty. Second, if there is certainty as to the existence of a regulatory liability, the gain will be credited to account 254, with subsequent recognition in income when reductions in charges to customers occur or the liability is otherwise satisfied. Third, all other gains will be credited to account 411.8, Gains from Disposition of Allowances, or account 411.11, Gains from Disposition of Environmental Credits. Losses on disposition of allowances and environmental credits, other than those held for speculative purposes, shall be accounted for as follows. Losses that qualify as regulatory assets shall be charged directly to account 182.3, Other Regulatory Assets. All other losses shall be charged to account 411.9, Losses from Disposition of Allowances, or account 411.12, Losses from Disposition of Environmental Credits. ( Definition No. 31.) Gains or losses on disposition of allowances and environmental credits held for speculative purposes shall be recognized in account 421, Miscellaneous Nonoperating Income, or account 426.5, Other Deductions, as appropriate.

    J. Revenues for environmental credits associated with the sale of energy shall be recorded in the appropriate operating revenue account.

    22.

    A.  Utilities must use a method of depreciation that allocates in a systematic and rational manner the service value of depreciable property over the service life of the property.

    B.  Estimated useful service lives of depreciable property must be supported by engineering, economic, or other depreciation studies.

    C.  Utilities must use percentage rates of depreciation that are based on a method of depreciation that allocates in a systematic and rational manner the service value of depreciable property to the service life of the property. Where composite depreciation rates are used, they should be based on the weighted average estimated useful service lives of the depreciable property comprising the composite group.

    23.

    A. Utilities shall record items of other comprehensive income in account 219, Accumulated other comprehensive income. Amounts included in this account shall be maintained by each category of other comprehensive income. Examples of categories of other comprehensive income include, foreign currency items, minimum pension liability adjustments, unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale type securities and cash flow hedge amounts. Supporting records shall be maintained for account 219 so that the company can readily identify the cumulative amount of other comprehensive income for each item included in this account.

    B. When an item of other comprehensive income enters into the determination of net income in the current or subsequent periods, a reclassification adjustment shall be recorded in account 219 to avoid double counting of that amount.

    C. When it is probable that an item of other comprehensive income will be included in the development of cost-of-service rates in subsequent periods, that amount of unrealized losses or gains will be recorded in Accounts 182.3 or 254 as appropriate.

    24.

    A. Utilities shall recognize derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in the financial statements and measure those instruments at fair value, except those falling within recognized exceptions. Normal purchases or sales are contracts that provide for the purchase or sale of goods that will be delivered in quantities expected to be used or sold by the utility over a reasonable period in the normal course of business. A derivative instrument is a financial instrument or other contract with all of the following characteristics:

    (1) It has one or more underlyings and a notional amount or payment provision. Those terms determine the amount of the settlement or settlements, and, in some cases, whether or not a settlement is required.

    (2) It requires no initial net investment or an initial net investment that is smaller than would be required for other types of contracts that would be expected to have a similar response to changes in market factors.

    (3) Its terms require or permit net settlement, can readily be settled net by a means outside the contract, or provides for delivery of an asset that puts the recipient in a position not substantially different from net settlement.

    B. The accounting for the changes in the fair value of derivative instruments depends upon its intended use and designation. Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments not designated as fair value or cash flow hedges shall be recorded in account 175, derivative instrument assets, or account 244, derivative instrument liabilities, as appropriate, with the gains recorded in account 421, miscellaneous nonoperating income, and losses recorded in account 426.5, other deductions.

    C. A derivative instrument may be specifically designated as a fair value or cash flow hedge. A hedge is used to manage risk to price, interest rates, or foreign currency transactions. A company shall maintain documentation of the hedge relationship at the inception of the hedge that details the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge, the nature of the risk being hedged, and how hedge effectiveness will be determined.

    D. If the utility designates the derivative instrument as a fair value hedge against exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset, liability, or a firm commitment, it shall record the change in fair value of the derivative instrument to account 176, derivative instrument assets-hedges, or account 245, derivative instrument liabilities-hedges, as appropriate, with a corresponding adjustment to the subaccount of the item being hedged. The ineffective portion of the hedge transaction shall be reflected in the same income or expense account that will be used when the hedged item enters into the determination of net income. In the case of a fair value hedge of a firm commitment a new asset or liability is created. As a result of the hedge relationship, the new asset or liability will become part of the carrying amount of the item being hedged.

    E. If the utility designates the derivative instrument as a cash flow hedge against exposure to variable cash flows of a probable forecasted transaction, it shall record changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument in account 176, derivative instrument assets-hedges, or account 245, derivative instrument liabilities-hedges, as appropriate, with a corresponding amount in account 219, accumulated other comprehensive income, for the effective portion of the hedge. The ineffective portion of the hedge transaction shall be reflected in the same income or expense account that will be used when the hedged item enters into the determination of net income. Amounts recorded in other comprehensive income shall be reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods that the hedged forecasted item enters into the determination of net income.

    25.

    A. An  represents a liability for the legal obligation associated with the retirement of a tangible long-lived asset that a company is required to settle as a result of an existing or enacted law, statute, ordinance, or written or oral contract or by legal construction of a contract under the doctrine of promissory estoppel. An  represents the amount capitalized when the liability is recognized for the long-lived asset that gives rise to the legal obligation. The amount recognized for the liability and an associated _asset retirement cost_ shall be stated at the fair value of the _asset retirement obligation_ in the period in which the obligation is incurred.

    B. The utility shall initially record a liability for an asset retirement obligation in account 230, Asset retirement obligations, and charge the associated asset retirement costs to electric utility plant (including accounts 101.1 and 120.6), and nonutility plant, as appropriate, related to the plant that gives rise to the legal obligation. The asset retirement cost shall be depreciated over the useful life of the related asset that gives rise to the obligations. For periods subsequent to the initial recording of the asset retirement obligation, a utility shall recognize the period to period changes of the asset retirement obligation that result from the passage of time due to the accretion of the liability and any subsequent measurement changes to the initial liability for the legal obligation recorded in account 230, Asset retirement obligations, as follows:

    (1) The utility shall record the accretion of the liability by debiting account 411.10, Accretion expense, for electric utility plant, account 413, Expenses of electric plant leased to others, for electric plant leased to others, and account 421, Miscellaneous nonoperating income, for nonutility plant and crediting account 230, Asset retirement obligations; and

    (2) The utility shall recognize any subsequent measurement changes of the liability initially recorded in account 230, Asset retirement obligations, for each specific asset retirement obligation as an adjustment of that liability in account 230 with the corresponding adjustment to electric utility plant, electric plant leased to others, and nonutility plant, as appropriate. The utility shall on a timely basis monitor any measurement changes of the asset retirement obligations.

    C. Gains or losses resulting from the settlement of asset retirement obligations associated with utility plant resulting from the difference between the amount of the liability for the asset retirement obligation included in account 230, Asset retirement obligations, and the actual amount paid to settle the obligation shall be accounted for as follows:

    (1) Gains shall be credited to account 411.6, Gains from disposition of utility plant, and;

    (2) Losses shall be charged to account 411.7, Losses from disposition of utility plant.

    D. Gains or losses on the settlement of asset retirement obligations associated with nonutility plant resulting from the difference between the amount of the liability for the asset retirement obligation in account 230, Asset retirement obligations, and the amount paid to settle the obligation, shall be accounted for as follows:

    (1) Gains shall be credited to account 421, Miscellaneous nonoperating income, and;

    (2) Losses shall be charged to account 426.5, Other deductions.

    E. Separate subsidiary records shall be maintained for each asset retirement obligation showing the initial liability and associated asset retirement cost, any incremental amounts of the liability incurred in subsequent reporting periods for additional layers of the original liability and related asset retirement cost, the accretion of the liability, the subsequent measurement changes to the asset retirement obligation, the depreciation and amortization of the asset retirement costs and related accumulated depreciation, and the settlement date and actual amount paid to settle the obligation. For purposes of analyses a utility shall maintain supporting documentation so as to be able to furnish accurately and expeditiously with respect to each asset retirement obligation the full details of the identity and nature of the legal obligation, the year incurred, the identity of the plant giving rise to the obligation, the full particulars relating to each component and supporting computations related to the measurement of the asset retirement obligation.

    1.

    A. The electric plant accounts provided herein are the same as those contained in the prior system of accounts except for inclusion of accounts for nuclear production plant and some changes in classification in the general equipment accounts. Except for these changes, the balances in the various plant accounts, as determined under the prior system of accounts, should be carried forward. Any remaining balance of plant which has not yet been classified, pursuant to the requirements of the prior system, shall be classified in accordance with the following instructions.

    B. The cost to the utility of its unclassified plant shall be ascertained by analysis of the utility's records. Adjustments shall not be made to record in utility plant accounts amounts previously charged to operating expenses or to income deductions in accordance with the uniform system of accounts in effect at the time or in accordance with the discretion of management as exercised under a uniform system of accounts, or under accounting practices previously followed.

    C. The detailed electric plant accounts (301 to 399, inclusive) shall be stated on the basis of cost to the utility of plant constructed by it and the original cost, estimated if not known, of plant acquired as an operating unit or system. The difference between the original cost, as above, and the cost to the utility of electric plant after giving effect to any accumulated provision for depreciation or amortization shall be recorded in account 114, Electric Plant Acquisition Adjustments. The original cost of electric plant shall be determined by analysis of the utility's records or those of the predecessor or vendor companies with respect to electric plant previously acquired as operating units or systems and the difference between the original cost so determined, less accumulated provisions for depreciation and amortization and the cost to the utility with necessary adjustments for retirements from the date of acquisition, shall be entered in account 114, Electric Plant Acquisition Adjustments. Any difference between the cost of electric plant and its book cost, when not properly includible in other accounts, shall be recorded in account 116, Other Electric Plant Adjustments.

    D. Plant acquired by lease which qualifies as capital lease property under General Instruction 19.  shall be recorded in Account 101.1, Property under Capital Leases, or Account 120.6, Nuclear Fuel under Capital Leases, as appropriate.

    2.

    A. All amounts included in the accounts for electric plant acquired as an operating unit or system, except as otherwise provided in the texts of the intangible plant accounts, shall be stated at the _cost_ incurred by the person who first devoted the property to utility service. All other electric plant shall be included in the accounts at the cost incurred by the utility, except for property acquired by lease which qualifies as capital lease property under General Instruction 19.  and is recorded in Account 101.1, Property under Capital Leases, or Account 120.6, Nuclear Fuel under Capital Leases. Where the term  is used in the detailed plant accounts, it shall have the meaning stated in this paragraph.

    B. When the consideration given for property is other than cash, the value of such consideration shall be determined on a cash basis (see, however, definition 9). In the entry recording such transition, the actual consideration shall be described with sufficient particularity to identify it. The utility shall be prepared to furnish the Commission the particulars of its determination of the cash value of the consideration if other than cash.

    C. When property is purchased under a plan involving deferred payments, no charge shall be made to the electric plant accounts for interest, insurance, or other expenditures occasioned solely by such form of payment.

    D. The electric plant accounts shall not include the cost or other value of electric plant contributed to the company. Contributions in the form of money or its equivalent toward the construction of electric plant shall be credited to accounts charged with the cost of such construction. Plant constructed from contributions of cash or its equivalent shall be shown as a reduction to gross plant constructed when assembling cost data in work orders for posting to plant ledgers of accounts. The accumulated gross costs of plant accumulated in the work order shall be recorded as a debit in the plant ledger of accounts along with the related amount of contributions concurrently be recorded as a credit.

    3.

    A. For Major utilities, the cost of construction properly includible in the electric plant accounts shall include, where applicable, the direct and overhead cost as listed and defined hereunder:

    (1)  includes amounts paid for work performed under contract by other companies, firms, or individuals, costs incident to the award of such contracts, and the inspection of such work.

    (2)  includes the pay and expenses of employees of the utility engaged on construction work, and related workmen's compensation insurance, payroll taxes and similar items of expense. It does not include the pay and expenses of employees which are distributed to construction through clearing accounts nor the pay and expenses included in other items hereunder.

    (3)  includes the purchase price at the point of free delivery plus customs duties, excise taxes, the cost of inspection, loading and transportation, the related stores expenses, and the cost of fabricated materials from the utility's shop. In determining the cost of materials and supplies used for construction, proper allowance shall be made for unused materials and supplies, for materials recovered from temporary structures used in performing the work involved, and for discounts allowed and realized in the purchase of materials and supplies.

    (4)  includes the cost of transporting employees, materials and supplies, tools, purchased equipment, and other work equipment (when not under own power) to and from points of construction. It includes amounts paid to others as well as the cost of operating the utility's own transportation equipment. (See item 5 following.)

    (5)  includes the cost of labor (optional), materials and supplies, depreciation, and other expenses incurred in the maintenance, operation and use of special machines, such as steam shovels, pile drivers, derricks, ditchers, scrapers, material unloaders, and other labor saving machines; also expenditures for rental, maintenance and operation of machines of others. It does not include the cost of small tools and other individual items of small value or short life which are included in the cost of materials and supplies. (See item 3, above.) When a particular construction job requires the use for an extended period of time of special machines, transportation or other equipment, the net book cost thereof, less the appraised or salvage value at time of release from the job, shall be included in the cost of construction.

    (6)  includes the proportion of the expense of the utility's shop department assignable to construction work except that the cost of fabricated materials from the utility's shop shall be included in

    (7)  includes the cost of protecting the utility's property from fire or other casualties and the cost of preventing damages to others, or to the property of others, including payments for discovery or extinguishment of fires, cost of apprehending and prosecuting incendiaries, witness fees in relation thereto, amounts paid to municipalities and others for fire protection, and other analogous items of expenditures in connection with construction work.

    (8)  includes expenditures or losses in connection with construction work on account of injuries to persons and damages to the property of others; also the cost of investigation of and defense against actions for such injuries and damages. Insurance recovered or recoverable on account of compensation paid for injuries to persons incident to construction shall be credited to the account or accounts to which such compensation is charged Insurance recovered or recoverable on account of property damages incident to construction shall be credited to the account or accounts charged with the cost of the damages.

    (9)  includes payments for and expenses incurred in securing temporary privileges, permits or rights in connection with construction work, such as for the use of private or public property, streets, or highways, but it does not include rents, or amounts chargeable as franchises and consents for which see account 302, Franchises and Consents.

    (16)  includes taxes on physical property (including land) during the period of construction and other taxes properly includible in construction costs before the facilities become available for service.

    (17)  (Major and Nonmajor Utilities) includes the net cost for the period of construction of borrowed funds used for construction purposes and a reasonable rate on other funds when so used, not to exceed, without prior approval of the Commission, allowances computed in accordance with the formula prescribed in paragraph (a) of this subparagraph. No allowance for funds used during construction charges shall be included in these accounts upon expenditures for construction projects which have been abandoned.

    (a) The formula and elements for the computation of the allowance for funds used during construction shall be:

    (b) The rates shall be determined annually. The balances for long-term debt, preferred stock and common equity shall be the actual book balances as of the end of the prior year. The cost rates for long-term debt and preferred stock shall be the weighted average cost determined in the manner indicated in § 35.13 of the Commission's Regulations Under the Federal Power Act. The cost rate for common equity shall be the rate granted common equity in the last rate proceeding before the ratemaking body having primary rate jurisdictions. If such cost rate is not available, the average rate actually earned during the preceding three years shall be used. The short-term debt balances and related cost and the average balance for construction work in progress plus nuclear fuel in process of refinement, conversion, enrichment, and fabrication shall be estimated for the current year with appropriate adjustments as actual data becomes available.

    (18)  The earnings and expenses during construction shall constitute a component of construction costs.

    (a) The earnings shall include revenues received or earned for power produced by generating plants during the construction period and sold or used by the utility. Where such power is sold to an independent purchaser before intermingling with power generated by other plants, the credit shall consist of the selling price of the energy. Where the power generated by a plant under construction is delivered to the utility's electric system for distribution and sale, or is delivered to an associated company, or is delivered to and used by the utility for purposes other than distribution and sale (for manufacturing or industrial use, for example), the credit shall be the fair value of the energy so delivered. The revenues shall also include rentals for lands, buildings etc., and miscellaneous receipts not properly includible in other accounts.

    (b) The expenses shall consist of the cost of operating the power plant, and other costs incident to the production and delivery of the power for which construction is credited under paragraph (a), above, including the cost of repairs and other expenses of operating and maintaining lands, buildings, and other property, and other miscellaneous and like expenses not properly includible in other accounts.

    (19)  (Major and Nonmajor Utilities). When it is necessary that employees be trained to operate or maintain plant facilities that are being constructed and such facilities are not conventional in nature, or are new to the company's operations, these costs may be capitalized as a component of construction cost. Once plant is placed in service, the capitalization of training costs shall cease and subsequent training costs shall be expensed. (See Operating Expense Instruction 4.)

    (20)  includes the costs of studies such as nuclear operational, safety, or seismic studies or environmental studies mandated by regulatory bodies relative to plant under construction. _Studies_ relative to facilities in service shall be charged to account 183, Preliminary Survey and Investigation Charges.

    (21)  The costs recognized as a result of asset retirement obligations incurred during the construction and testing of utility plant shall constitute a component of construction costs.

    B. For Nonmajor utilities, the cost of construction of property chargeable to the electric plant accounts shall include, where applicable, the cost of labor; materials and supplies; transportation; work done by others for the utility; injuries and damages incurred in construction work; privileges and permits; special machine service; allowance for funds used during construction, not to exceed without prior approval of the Commission, amounts computed in accordance with the formula prescribed in paragraph (a) of paragraph (17) of this Instruction; training costs; and such portion of general engineering, administrative salaries and expenses, insurance, taxes, and other analogous items as may be properly includable in construction costs. (See Operating Expense Instruction 4.) The rates and balances of short and long-term debt, preferred stock, common equity and construction work in progress shall be determined as prescribed in paragraph (b) of paragraph (17) of this Instruction.

    4.

    A. All overhead construction costs, such as engineering, supervision, general office salaries and expenses, construction engineering and supervision by others than the accounting utility, law expenses, insurance, injuries and damages, relief and pensions, taxes and interest, shall be charged to particular jobs or units on the basis of the amounts of such overheads reasonably applicable thereto, to the end that each job or unit shall bear its equitable proportion of such costs and that the entire cost of the unit, both direct and overhead, shall be deducted from the plant accounts at the time the property is retired.

    B. As far as practicable, the determination of pay roll charges includible in construction overheads shall be based on time card distributions thereof. Where this procedure is impractical, special studies shall be made periodically of the time of supervisory employees devoted to construction activities to the end that only such overhead costs as have a definite relation to construction shall be capitalized. The addition to direct construction costs of arbitrary percentages or amounts to cover assumed overhead costs is not permitted.

    C. For Major utilities, the records supporting the entries for overhead construction costs shall be so kept as to show the total amount of each overhead for each year, the nature and amount of each overhead expenditure charged to each construction work order and to each electric plant account, and the bases of distribution of such costs.

    5.

    A. When electric plant constituting an operating unit or system is acquired by purchase, merger, consolidation, liquidation, or otherwise, after the effective date of this system of accounts, the costs of acquisition, including expenses incidental thereto properly includible in electric plant, shall be charged to account 102, Electric Plant Purchased or Sold.

    B. The accounting for the acquisition shall then be completed as follows:

    (1) The original cost of plant, estimated if not known, shall be credited to account 102, Electric Plant Purchased or Sold, and concurrently charged to the appropriate electric plant in service accounts and to account 104, Electric Plant Leased to Others, account 105, Electric Plant Held for Future Use, and account 107, Construction Work in Progress—Electric, as appropriate.

    (2) The depreciation and amortization applicable to the original cost of the properties purchased shall be charged to account 102, Electric Plant Purchased or Sold, and concurrently credited to the appropriate account for accumulated provision for depreciation or amortization.

    (3) The cost to the utility of any property includible in account 121, Nonutility Property, shall be transferred thereto.

    (4) The amount remaining in account 102, Electric Plant Purchased or Sold, shall then be closed to account 114, Electric Plant Acquisition Adjustments.

    C. If property acquired in the purchase of an operating unit or system is in such physical condition when acquired that it is necessary substantially to rehabilitate it in order to bring the property up to the standards of the utility, the cost of such work, except replacements, shall be accounted for as a part of the purchase price of the property.

    D. When any property acquired as an operating unit or system includes duplicate or other plant which will be retired by the accounting utility in the reconstruction of the acquired property or its consolidation with previously owned property, the proposed accounting for such property shall be presented to the Commission.

    E. In connection with the acquisition of electric plant constituting an operating unit or system, the utility shall procure, if possible, all existing records relating to the property acquired, or certified copies thereof, and shall preserve such records in conformity with regulations or practices governing the preservation of records of its own construction.

    F. When electric plant constituting an operating unit or system is sold, conveyed, or transferred to another by sale, merger, consolidation, or otherwise, the book cost of the property sold or transferred to another shall be credited to the appropriate utility plant accounts, including amounts carried in account 114, Electric Plant Acquisition Adjustments. The amounts (estimated if not known) carried with respect thereto in the accounts for accumulated provision for depreciation and amortization and in account 252, Customer Advances for Construction, shall be charged to such accounts and contra entries made to account 102, Electric Plant Purchased or Sold. Unless otherwise ordered by the Commission, the difference, if any, between (1) the net amount of debits and credits and (2) the consideration received for the property (less commissions and other expenses of making the sale) shall be included in account 421.1. Gain on Disposition of Property, or account 421.2, Loss on Disposition of Property. (See account 102, Electric Plant Purchased or Sold.)

    6.

    A. The cost of substantial initial improvements (including repairs, rear-rangements, additions, and betterments) made in the course of preparing for utility service property leased for a period of more than one year, and the cost of subsequent substantial additions, replacements, or betterments to such property, shall be charged to the electric plant account appropriate for the class of property leased. If the service life of the improvements is terminable by action of the lease, the cost, less net salvage, of the improvements shall be spread over the life of the lease by charges to account 404, Amortization of Limited-Term Electric Plant. However, if the service life is not terminated by action of the lease but by depreciation proper, the cost of the improvements, less net salvage, shall be accounted for as depreciable plant. The provisions of this paragraph are applicable to property leased under either capital leases or operating leases.

    B. If improvements made to property leased for a period of more than one year are of relatively minor cost, or if the lease is for a period of not more than one year, the cost of the improvements shall be charged to the account in which the rent is included, either directly or by amortization thereof.

    7.

    A. The accounts for land and land rights shall include the cost of land owned in fee by the utility and rights. Interests, and privileges held by the utility in land owned by others, such as leaseholds, easements, water and water power rights, diversion rights, submersion rights, rights-of-way, and other like interests in land. Do not include in the accounts for land and land rights and rights-of-way costs incurred in connection with first clearing and grading of land and rights-of-way and the damage costs associated with the construction and installation of plant. Such costs shall be included in the appropriate plant accounts directly benefited.

    B. Where special assessments for public improvements provide for deferred payments, the full amount of the assessments shall be charged to the appropriate land account and the unpaid balance shall be carried in an appropriate liability account. Interest on unpaid balances shall be charged to the appropriate interest account. If any part of the cost of public improvements is included in the general tax levy, the amount thereof shall be charged to the appropriate tax account.

    C. The net profit from the sale of timber, cord wood, sand, gravel, other resources or other property acquired with the rights-of-way or other lands shall be credited to the appropriate plant account to which related. Where land is held for a considerable period of time and timber and other natural resources on the land at the time of purchase increases in value, the net profit (after giving effect to the cost of the natural resources) from the sales of timber or its products or other natural resources shall be credited to the appropriate utility operating income account when such land has been recorded in account 105, Electric Plant Held for Future Use or classified as plant in service, otherwise to account 421, Miscellaneous Nonoperating Income.

    D. Separate entries shall be made for the acquisition, transfer, or retirement of each parcel of land, and each land right (except rights of way for distribution lines), or water right, having a life of more than one year. A record shall be maintained showing the nature of ownership, full legal description, area, map reference, purpose for which used, city, county, and tax district on which situated, from whom purchased or to whom sold, payment given or received, other costs, contract date and number, date of recording of deed, and book and page of record. Entries transferring or retiring land or land rights shall refer to the original entry recording its acquisition.

    E. Any difference between the amount received from the sale of land or land rights, less agents' commissions and other costs incident to the sale, and the book cost of such land or rights, shall be included in account 411.6, Gains from Disposition of Utility Plant, or 411.7, Losses from Disposition of Utility Plant when such property has been recorded in account 105, Electric Plant Held for Future Use, otherwise to account 421.1, Gain on Disposition of Property or 421.2, Loss on Disposition of Property, as appropriate, unless a reserve therefor has been authorized and provided. Appropriate adjustments of the accounts shall be made with respect to any structures or improvements located on land sold.

    F. The cost of buildings and other improvements (other than public improvements) shall not be included in the land accounts. If at the time of acquisition of an interest in land such interest extends to buildings or other improvements (other than public improvements) which are then devoted to utility operations, the land and improvements shall be separately appraised and the cost allocated to land and buildings or improvements on the basis of the appraisals. If the improvements are removed or wrecked without being used in operations, the cost of removing or wrecking shall be charged and the salvage credited to the account in which the cost of the land is recorded.

    G. When the purchase of land for electric operations requires the purchase of more land than needed for such purposes, the charge to the specific land account shall be based upon the cost of the land purchased, less the fair market value of that portion of the land which is not to be used in utility operations. The portion of the cost measured by the fair market value of the land not to be used shall be included in account 105, Electric Plant Held for Future Use, or account 121, Nonutility Property, as appropriate.

    H. Provisions shall be made for amortizing amounts carried in the accounts for limited-term interests in land so as to apportion equitably the cost of each interest over the life thereof. (For Major utilities, see account 111, Accumulated Provision for Amortization of Electric Plant Utility, and account 404, Amortization of Limited-Term Electric Plant. For Nonmajor utilities, see account 404.)

    I. The items of cost to be included in the accounts for land and land rights are as follows:

    8.

    A. The accounts for structures and improvements shall include the cost of all buildings and facilities to house, support, or safeguard property or persons, including all fixtures permanently attached to and made a part of buildings and which cannot be removed therefrom without cutting into the walls, ceilings, or floors, or without in some way impairing the buildings, and improvements of a permanent character on or to land. Also include those costs incurred in connection with the first clearing and grading of land and rights-of-way and the damage costs associated with construction and installation of plant.

    B. The cost of specially provided foundations not intended to outlast the machinery or apparatus for which provided, and the cost of angle irons, castings, etc., installed at the base of an item of equipment, shall be charged to the same account as the cost of the machinery, apparatus, or equipment.

    C. Minor buildings and structures, such as valve towers, patrolmen's towers, telephone stations, fish and wildlife, and recreation facilities, etc., which are used directly in connection with or form a part of a reservoir, dam, waterway, etc., shall be considered a part of the facility in connection with which constructed or operated and the cost thereof accounted for accordingly.

    D. Where furnaces and boilers are used primarily for furnishing steam for some particular department and only incidentally for furnishing steam for heating a building and operating the equipment therein, the entire cost of such furnaces and boilers shall be charged to the appropriate plant account, and no part to the building account.

    E. Where the structure of a dam forms also the foundation of the power plant building, such foundation shall be considered a part of the dam.

    F. The cost of disposing of materials excavated in connection with construction of structures shall be considered as a part of the cost of such work, except as follows: (a) When such material is used for filling, the cost of loading, hauling, and dumping shall be equitably apportioned between the work in connection with which the removal occurs and the work in connection with which the material is used; (b) when such material is sold, the net amount realized from such sales shall be credited to the work in connection with which the removal occurs. If the amount realized from the sale of excavated materials exceeds the removal costs and the costs in connection with the sale, the excess shall be credited to the land account in which the site is carried.

    G. Lighting or other fixtures temporarily attached to buildings for purposes of display or demonstration shall not be included in the cost of the building but in the appropriate equipment account.

    H. The items of cost to be included in the accounts for structures and improvements are as follows:

    9.

    A. The cost of equipment chargeable to the electric plant accounts, unless otherwise indicated in the text of an equipment account, includes the net purchase price thereof, sales taxes, investigation and inspection expenses necessary to such purchase, expenses of transportation when borne by the utility, labor employed, materials and supplies consumed, and expenses incurred by the utility in unloading and placing the equipment in readiness to operate. Also include those costs incurred in connection with the first clearing and grading of land and rights-of-way and the damage costs associated with construction and installation of plant.

    B. Exclude from equipment accounts hand and other portable tools, which are likely to be lost or stolen or which have relatively small value (for example, $500 or less) or short life, unless the correctness of the accounting therefor as electric plant is verified by current inventories. Special tools acquired and included in the purchase price of equipment shall be included in the appropriate plant account. Portable drills and similar tool equipment when used in connection with the operation and maintenance of a particular plant or department, such as production, transmission, distribution, etc., or in  shall be charged to the plant account appropriate for their use.

    C. The equipment accounts shall include angle irons and similar items which are installed at the base of an item of equipment, but piers and foundations which are designed to be as permanent as the buildings which house the equipment, or which are constructed as a part of the building and which cannot be removed without cutting into the walls, ceilings or floors or without in some way impairing the building, shall be included in the building accounts.

    D. The equipment accounts shall include the necessary costs of testing or running a plant or parts thereof during an experimental or test period prior to such plant becoming ready for or placed in service. In the case of Nonmajor utilities, the utility shall pay the fee prescribed in part 381 of this chapter and shall furnish the Commission with full particulars of and justification for any test or experimental run extending beyond a period of 30 days. In the case of Major utilities, the utility shall furnish the Commission with full particulars of and justification for any test or experimental run extending beyond a period of 120 days for nuclear plant, and a period of 90 days for all other plant. Such particulars shall include a detailed operational and downtime log showing days of production, gross kilowatts generated by hourly increments, types, and periods of outages by hours with explanation thereof, beginning with the first date the equipment was either tested or synchronized on the line to the end of the test period.

    E. The cost of efficiency or other tests made subsequent to the date equipment becomes available for service shall be charged to the appropriate expense accounts, except that tests to determine whether equipment meets the specifications and requirements as to efficiency, performance, etc., guaranteed by manufacturers, made after operations have commenced and within the period specified in the agreement or contract of purchase may be charged to the appropriate electric plant account.

    10.

    A. For the purpose of avoiding undue refinement in accounting for additions to and retirements and replacements of electric plant, all property will be considered as consisting of (1) retirement units and (2) minor items of property. Each utility shall maintain a written property units listing for use in accounting for additions and retirements of electric plant and apply the listing consistently.

    B. The addition and retirement of retirement units shall be accounted for as follows:

    (1) When a retirement unit is added to electric plant, the cost thereof shall be added to the appropriate electric plant account, except that when units are acquired in the acquisition of any electric plant constituting an operating system, they shall be accounted for as provided in electric plant instruction 5.

    (2) When a retirement unit is retired from electric plant, with or without replacement, the book cost thereof shall be credited to the electric plant account in which it is included, determined in the manner set forth in paragraph D, below. If the retirement unit is of a depreciable class, the book cost of the unit retired and credited to electric plant shall be charged to the accumulated provision for depreciation applicable to such property. The cost of removal and the salvage shall be charged or credited, as appropriate, to such depreciation account.

    C. The addition and retirement of minor items of property shall be accounted for as follows:

    (1) When a minor item of property which did not previously exist is added to plant, the cost thereof shall be accounted for in the same manner as for the addition of a retirement unit, as set forth in paragraph B(1), above, if a substantial addition results, otherwise the charge shall be to the appropriate maintenance expense account.

    (2) When a minor item of property is retired and not replaced, the book cost thereof shall be credited to the electric plant account in which it is included; and, in the event the minor item is a part of depreciable plant, the account for accumulated provision for depreciation shall be charged with the book cost and cost of removal and credited with the salvage. If, however, the book cost of the minor item retired and not replaced has been or will be accounted for by its inclusion in the retirement unit of which it is a part when such unit is retired, no separate credit to the property account is required when such minor item is retired.

    (3) When a minor item of depreciable property is replaced independently of the retirement unit of which it is a part, the cost of replacement shall be charged to the maintenance account appropriate for the item, except that if the replacement effects a substantial betterment (the primary aim of which is to make the property affected more useful, more efficient, of greater durability, or of greater capacity), the excess cost of the replacement over the estimated cost at current prices of replacing without betterment shall be charged to the appropriate electric plant account.

    D. The book cost of electric plant retired shall be the amount at which such property is included in the electric plant accounts, including all components of construction costs. The book cost shall be determined from the utility's records and if this cannot be done it shall be estimated. Utilities must furnish the particulars of such estimates to the Commission, if requested. When it is impracticable to determine the book cost of each unit, due to the relatively large number or small cost thereof, an appropriate average book cost of the units, with due allowance for any differences in size and character, shall be used as the book cost of the units retired.

    E. The book cost of land retired shall be credited to the appropriate land account. If the land is sold, the difference between the book cost (less any accumulated provision for depreciation or amortization therefore which has been authorized and provided) and the sale price of the land (less commissions and other expenses of making the sale) shall be recorded in account 411.6, Gains from Disposition of Utility Plant, or 411.7, Losses from Disposition of Utility Plant when the property has been recorded in account 105, Electric Plant Held for Future Use, otherwise to accounts 421.1, Gain on Disposition of Property or 421.2, Loss on Disposition of Property, as appropriate. If the land is not used in utility service but is retained by the utility, the book cost shall be charged to account 105, Electric Plant Held for Future Use, or account 121, Nonutility Property, as appropriate.

    F. The book cost less net salvage of depreciable electric plant retired shall be charged in its entirety to account 108. Accumulated Provision for Depreciation of Electric Plant in Service (Account 110, Accumulated Provision for Depreciation and Amortization of Electric Utility Plant, in the case of Nonmajor utilities). Any amounts which, by approval or order of the Commission, are charged to account 182.1, Extraordinary Property Losses, shall be credited to account 108 (Account 110 for Nonmajor utilities).

    G. In the case of Major utilities, the accounting for the retirement of amounts included in account 302, Franchises and Consents, and account 303, Miscellaneous Intangible Plant, and the items of limited-term interest in land included in the accounts for land and land rights, shall be as provided for in the text of account 111. Accumulated Provision for Amortization of Electric Plant in Service, account 404, Amortization of Limited-Term Electric Plant, and account 405, Amortization of Other Electric Plant.

    11.

    A. Each utility shall record all construction and retirements of electric plant by means of work orders or job orders. Separate work orders may be opened for additions to and retirements of electric plant or the retirements may be included with the construction work order, provided, however, that all items relating to the retirements shall be kept separate from those relating to construction and provided, further, that any maintenance costs involved in the work shall likewise be segregated.

    B. Each utility shall keep its work order system so as to show the nature of each addition to or retirement of electric plant, the total cost thereof, the source or sources of costs, and the electric plant account or accounts to which charged or credited. Work orders covering jobs of short duration may be cleared monthly.

    C. In the case of Major utilities, each utility shall maintain records in which, for each plant account, the amounts of the annual additions and retirements are classified so as to show the number and cost of the various record units or retirement units.

    12.

    When property is transferred from one electric plant account to another, from one utility department to another, such as from electric to gas, from one operating division or area to another, to or from accounts 101, Electric Plant in Service, 104. Electric Plant Leased to Others, 105. Electric Plant Held for Future Use, and 121, Nonutility Property, the transfer shall be recorded by transferring the original cost thereof from the one account, department, or location to the other. Any related amounts carried in the accounts for accumulated provision for depreciation or amortization shall be transferred in accordance with the segregation of such accounts.

    13.

    A. If the utility is engaged in more than one utility service, such as electric, gas, and water, and any of its utility plant is used in common for several utility services or for other purposes to such an extent and in such manner that it is impracticable to segregate it by utility services currently in the accounts, such property, with the approval of the Commission, may be designated and classified as

    B. The book amount of utility plant designated as common plant shall be included in account 118, Other Utility Plant, and if applicable in part to the electric department, shall be segregated and accounted for in subaccounts as electric plant is accounted for in accounts 101 to 107, inclusive, and electric plant adjustments in account 116; any amounts classifiable as common plant acquisition adjustments or common plant adjustments shall be subject to disposition as provided in paragraphs C and B of accounts 114 and 116, respectively, for amounts classified in those accounts. The original cost of common utility plant in service shall be classified according to detailed utility plant accounts appropriate for the property.

    C. The utility shall be prepared to show at any time and to report to the Commission annually, or more frequently, if required, and by utility plant accounts (301 to 399) the following: (1) The book cost of common utility plant, (2) The allocation of such cost to the respective departments using the common utility plant, and (3) The basis of the allocation.

    D. The accumulated provision for depreciation and amortization of the utility shall be segregated so as to show the amount applicable to the property classified as common utility plant.

    E. The expenses of operation, maintenance, rents, depreciation and amortization of common utility plant shall be recorded in the accounts prescribed herein, but designated as common expenses, and the allocation of such expenses to the departments using the common utility plant shall be supported in such manner as to reflect readily the basis of allocation used.

    14.

    For the purpose of this system of accounts:

    A.  means:

    (1) All land, conversion structures, and equipment employed at a primary source of supply (i.e., generating station, or point of receipt in the case of purchased power) to change the voltage or frequency of electricity for the purpose of its more efficient or convenient transmission;

    (2) All land, structures, lines, switching and conversion stations, high tension apparatus, and their control and protective equipment between a generating or receiving point and the entrance to a distribution center or wholesale point; and

    B.  means all land, structures, conversion equipment, lines, line transformers, and other facilities employed between the primary source of supply (i.e., generating station, or point of receipt in the case of purchased power) and of delivery to customers, which are not includible in transmission system, as defined in paragraph A, whether or not such land, structures, and facilities are operated as part of a transmission system or as part of a distribution system.

    C. Where poles or towers support both transmission and distribution conductors, the poles, towers, anchors, guys, and rights of way shall be classified as transmission system. The conductors, crossarms, braces, grounds, tiewire, insulators, etc., shall be classified as transmission or distribution facilities, according to the purpose for which used.

    D. Where underground conduit contains both transmission and distribution conductors, the underground conduit and right of way shall be classified as distribution system. The conductors shall be classified as transmission or distribution facilities according to the purpose for which used.

    E. Land (other than rights of way) and structures used jointly for transmission and distribution purposes shall be classified as transmission or distribution according to the major use thereof.

    15.

    For the purpose of this system of accounts hydraulic production plant means all land and land rights, structures and improvements used in connection with hydraulic power generation, reservoirs dams and waterways, water wheels, turbines, generators, accessory electric equipment, miscellaneous powerplant equipment, roads, railroads, and bridges, and structures and improvements used in connection with fish and wildlife, and recreation.

    16.

    Each utility shall keep all the necessary records to support the entries to the various nuclear fuel plant accounts classified under “Assets and Other Debits,” Utility Plant 120.1 through 120.6, inclusive, account 518, Nuclear Fuel Expense and account 157, Nuclear Materials Held for Sale. These records shall be so kept as to readily furnish the basis of the computation of the net nuclear fuel costs.

    17.  Where computer hardware, software, and communication equipment is integrated as part of a larger retirement unit, it shall be recorded in the property account of the retirement unit purchased. This shall be done consistently with electric plant instruction 10.

    1.

    The supervision and engineering includible in the operating expense accounts shall consist of the pay and expenses of superintendents, engineers, clerks, other employees and consultants engaged in supervising and directing the operation and maintenance of each utility function. Wherever allocations are necessary in order to arrive at the amount to be included in any account, the method and basis of allocation shall be reflected by underlying records.

    2.

    A. The cost of maintenance chargeable to the various operating expense and clearing accounts includes labor, materials, overheads and other expenses incurred in maintenance work. A list of work operations applicable generally to utility plant is included hereunder. Other work operations applicable to specific classes of plant are listed in functional maintenance expense accounts.

    B. Materials recovered in connection with the maintenance of property shall be credited to the same account to which the maintenance cost was charged.

    C. If the book cost of any property is carried in account 102, Electric Plant Purchased or Sold, the cost of maintaining such property shall be charged to the accounts for maintenance of property of the same class and use, the book cost of which is carried in other electric plant in service accounts. Maintenance of property leased from others shall be treated as provided in operating expense instruction 3.

    3.

    A. The rent expense accounts provided under the several functional groups of expense accounts shall include all rents, including taxes paid by the lessee on leased property, for property used in utility operations, except (1) minor amounts paid for occasional or infrequent use of any property or equipment and all amounts paid for use of equipment that, if owned, would be includible in plant accounts 391 to 398, inclusive, which shall be treated as an expense item and included in the appropriate functional account and (2) rents which are chargeable to clearing accounts, and distributed therefrom to the appropriate account. If rents cover property used for more than one function, such as production and transmission, or by more than one department, the rents shall be apportioned to the appropriate rent expense or clearing accounts of each department on an actual, or, if necessary, an estimated basis.

    B. When a portion of property or equipment rented from others for use in connection with utility operations is subleased, the revenue derived from such subleasing shall be credited to the rent revenue account in operating revenues; provided, however, that in case the rent was charged to a clearing account, amounts received from subleasing the property shall be credited to such clearing account.

    C. The cost, when incurred by the lessee, of operating and maintaining leased property, shall be charged to the accounts appropriate for the expense if the property were owned.

    D. The cost incurred by the lessee of additions and replacements to electric plant leased from others shall be accounted for as provided in electric plant instruction 6.

    4.

    When it is necessary that employees be trained to specifically operate or maintain plant facilities that are being constructed, the related costs shall be accounted for as a current operating and maintenance expense. These expenses shall be charged to the appropriate functional accounts currently as they are incurred. However, when the training costs involved relate to facilities which are not conventional in nature, or are new to the company's operations, then see Electric Plant Instruction 3(19), for accounting.

    A. This account shall include the original cost of electric plant, included in accounts 301 to 399, prescribed herein, owned and used by the utility in its electric utility operations, and having an expectation of life in service of more than one year from date of installation, including such property owned by the utility but held by nominees. (See also account 106 for unclassified construction costs of completed plant actually in service.)

    B. The cost of additions to and betterments of property leased from others, which are includible in this account, shall be recorded in subdivisions separate and distinct from those relating to owned property. (See electric plant instruction 6.)

    A. This account shall include the amount recorded under capital leases for plant leased from others and used by the utility in its utility operations.

    A. This account shall be charged with the cost of electric plant acquired as an operating unit or system by purchase, merger, consolidation liquidation, or otherwise, and shall be credited with the selling price of like property transferred to others pending the distribution to appropriate accounts in accordance with electric plant instruction 5.

    B. Within six months from the date of acquisition or sale of property recorded herein, the utility shall file with the Commission the proposed journal entries to clear from this account the amounts recorded herein.

    A. This account shall include the cost of electric plant which was constructed as a research, development, and demonstration plant under the provisions of paragraph C, Account 107, Construction Work in Progress—Electric, and due to the nature of the plant it is desirous to operate it for a period of time in an experimental status.

    B. Amounts in this account shall be transferred to Account 101, Electric Plant in Service, or Account 121, Nonutility Property as appropriate when the project is no longer considered as experimental.

    C. The depreciation on plant in this account shall be charged to account 403, Depreciation expense, and account 403.1, Depreciation expense for asset retirement costs, as appropriate, and credited to account 108, Accumulated provision for depreciation of electric utility plant (Major only). The amounts herein shall be depreciated over a period which corresponds to the estimated useful life of the relevant project considering the characteristics involved. However, when projects are transferred to account 101, Electric plant in service, a new depreciation rate based on the remaining service life and undepreciated amounts, will be established.

    D. Records shall be maintained with respect to each unit of experiment so that full details may be obtained as to the cost, depreciation and the experimental status.

    E. Should it be determined that experimental plant recorded in this account will fail to satisfactorily perform its function, the costs thereof shall be accounted for as directed or authorized by the Commission.

    A. This account shall include temporarily the balance of electric plant as of the effective date of the prior system of accounts, which has not yet been reclassified as of the effective date of this system of accounts. The detail or primary accounts in support of this account employed prior to such date shall be continued pending reclassification into the electric plant accounts herein prescribed (301-399), but shall not be used for additions, betterments, or new construction.

    B. No charges other than as provided in paragraph A, above, shall be made to this account, but retirements of such unclassified electric plant shall be credited hereto and to the supporting (old) fixed capital accounts until the reclassification shall have been accomplished.

    A. This account shall include the original cost of electric plant owned by the utility, but leased to others as operating units or systems, where the lessee has exclusive possession.

    A. This account shall include the original cost of electric plant (except land and land rights) owned and held for future use in electric service under a definite plan for such use, to include: (1) Property acquired (except land and land rights) but never used by the utility in electric service, but held for such service in the future under a definite plan, and (2) property (except land and land rights) previously used by the utility in service, but retired from such service and held pending its reuse in the future, under a definite plan, in electric service.

    B. This account shall also include the original cost of land and land rights owned and held for future use in electric service under a plan for such use, to include land and land rights: (1) Acquired but never used by the utility in electric service, but held for such service in the future under a plan, and (2) previously held by the utility in service, but retired from such service and held pending its reuse in the future under a plan, in electric service. (See Electric Plant Instruction 7.)

    C. In the event that property recorded in this account shall no longer be needed or appropriate for future utility operations, the company shall request Commission approval of journal entries to remove such property from this account when the gain realized from the sale or other disposition of the property is $100,000 or more, prior to their being recorded. Such filings shall include the description and original cost of individual properties removed from this account, the accounts charged upon removal, and any associated gains realized upon disposition of such property.

    D. Gains or losses from the sale of land and land rights or other disposition of such property previously recorded in this account and not placed in utility service shall be recorded directly in accounts 411.6 or 411.7, as appropriate, except when determined to be significant by the Commission. Upon such a determination, the amounts shall be transferred to account 256, Deferred Gains from Disposition of Utility Plant, or account 187, Deferred Losses from Disposition of Utility Plant, and amortized to accounts 411.6, Gains from Disposition of Utility Plant, or 411.7, Losses from Disposition of Utility Plant, as appropriate.

    E. The property included in this account shall be classified according to the detail accounts (301 to 399) prescribed for electric plant in service and the account shall be maintained in such detail as though the property were in service.

    At the end of the year or such other date as a balance sheet may be required by the Commission, this account shall include the total of the balances of work orders for electric plant which has been completed and placed in service but which work orders have not been classified for transfer to the detailed electric plant accounts.

    A. This account shall include the total of the balances of work orders for electric plant in process of construction.

    This account shall include the book cost of fuel on hand.

    A. This account may include the cost of labor and of supplies used and expenses incurred in unloading fuel from the shipping medium and in the handling thereof prior to its use, if such expenses are sufficiently significant in amount to warrant being treated as a part of the cost of fuel inventory rather than being charged direct to expense as incurred.

    B. Amounts included herein shall be charged to expense as the fuel is used to the end that the balance herein shall not exceed the expenses attributable to the inventory of fuel on hand.

    This account shall include the book cost of any residuals produced in production or manufacturing processes.

    (2) Reusable materials consisting of relatively small items, the identity of which (from the date of original installation to the final abandonment or sale thereof) cannot be ascertained without undue refinement in accounting, shall be included in this account at current prices new for such items. The cost of repairing such items shall be charged to the appropriate expense account as indicated by previous use.

    (3) Scrap and nonusable materials included in this account shall be carried at the estimated net amount realizable therefrom. The difference between the amounts realized for scrap and nonusable materials sold and the net amount at which the materials were carried in this account, as far as practicable, shall be adjusted to the accounts credited when the materials were charged to this account.

    B. Materials and supplies issued shall be credited hereto and charged to the appropriate construction, operating expense, or other account on the basis of a unit price determined by the use of cumulative average, first-in-first-out, or such other method of inventory accounting as conforms with accepted accounting standards consistently applied.

    C. For Nonmajor utilities, inventories of materials, supplies, fuel, etc., shall be taken at least annually and the necessary adjustments shall be made to bring this account into agreement with the actual inventories. In effecting the adjustments, large differences which can be assigned to important classes of materials shall be equitably adjusted among the accounts to which such classes of materials have been charged since the previous inventory. Other differences shall be equitably apportioned among the accounts to which materials have been charged.

    This account shall include the book cost of materials and supplies and appliances and equipment held primarily for merchandising, jobbing and contract work. The principles prescribed in accounting for utility materials and supplies shall be observed in respect to items carried in this account.

    This account shall include amounts representing prepayments of insurance, rents, taxes, interest and miscellaneous items, and shall be kept or supported in such manner as to disclose the amount of each class of prepayment.

    This account shall include the amount of interest on bonds, mortgages, notes, commercial paper, loans, open accounts, deposits, etc., the payment of which is reasonably assured, and the amount of dividends declared or guaranteed on stocks owned.

    This account shall include rents receivable or accrued on property rented or leased by the utility to others.

    At the option of the utility, the estimated amount accrued for service rendered, but not billed at the end of any accounting period, may be included herein. In case accruals are made for unbilled revenues, they shall be made likewise for unbilled expenses, such as for the purchase of energy.

    This account shall include the book cost of all other current and accrued assets, appropriately designated and supported so as to show the nature of each asset included herein.

    This account shall include the amounts paid for derivative instruments, and the change in the fair value of all derivative instrument assets not designated as cash flow or fair value hedges.

    A. This account shall include the amounts paid for derivative instruments, and the change in the fair value of derivative instrument assets designated by the utility as cash flow or fair value hedges.

    B. When a utility designates a derivative instrument asset as a cash flow hedge it will record the change in the fair value of the derivative instrument in this account with a concurrent charge to account 219, accumulated other comprehensive income, with the effective portion of the gain or loss. The ineffective portion of the cash flow hedge shall be charged to the same income or expense account that will be used when the hedged item enters into the determination of net income.

    C. When a utility designates a derivative instrument as a fair value hedge it shall record the change in the fair value of the derivative instrument in this account with a concurrent charge to a subaccount of the asset or liability that carries the item being hedged. The ineffective portion of the fair value hedge shall be charged to the same income or expense account that will be used when the hedged item enters into the determination of net income.

    This account shall include expenses related to the issuance or assumption of debt securities. Amounts recorded in this account shall be amortized over the life of each respective issue under a plan which will distribute the amount equitably over the life of the security. The amortization shall be on a monthly basis, and the amounts thereof shall be charged to account 428, Amortization of Debt Discount and Expense. Any unamortized amounts outstanding at the time that the related debt is prematurely reacquired shall be accounted for as indicated in General Instruction 17.

    A. When authorized or directed by the Commission, this account shall include extraordinary losses, which could not reasonably have been anticipated and which are not covered by insurance or other provisions, such as unforeseen damages to property.

    B. Application to the Commission for permission to use this account shall be accompanied by a statement giving a complete explanation with respect to the items which it is proposed to include herein, the period over which, and the accounts to which it is proposed to write off the charges, and other pertinent information.

    A. This account shall include: (1) Nonrecurring costs of studies and analyses mandated by regulatory bodies related to plants in service, transferred from account 183, Preliminary Survey and Investigation Charges, and not resulting in construction; and (2) when authorized by the Commission, significant unrecovered costs of plant facilities where construction has been cancelled or which have been prematurely retired.

    B. This account shall be credited and account 407, Amortization of Property Losses, Unrecovered Plant and Regulatory Study Costs, shall be debited over the period specified by the Commission.

    C. Any additional costs incurred, relative to the cancellation or premature retirement, may be included in this account and amortized over the remaining period of the original amortization period. Should any gains or recoveries be realized relative to the cancelled or prematurely retired plant, such amounts shall be used to reduce the unamortized amount of the costs recorded herein.

    D. In the event that the recovery of costs included herein is disallowed in the rate proceedings, the disallowed costs shall be charged to account 426.5, Other Deductions, or account 435, Extraordinary Deductions, in the year of such disallowance.

    A. This account shall include the amounts of regulatory-created assets, not includible in other accounts, resulting from the ratemaking actions of regulatory agencies. ( Definition No. 30.)

    B. The amounts included in this account are to be established by those charges which would have been included in net income, or accumulated other comprehensive income, determinations in the current period under the general requirements of the Uniform System of Accounts but for it being probable that such items will be included in a different period(s) for purposes of developing rates that the utility is authorized to charge for its utility services. When specific identification of the particular source of a regulatory asset cannot be made, such as in plant phase-ins, rate moderation plans, or rate levelization plans, account 407.4, regulatory credits, shall be credited. The amounts recorded in this account are generally to be charged, concurrently with the recovery of the amounts in rates, to the same account that would have been charged if included in income when incurred, except all regulatory assets established through the use of account 407.4 shall be charged to account 407.3, regulatory debits, concurrent with the recovery in rates.

    C. If rate recovery of all or part of an amount included in this account is disallowed, the disallowed amount shall be charged to Account 426.5, Other Deductions, or Account 435, Extraordinary Deductions, in the year of the disallowance.

    D. The records supporting the entries to this account shall be kept so that the utility can furnish full information as to the nature and amount of each regulatory asset included in this account, including justification for inclusion of such amounts in this account.

    A. This account shall be charged with all expenditures for preliminary surveys, plans, investigations, etc., made for the purpose of determining the feasibility of utility projects under contemplation. If construction results, this account shall be credited and the appropriate utility plant account charged. If the work is abandoned, the charge shall be made to account 426.5, Other Deductions, or to the appropriate operating expense account.

    B. This account shall also include costs of studies and analyses mandated by regulatory bodies related to plant in service. If construction results from such studies, this account shall be credited and the appropriate utility plant account charged with an equitable portion of such study costs directly attributable to new construction. The portion of such study costs not attributable to new construction or the entire cost if construction does not result shall be charged to account 182.2, Unrecovered Plant and Regulatory Costs, or the appropriate operating expense account. The costs of such studies relative to plant under construction shall be included directly in account 107, Construction Work in Progress-Electric.

    C. The records supporting the entries to this account shall be so kept that the utility can furnish complete information as to the nature and the purpose of the survey, plans, or investigations and the nature and amounts of the several charges.

    This caption shall include undistributed balances in clearing accounts at the date of the balance sheet. Balances in clearing accounts shall be substantially cleared not later than the end of the calendar year unless items held therein relate to a future period.

    This account shall include amounts shown by work orders for plant installed for temporary use in utility service for periods of less than one year. Such work orders shall be charged with the cost of temporary facilities and credited with payments received from customers and net salvage realized on removal of the temporary facilities. Any net credit or debit resulting shall be cleared to account 451, Miscellaneous Service Revenues.

    A. For Major utilities, this account shall include all debits not elsewhere provided for, such as miscellaneous work in progress, and unusual or extraordinary expenses, not included in other accounts, which are in process of amortization and items the proper final disposition of which is uncertain.

    B. For Nonmajor utilities, this account shall include the following classes of items:

    (1) Expenditures for preliminary surveys, plans, investigations, etc., made for the purpose of determining the feasibility of utility projects under contemplation. If construction results, this account shall be credited with the amount applicable thereto and the appropriate plant accounts shall be charged with an amount which does not exceed the expenditures which may reasonably be determined to contribute directly and immediately and without duplication to plant. If the work is abandoned, the charge shall be to account 426.5, Other Deductions, or to the appropriate operating expense accounts.

    (2) Undistributed balances in clearing accounts at the date of the balance sheet. Balances in clearing accounts shall be substantially cleared not later than the end of the calendar year unless items held therein related to a future period.

    (3) Balances representing expenditures for work in progress other than on utility plant. This includes jobbing and contract work in progress.

    (4) Other debit balances, the proper final disposition of which is uncertain and unusual or extraordinary expenses not included in other accounts, which are in process of being written off.

    C. For both Major and Nonmajor utilities, the records supporting the entries to this account shall be so kept that the utility can furnish full information as to each deferred debit included herein.

    This account shall include losses from the sale or other disposition of property previously recorded in account 105, Electric Plant held for Future Use, under the provisions of paragraphs B, C, and D thereof, where such losses are significant and are to be amortized over a period of 5 years, unless otherwise authorized by the Commission. The amortization of the amounts in this account shall be made by debits to account 411.7, Losses from Disposition of Utility Plant. (See account 105, Electric Plant Held for Future Use.)

    A. This account shall be charged with the cost of all expenditures coming within the meaning of Research, Development and Demonstration (RD & D) of this uniform system of accounts (see definition 27.B.), except those expenditures properly chargeable to account 107, Construction Work in Progress—Electric.

    B. Costs that are minor or of a general or recurring nature shall be transferred from this account to the appropriate operating expense function or if such costs are common to the overall operations or cannot be feasibly allocated to the various operating accounts, then such costs shall be recorded in account 930.2, Miscellaneous General Expenses.

    C. In certain instances a company may incur large and significant research, development, and demonstration expenditures which are nonrecurring and which would distort the annual research, development, and demonstration charges for the period. In such a case the portion of such amounts that cause the distortion may be amortized to the appropriate operating expense account over a period not to exceed 5 years unless otherwise authorized by the Commission.

    D. The entries in this account must be so maintained as to show separately each project along with complete detail of the nature and purpose of the research, development, and demonstration project together with the related costs.

    This account shall include the losses on long-term debt reacquired or redeemed. The amounts in this account shall be amortized in accordance with General Instruction 17.

    A. This account shall be debited and account 411.1, Provision for Deferred Income Taxes—Credit, Utility Operating Income, or account 411.2, Provision for Deferred Income Taxes—Credit, Other Income and Deductions, as appropriate, shall be credited with an amount equal to that by which income taxes payable for the year are higher because of the inclusion of certain items in income for tax purposes, which items for general accounting purposes will not be fully reflected in the utility's determination of annual net income until subsequent years.

    B. This account shall be credited and account 410.1, Provision for Deferred Income Taxes, Utility Operating Income, or account 410.2, Provision for Deferred Income Taxes, Other Income and Deductions, as appropriate, shall be debited with an amount equal to that by which income taxes payable for the year are lower because of prior payment of taxes as provided by paragraph A above, because of difference in timing for tax purposes of particular items of income or income deductions from that recognized by the utility for general accounting purposes. Such credit to this account and debit to account 410.1 or 410.2 shall, in general, represent the effect on taxes payable in the current year of the smaller amount of book income recognized for tax purposes as compared to the amount recognized in the utility's current accounts with respect to the item or class of items for which deferred tax accounting by the utility was authorized by the Commission.

    C. Vintage year records with respect to entries to this account, as described above, and the account balance, shall be so maintained as to show the factor of calculation with respect to each annual amount of the item or class of items for which deferred tax accounting by the utility is utilized.

    D. The utility is restricted in its use of this account to the purpose set forth above. It shall not make use of the balance in this account or any portion thereof except as provided in the text of this account, without prior approval of the Commission. Any remaining deferred tax account balance with respect to an amount for any prior year's tax deferral, the amortization of which or other recognition in the utility's income accounts has been completed, or other disposition made, shall be debited to account 410.1, Provision for Deferred Income Taxes, Utility Operating Income, or account 410.2, Provision for Deferred Income Taxes, Other Income and Deductions, as appropriate, or otherwise disposed of as the Commission may authorize or direct. (See General Instruction 18.)

    A. These accounts shall include the par value or the stated value of stock without par value if such stock has a stated value, and, if not, the cash value of the consideration received for such nonpar stock, of each class of capital stock actually issued, including the par or stated value of such capital stock in account 124, Other Investments, and account 217, Reacquired Capital Stock.

They shall be credited with the par or stated value of the stock subscribed, exclusive of accrued dividends, if any. Concurrently, a debit shall be made to subscriptions to capital stock, included as a separate subdivision of account 143, Other Accounts Receivable, for the agreed price, and any discount or premium shall be debited or credited to the appropriate discount or premium account. When properly executed stock certificates have been issued representing the shares subscribed, this account shall be debited, and the appropriate capital stock account credited, with the par or stated value of such stock.

    B. The records shall be kept in such manner as to show the amount of subscriptions to each class and series of stock.

These accounts shall include the par value or stated value, as appropriate, of capital stock which the utility has agreed to exchange for outstanding securities of other companies in connection with the acquisition of properties of such companies under terms which allow the holders of the securities of the other companies to surrender such securities and receive in return therefor capital stock of the accounting utility.

    B. When the securities of the other companies have been surrendered and capital stock issued in accordance with the terms of the exchange, these accounts shall be charged and accounts 201, Common Stock Issued, or 204, Preferred Stock Issued, as the case may be, shall be credited.

    C. The records shall be kept so as to show separately the stocks of each class and series for which a conversion liability exists.

    A.

Any discount or premium on an original issue shall be included in the appropriate discount or premium account.

    A. This account shall include in a separate subdivision for each class and series of capital stock all discount on the original issuance and sale of capital stock, including additional capital stock of a particular class or series as well as first issues.

      § 125.1   Promulgation.

#### § § 125.1

      This Part is prescribed and promulgated as the regulations governing the preservation of records by public utilities subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission and by licensees holding licenses issued by the Commission, to the extent and in the manner set forth therein.

> [Order 617, 65 FR 48155, Aug. 7, 2000]

      § 125.2   General instructions.

#### § § 125.2

      (a)  (1) The regulations in this part apply to all books of account and other records prepared by or on behalf of the public utility or licensee. See item 40 of the schedule (§ 125.3) for those records that come into possession of the public utility or licensee in connection with the acquisition of property, such as purchase, consolidation, merger, etc.

      (2) The regulations in this part should not be construed as excusing compliance with other lawful requirements of any other governmental body, Federal or State, prescribing other record keeping requirements or for preservation of records longer than those prescribed in this part.

      (3) To the extent that any Commission regulations may provide for a different retention period, the records should be retained for the longer of the retention periods.

      (4) Records other than those listed in the schedule may be destroyed at the option of the public utility or licensee:  That records which are used in lieu of those listed shall be preserved for the periods prescribed for the records used for substantially similar purposes. And,  That retention of records pertaining to added services, functions, plant, etc., the establishment of which cannot be presently foreseen, shall conform to the principles embodied herein.

      (5) Notwithstanding the provisions of the Records Retention Schedule, the Commission may, upon the request of the Company, authorize a shorter period of retention for any record listed therein upon a showing by the Company that preservation of such record for a longer period is not necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors or consumers.

      (b)  Each public utility or licensee subject to the regulations in this part shall designate one or more persons with official responsibility to supervise the utility's or licensee's program for preservation and the authorized destruction of its records.

      (c)  The public utility or licensee shall provide reasonable protection for records subject to the regulations in this part from damage by fire, floods, and other hazards and, in the selection of storage spaces, safeguards the records from unnecessary exposure to deterioration from excessive humidity, dryness, or lack of proper ventilation.

      (d)  Each public utility and licensee has the flexibility to select its own storage media subject to the following conditions.

      (1) The storage media must have a life expectancy at least equal to the applicable record retention period provided in § 125.3 unless there is a quality transfer from one media to another with no loss of data.

      (2) Each public utility and licensee is required to implement internal control procedures that assure the reliability of, and ready access to, data stored on machine readable media. Internal control procedures must be documented by a responsible supervisory official.

      (3) Each transfer of data from one media to another must be verified for accuracy and documented. Software and hardware required to produce readable records must be retained for the same period the media format is used.

      (e)  At the expiration of the retention period, public utilities and licensees may use any appropriate method to destroy records.

      (f)  When records are destroyed or lost before the expiration of the prescribed period of retention, a certified statement listing, as far as may be determined, the records destroyed and describing the circumstances of accidental or other premature destruction or loss must be filed with the Commission within ninety (90) days from the date of discovery of the destruction.

      (g)  (1) Records related to plant in service must be retained until the facilities are permanently removed from utility service, all removal and restoration activities are completed, and all costs are retired from the accounting records unless accounting adjustments resulting from reclassification and original costs studies have been approved by the regulatory commission having jurisdiction. If the plant is sold, the associated records or copies thereof, must be transferred to the new owners.

      (2) Records related to hydroelectric facilities and additions, retirements, and betterments thereto must be retained until:

      (i) The Commission has determined the actual legitimate original cost of the facilities, or the licenses are surrendered. If the plant is sold, the associated records or copies thereof, must be transferred to the new owners.

      (ii) Records related to the determination of amortization reserves pursuant to section 10(d) of the Federal Power Act must be retained until a final determination and adjudication of the amortization reserves are made.

      (h)  “Destroy at option” constitutes authorization for destruction of records at managements' discretion if it does not conflict with other legal retention requirements or usefulness of such records in satisfying pending regulatory actions or directives.

      (i)  Public utilities and licensees must assure the availability of records of services performed by and for associated or affiliated companies with supporting cost information for the periods indicated in § 125.3 as necessary to be able to readily furnish detailed information as to the nature of the transaction, the amounts involved, and the accounts used to record the transactions.

      (j)  Public utilities and licensees must arrange, file, and index records so records may be readily identified and made available to Commission representatives.

      (k)  Notwithstanding the minimum retention periods provided in these regulations, if a public utility or licensee wants to reflect costs in a current, future, or pending rate case, or if a public utility or licensee has abandoned or retired a plant subsequent to the test period of the utility's rate case, the utility must retain the appropriate records to support the costs and adjustments proposed in the current or next rate case.

      (l)  Notwithstanding the minimum requirements, if a public utility or licensee is involved in pending litigation, complaint procedures, proceedings remanded by the court, or governmental proceedings, it must retain all relevant records.

      (m)  Life or mortality study data for depreciation purposes must be retained for 25 years or for 10 years after plant is retired, whichever is longer.

      (a) Application for exemption from the provisions of the Natural Gas Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission issued pursuant thereto may be made by any person as defined in the Natural Gas Act engaged in, or authorized to engage in the transportation in interstate commerce or the sale in interstate commerce for resale, of natural gas received by such applicant from another person within or at the boundary of a State, if all of the natural gas so received is ultimately consumed in such State:  That the natural-gas rates (including rates for sales for resale) and service of the applicant and its natural-gas facilities are subject to regulation by a State Commission, as defined in the Natural Gas Act, and that such State Commission is exercising that jurisdiction.

      (b)(1)(i) For purposes of the Commission's regulations implementing the Natural Gas Act, “vehicular natural gas” or “VNG” means natural gas that will be used, in either a gaseous or liquefied state, as fuel in any self-propelled vehicle.

      (ii) For purposes of the Commission's regulations implementing the Natural Gas Act, vehicular natural gas, or VNG, is deemed to be ultimately consumed in the state in which the gas is physically delivered into the vehicle's fuel tank regardless of whether the tank is attached to the vehicle at the time it is filled.

      (2)(i) Blanket certificates of public convenience and necessity are issued pursuant to section 7(c) of the Natural Gas Act to all persons that engage in sales for resale of VNG that are subject to the Commission's authority under section 1(b) of the NGA, such authorization to be effective upon that person's engagement in the jurisdictional sale. A blanket certificate issued under this paragraph (b)(2)(i) is a certificate of limited jurisdiction which will not subject the certificate holder to any other regulation under the Natural Gas Act jurisdiction of the Commission by virtue of transactions under the certificate. Such certificate will not impair the continued validity of any Natural Gas Act exemption from Commission jurisdiction.

      (ii) A blanket certificate issued under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section authorizes the holder to make sales of VNG for resale in interstate commerce at market rates.

      (iii) Abandonment of the sales service authorized in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section is authorized pursuant to section 7(b) of the Natural Gas Act upon the expiration of the contractual term or upon termination of each individual sales arrangement.

        § 154.303   Test periods.

#### § § 154.303

        Statements A through M, O, P, and supporting schedules, in § 154.312 and § 154.313, must be based upon a test period.

        (a) If the natural gas company has been in operation for 12 months on the filing date, then the test period consists of a base period followed by an adjustment period.

        (1) The base period consists of 12 consecutive months of the most recently available actual experience. The last day of the base period may not be more than 4 months prior to the filing date.

        (2) The adjustment period is a period of up to 9 months immediately following the base period.

        (3) The test period may not extend more than 9 months beyond the filing date.

        (4) The rate factors (volumes, costs, and billing determinants) established during the base period may be adjusted for changes in revenues and costs which are known and measurable with reasonable accuracy at the time of the filing and which will become effective within the adjustment period. The base period factors must be adjusted to eliminate nonrecurring items. The company may adjust its base period factors to normalize items eliminated as nonrecurring.

        (b) If the natural gas company has not been in operation for 12 months on the filing date, then the test period must consist of 12 consecutive months ending not more than one year after the filing date. Rate factors may be adjusted as in paragraph (a)(4) of this section but must not be adjusted for occurrences anticipated after the 12-month period.

        (c)(1) Adjustments to base period experience, or to estimates where 12 months' experience is not available, may include the costs for facilities for which either a permanent or temporary certificate has been granted, provided such facilities will be in service within the test period; or a certificate application is pending. The filing must identify facilities, related costs and the docket number of each such outstanding certificate. Subject to paragraph (c)(2) of this section, adjustments to base period experience, or to estimates where 12 months' experience is not available, may include any amounts for facilities that require a certificate of public convenience and necessity, where a certificate has not been issued by the filing date but is expected to be issued before the end of the test period. Adjustments to base period may include costs for facilities that do not require a certificate and are in service by the end of the test period.

        (2) When a pipeline files a motion to place the rates into effect, the filing must be revised to exclude the costs associated with any facilities that will not be in service as of the end of the test period, or for which certificate authorization is required but will not be granted as of the end of the test period. At the end of the test period, the pipeline must remove from its rates costs associated with any facility that is not in service or for which certificate authority is required but has not been granted.

        (d) The Commission may allow reasonable deviation from the prescribed test period.

        § 154.305   Tax normalization.

#### § § 154.305

        (a)  An interstate pipeline must compute the income tax component of its cost-of-service by using tax normalization for all transactions.

        (b)  (1)  means computing the income tax component as if transactions recognized in each period for ratemaking purposes are also recognized in the same amount and in the same period for income tax purposes.

        (2)  method means a ratemaking method approved by the Commission in a final decision. This includes a ratemaking method that is part of an approved settlement or arbitration providing that the ratemaking method is to be effective beyond the term of the settlement or arbitration.

        (3)  means for the purpose of computing actual income tax under the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code or the income tax provisions of the laws of a State or political subdivision of a State (including franchise taxes).

        (4)  means that part of the cost-of-service that covers income tax expenses allowable by the Commission.

        (5)  means for the purpose of fixing, modifying, accepting, approving, disapproving, or rejecting rates under the Natural Gas Act.

        (6)  means the tax reduction or addition associated with a specific expense or revenue transaction.

        (7)  means an activity or event that gives rise to an accounting entry.

        (c)  (1) The rate base of an interstate pipeline using tax normalization under this section must be reduced by the balances that are properly recordable in Account 281, “Accumulated deferred income taxes-accelerated amortization property”; Account 282, “Accumulated deferred income taxes—other property”: and Account 283, “Accumulated deferred income taxes—other.” Balances that are properly recordable in Account 190, “Accumulated deferred income taxes,” must be treated as an addition to rate base. Include, as an addition or reduction, as appropriate, amounts in Account 182.3, Other regulatory assets, and Account 254, Other regulatory liabilities, that result from a deficiency or excess in the deferred tax accounts (see paragraph (d) of this section) and which have been, or are soon expected to be, authorized for recovery or refund through rates.

        (2) Such rate base reductions or additions must be limited to deferred taxes related to rate base, construction, or other costs and revenues affecting jurisdictional cost-of-service.

        (d)  (1) This paragraph applies:

        (i) If the rate applicant has not provided deferred taxes in the same amount that would have accrued had tax normalization always been applied; or

        (ii) If, as a result of changes in tax rates, the accumulated provision for deferred taxes becomes deficient in, or in excess of, amounts necessary to meet future tax liabilities.

        (2) The interstate pipeline must compute the income tax component in its cost-of-service by making provision for any excess or deficiency in deferred taxes.

        (3) The interstate pipeline must apply a Commission-approved ratemaking method made specifically applicable to the interstate pipeline for determining the cost-of-service provision described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section. If no Commission-approved ratemaking method has been made specifically applicable to the interstate pipeline, then the interstate pipeline must use some ratemaking method for making such provision, and the appropriateness of such method will be subject to case-by-case determination.

        (4) An interstate pipeline must continue to include, as an addition or reduction to rate base, any deficiency or excess attributable to prior flow-through or changes in tax rates (paragraphs (d)(1)(i) and (d)(1)(ii) of this section), until such deficiency or excess is fully amortized in accordance with a Commission approved ratemaking method.

        § 154.306   Cash working capital.

#### § § 154.306

        A natural gas company that files a tariff change under this part may not receive a cash working capital adjustment to its rate base unless the company or other participant in a rate proceeding under this part demonstrates, with a fully developed and reliable lead-lag study, a net revenue receipt lag or a net expense payment lag (revenue lead). Any demonstrated net revenue receipt lag will be credited to rate base; and, any demonstrated net expense payment lag will be deducted from rate base.

        § 154.307   Joint facilities.

#### § § 154.307

        The Statements required by § 154.312 must show all costs (investment, operation, maintenance, depreciation, taxes) that have been allocated to the natural gas operations involved in the subject rate change and are associated with joint facilities.

#### § § 154.308

        The filing must include a statement executed by the chief accounting officer or other authorized accounting representative of the filing company representing that the cost statements, supporting data, and workpapers, that purport to reflect the books of the company do, in fact, set forth the results shown by such books.

        § 154.309   Incremental expansions.

#### § § 154.309

        (a) For every expansion for which incremental rates are charged, the company must provide a summary with applicable cross-references to § 154.312 and § 154.313, of the costs and revenues associated with the expansion, until the Commission authorizes the costs of the incremental facilities to be rolled-in to the pipeline's rates. For every expansion that has an at-risk provision in the certificate authorization, the costs and revenues associated with the facility must be shown in summary format with applicable cross-references to § 154.312 and § 154.313, until the Commission removes the at-risk condition.

        (b) The summary statements must provide the formulae and explain the bases used in the allocation of common costs to each incremental facility.

        § 154.310   Zones.

#### § § 154.310

        If the company maintains records of costs by zone, and proposes a zone rate methodology based on these costs, the statements and schedules in § 154.312 and § 154.313 must reflect costs detailed by zone.

        In addition to the requirements of subparts A, B, and C of this part, any proposal to implement a limited rate change must comply with this subpart.

        § 154.401   RD&D expenditures.

#### § § 154.401

        (a)  Upon approval by the Commission, a natural gas company may file to recover research, development, and demonstration (RD&D) expenditures in its rates under this subpart.

        (b)  (1) An application for advance approval of rate treatment may be filed by a natural gas company for RD&D expenditures related to a project or group of projects undertaken by the company or as part of a project undertaken by others. When more than one company supports an RD&D organization, the RD&D organization may submit an application that covers the organization's RD&D program. Approval by the Commission of such an RD&D application and program will constitute approval of the individual companies' contributions to the RD&D organization.

        (2) An application for advance approval of rate treatment must include a 5-year program plan and must be filed at least 180 days prior to the commencement of the 5-year period of the plan.

        (3) A 5-year program plan must include at a minimum:

        (i) A statement of the objectives for the 5-year period that relates the objectives to the interests of ratepayers, the public, and the industry and to the objectives of other major research organizations.

        (ii) Budget, technical, and schedule information in sufficient detail to explain the work to be performed and allow an assessment of the probability of success and a comparison with other organizations' research plans.

        (iii) The commencement date, expected termination date, and expected annual costs for individual RD&D projects to be initiated during the first year of the plan.

        (iv) A discussion of the RD&D efforts and progress since the preparation of the program plan submitted the previous year and an explanation of any changes that have been made in objectives, priorities, or budgets since the plan of the previous year.

        (v) A statement identifying all jurisdictional natural gas companies that will support the program and specifying the amounts of their budgeted support.

        (vi) A statement identifying those persons involved in the development, review, and approval of the plan and specifying the amount of effort contributed and the degree of control exercised by each.

        (c) Applications must describe the RD&D projects in such detail as to satisfy the Commission that the RD&D expenditures qualify as valid, justifiable, and reasonable.

        (d) Within 120 days of the filing of an application for rate treatment approval and a 5-year program plan, the Commission will state its decision with respect to acceptance, partial acceptance, or rejection of the plan, or, when the complexity of issues in the plan so requires, will set a date certain by which a final decision will be made, or will order the matter set for hearing. Partial rejection of a plan by the Commission will be accompanied by a decision as to the partial level of acceptance which will be proportionally applied to all contributions listed for jurisdictional companies in the plan. Approval by the Commission of a 5-year plan constitutes approval for rate treatment of all projects identified as starting during the first year of the approved plan. Continued rate treatment will depend upon review and evaluation of subsequent annual applications and 5-year program plans.

        § 154.402   ACA expenditures.

#### § § 154.402

        (a)  Upon approval by the Commission, a natural gas pipeline company may adjust its rates, annually, to recover from its customers annual charges assessed by the Commission under part 382 of this chapter pursuant to an annual charge adjustment clause (ACA clause). Prior to the start of each fiscal year, the Commission will post on its Web site the amount of annual charges to be flowed through per unit of energy sold or transported (ACA unit charge) for that fiscal year. A company's ACA clause must be filed with the Commission and must incorporate by reference the ACA unit charge for the upcoming fiscal year as posted on the Commission's Web site. A company must incorporate by reference the ACA unit charge posted on the Commission's Web site in each of its rate schedules applicable to sales or transportation deliveries. The company must apply the ACA unit charge posted on the Commission's Web site to the usage component of rate schedules with two-part rates. A company may recover annual charges through an ACA unit charge only if its rates do not otherwise reflect the costs of annual charges assessed by the Commission under § 382.106(a) of this chapter. The applicable annual charge, required by § 382.103 of this chapter, must be paid before the company applies the ACA unit charge. Upon payment to the Commission of its annual charges, the ACA unit charge for that fiscal year will be incorporated by reference into the company's tariff, effective throughout that fiscal year.

        (b)  A company seeking authorization to use an ACA unit charge must file with the Commission a separate ACA tariff record containing:

        (1) A statement that the company is collecting an ACA unit charge, as calculated by the Commission, applicable to all the pipeline's sales and transportation rate schedules,

        (2) A statement that the ACA unit charge, as revised annually and posted on the Commission's Web site, is incorporated by reference into the company's tariff,

        (3) For companies with existing ACA clauses, a proposed effective date of the tariff change of October 1 of the fiscal year; for companies seeking to utilize an ACA clause after October 1 of the fiscal year, a proposed effective date 30 days after the filing of the tariff record, unless a shorter period is specifically requested in a waiver petition and approved), and

        (4) A statement that the pipeline will not recover any annual charges recorded in FERC Account 928 in a proceeding under subpart D of this part.

        (c) Changes to the ACA unit charge must be filed annually, to reflect the annual charge unit rate authorized by the Commission each fiscal year.

        § 154.403   Periodic rate adjustments.

#### § § 154.403

        (a) This section applies to the passthrough, on a periodic basis, of a single cost item or revenue item for which passthrough is not regulated under another section of this subpart, and to revisions on a periodic basis of a gas reimbursement percentage.

        (b) Where a pipeline recovers fuel use and unaccounted-for natural gas in kind, the fuel reimbursement percentage must be stated in the tariff either on the tariff sheet stating the currently effective rate or on a separate tariff sheet or section in such a way that it is clear what amount of natural gas must be tendered in kind for each service rendered.

        (c) A natural gas company that passes through a cost or revenue item or adjusts its fuel reimbursement percentage under this section, must state within the general terms and conditions of its tariff, the methodology and timing of any adjustments. The following must be included in the general terms and conditions:

        (1) A statement of the nature of the revenue or costs to be flowed through to the customer;

        (2) A statement of the manner in which the cost or revenue will be collected or returned, whether through a surcharge, offset, or otherwise;

        (3) A statement of which customers are recipients of the revenue credit and which rate schedules are subject to the cost or fuel reimbursement percentage;

        (4) A statement of the frequency of the adjustment and the dates on which the adjustment will become effective;

        (5) A step-by-step description of the manner in which the amount to be flowed through is calculated and a step-by-step description of the flowthrough mechanism, including how the costs are classified and allocated. Where the adjustment modifies a rate established under subpart D of this part, the methodology must be consistent with the methodology used in the proceeding under subpart D of this part;

        (6) Where costs or revenue credits are accumulated over a past period for periodic recovery or return, the past period must be defined and the mechanism for the recovery or return must be detailed on a step-by-step basis. Where the natural gas company proposes to use a surcharge to clear an account in which the difference between costs or revenues, recovered through rates, and actual costs and revenues accumulate, a statement must be included detailing, on a step-by-step basis, the mechanism for calculating the entries to the account and for passing through the account balance.

        (7) Where carrying charges are computed, the calculations must be consistent with the methodology and reporting requirements set forth in § 154.501 using the carrying charge rate required by that section. A natural gas company must normalize all income tax timing differences which are the result of differences between the period in which expense or revenue enters into the determination of taxable income and the period in which the expense or revenue enters into the determination of pre-tax book income. Any balance upon which the natural gas company calculates carrying charges must be adjusted for any recorded deferred income taxes.

        (8) Where the natural gas company discounts the rate component calculated pursuant to this section, explain on a step-by-step basis how the natural gas company will adjust for rate discounts in its methodology to reflect changes in costs under this section.

        (9) If the costs passed through under a mechanism approved under this section are billed by an upstream natural gas company, explain how refunds received from upstream natural gas companies will be passed through to the natural gas company's customers, including the allocation and classification of such refunds;

        (10) A step-by-step explanation of the methodology used to reflect changes in the fuel reimbursement percentage, including the allocation and classification of the fuel use and unaccounted-for natural gas. Where the adjustment modifies a fuel reimbursement percentage established under subpart D of this part, the methodology must be consistent with the methodology used in the proceeding under subpart D of this part;

        (11) A statement of whether the difference between quantities actually used or lost and the quantities retained from the customers for fuel use and loss will be recovered or returned in a future surcharge. Include a step-by-step explanation of the methodology used to calculate such surcharge. Any period during which these differences accumulate must be defined.

        (d)  (1) Filings under this section must include:

        (i) A summary statement showing the rate component added to each rate schedule with workpapers showing all mathematical calculations.

        (ii) If the filing establishes a new fuel reimbursement percentage or surcharge, include computations for each fuel reimbursement or surcharge calculated, broken out by service, classification, area, zone, or other subcategory.

        (iii) Workpapers showing the allocation of costs or revenue credits by rate schedule and step-by-step computations supporting the allocation, segregated into reservation and usage amounts, where appropriate.

        (iv) Where the costs, revenues, rates, quantities, indices, load factors, percentages, or other numbers used in the calculations are publicly available, include references by source.

        (v) Where a rate or quantity underlying the costs or revenue credits is supported by publicly available data (such as another natural gas company's tariff or EBB), the source must be referenced to allow the Commission and interested parties to review the source. If the rate or quantity does not match the rate or quantity from the source referenced, provide step-by-step instructions to tie the rate in the referenced source to the rate in the filing.

        (vi) Where a number is derived from another number by applying a load factor, percentage, or other adjusting factor not referenced in paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section, include workpapers and a narrative to explain the calculation of the adjusting factor.

        (2) If the natural gas company is adjusting its rates to reflect changes in transportation and compression costs paid to others:

        (i) The changes in transportation and compression costs must be based on the rate on file with the Commission. If the rate is not on file with the Commission or a discounted rate is paid, the rate reflected in the filing must be the rate the natural gas company is contractually obligated to pay;

        (ii) The filing must include appropriate credits for capacity released under § 284.243 of this chapter with workpapers showing the quantity released, the revenues received from the release, the time period of the release, and the natural gas pipeline on which the release took place; and,

        (iii) The filing must include a statement of the refunds received from each upstream natural gas company which are included in the rate adjustment. The statement must conform to the requirements set forth in § 154.501.

        (3) If the natural gas company is reflecting changes in its fuel reimbursement percentage, the filing must include:

        (i) A summary statement of actual gas inflows and outflows for each month used to calculate the fuel reimbursement percentage or surcharge. For purposes of establishing the surcharge, the summary statement must be included for each month of the period over which the differences defined in paragraph (c) of this section accumulate.

        (ii) Where the fuel reimbursement percentage is calculated based on estimated activity over a future period, the period must be defined and the estimates used in the calculation must be justified. If any of the estimates are publicly available, include a reference to the source.

        (4) The natural gas company must not recover costs and is not obligated to return revenues which are applicable to the period pre-dating the effectiveness of the tariff language setting forth the periodic rate change mechanism, unless permitted or required to do so by the Commission.

        (iii) The jurisdictional portion of a refund the natural gas company receives.

        (e) Unless otherwise provided by the order, settlement or tariff provision requiring the refund, the natural gas company must file a report of refunds, within 30 days of the date the refund was made, which complies with § 154.502 and includes the following:

        (1) Workpapers and a narrative sufficient to show how the refunds for jurisdictional services were calculated;

        (2) Workpapers and a narrative sufficient to determine the origin of the refund, including step-by-step calculations showing the derivation of the refund amount described in paragraph (d)(3) of this section, if necessary;

        (3) References to any publicly available sources which confirm the rates, quantities, or costs, which are used to calculate the refund balance or which confirm the refund amount itself. If the rate, quantity, cost or refund does not directly tie to the source, a workpaper must be included to show the reconciliation between the rate, quantity, cost, or refund in the natural gas company's report and the corresponding rate, quantity, cost or refund in the source document;

        (4) Workpapers showing the calculation of interest on a monthly basis, including how the carrying charges were compounded quarterly;

        (5) Workpapers and a narrative explaining how the refund was allocated to each jurisdictional customer. Where the numbers used to support the allocation are publicly available, a reference to the source must be included. Where the allocation methodology has been approved previously, a reference to the order or tariff provision approving the allocation methodology must be included.

        (6) A letter of transmittal containing:

        (i) A list of the material enclosed;

        (ii) The name and telephone number of a company official who can answer questions regarding the filing;

      Subpart B—Open Seasons for Alaska Natural Gas Transportation Projects

**Source:** Source: Order 2005, 70 FR 8286, Feb. 18, 2005, unless otherwise noted.

        § 157.30   Purpose.

#### § § 157.30

        This subpart establishes the procedures for conducting open seasons for the purpose of making binding commitments for the acquisition of initial or voluntary expansion capacity on Alaska natural gas transportation projects, as defined herein.

        § 157.31   Definitions.

#### § § 157.31

        (a) “Alaska natural gas transportation project” means any natural gas pipeline system that carries Alaska natural gas to the international border between Alaska and Canada (including related facilities subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission) that is authorized under the Alaska Natural Gas Transportation Act of 1976 or section 103 of the Alaska Natural Gas Pipeline Act.

        (b) “Commission” means the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.

        (c) “Voluntary expansion” means any expansion in capacity of an Alaska natural gas transportation project above the initial certificated capacity, including any increase in mainline capacity, any extension of mainline pipeline facilities, and any lateral pipeline facilities beyond those certificated in the initial certificate order, voluntarily made by the pipeline. An expansion done pursuant to section 105 of the Alaska Natural Gas Pipeline Act is not a voluntary expansion.

        § 157.32   Applicability.

#### § § 157.32

        These regulations shall apply to any application to the Commission for a certificate of public convenience and necessity or other authorization for an Alaska natural gas transportation project, whether filed pursuant to the Natural Gas Act, the Alaska Natural Gas Transportation Act of 1976, or the Alaska Natural Gas Pipeline Act, and to applications for expansion of such projects. Absent a Commission order to the contrary, these regulations are not applicable in the case of an expansion ordered by the Commission pursuant to section 105 of the Alaska Natural Gas Pipeline Act.

        § 157.33   Requirement for open season.

#### § § 157.33

        (a) Any application for a certificate of public convenience and necessity or other authorization for a proposed Alaska natural gas transportation project must include a demonstration that the applicant has conducted an open season for capacity on its proposed project, in accordance with the requirements of this subpart. Failure to provide the requisite demonstration will result in an application being rejected as incomplete.

        (b) Initial capacity on a proposed Alaska natural gas transportation project may be acquired prior to an open season through pre-subscription agreements, provided that in any open season as required in paragraph (a) of this section, capacity is offered to all prospective bidders at the same rates and on the same terms and conditions as contained in the pre-subscription agreements. All pre-subscription agreements shall be made public by posting on Internet websites and press releases within ten days of their execution. In the event there is more than one such agreement, all prospective bidders shall be allowed the option of selecting among the several agreements all of the rates, terms and conditions contained in any one such agreement.

        (21) A statement that any officers and directors of the prospective applicant's affiliated sales and marketing units and affiliates involved in the production of natural gas in the State of Alaska named in paragraph (c)(19) of this section will be prohibited from obtaining information about the conduct of the open season or allocation of capacity that is not posted on the open season Internet Web site or that is otherwise also available to the general public or other participants in the open season.

        (d)  (1) A prospective applicant must provide prospective shippers at least 90 days from the date on which notice of the open season is given within which to submit requests for transportation services. No bid shall be rejected because a prospective shipper has submitted another bid in another open season conducted under this subpart.

        (2) A prospective applicant must consider any bids tendered after the expiration of the open season by qualifying bidders and may reject them only if they cannot be accommodated due to economic, engineering, design, capacity or operational constraints, or accommodating the request would otherwise adversely impact the timely development of the project, and a detailed explanation must accompany the rejection. Any bids tendered after the expiration of the open season must contain a good faith showing, including a statement of the circumstances which prevented the late bidder from tendering a timely bid and how those circumstances have changed. If a prospective applicant determines at any time that, based on the criteria stated in this paragraph, no further late bids for capacity can be accommodated, it may request Commission approval to summarily reject any further requests.

        (3) Within 10 days after precedent agreements have been executed for capacity allocated in the open season, the prospective applicant shall make public on the Internet and through press releases the results of the open season, at least including the name of the prospective shipper, amount of capacity awarded, and term of agreement.

        (4) Within 20 days after precedent agreements have been executed for capacity allocated in the open season, the prospective applicant must submit copies of all such precedent agreements to the Commission and copies of any relevant correspondence with bidders for capacity who were not allocated capacity that identifies why such bids were not accepted (all documents identified in this paragraph (d)(4) may be filed seeking privileged treatment pursuant to § 388.112 of this chapter.

    20.  means the associated parts or items of which retirement units are composed.

    21.  means either natural gas unmixed, or any mixture of natural and artificial gas.

    22.  means a person engaged in the transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce, or the sale in interstate commerce of such gas for resale.

    23.  means the salvage value of property retired less the cost of removal.

    24.  as applied to securities issued or assumed by the utility, means those which have been signed, certified, or otherwise executed, and placed with the proper officer for sale and delivery, or pledged, or otherwise placed in some special fund of the utility, but which have not been sold, or issued direct to trustees of sinking funds in accordance with contractual requirements.

    25.  as applied to securities issued or assumed by the utility, means those which, after being actually issued, have been reacquired by or for the utility under circumstances which require them to be considered as held alive and not retired, provided, however, that securities held by trustees shall be considered as actually outstanding.

    26.  as applied to gas plant, means the cost of such property to the person first devoting it to public service.

    27.  means an individual, a corporation, a partnership, an association, a joint stock company, a business trust, or any organized group of persons, whether incorporated or not, or any receiver or trustee.

    28.  as applied to securities issued or assumed by the utility, means the excess of the cash value of the consideration received from their sale over the sum of their par (stated value of no-par stocks) or face value and interest or dividends accrued at the date of sale.

    29.  For the purposes of this system of accounts:

    A.  shall consist of plant and equipment used in the production of gas. It shall include producing lands and leaseholds, gas rights, other land rights, structures, drilling and clearing equipment, gas wells, well head equipment, separation and other facilities used in the production of natural gas. The production system ends where the gas enters a gathering system, transmission system or distribution system, as applicable, in accordance with the practices in the pricing area where such system is located.

    B.  means the land, structures, mains, valves, meters, boosters, regulators, tanks, compressors, and their driving units and appurtenances, and other equipment used primarily for transmitting gas from a production plant, delivery point of purchased gas, gathering system, storage area, or other wholesale source of gas, to one or more distribution areas. The transmission system begins at the outlet side of the valve at the connection to the last equipment in a manufactured gas plant, the connection to gathering lines or delivery point of purchased gas, and includes the equipment at such connection that is used to bring the gas to transmission pressure, and ends at the outlet side of the equipment which meters or regulates the entry of gas into the distribution system or into a storage area. It does not include storage land, structures or equipment. Pipeline companies, including those companies which measure deliveries of gas to their own distribution systems, shall include city gate and main line industrial measuring and regulating stations in the transmission function.

    C.  means the mains which are provided primarily for distributing gas within a distribution area, together with land, structures, valves, regulators, services and measuring devices, including the mains for transportation of gas from production plants or points of receipt located within such distribution area to other points therein. The distribution system owned by companies having no transmission facilities connected to such distribution system begins at the inlet side of the distribution system equipment which meters or regulates the entry of gas into the distribution system and ends with and includes property on the customer's premises. For companies which own both transmission and distribution facilities on a continuous line, the distribution system begins at the outlet side of the equipment which meters or regulates the entry of gas into the distribution system and ends with and includes property on the customer's premises. The distribution system does not include storage land, structures, or equipment.

    D.  means a metropolitan area or other urban area comprising one or more adjacent or nearby cities, villages or unincorporated areas, including developed areas contiguous to main highways.

    30.  as applied to gas plant, means property which has been removed, sold, abandoned, destroyed, or which for any cause has been withdrawn from service.

    31.  are assets and liabilities that result from rate actions of regulatory agencies. Regulatory assets and liabilities arise from specific revenues, expenses, gains, or losses that would have been included in net income determinations in one period under the general requirements of the Uniform System of Accounts but for it being probable: 1) that such items will be included in a different period(s) for purposes of developing the rates the utility is authorized to charge for its utility services; or 2) in the case of regulatory liabilities, that refunds to customers, not provided for in other accounts, will be required.

    32. A.  or  when not otherwise indicated in the context, means the construction or installation of gas plant in place of property retired, together with the removal of the property retired.

    B.  (RD&D), means expenditures incurred by natural gas companies either directly or through another person or organization (such as research institute, industry association, foundation, university, engineering company, or similar contractor) in pursuing research, development, and demonstration activities including experiment, design, installation, construction, or operation. This definition includes expenditures for the implementation or development of new and/or existing concepts until technically feasible and commercially feasible operations are verified. Such research, development, and demonstration costs should be reasonably related to the existing or future utility business, broadly defined, of the public utility or licensee or in the environment in which it operates or expects to operate. The term includes, but is not limited to: All such costs incidental to the design, development or implementation of an experimental facility, a plant process, a product, a formula, an invention, a system or similar items, and the improvement of already existing items of a like nature; amounts expended in connection with the proposed development and/or proposed delivery of substitute or synthetic gas supplies (alternate fuel sources for example, an experimental coal gasification plant or an experimental plant synthetically producing gas from liquid hydrocarbons); and the costs of obtaining its own patent, such as attorney's fees expended in making and perfecting a patent application. The term includes preliminary investigations and detailed planning of specific projects for securing for customers non-conventional pipeline gas supplies that rely on technology that has not been verified previously to be feasible. The term does not include expenditures for efficiency surveys; studies of management, management techniques and organization; consumer surveys, advertising, promotions, or items of a like nature.

    33.  (formerly earned surplus) means the accumulated net income of the utility less distribution to stockholders and transfers to other capital accounts.

    34.  means those items of gas plant which, when retired, with or without replacement, are accounted for by crediting the book cost thereof to the gas plant account in which included.

    35.  means the amount received for property retired, less any expenses incurred in connection with the sale or in preparing the property for sale; or, if retained, the amount at which the material recoverable is chargeable to Materials and Supplies, or other appropriate account.

    36.  means the time between the date gas plant is includible in gas plant in service, or gas plant leased to others, and the date of its retirement. If depreciation is accounted for on a production basis rather than on a time basis, then service life should be measured in terms of the appropriate unit of production.

    37.  means the difference between original cost and net salvage value of gas plant.

    38.  means exploration and development costs related to efforts which do not directly result in the discovery of commercially recoverable hydrocarbon reserves.

    39.  means a company which is controlled by the utility through ownership of voting stock. (See “Definitions”—item 5B “Control”). A corporate joint venture in which a corporation is owned by a small group of businesses as a separate and specific business or project for the mutual benefit of the members of the group is a subsidiary company for the purposes of this system of accounts.

    40.  as used herein and when not otherwise indicated in the context, means any natural gas company to which this system of accounts is applicable.

    1.  Each natural gas company must apply the system of accounts prescribed by the Commission.

    —Each natural gas company as defined in the Natural Gas Act, whose combined gas sold for resale and gas transported or stored for a fee exceeds 50 million Mcf at 14.73 psi (60 °F) in each of the three previous calendar years.

    —Natural gas companies that are not classified as a “major company” (as defined above), and had total gas sales or volume transactions exceeding 200,000 Mcf at 14.73 psi (60 °F) in each of the three previous calendar years.

    B. This system applies to both _Major_ and _Nonmajor_ natural gas companies. Provisions have been incorporated into this system for those entities which prior to January 1, 1984, were applying the Commission's Uniform System of Accounts Prescribed for Class C and Class D (part 104 of this chapter) now revoked. The notations “(Nonmajor)” and “(Major)” have been used to indicate those instructions and accounts from the previous systems and classifications, which by definition, are not interchangeable without causing a loss of detail for the  (previous Class A and Class B) or an increase in detail burden for the  (previous Class C and Class D).

    C. The class to which any natural gas company belongs shall originally be determined by its annual gas volume in each of the last three consecutive years, or, in the case of a newly established entity, the projected data shall be the basis. Subsequent changes in classification shall be made when the volume for each of the three immediately preceding years exceeds the upper limit, or is less than the lower limit of the classification previously applicable to the natural gas company.

    D. Any utility may, at its option, adopt the system of accounts prescribed by the Commission for any larger class of utilities.

    2.  A. Each utility shall keep its books of account, and all other books, records, and memoranda which support the entries in such books of account so as to be able to furnish readily full information as to any item included in any account. Each entry shall be supported by such detailed information as will permit ready identification, analysis, and verification of all facts relevant thereto.

    B. The books and records referred to herein include not only accounting records in a limited technical sense, but all other records, such as minute books, stock books, reports, correspondence, memoranda, etc., which may be useful in developing the history of or facts regarding any transaction.

    C. No utility shall destroy any such books or records unless the destruction thereof is permitted by rules and regulations of the Commission.

    D. In addition to prescribed accounts, clearing accounts, temporary or experimental accounts, and subdivisions of any accounts, may be kept, provided the integrity of the prescribed accounts is not impaired.

    E. All amounts included in the accounts prescribed herein for gas plant and operating expenses shall be just and reasonable and any payments or accruals by the utility in excess of just and reasonable charges shall be included in account 426.5, Other Deductions.

    F. The arrangement or sequence of the accounts prescribed herein shall not be controlling as to the arrangement or sequence in report forms which may be prescribed by the Commission.

    3.  A. The account numbering plan used herein consists of a system of three-digit whole numbers as follows:

    B. In certain instances, numbers have been skipped in order to allow for possible later expansion or to permit better coordination with the numbering system for other utility departments.

    C. The numbers prefixed to account titles are to be considered as part of the titles. Each utility, however, may adopt for its own purposes a different system of account numbers (See also general instruction 2D) provided that the numbers herein prescribed shall appear in the descriptive headings of the ledger accounts and in the various sources of original entry; however, if a utility uses a different group of account numbers and it is not practicable to show the prescribed account numbers in the various sources of original entry, such reference to the prescribed account numbers may be omitted from the various sources of original entry. Moreover, each utility using different account numbers for its own purposes shall keep readily available a list of such account numbers which it uses and a reconciliation of such account numbers with the account numbers provided herein. It is intended that the utility's records shall be so kept as to permit ready analysis by prescribed accounts (by direct reference to sources of original entry to the extent practicable) and to permit preparation of financial and operating statements directly from such records at the end of each accounting period according to the prescribed accounts.

    4.  Each utility shall keep its books on a monthly basis so that for each month all transactions applicable thereto, as nearly as may be ascertained, shall be entered in the books of the utility. Amounts applicable or assignable to specific utility departments shall be so segregated monthly. Each utility shall close its books at the end of each calendar year unless otherwise authorized by the Commission.

    5.  To maintain uniformity of accounting, utilities shall submit questions of doubtful interpretation to the Commission for consideration and decision.

    6.  Lists of “items” appearing in the texts of the accounts or elsewhere herein are for the purpose of more clearly indicating the application of the prescribed accounting. The lists are intended to be representative, but not exhaustive. The appearance of an item in a list warrants the inclusion of the item in the account mentioned only when the text of the account also indicates inclusion inasmuch as the same item frequently appears in more than one list. The proper entry in each instance must be determined by the texts of the accounts.

    7.  It is the intent that net income shall reflect all items of profit and loss during the period with the exception of prior period adjustments as described in paragraph 7.1 and long-term debt as described in paragraph 17 below. Those items related to the effects of events and transactions which have occurred during the current period and which are of unusual nature and infrequent occurrence shall be considered extraordinary items. Accordingly, they will be events and transactions of significant effect which are abnormal and significantly different from the ordinary and typical activities of the company, and which would not reasonably be expected to recur in the foreseeable future. (In determining significance, items should be considered individually and not in the aggregate. However, the effects of a series of related transactions arising from a single specific and identifiable event or plan of action should be considered in the aggregate.) To be considered as extraordinary under the above guidelines, an item should be more than approximately 5 percent of income, computed before extraordinary items. Commission approval must be obtained to treat an item of less than 5 percent, as extraordinary. (See accounts 434 and 435.)

    A. Items of profit and loss related to the following shall be accounted for as prior period adjustments and excluded from the determination of net income for the current year.

    (1) Correction of an error in the financial statements of a prior year.

    (2) Adjustments that result from realization of income tax benefits of pre-acquisition operating loss carryforwards of purchased subsidiaries.

    B. All other items of profit and loss recognized during the year shall be included in the determination of net income for that year.

    8.  Whenever a financial statement is required by the Commission, if it is known that a transaction has occurred which affects the accounts but the amount involved in the transaction and its effect upon the accounts cannot be determined with absolute accuracy, the amount shall be estimated and such estimated amount included in the proper accounts. The utility is not required to anticipate minor items which would not appreciably affect the accounts.

    9.  The charges to gas plant, operating expense and other accounts for services and expenses of employees engaged in activities chargeable to various accounts, such as construction, maintenance, and operations, shall be based upon the actual time engaged in the respective classes of work, or in case that method is impracticable, upon the basis of a study of the time actually engaged during a representative period.

    10.  Underlying accounting data shall be maintained so that the distribution of the cost of labor charged direct to the various accounts will be readily available. Such underlying data shall permit a reasonably accurate distribution to be made of the cost of labor charged initially to clearing accounts so that the total labor cost may be classified among construction, cost of removal, gas operating functions (manufactured gas production, natural gas production and gathering, products extraction, underground storage, transmission, distribution, etc.), and nonutility operations.

    11.  A. The utility is required to keep its accounts on the accrual basis. This requires the inclusion in its accounts of all known transactions of appreciable amount which affect the accounts. If bills covering such transactions have not been received or rendered, the amounts shall be estimated and appropriate adjustments made when the bills are received.

    B. When payments are made in advance for items such as insurance, rents, taxes or interest, the amount applicable to future periods shall be charged to account 165, Prepayments, and spread over the periods to which applicable by credits to account 165, and charges to the accounts appropriate for the expenditure.

    12.  A. Separate records shall be maintained by gas plant accounts of the book cost of each plant owned, including additions by the utility to plant leased from others, and of the cost of operating and maintaining each plant owned or operated. The term “plant,” as here used, means each manufactured gas production plant, the wells and gathering lines of each distinct production area, each system of interconnected transmission mains, each system of wells and lines of an underground storage project, each large purification or dehydration plant, each compressor station, other than a distribution compressor station, and each products extraction plant.

    B. A natural gas company may, with the approval of the Commission, group certain of its systems of gathering lines and wells, small compressor stations, systems of underground storage lines and wells, and systems of interconnected transmission mains for the purpose of complying with the portion of this instruction requiring a segregation of the cost of operating and maintaining each plant.

    13.  If the utility also operates other utility departments, such as electric, water, etc., it shall keep such accounts for the other departments as may be prescribed by proper authority and in the absence of prescribed accounts, it shall keep such accounts as are proper or necessary to reflect the results of operating each such department. It is not intended that proprietary and similar accounts which apply to the utility as a whole shall be departmentalized.

    14.  Each utility shall keep its accounts and records so as to be able to furnish accurately and expeditiously statements of all transactions with associated companies. The statements may be required to show the general nature of the transactions, the amounts involved therein and the amounts included in each account prescribed herein with respect to such transactions. Transactions with associated companies shall be recorded in the appropriate accounts for transactions of the same nature. Nothing herein contained, however, shall be construed as restraining the utility from subdividing accounts for the purpose of recording separately transactions with associated companies.

    15.  Contingent assets represent a possible source of value to the utility contingent upon the fulfillment of conditions regarded as uncertain. Contingent liabilities include items which may under certain conditions become obligations of the utility but which are neither direct nor assumed liabilities at the date of the balance sheet. The utility shall be prepared to give a complete statement of significant contingent assets and liabilities (including cumulative dividends on preference stock) in its annual report and at such other times as may be requested by the Commission.

    16. [Reserved]

    17. — A.  A separate premium, discount and expense account shall be maintained for each class and series of long-term debt (including receivers' certificates) issued or assumed by the utility. The premium will be recorded in account 225, Unamortized Premium on Long-Term Debt, the discount will be recorded in account 226, Unamortized Discount on Long-Term Debt—Debit, and the expense of issuance shall be recorded in account 181, Unamortized Debt Expense.

    The premium, discount and expense shall be amortized over the life of the respective issues under a plan which will distribute the amounts equitably over the life of the securities. The amortization shall be on a monthly basis, and amounts thereof relating to discount and expense shall be charged to account 428, Amortization of Debt Discount and Expense. The amounts relating to premium shall be credited to account 429, Amortization of Premium on Debt—Credit.

    B.  When long-term debt is reacquired or redeemed without being converted into another form of long-term debt and when the transaction is not in connection with a refunding operation (primarily redemptions for sinking fund purposes), the difference between the amount paid upon reacquisition and the face value; plus any un- amortized premium less any related unamortized debt expense and reacquisition costs; or less any unamortized discount, related debt expense and reacquisition costs applicable to the debt redeemed, retired and canceled, shall be included in account 189, Unamortized Loss on Reacquired Debt, or account 257, Unamortized Gain on Reacquired Debt, as appropriate. The utility shall amortize the recorded amounts equally on a monthly basis over the remaining life of the respective security issues (old original debt). The amounts so amortized shall be charged to account 428.1, Amortization of Loss on Reacquired Debt, or credited to account 429.1, Amortization of Gain on Reacquired Debt—Credit, as appropriate.

    C.  When the redemption of one issue or series of bonds or other long-term obligations is financed by another issue or series before the maturity date of the first issue, the difference between the amount paid upon refunding and the face value; plus any unamortized premium less related debt expense or less any unamortized discount and related debt expense, applicable to the debt refunded, shall be included in account 189, Unamortized Loss on Reacquired Debt, or account 257, Unamortized Gain on Reacquired Debt, as appropriate. The utility may elect to account for such amounts as follows:

    (1) Write them off immediately when the amounts are insignificant.

    (2) Amortize them by equal monthly amounts over the remainder of the original life of the issue retired, or

    (3) Amortize them by equal monthly amounts over the life of the new issue.

    Once an election is made, it shall be applied on a consistent basis. The amounts in (1), (2), or (3) above shall be charged to account 428.1, Amortization of Loss on Reacquired Debt, or credited to account 429.1, Amortization of Gain on Reacquired Debt—Credit, as appropriate.

    D. Under methods (2) and (3) above, the increase or reduction in current income taxes resulting from the reacquisition should be apportioned over the remainder of the original life of the issue retired or over the life of the new issue, as appropriate, as directed more specifically in paragraphs E and F below.

    E. When the utility recognizes the loss in the year of reacquisition as a tax deduction, account 410.1, Provision for Deferred Income Taxes, Utility Operating Income, shall be debited and account 283, Accumulated Deferred Income Taxes—Other, shall be credited with the amount of the related tax effect, such amount to be allocated to the periods affected in accordance with the provisions of account 283.

    F. When the utility chooses to recognize the gain in the year of reacquisition as a taxable gain, account 411.1, Provision for Deferred Income Taxes—Credit, Utility Operating Income, shall be credited and account 190, Accumulated Deferred Income Taxes, shall be debited with the amount of the related tax effect, such amount to be allocated to the periods affected in accordance with the provisions of account 190.

    G. When the utility chooses to use the optional privilege of deferring the tax on the gain attributable to the reacquisition of debt by reducing the depreciable basis of utility property for tax purposes, pursuant to Section 108 of the Internal Revenue Code, the related tax effects shall be deferred as the income is recognized for accounting purposes, and the deferred amounts shall be amortized over the life of the associated property on a vintage year basis. Account 410.1, Provision for Deferred Income Taxes, Utility Operating Income, shall be debited, and account 282, Accumulated Deferred Income Taxes—Other Property, shall be credited with an amount equal to the estimated income tax effect applicable to the portion of the income, attributable to reacquired debt, recognized for accounting purposes during the period. Account 282 shall be debited and account 411.1, Provision for Deferred Income Taxes—Credit, Utility Operating Income, shall be credited with an amount equal to the estimated income tax effects, during the life of the property, attributable to the reduction in the depreciable basis for tax purposes.

    H. The tax effects relating to gain or loss shall be allocated as above to utility operations except in cases where a portion of the debt reacquired is directly applicable to nonutility operations. In that event, the related portion of the tax effects shall be allocated to nonutility operations. Where it can be established that reacquired debt is generally applicable to both utility and nonutility operations, the tax effects shall be allocated between utility and nonutility operations based on the ratio of net investment in utility plant to net investment in non- utility plant.

    I. Premium, discount, or expense on debt shall not be included as an element in the cost of construction or acquisition of property (tangible or intangible), except under the provisions of account 432, Allowance for Borrowed Funds Used During Construction—Credit.

    J.  Where a regulatory authority or a group of regulatory authorities having prime rate jurisdiction over the utility specifically disallows the rate principle of amortizing gains or losses on reacquisition of long-term debt without refunding, and does not apply the gain or loss to reduce interest charges in computing the allowed rate of return for rate purposes, then the following alternate method may be used to account for gains or losses relating to reacquisition of long-term debt, with or without refunding.

    (1) The difference between the amount paid upon reacquisition of any long-term debt and the face value, adjusted for unamortized discount, expenses or premium, as the case may be, applicable to the debt redeemed shall be recognized currently in income and recorded in account 421, Miscellaneous Nonoperating Income, or account 426.5, Other Deductions.

    (2) When this alternate method of accounting is used, the utility shall include a footnote to each financial statement, prepared for public use, explaining why this method is being used along with the treatment given for ratemaking purposes.

    18.  A. Where there are timing differences between the periods in which transactions affect taxable income and the periods in which they enter into the determination of pretax accounting income, the income tax effects of such transactions are to be recognized in the periods in which the differences between book accounting income and taxable income arise and in the periods in which the differences reverse using the deferred tax method. In general, comprehensive interperiod tax allocation should be followed whenever transactions enter into the determination of pretax accounting income for the period even though some transactions may affect the determination of taxes payable in a different period, as further qualified below.

    B. Utilities are not required to utilize comprehensive interperiod income tax allocation until the deferred income taxes are included as an expense in the rate level by the regulatory authority having rate jurisdiction over the utility. Where comprehensive interperiod tax allocation accounting is not practiced the utility shall include as a note to each financial statement, prepared for public use, a footnote explanation setting forth the utility's accounting policies with respect to interperiod tax allocation and describing the treatment for ratemaking purposes of the tax timing differences by regulatory authorities having rate jurisdiction.

    C. Should the utility be subject to more than one agency having rate jurisdiction, its accounts shall appropriately reflect the ratemaking treatment (deferral or flow through) of each jurisdiction.

    D. Once comprehensive interperiod tax allocation has been initiated either in whole or in part it shall be practiced on a consistent basis and shall not be changed or discontinued without prior Commission approval.

    E. Tax effects deferred currently will be recorded as deferred debits or deferred credits in accounts 190, Accumulated Deferred Income Taxes, 281, Accumulated Deferred Income Taxes—Accelerated Amortization Property, 282, Accumulated Deferred Income Taxes—Other Property, and 283, Accumulated Deferred Income Taxes—Other, as appropriate. The resulting amounts recorded in these accounts shall be disposed of as prescribed in this system of accounts or as otherwise authorized by the Commission.

    19.  A. If at its inception a lease meets one or more of the following criteria, the lease shall be classified as a capital lease. Otherwise, it shall be classified as an operating lease.

    (1) The lease transfers ownership of the property to the leasee by the end of the lease term.

    (2) The lease contains a bargain purchase option.

    (3) The lease term is equal to 75 percent or more of the estimated economic life of the leased property. However, if the beginning of the lease term falls within the last 25 percent of the total estimated economic life of the lease property, including earlier years of use, this criterion shall not be used for purposes of classifying the lease.

    (4) the present value at the beginning of the lease term of the minimum lease payments, excluding that portion of the payments representing executory costs such as insurance, maintenance, and taxes to be paid by the lessor, including any profit thereon, equals or exceeds 90 percent of the excess of the fair value of the leased property to the lessor at the inception of the lease over any related investment tax credit retained by the lessor and expected to be realized by the lessor. However, if the beginning of the lease term falls within the last 25 percent of the total estimated economic life of the lease property, including earlier years of use, this criterion shall not be used for purposes of classifying the lease. The lessee utility shall compute the present value of the minimum lease payments using his incremental borrowing rate, unless (a) it is practicable for the utility to learn the implicit rate computed by the lessor, and (b) the implicit rate computed by the lessor is less than the lessee's incremental borrowing rate. If both of those conditions are met, the lessee shall use the implicit rate.

    B. If at any time the lessee and lessor agree to change the provisions of the lease, other than by renewing the lease or extending its term, in a manner that would have resulted in a different classification of the lease under the criteria in paragraph A had the changed terms been in effect at the inception of the lease, the revised agreement shall be considered as a new agreement over its term, and the criteria in paragraph A shall be applied for purposes of classifying the lease. Likewise, any action that extends the lease beyond the expiration of the existing lease term, such as the exercise of a lease renewal option other than those already included in the lease term, shall be considered as a new agreement, and shall be classified according to the above provisions, Changes in estimates (for example, changes in estimates of the economic life or of the residual value of the leased property) or changes in circumstances (for example, default by the lessee), shall not give rise to a new classification of a lease for accounting purposes.

    20.  A. All leases shall be classified as either capital or operating leases. The accounting for capitalized leases is effective January 1, 1984, except for the retroactive classification of certain leases which, in accordance with FASB No. 71, will not be required to be capitalized until after a three year transition period. For the purpose of reporting to the FERC, the transition period shall be deemed to end December 31, 1986.

    B. The utility shall record a capital lease as an asset in account 101.1, Property under Capital Leases (or account 121, Non-utility Property, if appropriate), and an obligation in account 227, Obligations under Capital Leases—Noncurrent, or account 243, Obligations under Capital Leases—Current, at an amount equal to the present value at the beginning of the lease term of minimum lease payments during the lease term, excluding that portion of the payments representing executory costs such as insurance, maintenance, and taxes to be paid by the lessor, together with any profit thereon. However, if the amount so determined exceeds the fair value of the leased property at the inception of the lease, the amount recorded as the asset and obligation shall be the fair value.

    C. The utility, as a lessee, shall recognize an asset retirement obligation (See General Instruction 24) arising from the plant under a capital lease unless the obligation is recorded as an asset and liability under a capital lease. The utility shall record the asset retirement cost by debiting account 101.1, Property under capital leases, or account 121, Nonutility property, as appropriate, and crediting the liability for the asset retirement obligation in account 230, Asset retirement obligations. Asset retirement costs recorded in account 101.1 or account 121 shall be amortized by charging rent expense (See Operating Expense Instruction 3) or account 421, Miscellaneous nonoperating income, as appropriate, and crediting a separate subaccount of the account in which the asset retirement costs are recorded. Charges for the periodic accretion of the liability in account 230, Asset retirement obligations, shall be recorded by a charge to account 411.10, Accretion expense, for gas utility plant, and account 421, Miscellaneous nonoperating income, for nonutility plant and a credit to account 230, Asset retirement obligations.

    D. Rental payments on all leases shall be charged to rent expense, fuel expense, construction work in progress, or other appropriate accounts as they become payable.

    E. For a capital lease, for each period during the lease term, the amounts recorded for the asset and obligation shall be reduced by an amount equal to the portion of each lease payment which would have been allocated to the reduction of the obligation, if the payment had been treated as a payment on an installment obligation (liability) and allocated between interest expense and a reduction of the obligation so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance.

    21.  Each utility with natural gas operations shall maintain operating or accounting records for each well showing: (a) Acreage on which drilled, (b) dates of drilling period, (c) cost of drilling, (d) depth of well, (e) particulars and depth of each stratum drilled through, (f) geological formation from which gas is obtained, (g) initial rock pressure and open flow capacity, (h) sizes of casing used and lengths of each size, (i) total cost of well as recorded in gas plant accounts, (j) date well abandoned, for wells once productive, (k) date transferred to underground storage plant, for wells converted to storage use, and (l) date drilling discontinued, for wells determined to be nonproductive. The foregoing data, as appropriate, shall also be maintained for each subsequent change in the depth of each well.

    22.

    A. Utilities shall record items of other comprehensive income in account 219, accumulated other comprehensive income. Amounts included in this account shall be maintained by each category of other comprehensive income. Examples of categories of other comprehensive income include, foreign currency items, minimum pension liability adjustments, unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale type securities and cash flow hedge amounts. Supporting records shall be maintained for account 219 so that the company can readily identify the cumulative amount of other comprehensive income for each item included in this account.

    B. When an item of other comprehensive income enters into the determination of net income in the current or subsequent periods, a reclassification adjustment shall be recorded in account 219 to avoid double counting of that amount.

    C. When it is probable that an item of other comprehensive income will be included in the development of cost of service rates in subsequent periods, that amount of unrealized losses or gains shall be recorded in accounts 182.3 or 254 as appropriate.

    23.

    A. Utilities shall recognize derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in the financial statements and measure those instruments at fair value, except those falling within recognized exceptions, the most common of which being the normal purchases and sales scope exception. Normal purchases or sales are contracts that provide for the purchase or sale of goods that will be delivered in quantities expected to be used or sold by the utility over a reasonable period in the normal course of business. A derivative instrument is a financial instrument or other contract with all three of the following characteristics:

    (1) It has one or more underlyings and a notional amount or payment provision. Those terms determine the amount of the settlement or settlements, and, in some cases, whether or not a settlement is required.

    (2) It requires no initial net investment or an initial net investment that is smaller than would be required for other types of contracts that would be expected to have similar response to changes in market factors.

    (3) Its terms require or permit net settlement, can readily be settled net by a means outside the contract, or provides for delivery of an asset that puts the recipient in a position not substantially different from net settlement.

    B. The accounting for the changes in the fair value of derivative instruments depends upon its intended use and designation. Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments not designated as fair value or cash flow hedges will be recorded in account 175, derivative instrument assets, or account 244, derivative instrument liabilities, as appropriate, with the gains recorded in account 421, miscellaneous nonoperating income, and losses recorded in account 426.4, other deductions.

    C. A derivative instrument may be specifically designated as a fair value or cash flow hedge. A hedge may be used to manage risk to price, interest rates, or foreign currency transactions. Utilities shall maintain documentation of the hedge relationship at the inception of the hedge that details the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge, the nature of the risk being hedged, and how hedge effectiveness will be determined.

    D. If the utility designates the derivative instrument as a fair value hedge against exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset, liability, or a firm commitment, it will record the change in fair value of the derivative instrument to account 176, derivative instrument assets—hedges, or account 245, derivative instrument liabilities—hedges, as appropriate, with a corresponding adjustment to the subaccount of the item being hedged. The ineffective portion of the hedge transaction shall be reflected in the same income or expense account that will be used when the hedged item enters into the determination of net income. In the case of a fair value hedge of a firm commitment a new asset or liability is created. As a result of the hedge relationship, the new asset or liability will become part of the carrying amount of the item being hedged.

    E. If the utility designates the derivative instrument as a cash flow hedge against exposure to variable cash flows of a probable forecasted transaction, it shall record changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument in account 176, derivative instrument assets—hedges, or account 245, derivative instrument liabilities—hedges, as appropriate, with a corresponding amount in account 219, accumulated other comprehensive income, for the effective portion of the hedge. The ineffective portion of the hedge transaction shall be reflected in the same income or expense account that will be used when the hedged item enters into the determination of net income. Amounts recorded in other comprehensive income shall be reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods that the hedged forecasted item enters into the determination of net income.

    24.

    A. An  represents a liability for the legal obligation associated with the retirement of a tangible long-lived asset that a utility is required to settle as a result of an existing or enacted law, statute, ordinance, or written or oral contract or by legal construction of a contract under the doctrine of promissory estoppel. An  represents the amount capitalized when the liability is recognized for the long-lived asset that gives rise to the legal obligation. The amount recognized for the liability and an associated _asset retirement cost_ shall be stated at the fair value of the _asset retirement obligation_ in the period in which the obligation is incurred.

    B. The utility shall initially record a liability for an asset retirement obligation in account 230, Asset retirement obligations, and charge the associated asset retirement costs to gas utility plant and nonutility plant, as appropriate, related to the plant that gives rise to the legal obligation. The asset retirement cost shall be depreciated over the useful life of the related asset that gives rise to the obligations. For periods subsequent to the initial recording of the asset retirement obligation, a utility shall recognize the period to period changes of the asset retirement obligation that result from the passage of time due to the accretion of the liability and any subsequent measurement changes to the initial liability for the legal obligation recorded in account 230, Asset retirement obligations, as follows:

    (1) The utility shall record the accretion of the liability by debiting account 411.10, Accretion expense, for gas utility plant, account 413, Expenses of gas plant leased to others, for gas plants leased to others, and account 421, Miscellaneous nonoperating income, for nonutility plant and crediting account 230, Asset retirement obligations; and

    (2) The utility shall recognize any subsequent measurement changes of the liability initially recorded in account 230, Asset retirement obligations, for each specific asset retirement obligation as an adjustment of that liability in account 230 with the corresponding adjustment to gas utility plant, gas plant leased to others, and nonutility plant, as appropriate. The utility shall on a timely basis monitor any measurement changes of the asset retirement obligations.

    C. Gains or losses resulting from the settlement of asset retirement obligations associated with utility plant resulting from the difference between the amount of the liability for the asset retirement obligation included in account 230, Asset retirement obligations, and the actual amount paid to settle the obligation shall be accounted for as follows:

    (1) Gains shall be credited to account 411.6, Gains from disposition of utility plant, and;

    (2) Losses shall be charged to account 411.7, Losses from disposition of utility plant.

    D. Gains or losses on the settlement of the asset retirement obligations associated with nonutility plant resulting from the difference between the amount of the liability for the asset retirement obligation in account 230, Asset retirement obligations, and the amount paid to settle the obligation, shall be accounted for as follows:

    (1) Gains shall be credited to account 421, Miscellaneous nonoperating income, and;

    (2) Losses shall be charged to account 426.5, Other deductions.

    E. Separate subsidiary records shall be maintained for each asset retirement obligation showing the initial liability and associated asset retirement cost, any incremental amounts of the liability incurred in subsequent reporting periods for additional layers of the original liability and related asset retirement cost, the accretion of the liability, the subsequent measurement changes to the asset retirement obligation, the depreciation and amortization of the asset retirement costs and related accumulated depreciation, and the settlement date and actual amount paid to settle the obligation. For purposes of analyses a utility shall maintain supporting documentation so as to be able to furnish accurately and expeditiously with respect to each asset retirement obligation the full details of the identity and nature of the legal obligation, the year incurred, the identity of the plant giving rise to the obligation, the full particulars relating to each component and supporting computations related to the measurement of the asset retirement obligation.

    1.

    A. The gas plant accounts provided herein are generally the same as those contained in the prior system of accounts except for some changes in classification in the general equipment accounts. Except for these changes, the balances in the various plant accounts, as determined under the prior system of accounts, should be carried forward. Any remaining balance of plant which has not yet been classified pursuant to the requirements of the prior system, shall be classified in accordance with the following instructions.

    B. The cost to the utility of its unclassified plant shall be ascertained by analysis of the utility's records. Adjustments shall not be made to record in utility plant accounts amounts previously charged to operating expenses or to income deductions in accordance with the uniform system of accounts in effect at the time or in accordance with the discretion of management as exercised under a uniform system of accounts, or under accounting practices previously followed.

    C. The detailed gas plant accounts (301 to 399, inclusive) shall be stated on the basis of cost to the utility of plant constructed by it and the original cost, estimated if not known, of plant acquired as an operating unit or system. The difference between the original cost as above, and the cost to the utility of gas plant after giving effect to any accumulated provision for depreciation, depletion, or amortization shall be recorded in account 114, Gas Plant Acquisition Adjustments. The original cost of gas plant shall be determined by analysis of the utility's records or those of the predecessor or vendor companies with respect to gas plant previously acquired as operating units or systems and the differences between the original cost so determined, less accumulated provisions for depreciation, depletion and amortization, and the cost to the utility, with necessary adjustments for retirements from the date of acquisition, shall be entered in account 114, Gas Plant Acquisition Adjustments. Any difference between the cost of gas plant and its book cost, when not properly includable in other accounts, shall be recorded in account 116, Other Gas Plant Adjustments.

    D. Plant acquired by lease which qualifies as capital lease property under General Instruction 19.  shall be recorded in Account 101.1, Property under Capital Leases.

    2.  A. All amounts included in the accounts for gas plant acquired as an operating unit or system, except as otherwise provided in the texts of the intangible plant accounts, shall be stated at the cost incurred by the person who first devoted the property to utility service. All other gas plant shall be included in the accounts at the cost incurred by the utility, except for property acquired by lease which qualifies as capital lease property under General Instruction 19.  and is recorded in Account 101.1, Property under Capital Leases. Where the term “cost” is used in the detailed plant accounts, it shall have the meaning stated in this paragraph.

    B. When the consideration given for property is other than cash, the value of such consideration shall be determined on a cash basis. (See, however, definition 8.) In the entry recording such transaction, the actual consideration shall be described with sufficient particularity to identify it. The utility shall be prepared to furnish the Commission the particulars of its determination of the cash value of the consideration if other than cash.

    C. When property is purchased under a plan involving deferred payments, no charge shall be made to the gas plant accounts for interest, insurance, or other expenditures occasioned solely by such form of payment.

    D. The gas plant accounts shall not include the cost or other value of gas plant contributed to the company. Contributions in the form of money or its equivalent toward the construction of gas plant shall be credited to the accounts charged with the cost of such construction. Plant constructed from contributions of cash or its equivalent shall be shown as a reduction to gross plant constructed when assembling cost data in work orders for posting to plant ledger of accounts. The accumulated gross costs of plant accumulated in the work order shall be recorded as a debit in the plant ledger of accounts along with the related amount of contributions concurrently being recorded as a credit.

    3.  A. The cost of construction properly includable in the gas plant accounts shall include, where applicable, the direct and overhead costs as listed and defined hereunder:

    (1) “Contract work” includes amounts paid for work performed under contract by other companies, firms, or individuals, costs incident to the award of such contracts, and the inspection of such work.

    (2) “Labor” includes the pay and expenses of employees of the utility engaged on construction work, and related workmen's compensation insurance, payroll taxes and similar items of expense. It does not include the pay and expenses of employees which are distributed to construction through clearing accounts nor the pay and expenses included in other items hereunder.

    (3) “Materials and supplies” includes the purchase price at the point of free delivery plus customs duties, excise taxes, the cost of inspection, loading and transportation, the related stores expenses, and the cost of fabricated materials from the utility's shop. In determining the cost of materials and supplies used for construction, proper allowance shall be made for unused materials and supplies, for materials recovered from temporary structures used in performing the work involved, and for discounts allowed and realized in the purchase of materials and supplies.

    (4) “Transportation” includes the cost of transporting employees, materials and supplies, tools, purchased equipment, and other work equipment (when not under own power) to and from points of construction. It includes amounts paid to others as well as the cost of operating the utility's own transportation equipment. (See item 5 following.)

    (5) “Special machine service” includes the cost of labor (optional), materials and supplies, depreciation, and other expenses incurred in the maintenance, operation and use of special machines, such as steam shovels, pile drivers, derricks, ditchers, scrapers, material unloaders, and other labor saving machines; also expenditures for rental maintenance and operation of machines of others. It does not include the cost of small tools and other individual items of small value or short life which are included in the cost of materials and supplies. (See item 3, above.) When a particular construction job requires the use for an extended period of time of special machines, transportation or other equipment, the net book cost thereof, less the appraised or salvage value at time of release from the job, shall be included in the cost of construction.

    (6) “Shop service” includes the proportion of the expense of the utility's shop department assignable to construction work except that the cost of fabricated materials from the utility's shop shall be included in “materials and supplies.”

    (7) “Protection” includes the cost of protecting the utility's property from fire or other casualties and the cost of preventing damages to others, or to the property of others, including payments for discovery or extinguishment of fires, cost of apprehending and prosecuting incendiaries, witness fees in relation thereto, amounts paid to municipalities and others for fire protection, and other analogous items of expenditures in connection with construction work.

    (8) “Injuries and damages” includes expenditures or losses in connection with the construction work on account of injuries to persons and damages to the property of others; also the cost of investigation of and defense against actions for such injuries and damages. Insurance recovered or recoverable on account of compensation paid for injuries to persons incident to construction shall be credited to the account or accounts to which such compensation is charged. Insurance recovered or recoverable on account of property damages incident to construction shall be credited to the account or accounts charged with the cost of the damages.

    (9) “Privileges and permits” includes payments for and expenses incurred in securing temporary privileges, permits or rights in connection with construction work, such as for the use of private or public property, streets, or highways, but it does not include rents, or amounts chargeable as franchises and consents for which see account 302, Franchises and Consents.

    (10) “Rents” includes amounts paid for the use of construction quarters and office space occupied by construction forces and amounts properly includible in construction costs for such facilities jointly used.

    (11) “Engineering and supervision” includes the portion of the pay and expenses of engineers, surveyors, draftsmen, inspectors, superintendents and their assistants applicable to construction work.

    (12) “General administration capitalized” includes the portion of the pay and expenses of the general officers and administrative and general expenses applicable to construction work.

    (13) “Engineering services” includes amounts paid to other companies, firms, or individuals engaged by the utility to plan, design, prepare estimates, supervise, inspect, or give general advice and assistance in connection with construction work.

    (14) “Insurance” includes premiums paid or amounts provided or reserved as self-insurance for the protection against loss and damages in connection with construction, by fire or other casualty, injury to or death of persons other than employees, damages to property of others, defalcation of employees and agents, and the nonperformance of contractual obligations of others. It does not include workmen's compensation or similar insurance on employees included as “labor” in item 2, above.

    (15) “Law expenditures” includes the general law expenditures incurred in connection with construction and the court and legal costs directly related thereto, other than law expenses included in protection, item 7, and in injuries and damages, item 8.

    (16) “Taxes” includes taxes on physical property (including land) during the period of construction and other taxes properly includible in construction costs before the facilities become available for service.

    (17) “Allowance for funds used during construction” includes the net cost for the period of construction of borrowed funds used for construction purposes and a reasonable rate on other funds when so used, not to exceed without prior approval of the Commission allowances computed in accordance with the formula prescribed in paragraph (a) below, except when such other funds are used for exploration and development or leases acquired after October 7, 1969, no allowance on such other funds shall be included in these accounts. No allowance for funds used during construction charges shall be included in these accounts upon expenditures for construction projects which have been abandoned.

    (a) The formula and elements for the computation of the allowance for funds used during construction shall be:

    (b) The rates shall be determined annually. The balances for long-term debt, preferred stock and common equity shall be the actual book balances as of the end of the prior year. The cost rates for long-term debt and preferred stock shall be the weighted average cost determined in the manner indicated in subpart D of part 154 of the Commission's Regulations Under the Natural Gas Act. The cost rate for common equity shall be the rate granted common equity in the last rate proceeding before the ratemaking body having primary rate jurisdiction. If such cost rate is not available, the average rate actually earned during the preceding three years shall be used. The short-term debt balances and related cost and the average balance for construction work in progress shall be estimated for the current year with appropriate adjustments as actual data becomes available.

    (18) “Earnings and expenses during construction” includes (a) all revenues derived during the construction period from property which is included in the cost of a project under construction and (b) all expenses which are attributable to the revenues received.

    (19) “Training costs”. When it is necessary that employees be trained to operate or maintain plant facilities that are being constructed and such facilities are not conventional in nature or are new to the company's operations, these costs may be capitalized as a component of construction cost. Once plant is placed in service, the capitalization of training costs shall cease, and subsequent training costs shall be expensed. (See Operating Expense Instruction 4.)

    (20) “Line pack gas.” Line pack includes the first cost of that quantity of gas introduced into the utility's system necessary to bring the system up to its designed operating capacity or increases therein and which must be maintained in the system in order to sustain such design operating capacity.

    (21) LNG “heel” is the first cost of that minimum quantity of liquefied natural gas necessary to be retained in holding tanks and other facilities for purposes of temperature and/or pressure maintenance.

    (22) “Studies” includes the costs of studies such as operational, safety or environmental studies relative to plant under construction. Studies mandated by regulatory bodies relative to facilities in service, shall be charged to Account 183.2, Other Preliminary Survey and Investigation Charges.

    (23) “Asset retirement costs.” The costs recognized as a result of asset retirement obligations incurred during the construction and testing of utility plant shall constitute a component of construction costs.

    4.  A. All overhead construction costs, such as engineering, supervision, general office salaries and expenses, construction engineering and supervision by others than the accounting utility, law expenses, insurance, injuries and damages, relief and pensions, taxes and interest, shall be charged to particular jobs or units on the basis of the amounts of such overheads reasonably applicable thereto, to the end that each job or unit shall bear its equitable proportion of such costs and that the entire cost of the unit, both direct and overhead, shall be deducted from the plant accounts at the time the property is retired.

    B. As far as practicable, the determination of pay roll charges includible in construction overheads shall be based on time card distributions thereof. Where this procedure is impractical, special studies shall be made periodically of the time of supervisory employees devoted to construction activities to the end that only such overhead costs as have a definite relation to construction shall be capitalized. The addition to direct construction costs of arbitrary percentages or amounts to cover assumed overhead costs is not permitted.

    C. The record supporting the entries for overhead construction costs shall be so kept as to show the total amount of each overhead for each year, the nature and amount of each overhead expenditure charged to each construction work order and to each utility plant account, and the bases of distribution of such costs.

    5.  A. When gas plant constituting an operating unit or system is acquired by purchase, merger, consolidation, liquidation, or otherwise, after the effective date of this system of accounts, the costs of acquisition, including expenses incidental thereto properly includible in gas plant, shall be charged to account 102, Gas Plant Purchased or Sold.

    B. The accounting for the acquisition shall then be completed as follows:

    (1) The original cost of plant, estimated if not known, shall be credited to account 102, Gas Plant Purchased or Sold, and concurrently charged to the appropriate gas plant in service accounts and to account 104, Gas Plant Leased to Others, account 105, Gas Plant Held for Future Use, 105.1, Production Properties Held for Future Use, and account 107, Construction Work in Progress—Gas, as appropriate.

    (2) The depreciation, depletion, and amortization applicable to the original cost of the properties purchased, shall be charged to account 102, Gas Plant Purchased or Sold, and concurrently credited to the appropriate account for accumulated provision for depreciation, depletion or amortization.

    (3) The cost to the utility of any property includible in account 121, Nonutility Property, shall be transferred thereto.

    (4) The amount remaining in account 102, Gas Plant Purchased or Sold, shall then be closed to account 114, Gas Plant Acquisition Adjustments.

    C. If property acquired in the purchase of an operating unit or system is in such physical condition when acquired that it is necessary substantially to rehabilitate it in order to bring the property up to the standards of the utility, the cost of such work, except replacements, shall be accounted for as a part of the purchase price of the property.

    D. When any property acquired as an operating unit or system includes duplicate or other plant which will be retired by the accounting utility in the reconstruction of the acquired property or its consolidation with previously owned property, the proposed accounting for such property shall be presented to the Commission.

    E. In connection with the acquisition of gas plant constituting an operating unit or system, the utility shall procure, if possible, all existing records relating to the property acquired, or certified copies thereof, and shall preserve such records in conformity with regulations or practices governing the preservation of records of its own construction.

    F. When gas plant constituting an operating unit or system is sold, conveyed, or transferred to another by sale, merger, consolidation, or otherwise, the book cost of the property sold or transferred to another shall be credited to the appropriate utility plant accounts, including amounts carried in account 114, Gas Plant Acquisition Adjustments. The amounts (estimated if not known) carried with respect thereto in the accounts for accumulated provision for depreciation, depletion, and amortization and in account 252, Customer Advances for Construction, shall be charged to such accounts and the contra entries made to account 102, Gas Plant Purchased or Sold. Unless otherwise ordered by the Commission, the difference, if any, between (a) the net amount of debits and credits and (b) the consideration received for the property (less commissions and other expenses of making the sale) shall be included in account 421.1, Gain on Disposition of Property, or account 421.2, Loss on Disposition of Property. (See account 102, Gas Plant Purchased or Sold.)

    6.  A. The cost of substantial initial improvements (including repairs, rearrangements, additions, and betterments) made in the course of preparing for utility service property leased for a period of more than one year, and the cost of subsequent substantial additions, replacements, or betterments to such property, shall be charged to the gas plant account appropriate for the class of property leased. If the service life of the improvements is terminable by action of the lease, the cost, less net salvage, of the improvements shall be spread over the life of the lease by charges to account 404.3, Amortization of Other Limited-Term Gas Plant. However, if the service life is not terminated by action of the lease but by depreciation proper, the cost of the improvements, less net salvage, shall be accounted for as depreciable plant. The provisions of this paragraph are applicable to property leased under either capital leases or operating leases.

    B. If improvements made to property leased for a period of more than one year are of relatively minor cost, or if the lease is for a period of not more than one year, the cost of the improvements shall be charged to the account in which the rent is included, either directly or by amortization thereof.

    7.  A. The accounts for land and land rights shall include the cost of land owned in fee by the utility and rights, interests, and privileges held by the utility in land owned by others, such as leaseholds, easements, rights-of-way, natural gas rights, and other like interests in land. Do not include in the accounts for land and land rights and rights-of-way costs incurred in connection with first clearing and grading of land and rights-of-way and the damage costs associated with the construction and installation of plant. Such costs shall be included in the appropriate plant accounts directly benefited.

    B. Where special assessments for public improvements provide for deferred payments, the full amount of the assessments shall be charged to the appropriate land account and the unpaid balance shall be carried in an appropriate liability account. Interest on unpaid balances shall be charged to the appropriate interest account. If any part of the cost of public improvement is included in the general tax levy, the amount thereof shall be charged to the appropriate tax account.

    C. The net profit from the sale of timber, cord wood, sand, gravel, other resources or other property acquired with the rights-of-way or other lands shall be credited to the appropriate plant account to which related. Where land is held for a considerable period of time and timber and other natural resources on the land at the time of purchase increases in value, the net profit (after giving effect to the cost of the natural resources) from the sales of timber or its products or other natural resources shall be credited to the appropriate utility operating income account when such land has been recorded in account 105, Gas Plant Held for Future Use, account 105.1, Production Properties Held for Future Use, or classified as plant in service otherwise to account 421, Miscellaneous Nonoperating Income.

    D. Separate entries shall be made for the acquisition, transfer, or retirement of each parcel of land, and each land right, or gas right (except rights-of-way for distribution mains), having a life of more than one year. A record shall be maintained showing the nature of ownership, full legal description, area, map reference, purpose for which used, city, county, and tax district in which situated, from whom purchased or to whom sold, payment given or received, other costs, contract date and number, date of recording of deed, and book and page of record. Entries transferring or retiring land or land rights shall refer to the original entry recording its acquisition. A parcel of land acquired and carried on the books as a unit is not required to be subdivided with transfers to other land accounts merely because of the erection thereon of an incidental structure to be used in gas operations but for a purpose differing from that for which the land is chiefly employed; for example, a small storehouse on production plant land.

    E. Any difference between the amount received from the sale of land or land rights, less agents' commissions and other costs incident to the sale, and the book cost of such land or rights shall be included in account 411.6, Gains from Disposition of Utility Plant or 411.7, Losses from Disposition of Utility Plant when such property has been recorded in account 105, Gas Plant Held for Future Use, 105.1, Production Properties Held for Future Use, otherwise to account 421.1, Gain on Disposition of Property or 421.2, Loss on Disposition of Property, as appropriate, unless a reserve therefor has been authorized and provided. Appropriate adjustments of the accounts shall be made with respect to any structures or improvements located on land sold.

    F. The cost of buildings and other improvements (other than public improvements) shall not be included in the land accounts. If at the time of acquisition of an interest in land such interest extends to buildings or other improvements (other than public improvements), which are then devoted to utility operations, the land and improvements shall be separately appraised and the cost allocated to land and buildings or improvements on the basis of the appraisals. If the improvements are removed or wrecked without being used in operations, the cost of removing or wrecking shall be charged and the salvage credited to the account in which the cost of the land is recorded.

    G. When the purchase of land for gas operations requires the purchase of more land than needed for such purposes, the charge to the specific land account shall be based upon the cost of the land purchased, less the fair market value of that portion of the land which is not to be used in utility operations. The portion of the cost measured by the fair market value of the land not to be used shall be included in account 105, Gas Plant Held for Future Use or, account 121, Nonutility Property, as appropriate. Regarding land and land rights held for the production of natural gas, account 101, Gas Plant in Service, shall include (1) the cost of lands owned in fee upon which producing natural gas wells are located on lands owned in fee which are being drained through the operation by the utility of wells on the other land, and (2) the first cost of lands held under lease upon which the utility pays royalties for the natural gas obtained therefrom. The cost of all other land and land rights held for the production of natural gas under a plant for such use shall be included in account 105, Gas Plant Held for Future Use, or 105.1, Production Properties Held for Future Use, as appropriate.

    H. Provision shall be made for amortizing amounts carried in the accounts for limited-term interests in land, so as to apportion equitably the cost of each interest over the life thereof. For the purposes of amortization of natural gas rights, separate interests in land which comprise an interest in a production area may be grouped to form a depletion unit. (See account 111, Accumulated Provision for Amortization and Depletion of Gas Utility Plant, account 404.1, Amortization and Depletion of Producing Natural Gas Land and Land Rights, account 404.3, Amortization of Other Limited-Term Gas Plant, and account 797, Abandonment, leases.)

    I. The items of cost to be included in the accounts for land and land rights are as follows:

    8.  A. The accounts for structures and improvements shall include the cost of all buildings and facilities to house, support, or safeguard property or persons, including all fixtures permanently attached to and made a part of buildings and which cannot be removed therefrom without cutting into the walls, ceilings, or floors, or without in some way impairing the buildings, and improvements of a permanent character on or to land. Also include those costs incurred in connection with the first clearing and grading of land and rights-of-way, and the damage costs associated with construction and installation of plant.

    B. The cost of specially provided foundations not intended to outlast the machinery or apparatus for which provided, and the cost of angle irons, castings, etc., installed at the base of an item of equipment, shall be charged to the same account as the cost of the machinery, apparatus, or equipment.

    C. Minor buildings and structures may be considered a part of the facility in connection with which constructed or operated and the cost thereof accounted for accordingly when the nature of the structure and facility indicates the correctness of such accounting.

    D. Where furnaces and boilers are used primarily for furnishing steam for some particular department and only incidentally for furnishing steam for heating a building and operating the equipment therein, the entire cost of such furnaces and boilers shall be charged to the appropriate plant account, and no part to the building account.

    E. The cost of disposing of materials excavated in connection with construction of structures shall be considered as a part of the cost of such work, except as follows: (a) When such material is used for filling, the cost of loading, hauling, and dumping shall be equitably apportioned between the work in connection with which the removal occurs and the work in connection with which the material is used; (b) when such material is sold, the net amount realized from such sales shall be credited to the work in connection with which the removal occurs. If the amount realized from the sale of excavated materials exceeds the removal costs and the costs in connection with the sale, the excess shall be credited to the land account in which the site is carried.

    F. Lighting or other fixtures temporarily attached to buildings for purposes of display or demonstration shall not be included in the cost of the building but in the appropriate equipment account.

    G. The items of cost to be included in the accounts for structures and improvements are as follows:

    9.  A. The cost of equipment chargeable to the gas plant accounts, unless otherwise indicated in the text of an equipment account, includes the net purchase price thereof, sales taxes, investigation and inspection expenses necessary to such purchase, expenses of transportation when borne by the utility, labor employed, materials and supplies consumed, and expenses incurred by the utility in unloading and placing the equipment in readiness to operate. Also include those costs incurred in connection with the first clearing and grading of land and rights-of-way and the damage costs associated with construction and installation of plant.

    B. Exclude from equipment accounts hand and other portable tools which are likely to be lost or stolen or which have relatively small value (for example, $500 or less) or short life, unless the correctness of the accounting therefor as gas plant is verified by current inventories. Special tools acquired and included in the purchase price of equipment shall be included in the appropriate plant account. Portable drills and similar tool equipment when used in connection with the operation and maintenance of a particular plant or department, such as production, transmission, distribution, etc., or in “stores,” shall be charged to the plant account appropriate for their use.

    C. The equipment accounts shall include angle irons and similar items which are installed at the base of an item of equipment, but piers and foundations which are designed to be as permanent as the buildings which house the equipment, or which are constructed as a part of the building and which cannot be removed without cutting into the walls, ceilings or floors or without in some way impairing the building, shall be included in the building accounts.

    D. The equipment accounts shall include the necessary costs of testing or running a plant or part thereof during an experimental or test period prior to becoming available for service. The utility shall furnish the Commission with full particulars of and justification for any test or experimental run extending beyond a period of thirty days.

    E. The cost of efficiency or other tests made subsequent to the date equipment becomes available for service shall be charged to the appropriate expense accounts, except that tests to determine whether equipment meets the specifications and requirements as to efficiency, performance, etc., guaranteed by manufacturers, made after operations have commenced and within the period specified in the agreement or contract of purchase, may be charged to the appropriate gas plant account.

    10.

    A. For the purpose of avoiding undue refinement in accounting for additions to and retirements and replacements of gas plant, all property shall be considered as consisting of (1) retirement units and (2) minor items of property. Each utility shall maintain a written property units listing for use in accounting for additions and retirements of gas plant and apply the listing consistently.

    B. The addition and retirement of retirement units shall be accounted for as follows:

    (1) When a retirement unit is added to gas plant, the cost thereof shall be added to the appropriate gas plant account, except that when units are acquired in the acquisition of any gas plant constituting an operating system, they shall be accounted for as provided in gas plant instruction 5.

    (2) When a retirement unit is retired from gas plant, with or without replacement, the book cost thereof shall be credited to the gas plant account in which it is included, determined in the manner set forth in paragraph D, below. If the retirement unit is of a depreciable class, the book cost of the unit retired and credited to gas plant shall be charged to the accumulated provision for depreciation applicable to such property. The cost of removal and the salvage shall be charged or credited, as appropriate, to such depreciation account.

    C. The addition and retirement of minor items of property shall be accounted for as follows:

    (1) When a minor item of property which did not previously exist is added to plant, the cost thereof shall be accounted for in the same manner as for the addition of a retirement unit, as set forth in paragraph B(1), above, if a substantial addition results, otherwise the charge shall be to the appropriate maintenance expense account.

    (2) When a minor item of property is retired and not replaced, the book cost thereof shall be credited to the gas plant account in which it is included; and, in the event the minor item is a part of depreciable plant, the account for accumulated provision for depreciation shall be charged with the book cost and cost of removal and credited with the salvage. If, however, the book cost of the minor item retired and not replaced has been or will be accounted for by its inclusion in the retirement unit of which it is a part when such unit is retired, no separate credit to the property account is required when such minor item is retired.

    (3) When a minor item of depreciable property is replaced independently of the retirement unit of which it is a part, the cost of replacement shall be charged to the maintenance account appropriate for the item, except that if the replacement effects a substantial betterment (the primary aim of which is to make the property affected more useful, more efficient, or of greater durability, or of greater capacity), the excess cost of the replacement over the estimated cost at current prices of replacing without betterment shall be charged to the appropriate gas plant account.

    D. The book cost of gas plant retired shall be the amount at which such property is included in the gas plant accounts, including all components of construction costs. The book cost shall be determined from the utility's records and if this cannot be done it shall be estimated. Utilities must furnish the particulars of such estimates to the Commission, if requested. When it is impracticable to determine the book cost of each unit, due to the relatively large number or small cost thereof, an appropriate average book cost of the units, with due allowance for any differences in size and character, shall be used as the book cost of the units retired.

    E. The book cost of land retired shall be credited to the appropriate land account. If the land is sold, the difference between the book cost (less any accumulated provision for depreciation, depletion or amortization therefor which has been authorized and provided) and the sale price of the land (less commissions and other expenses of making the sale) shall be recorded in account 411.6, Gains from Disposition of Utility Plant or 411.7, Losses from Disposition of Utility Plant when the property has been recorded in account 105, Gas Plant Held for Future Use account 105.1, Production Properties Held for Future Use, otherwise to accounts 421.1, Gain on Disposition of Property or 421.2, Loss on Disposition of Property, as appropriate. If the land is not used in utility service but is retained by the utility, the book cost shall be charged to account 105, Gas Plant Held for Future Use, or account 121, Nonutility Property as appropriate.

    F. The book cost less net salvage of depreciable gas plant retired shall be charged in its entirety to account 108. Accumulated Provision for Depreciation of Gas Plant in Service. Any amounts which, by approval or order of the Commission, are charged to account 182, Extraordinary Property Losses, shall be credited to account 108.

    G. The accounting for the retirement of amounts included in account 302, Franchises and Consents, and account 303, Miscellaneous Intangible Plant, and the item of limited-term interest in land included in the accounts for land and land rights, shall be as provided for in the text of account 111, Accumulated Provision for Amortization and Depletion of Gas Utility Plant, account 404.3, Amortization of Other Limited-Term Gas Plant, and account 405, Amortization of Other Gas Plant.

    11.  A. Each utility shall record all construction and retirements of gas plant by means of work orders or job orders. Separate work orders may be opened for additions to and retirements of gas plant or the retirements may be included with the construction work order, provided, however, that all items relating to the retirements shall be kept separate from those relating to construction and provided, further, that any maintenance costs involved in the work shall likewise be segregated.

    B. Each utility shall keep its work order system so as to show the nature of each addition to or retirement of gas plant, the total cost thereof, the source or sources of costs, and the gas plant account or accounts to which charged or credited. Work orders covering jobs of short duration may be cleared monthly.

    C. Each utility shall maintain records in which, for each plant account, the amounts of the annual additions and retirements are classified so as to show the number and cost of the various record units or retirement units.

    12.  When property is transferred from one gas plant account to another, from one utility department to another (such as from gas to electric), from one operating division or area to another, to or from account 101, Gas Plant in Service, 104, Gas Plant Leased to Others, 105, Gas Plant Held for Future Use, 105.1, Production Properties held for Future Use, and 121, Nonutility Property, the transfer shall be recorded by transferring the original cost thereof from the one account, department, or location to the other. Any related amounts carried in the accounts for accumulated provisions for depreciation, depletion, or amortization shall be transferred in accordance with the segregation of such accounts.

    13.  A. If the utility is engaged in more than one utility service such as gas, electric, and water, and any of its utility plant is used in common for several utility services or for other purposes to such an extent and in such manner that it is impracticable to segregate it by utility services currently in the accounts, such property, with the approval of the Commission, may be designated and classified as “common utility plant.”

    B. The book amount of utility plant designated as common plant shall be included in account 118, Other Utility Plant, and if applicable in part to gas department, shall be segregated and accounted for in subaccounts as gas plant is accounted for in accounts 101 to 107, inclusive, and gas plant adjustments in account 116; any amounts classifiable as common plant acquisition adjustments or common plant adjustments shall be subject to disposition as provided in paragraph C and B of accounts 114 and 116, respectively, for amounts classified in those accounts. The original cost of common utility plant in service shall be classified according to detailed utility plant accounts appropriate for the property.

    C. The utility shall be prepared to show at any time and to report to the Commission annually, or more frequently, if required, and by utility plant accounts (301 to 399) the following: (1) The book cost of common utility plant, (2) the allocation of such cost to the respective departments using the common utility plant, and (3) the basis of the allocation.

    D. The accumulated provision for depreciation and amortization of the utility shall be segregated so as to show the amount applicable to the property classified as common utility plant.

    E. The expenses of operation maintenance, rents, depreciation and amortization of common utility plant shall be recorded in the accounts prescribed herein, but designated as common expenses, and the allocation of such expenses to the departments using the common utility plant shall be supported in such manner as to reflect readily the basis of allocation used.

    14.  Where employee villages or living quarters are provided for operators and attendants of a functional installation such as a compressor station or gasoline plant, the structures and improvements shall be classified in the related functional structures and improvements account. The furnishings of such residential and recreational facilities shall be classified in the equipment account of the related function.

    15.  A. Fees for applications involving construction of property shall be accounted for as follows:

    (1) All fees paid prior to the final disposition of the certificate application shall be charged to account 186, Miscellaneous Deferred Debits.

    (2) If the certificate is granted and accepted, the amounts recorded in account 186 shall be cleared to account 107, Construction Work in Progress—Gas, and subsequently cleared to the appropriate plant accounts.

    (3) If the certificate requested is not granted or is not accepted by the applicant, the fees recorded in account 186 shall be cleared to account 928, Regulatory Commission Expenses.

    (4) All amounts paid after the Commission has granted the certificate shall be recorded in account 107, Construction Work in Progress—Gas, and subsequently cleared to the appropriate plant accounts.

    B. All amounts paid related to certificate applications involving the acquisitions of facilities including those acquired by merger or pooling of interests shall be charged to account 928, Regulatory Commission Expenses.

    C. All other fees for applications not involving construction or acquisition of facilities shall be charged to account 928, Regulatory Commission Expenses.

    1.  The supervision and engineering includible in the operating expense accounts shall consist of the pay and expenses of superintendents, engineers, clerks, other employees and consultants engaged in supervising and directing the operation and maintenance of each utility function. Wherever allocations are necessary in order to arrive at the amount to be included in any account the method and basis of allocation shall be reflected by underlying records.

    2.  A. The cost of maintenance chargeable to the various operating expense and clearing accounts, includes labor, materials, overheads and other expenses incurred in maintenance work. A list of work operations applicable generally to utility plant is included hereunder. Other work operations applicable to specific classes of plant are listed in functional maintenance expense accounts.

    B. Materials recovered in connection with the maintenance of property shall be credited to the same account to which the maintenance cost was charged.

    C. If the book cost of any property is carried in account 102, Gas Plant Purchased or Sold, the cost of maintaining such property shall be charged to the accounts for maintenance of property of the same class and use, the book cost of which is carried in other gas plant in service accounts. Maintenance of property leased from others shall be treated as provided in operating expense instruction 3.

    3.  A. The rent expense accounts provided under the several functional groups of expense accounts shall include all rents, including taxes paid by the lessee on leased property, for property used in utility operations, except (1) minor amounts paid for occasional or infrequent use of any property or equipment and all amounts paid for use of equipment that, if owned, would be includible in plant accounts 391 to 398, inclusive, which shall be treated as an expense item and included in the appropriate functional account and (2) rents which are chargeable to clearing accounts, and distributed therefrom to the appropriate account. If rents cover property used for more than one function, such as production and transmission, or by more than one department, the rents shall be apportioned to the appropriate rent expense or clearing accounts of each department on an actual, or, if necessary, an estimated basis.

    B. When a portion of property or equipment rented from others for use in connection with utility operations is subleased, the revenue derived from such subleasing shall be credited to the rent revenue account in operating revenues:  That in case the rent was charged to a clearing account, amounts received from subleasing the property shall be credited to such clearing account.

    C. The cost, when incurred by the lessee, of operating and maintaining leased property, shall be charged to the accounts appropriate for the expense if the property were owned.

    D. The cost incurred by the lessee of additions and replacements to gas plant leased from other shall be accounted for as provided in gas plant instruction 6.

    4.  When it is necessary that employees be trained to specifically operate or maintain plant facilities that are being constructed, the related costs shall be accounted for as a current operating and maintenance expense. These expenses shall be charged to the appropriate functional accounts currently as they are incurred. However, when the training costs involved relate to facilities which are not conventional in nature, or are new to the company's operations, then see Gas Plant Instruction 3(19) for accounting.

    A. This account shall include the original cost of gas plant, included in accounts 301 to 399 prescribed herein, owned and used by the utility in its gas operations, and having an expectation of life in service of more than one year from date of installation. Including such property owned by the utility but held by nominees. (See also account 106 for unclassified construction costs of completed plant actually in service.)

    B. The cost of additions to and betterments of property leased from others, which are includible in this account, shall be recorded in subdivisions separate and distinct from those relating to owned property. (See gas plant instruction 6.)

    A. This account shall include the amount recorded under capital leases for plant leased from others and used by the utility in its utility operations.

    B. The gas property included in this account shall be classified separately according to the detailed accounts (301 to 399) prescribed for gas plant in service.

    C. Records shall be maintained with respect to each capital lease reflecting: (1) Name of lessor, (2) basic details of lease, (3) terminal date, (4) original cost fair market value of property leased, (5) future minimum lease payments, (6) executory costs, (7) present value of minimum lease payments, (8) the amounts representing interest and the interest rate used, and (9) expenses paid. Records shall also be maintained for plant under a lease, to identify the asset retirement obligation and cost originally recognized for each lease and the periodic charges and credits made to the asset retirement obligations and asset retirement costs.

    A. This account shall be charged with the cost of gas plant acquired as an operating unit or system by purchase, merger, consolidation, liquidation, or otherwise, and shall be credited with the selling price of like property transferred to others pending the distribution to appropriate accounts in accordance with gas plant instruction 5.

    B. Within six months from the date of acquisition or sale of property recorded herein, the utility shall file with the Commission the proposed journal entries to clear from this account the amounts recorded herein.

    A. This account shall include the cost of gas plant which was constructed as a research, development, and demonstration project under the provisions of paragraph C, Account 107, Construction Work in Progress—Gas, and due to the nature of the plant it is desirous to operate it for a period of time in an experimental status.

    B. Amounts in this account shall be transferred to Account 101, Gas Plant in Service, or Account 121, Nonutility Property, as appropriate, when the project is no longer considered as experimental. Prior to transfer to account 101 the subject plant must be certified by the Commission for use as gas plant in service.

    C. The depreciation on plant in this account shall be charged to account 403, Depreciation expense, and account 403.1, Depreciation expense for asset retirement costs, as appropriate, and credited to account 108, Accumulated provision for depreciation of gas utility plant. The amounts herein shall be depreciated over a period which corresponds to the estimated useful life of the relevant project considering the characteristics involved. However, when projects are transferred to account 101, Gas plant in service, a new depreciation rate based on the remaining service life and undepreciated amounts, will be established.

    D. Records shall be maintained with respect to each unit of experiment so that full details may be obtained as to the cost, depreciation, and the experimental status.

    E. Should it be determined that experimental plants recorded in this account will fail to satisfactorily perform its function, the costs thereof shall be accounted for as directed or authorized by the Commission.

    A. This account shall include the original cost of gas plant owned by the utility but leased to others as operating units or systems, where the lessee has exclusive possession.

    B. The property included in this account shall be classified according to the detailed accounts (301 to 399) prescribed for gas plant in service and this account shall be maintained in such detail as though the property were used by the owner in its utility operations.

    A. This account shall include the original cost of gas plant (except land and land rights) owned and held for future use in gas service under a definite plan for such use, to include: (1) Property acquired (except land and land rights) but never used by the utility in gas service, but held for such service in the future under a definite plan, and (2) property (except land and land rights) previously used by the utility in gas service, but retired from such service and held pending its reuse in the future, under a definite plan, in gas service. This includes production properties relating to leases acquired on or before October 7, 1969.

    B. This account shall also include the original cost of land and land rights owned and held for future use in gas service relating to leases acquired on or before October 7, 1969, under a plan for such use, to include land and land rights: (1) Acquired but never used by the utility in gas service, but held for such service in the future under a plan, and (2) previously held by the utility in gas service, but retired from such service and held pending its reuse in the future under a plan, in gas service. (See Gas Plant Instruction 7.)

    C. In the event that property recorded in this account shall no longer be needed or appropriate for future utility operations, the company shall request Commission approval of journal entries to remove such property from this account when the gain realized from the sale or other disposition of the property is $100,000 or more, prior to their being recorded. Such filings shall include the description and original cost of individual properties removed from this account, the accounts charged upon removal, and any associated gains realized upon disposition of such property.

    D. Gains or losses from the sale of land and land rights or other disposition of such property previously recorded in this account and not placed in utility service shall be recorded directly in accounts 411.6 or 411.7, as appropriate, except when determined to be significant by the Commission. Upon such a determination, the amounts shall be transferred to account 256, Deferred Gains from Disposition of Utility Plant, or account 187, Deferred Losses from Disposition of Utility Plant, and amortized to accounts 411.6, Gains from Disposition of Utility Plant, or 411.7, Losses from Disposition of Utility Plant, as appropriate.

    E. The property included in this account shall be classified according to the detail accounts (301 to 399) prescribed for gas plant in service and the account shall be maintained in such detail as though the property were in service.

    A. This account shall include the cost of production properties (except land and land rights) relating to leases acquired on or after October 8, 1969, held under a definite plan for future use to insure a future supply of natural gas for use in pipeline operations, to include: (1) Production property (except land and land rights) acquired but never used by the utility in gas service, but held for such service in the future under a definite plan, and (2) production property (except land and land rights) previously used by the utility in gas service, but retired from such service and held pending its reuse in the future, under a definite plan, in gas service.

    B. This account shall also include the original cost of land and land rights held under a plan for future use to insure a future supply of natural gas for use in pipeline operations, relating to leases acquired on or after October 8, 1969, to include land and land rights: (1) Acquired but never used by the utility in gas service, but held for service in the future under a plan, and (2) previously used by the utility in gas service, but retired from such service and held pending its reuse in the future under a plan, in gas service. (See Gas Plant Instruction 7.)

    C. In the event that property recorded in this account shall no longer be needed or appropriate for future utility operations, the company shall request Commission approval of journal entries to remove such property from this account when the gain realized from the sale or other disposition of the property is $100,000 or more, prior to their being recorded. Such filings shall include the description and original cost of individual properties removed from this account, the accounts charged upon removal, and any associated gains realized upon disposition of such property.

    D. Gains or losses from the sale of land and land rights or other disposition of such property previously recorded in this account and not placed in utility service shall be recorded directly in accounts 411.6 or 411.7, as appropriate, except when determined to be significant by the Commission. Upon such determination, the amounts shall be transferred to account 256, Deferred Gains from Sale of Utility Plant, or account 187, Deferred Losses from Sale of Utility Plant, and amortized to accounts 411.6, Gains from Disposition of Utility Plant or 411.7, Losses from Disposition of Utility Plant, as appropriate.

    E. The property included in this account shall be classified according to the detailed accounts prescribed for natural gas production and gathering plant in service and such classification shall be maintained in the same detail as though the property were in service.

    At the end of the year or such other date as a balance sheet may be required by the Commission, this account shall include the total of the balances of work orders for gas plant which have been completed and placed in service but which work orders have not been classified for transfer to the detailed gas plant accounts.

    A. This account shall include the total of the balances of work orders for gas plant in process of construction.

    B. Work orders shall be cleared from this account as soon as practicable after completion of the job. Further, if a project, such as a gas production plant, a compressor station, or a transmission line, is designed to consist of two or more units which may be placed in service at different dates, any expenditures which are common to and which will be used in the operation of the project as a whole shall be included in gas plant in service upon the completion and the readiness for service of the first unit. Any expenditures which are identified exclusively with units of property not yet in service shall be included in this account.

    C. Expenditures on research, development, and demonstration projects for construction of utility facilities are to be included in a separate subdivision in this account. Records must be maintained to show separately each project along with complete detail of the nature and purpose of the research, development, and demonstration project together with the related costs.

    A. This account shall be credited with the following:

    (1) Amounts charged to account 403, Depreciation Expense, or to clearing accounts for current depreciation expense for gas plant in service.

    (2) Amounts charged to account 403.1, Depreciation expense for asset retirement costs, for current depreciation expense related to asset retirement costs in gas plant in service in a separate subaccount.

    (3) Amounts charged to account 421, Miscellaneous Nonoperating Income, for depreciation expense on property included in account 105, Gas Plant Held for Future Use, or 105.1, Production Properties Held for Future Use. Include also, the balance of accumulated provision for depreciation on property when transferred to account 105 or 105.1, from other property accounts. Normally, account 108 will not be used for current depreciation provisions because, as provided herein, the service life during which depreciation is computed commences with the date property is includible in gas plant in service; however, if special circumstances indicate the propriety of current accruals for depreciation, such charges shall be made to account 421, Miscellaneous Nonoperating Income.

    (4) Amounts charged to account 413, Expenses of Gas Plant Leased to Others, for gas plant included in account 104, Gas Plant Leased to Others.

    (5) Amounts charged to account 416, Costs and Expenses of Merchandising, Jobbing and Contract Work, or to clearing accounts for current depreciation expense.

    (6) Amounts of depreciation applicable to gas properties acquired as operating units or systems. (See gas plant instruction 5.)

    (7) Amounts charged to account 182.1, Extraordinary Property Losses, when authorized by the Commission.

    (8) Amounts of depreciation applicable to gas plant donated to the utility.

    B. At the time of retirement of depreciable gas utility plant, this account shall be charged with the book cost of the property retired and the cost of removal and shall be credited with the salvage value and any other amounts recovered, such as insurance. When retirements, cost of removal and salvage are entered originally in retirement work orders, the net total of such work orders may be included in a separate subaccount hereunder. Upon completion of the work order, the proper distribution to subdivision of this account shall be made as provided in the following paragraph.

    C. For general ledger and balance sheet purposes, this account shall be regarded and treated as a single composite provision for depreciation. For purposes of analysis, however, each utility shall maintain subsidiary records in which this account is segregating according to the following functional classification for gas plant:

    (1) Production—manufactured gas, (2) production and gathering—natural gas, (3) products extraction—natural gas, (4) underground gas storage, (5) other storage, (6) base load LNG terminaling and processing plant, (7) transmission, (8) distribution, and (9) general. These subsidiary records shall reflect the current credits and debits to this account in sufficient detail to show separately for each such functional classification (a) the amount of provision for depreciation, (b) the book cost of property retired, (c) cost of removal, (d) salvage, and (e) other items, including recoveries from insurance. Separate subsidiary records shall be maintained for the amount of accrued cost of removal other than legal obligations for the retirement of plant recorded in account 108, Accumulated provision for depreciation of gas utility plant.

    D. When transfers of plant are made from one gas plant account to another, or from or to another utility department, or from or to nonutility property accounts, the accounting for the related accumulated provision for depreciation shall be as provided in gas plant instruction 12.

    E. The utility is restricted in its use of the provision for depreciation to the purposes set forth above. It shall not transfer any portion of this account to retained earnings or make any other use thereof without authorization by the Commission.

    A. This account shall be credited with the following:

    (1) Amounts charged to account 404.1, Amortization and Depletion of Producing Natural Gas Land and Land Rights, for current amortization and depletion of such land and land rights.

    (2) Amounts charged to account 404.2, Amortization of Underground Storage Land and Land Rights, for current amortization.

    (3) Amounts charged to account 404.3, Amortization of Other Limited-Term Gas Plant, for the current amortization of limited-term gas plant.

    (4) Amounts charged to account 421, Miscellaneous Nonoperating Income, for amortization expense on property included in account 105, Gas Plant Held for Future Use, or 105.1, Production Properties Held for Future Use. Include also, the balance of accumulated provision for amortization on property when transferred to account 105 or 105.1 from other property accounts.

    (5) Amounts charged to account 405, Amortization of Other Gas Plant.

    (6) Amounts charged to account 413, Expenses of Gas Plant Leased to Others, for current amortization thereof.

    (7) Amounts charged to account 797, Abandoned Leases, to provide for the abandonment of nonproductive natural gas leases.

    (8) Amounts charged to account 425, Miscellaneous Amortization, for the amortization of intangible or other gas plant which does not have a definite or terminable life and is not subject to charges for depreciation expense, with Commission approval.

    B. When any property to which this account applies is sold, relinquished, or otherwise retired from service, this account shall be charged with the amount previously credited in respect to such property. The book cost of the property so retired less the amount chargeable to this account and less the net proceeds realized at retirement shall be included in account 421.1, Gain on Disposition of Property, or account 421.2, Loss on Disposition of Property, as appropriate.

    C. For general ledger and balance sheet purposes, this account shall be regarded and treated as a single composite provision for amortization.

    (1) Production—manufactured gas, (2) production and gathering—natural gas, (3) products extraction—natural gas, (4) underground gas storage, (5) other storage, (6) base load LNG terminaling and processing plant, (7) transmission, (8) distribution, and (9) general. These subsidiary records shall reflect the current credits and debits to this account in sufficient detail to show separately for each such functional classification (a) the amount of provision for amortization, (b) the book cost of property retired, (c) cost of removal, (d) salvage, and (e) other items, including recoveries from insurance. Records shall be maintained so as to show separately the balance applicable to each item of land and land rights which is being amortized or depleted except that natural gas land and land rights which comprise an interest in a production area may be grouped to form a unit for amortization and depletion and the accumulated provision applicable thereto need not be segregated to show the amount related to each gas right included therein. Records shall also be maintained so as to show separately the balance applicable to each underground gas storage project.

    D. The utility is restricted in its use of the accumulated provision for amortization to the purposes set forth above. It shall not transfer any portion of this account to retained earnings or make any other use thereof without authorization by the Commission.

    A. This account shall include the difference between (a) the cost to the accounting utility of gas plant acquired as an operating unit or system by purchase, merger, consolidation, liquidation, or otherwise, and (b) the original cost, estimated, if not known, of such property, less the amount or amounts credited by the accounting utility at the time of acquisition to accumulated provisions for depreciation, depletion, and amortization and contributions in aid of construction with respect to such property.

    B. With respect to acquisitions after the effective date of this system of accounts, this account shall be subdivided so as to show the amounts included herein for each property acquisition and to gas plant in service, gas plant held for future use and gas plant leased to others. (See gas plant instruction 5.)

    C. Debit amounts recorded in this account related to plant and land acquisition may be amortized to account 425, Miscellaneous Amortization, over a period not longer than the estimated remaining life of the properties to which such amounts relate. Amounts related to the acquisition of land only may be amortized to account 425 over a period of not more than 15 years. Should a utility wish to account for debit amounts in this account in any other manner, it shall petition the Commission for authority to do so. Credit amounts recorded in this account shall be accounted for as directed by the Commission.

    This account shall be credited or debited with amounts which are includible in account 406, Amortization of Gas Plant Acquisition Adjustments or account 425, Miscellaneous Amortization, for the purpose of providing for the extinguishment of amounts in account 114, Gas Plant Acquisition Adjustments, in instances where the amortization of account 114 is not being made by direct write-off of the account.

    A. This account shall include the difference between the original cost, estimated if not known, and the book cost of gas plant to the extent that such difference is not properly includible in account 114 Gas Plant Acquisition Adjustments. (See gas plant instruction 1C.)

    B. Amounts included in this account shall be classified in such manner as to show the origin of each amount and shall be disposed of as the Commission may approve or direct.

    The investment in and use of system gas included in Account 117.1, Gas Stored—Base Gas, and Account 117.2, System Balancing Gas, may be accounted for using either the “fixed asset” method or an “inventory” method as set forth below. The cost of stored gas included in Account 117.3 must be accounted for using an inventory method.

    (a) —Gas stored during the year must be priced at cost according to generally accepted methods of cost determination consistently applied from year to year. Transmission expenses for facilities of the utility used in moving the gas to the storage area and expenses of storage facilities cannot be included in the inventory of gas except as may be authorized or directed by the Commission.

    Withdrawals of gas must be priced using the first-in-first-out, last-in-first-out, or weighted average cost method, provided the method adopted by the utility is used consistently from year to year and appropriate inventory records are maintained. Approval of the Commission must be obtained for any other pricing method, or change in the pricing method adopted by the utility.

    Adjustments for inventory losses related to gas held in underground reservoirs due to cumulative inaccuracies of gas measurements, or from other causes, must be charged to Account 823, Gas Losses. Losses of system gas not associated with underground reservoirs must be charged to Account 813, Other Gas Supply Expenses.

    (b) —When replacement of the gas is made, the amount carried in Account 117.4 for such volumes must be cleared with a contra entry to Account 808.2, Gas Delivered to Storage—Credit. Any difference between the utility's cost of replacement gas volumes and the amount cleared from Account 117.4 must be recognized as a gain in Account 495, Other gas revenues, or as a loss in Account 813, Other gas supply expenses, with contra entries to Account 808.2.

    Adjustments for inventory losses related to gas held in underground reservoirs due to cumulative inaccuracies of gas measurements, or from other causes, must be charged to Account 823, Gas Losses. Losses of system gas not associated with underground reservoirs must be charged to Account 813, Other Gas Supply Expenses. Gas losses must be priced at the market price of gas available to the utility in the month the loss is recognized.

    Gas owned by the utility and injected into its system will be deemed to satisfy any encroachment on system gas first before any other use.

    This account is to include the cost of recoverable gas volumes that are necessary, in addition to those volumes for which cost are properly includable in Account 101, Gas plant in service, to maintain pressure and deliverability requirements for each storage facility. Nonrecoverable gas volumes used for this purpose are to be recorded in Account 352.3, Nonrecoverable natural gas. For utilities using the fixed asset method of accounting, the cost of base gas applicable to each gas storage facility shall not be changed from the amount initially recorded except to reflect changes in volumes designated as base gas. If an inventory method is used to account for gas included herein, the utility may, at its election, price withdrawals in accordance with the instructions to Account 117.4.

    This account is to be used to record the cost of system gas designated as available for transmission load balancing (including no-notice transportation) and other uses associated with maintaining efficient transmission operations other than gas properly recordable in Account 117.1 or the plant accounts. Detailed records must be kept separately identifying volumes and unit prices of system gas held in underground storage facilities and held in pipelines.

    For utilities using fixed asset accounting, the cost initially recorded herein cannot be changed except for adjustments to volumes designated as system gas. Encroachments upon system gas must be accounted for in accordance with the instructions to Account 117.4, Gas owed to system gas.

    This account is to include the cost of stored gas owned by the utility and available for sale or other purposes. Gas included in this account must be accounted for using an inventory method in accordance with the Special Instructions to Accounts 117.1, 117.2, and 117.3 above.

    This account is to be used to record encroachments of system gas under the fixed asset method. This account may also be used to record encroachments of base gas for utilities electing to use an inventory method of accounting for system gas. Utilities may revalve cumulative net imbalances, net all transactions, and record one monthly entry with one month-end price for valuation purposes.

    This account shall include the balance in accounts for utility plant, other than gas plant, such as electric, railway, etc.

    This account shall include the accumulated provision for depreciation and amortization applicable to utility property other than gas plant.

    A. This account shall include the book cost of land, structures, equipment or other tangible or intangible property owned by the utility, but not used in utility service and not properly includible in account 105, Gas Plant Held for Future Use. This account shall also include, where applicable, amounts recorded for asset retirement costs associated with nonutility plant.

    B. This account shall also include the amount recorded under capital leases for property leased from others and used by the utility in its nonutility operations. Records shall be maintained with respect to each lease reflecting: (1) name of lessor, (2) basic details of lease, (3) terminal date, (4) original cost or fair market value of property leased, (5) future minimum lease payments, (6) executory costs, (7) present value of minimum lease payments, (8) the amount representing interest and the interest rate used, and (9) expenses paid.

    C. This account shall be subdivided so as to show the amount of property used in operations which are nonutility in character but nevertheless constitute a distinct operating activity of the company (such as operation of an ice department where such activity is not classed as a utility) and the amount of miscellaneous property not used in operations. The records in support of each subaccount shall be maintained so as to show an appropriate classification of the property.

    This account shall include the accumulated provision for depreciation and amortization applicable to nonutility property.

    A. This account shall include the book cost of investments in securities issued or assumed by associated companies and investment advances to such companies, including interest accrued thereon when such interest is not subject to current settlement, provided that the investment does not relate to a subsidiary company.

    E. Adjustments for inventory losses shall be charged to account 846.1, Gas Losses.

    A. This account shall include payments for undelivered gas and other prepayments of rents, taxes, insurance, interest, and like disbursements made prior to the period to which they apply. Prepayments for gas are those amounts paid to a seller of gas under “take or pay” provisions of a gas purchase contract for a sale certificated by the Commission where future makeup of the gas not taken in the current period is provided for by the contract.

    B. As the periods covered by such prepayments expire, credit this account and charge the proper operating expense or other appropriate account with the amount applicable to the period.

    C. This account shall be kept or supported in such a manner as to disclose the amount of each class of prepayments.

    A. This account shall include all advances made for gas (whether called “advances,” “contributions” or otherwise) to independent producers, affiliated or associated companies, or others operating within the lower 48 states and Alaska; for exploration, development or production (but not to include lease acquisition) of natural gas. Under each agreement with payee, such payments must be made prior to initial gas deliveries, or if the agreement provides for advances on a well by well basis, each incremental payment must be made prior to deliveries from an incremental well, or prior to Federal and/or State authorization, as appropriate. All agreements executed after June 17, 1975, (issuance date of Order No. 529) shall specify that (1) the pipeline shall have first call on any gas produced, attributable to the advance payment, under a long-term contract which is for a minimum initial term computed as the lesser of fifteen years or the life of the reserve in the field, and (2) the selling price of the gas committed by producers whose sales are subject to price regulation shall be governed by and limited to the area rate or national rate or, under appropriate showing of special circumstance, such other rate as may be authorized by the Commission under the provisions of optional pricing and special relief. As a determination of the initial rate, the time of first delivery in interstate commerce to the purchaser shall govern. Non-current advances not to be repaid within a two-year period shall be reclassified and transferred to account 124, Other Investments, for balance sheet purposes. This transfer is for reporting purposes only and has no effect on accounting and ratemaking.

    B. When a pipeline obtains a working interest as a result of funds advanced to producers, such amounts shall be included in appropriate production accounts for formal contractual agreements executed prior to the date of issuance of Order No. 499. When an associated company obtains a working interest as a result of funds advanced from a pipeline company, the pipeline shall include such amounts in Account 123, Investment in Associated Companies, or Account 146, Accounts receivable from Associated Companies, as appropriate, for formal contractual commitments made during the period on or after November 10, 1971 (effective date of Order 441) but prior to December 29, 1972, the date of issuance of Order No. 465.

    C. Outstanding advances shall be fully reduced within 5 years, or as otherwise authorized by the Commission, from the date gas deliveries commence or the date it is determined that recovery will be in other than gas. This account shall be credited with advances not fully recovered within the five-year period, and the unrecovered portion charged directly to Account 426.5, Other Deductions. A sufficient portion of all gas taken should be credited to the related outstanding advance so as to eliminate the advance within the 5-year period or as otherwise authorized by the Commission upon request by the pipeline company. The reduction of the outstanding advance should not be dependent on a buyer purchasing more than 100 percent of the minimum take or pay quantity provided in the contract. In those instances where the five-year recovery period has lapsed, but recovery of the advance continues beyond the five-year period, the unrecovered advances shall be removed from this account and transferred to Account 167, Other Advances for Gas.

    D. Where recovery is by gas, the recovered advance shall be credited to this account and charged to the appropriate gas purchase account.

    E. When an advance which is or has been included in this account and in rate base results in a source of proven reserves of natural gas, gas deliveries commence but no gas flows to the pipeline company making such advance, the amount of the advance shall be removed from this account (and from rate base) and recorded in account 167, Other Advances for Gas. Any revenues collected as a result of the advance being included in rate base shall be refunded by the pipeline company to its customers, together with interest, per annum, at the rate established by Order No. 513, issued October 10, 1974, or as subsequently revised by Commission Order, from the date of payment until refunded, within 12 months after the removal of the advance from this account, unless otherwise directed by the Commission. Where there is partial recovery of the advance by gas, in this situation, the amount of the advance transferred from this account to account 167 and the amount of revenues refunded, with interest, shall be appropriately apportioned.

    F. However, if 5 years elapses from the time the advance has been included in this account and during such time no gas deliveries have commenced or no determination has been made that the recovery will be in economic consideration other than gas, the pipeline shall at the end of the 5-year period, transfer the advance from this account to Account 167, and cease rate base treatment thereof, unless otherwise directed by the Commission.

    G. Whenever as a result of an advance included in this account, a pipeline receives any amount in excess of a full recovery of the advance, e.g. interest income, such amount must be credited to Account 813, Other Gas Supply Expenses, or as otherwise directed by the Commission. If the income or return is received in other than money, it shall be included at the market value of the assets received.

    H. If the recipient of an advance is unable to repay it in full, through no fault of the pipeline or contractual provisions, in gas or other assets, the unpaid or nonrecoverable portion must be credited to this account at the time such amount is recognized as nonrecoverable. Nonrecoverable advances significant in amount must be eliminated within 5 years from the date of determination as nonrecoverable by either a charge to account 435, Extraordinary Deductions, or when authorized by the Commission, by a transfer to account 186, Miscellaneous Deferred Debits, and amortization to account 813, Other Gas Supply Expenses. Nonrecoverable advances insignificant in amount should be charged directly to account 813 in the year recognized as nonrecoverable, when authorized by the Commission.

    I. No transfers shall be made to or from this account to any other accounts, unless otherwise provided herein, except as specifically authorized by the Commission upon request by the pipeline company.

    J. Three copies of any agreement concerning advances will be filed with the Secretary within 30 days of the initial related entry in account 166.

    This account shall include all advances not properly includible in Account 166, exclusive of amounts advanced where a working interest is obtained.

    This account shall include the amount of interest on bonds, mortgages, notes, commercial paper, loans, open accounts, deposits, etc., the payment of which is reasonably assured, and the amount of dividends declared or guaranteed on stocks owned.

    This account shall include rents receivable or accrued on property rented or leased by the utility to others.

    At the option of the utility, the estimated amount accrued for service rendered, but not billed at the end of any accounting period, may be included herein. In case accruals are made for unbilled revenues, they shall be made likewise for unbilled expenses, such as for the purchase of gas.

    A. This account shall include the book cost of all other current and accrued assets, appropriately designated and supported so as to show the nature of each asset included herein.

    B. The utility is to include in a separate subaccount amounts receivable for gas in unbalanced transactions where gas is delivered to another party in exchange, load balancing, or no-notice transportation transactions. (See Account 806.) If the amount receivable is settled by other than gas, Account 495, Other Gas Revenues must be credited or Account 813, Other Gas Supply Expenses, charged for the difference between the amount of the consideration received and the recorded amount of the receivable settled. Records are to be maintained so that there is readily available for each party entering gas exchange, load balancing, or no-notice transportation transactions, the quantity and cost of gas delivered, and the amount and basis of consideration received, if other than gas.

    This account shall include the amounts paid for derivative instruments, and the change in the fair value of all derivative instrument assets not designated as cash flow or fair value hedges. Account 421, miscellaneous nonoperating income, will be credited or debited as appropriate with the corresponding amount of the change in the fair value of the derivative instrument.

    A. This account shall include the amounts paid for derivative instruments, and the change in the fair value of derivative instrument assets designated by the utility as cash flow or fair value hedges.

    B. When a utility designates a derivative instrument asset as a cash flow hedge it will record the change in the fair value of the derivative instrument in this account with a concurrent charge to account 219, accumulated other comprehensive income, with the effective portion of the derivative gain or loss. The ineffective portion of the cash flow hedge shall be charged to the same income or expense account that will be used when the hedged item enters into the determination of net income.

    C. When a utility designates a derivative instrument asset as a fair value hedge it shall record the change in the fair value of the derivative instrument in this account with a concurrent charge to a subaccount of the asset or liability that carries the item being hedged. The ineffective portion of the fair value hedge shall be charged to the same income or expense account that will be used when the hedged item enters into the determination of net income.

    This account shall include expenses related to the issuance or assumption of debt securities. Amounts recorded in this account shall be amortized over the life of each respective issue under a plan which will distribute the amount equitably over the life of the security. The amortization shall be on a monthly basis, and the amounts thereof shall be charged to account 428, Amortization of Debt Discount and Expense. Any unamortized amounts outstanding at the time that the related debt is prematurely reacquired shall be accounted for as indicated in General Instruction 17.

    A. When authorized or directed by the Commission, this account shall include extraordinary losses, which could not reasonably have been anticipated and which are not covered by insurance or other provisions, such as unforeseen damages to property.

    B. Application to the Commission for permission to use this account shall be accompanied by a statement giving a complete explanation with respect to the items which it is proposed to include herein, the period over which, and the accounts to which it is proposed to write off the charges, and other pertinent information.

    A. This account shall include: (1) Nonrecurring costs of studies and analyses mandated by regulatory bodies related to plants in service, transferred from account 183.2, Other Preliminary Survey and Investigation Charges, and not resulting in construction; and (2) when authorized by the Commission, significant unrecovered costs of plant facilities where construction has been cancelled or which have been prematurely retired.

    B. This account shall be credited and account 407.1, Amortization of Property Losses, Unrecovered Plant and Regulatory Study Costs, shall be debited, over the period specified by the Commission.

    C. Any additional costs incurred, relative to the cancellation or premature retirement, may be included in this account and amortized over the remaining period of the original amortization period. Should any gains of recoveries be realized relative to the cancelled or prematurely retired plant, such amounts shall be used to reduce the unamortized amount of the costs recorded herein.

    D. In the event that the recovery of costs included herein is disallowed in rate proceedings, the disallowed costs shall be charged to account 426.5, Other Deductions, or account 435, Extraordinary deductions, in the year of such disallowance.

    A. This account shall include the amounts of regulatory-created assets, not includible in other accounts, resulting from the ratemaking actions of regulatory agencies. ( Definition No. 31.)

    B. The amounts included in this account are to be established by those charges which would have been included in net income, or accumulated other comprehensive income, determinations in the current period under the general requirements of the Uniform System of Accounts but for it being probable that such items will be included in a different period(s) for purposes of developing rates that the utility is authorized to charge for its utility services. When specific identification of the particular source of a regulatory asset cannot be made, such as in plant phase-ins, rate moderation plans, or rate levelization plans, account 407.4, regulatory credits, shall be credited. The amounts recorded in this account are generally to be charged, concurrently with the recovery of the amounts in rates, to the same account that would have been charged if included in income when incurred, except all regulatory assets established through the use of account 407.4 shall be charged to account 407.3, Regulatory debits, concurrent with the recovery in rates.

    C. If rate recovery of all or part of an amount included in this account is disallowed, the disallowed amount shall be charged to Account 426.5, Other Deductions, or Account 435, Extraordinary Deductions, in the year of the disallowance.

    D. The records supporting the entries to this account shall be kept so that the utility can furnish full information as to the nature and amount of each regulatory asset included in this account, including justification for inclusion of such amounts in this account.

    A. This account shall be charged with all expenditures for preliminary surveys, plans, investigations, etc. made for the purpose of determining the feasibility of acquiring land and land rights to provide a future supply of natural gas. If such land or land rights are acquired, this account shall be credited and the appropriate gas plant account (see gas plant instruction 7-G) charged with the amount of the expenditures relating to such acquisition. If a project is abandoned involving a natural gas lease acquired before October 8, 1969, the expenditures related thereto shall be charged to account 798, Other Exploration. If a project is abandoned involving a lease acquired after October 7, 1969, the expenditures related thereto shall be charged to account 338, Unsuccessful Exploration and Development Costs.

    B. The records supporting the entries to this account shall be so kept that the utility can furnish, for each investigation, complete information as to the identification and location of territory investigated, the number or other identification assigned to the land tract or leasehold acquired, and the nature and respective amounts of the charges.

    A. This account shall be charged with all expenditures for preliminary surveys, plans, investigations, etc., made for the purpose of determining the feasibility of utility projects under contemplation, other than the acquisition of land and land rights to provide a future supply of natural gas. If construction results, this account shall be credited and the appropriate utility plant account charged. If the work is abandoned, the charge shall be made to account 426.5, Other Deductions, or the appropriate operating expense account.

    B. This account shall also include costs of studies and analyses mandated by regulatory bodies related to plant in service. If construction results from such studies, this account shall be credited and the appropriate utility plant account charged with an equitable portion of such study costs directly attributable to new construction. The portion of such study costs not attributable to new construction or the entire cost if construction does not result shall be charged to account 182.2, Unrecovered Plant and Regulatory Study Costs, or the appropriate operating expense account. The costs of such studies relative to plant under construction shall be included directly in account 107, Construction Work in Progress—Gas.

    C. The records supporting the entries to this account shall be so kept that the utility can furnish complete information as to the nature and the purpose of the survey, plans, or investigations and the nature and amounts of the several charges.

    This caption shall include undistributed balances in clearing accounts at the date of the balance sheet. Balances in clearing accounts shall be substantially cleared not later than the end of the calendar year unless items held therein relate to a future period.

    This account shall include amounts shown by work orders for plant installed for temporary use in utility service for periods of less than one year. Such work orders shall be charged with the cost of temporary facilities and credited with payments received from customers and net salvage realized on removal of the temporary facilities. Any net credit or debit resulting shall be cleared to account 488, Miscellaneous Service Revenues.

    A. This account shall include all debits not elsewhere provided for, such as miscellaneous work in progress, construction certificate application fees paid prior to final disposition of the application as provided for in gas plant instruction 15A, and unusual or extraordinary expenses not included in other accounts which are in process of amortization, and items the final disposition of which is uncertain.

    B. The records supporting the entries to this account shall be so kept that the utility can furnish full information as to each deferred debit included herein.

    This account shall include losses from the sale or other disposition of property previously recorded in account 105, Gas Plant Held for Future Use and account 105.1, Production Properties Held for Future Use, under the provisions of paragraphs B, C, and D thereof, where such losses are significant and are to be amortized over a period of 5 years, unless otherwise authorized by the Commission. The amortization of the amounts in this account shall be made by debits to account 411.7, Losses from Disposition of Utility Plant. Subdivision of this account shall be maintained so that amounts relating to account 105, Gas Plant Held for Future Use and account 105.1, Production Properties Held for Future Use, can be readily identifiable. (See accounts 105, Gas Plant Held for Future Use and 105.1, Production Properties Held for Future Use.)

    A. This account shall be charged with the cost of all expenditures coming within the meaning of Research, Development, and Demonstration (R.D. & D.) of this Uniform Systems of Accounts (see definition 28.B), except those expenditures properly chargeable to Account 107, Construction Work in Progress—Gas.

    B. Costs that are minor or of a general or recurring nature shall be transferred from this account to the appropriate operating expense function or if such costs are common to the overall operations or cannot be feasibly allocated to the various operating accounts, then such costs shall be recorded in account 930.2, Miscellaneous General Expenses.

    C. In certain instances a company may incur large and significant research, development, and demonstration expenditures which are nonrecurring and which would distort the annual research, development, and demonstration charges for the period. In such a case the portion of such amounts that cause the distortion may be amortized to the appropriate operating expense account over a period not to exceed five years unless otherwise authorized by the Commission.

    D. The entries in this account must be so maintained as to show separately each project along with complete detail of the nature and purpose of the research, development, and demonstration project together with the related costs.

    This account shall include the losses on long-term debt reacquired or redeemed. The amounts in this account shall be amortized in accordance with General Instruction 17.

    A. This account shall be debited and account 411.1, Provision for Deferred Income Taxes—Credit, Utility Operating Income, or account 411.2, Provision for Deferred Income Taxes—Credit, Other Income and Deductions, as appropriate, shall be credited with an amount equal to that by which income taxes payable for the year are higher because of the inclusion of certain items in income for tax purposes, which items for general accounting purposes will not be fully reflected in the utility's determination of annual net income until subsequent years.

    B. This account shall be credited and account 410.1, Provision for Deferred Income Taxes, Utility Operating Income, or account 410.2, Provision for Deferred Income Taxes, Other Income and Deductions, as appropriate, shall be debited with an amount equal to that by which income taxes payable for the year are lower because of prior payment of taxes as provided by paragraph A above, because of difference in timing for tax purposes of particular items of income or income deductions from that recognized by the utility for general accounting purposes. Such credit to this account and debit to account 410.1 or 410.2 shall, in general, represent the effect on taxes payable in the current year of the smaller amount of book income recognized, or the larger deduction permitted, for tax purposes as compared to the amount recognized in the utility's current accounts with respect to the item or class of items for which deferred tax concept of accounting is affected.

    C. Vintage year records with respect to entries to this account, as described above, and the account balance shall be so maintained as to show the factor of calculation with respect to each annual amount of the item or class of items for which deferred tax accounting by the utility is utilized.

    D. The utility is restricted in its use of this account to the purpose set forth above. It shall not make use of the balance in this account or any portion thereof except as provided in the text of this account, without prior approval of the Commission. Any remaining deferred tax account balance with respect to an amount for any prior year's tax deferral, the amortization of which or other recognition in the utility's income accounts has been completed, or other disposition made, shall be debited to account 410.1, Provision for Deferred Income Taxes, Utility Operating Income, or account 410.2, Provision for Deferred Income Taxes, Other Income and Deductions, as appropriate, or otherwise disposed of as the Commission may authorize or direct. (See General Instruction 18.)

    A. This account shall include purchase gas costs related to Commission approved purchased gas adjustment clauses when such costs are not included in the utility's rate schedule on file with the Commission. This account shall also include such other costs as authorized by the Commission.

    B. This account shall be debited or credited, as appropriate, each month for increases or decreases in purchased gas costs with contra entries to Account 805.1, Purchased Gas Cost Adjustments.

    C. After a change in a rate schedule recognizing the increases or decreases in purchased gas costs recorded in this account is approved by the Commission, this account shall be debited or credited, as appropriate, with contra entries to expense Account 805.1, Purchased Gas Cost Adjustments, so that the balance accumulated in this account will be amortized on an appropriate basis over a succeeding 6-month period or over such other periods that the Commission may have authorized. Any over or under applied debits or credits to this account shall be carried forward to the succeeding period of amortization.

    D. Separate subaccounts shall be maintained for the amounts relating to the period in which the increase or decrease is accumulated and for the amortization of purchase gas increases or decreases, as applicable, so as to keep each period separate.

    A. These accounts shall include the par value or the stated value of stock without par value if such stock has a stated value, and, if not, the cash value of the consideration received for such nonpar stock, of each class of capital stock actually issued, including the par or stated value of such capital stock in account 124, Other Investments and account 217, Reacquired Capital Stock.

    B. When the actual cash value of the consideration received is more or less than the par or stated value of any stock having a par or stated value, the difference shall be credited or debited, as the case may be, to the premium or discount account for the particular class and series.

    C. When capital stock is retired, these accounts shall be charged with the amount at which such stock is carried herein.

    A. These accounts shall include the amount of legally enforceable subscriptions to capital stock of the utility. They shall be credited with the par or stated value of the stock subscribed, exclusive of accrued dividends, if any. Concurrently, a debit shall be made to subscriptions to capital stock, included as a Other Accounts Receivable, for the agreed price and any discount or premium shall be debited or credited to the appropriate discount or premium account. When properly executed stock certificates have been issued representing the shares subscribed, this account separate subdivision of account 143, shall be debited, and the appropriate capital stock account credited, with the par or stated value of such stock.

    B. The records shall be kept in such manner as to show the amount of subscriptions to each class and series of stock.

    A. These accounts shall include the par value or stated value, as appropriate, of capital stock which the utility has agreed to exchange for outstanding securities of other companies in connection with the acquisition of properties of such companies under terms which allow the holders of the securities of the other companies to surrender such securities and receive in return therefor capital stock of the accounting utility.

    B. When the securities of the other companies have been surrendered and capital stock issued in accordance with the terms of the exchange, these accounts shall be charged and accounts 201, Common Stock Issued, or 204, Preferred Stock Issued, as the case may be, shall be credited.

    C. The records shall be kept so as to show separately the stocks of each class and series for which a conversion liability exists.

      (2) The regulations in this part should not be construed as excusing compliance with other lawful requirements of any other governmental body, Federal or State, prescribing other record keeping requirements, or for preservation of records for periods longer than those prescribed in this part.

      (3) To the extent that any Commission regulations may provide for a different retention period, the records should be retained for the longer of the retention periods.

      (4) Records other than those listed in the schedule may be destroyed at the option of the natural gas company:  That records which are used in lieu of those listed shall be preserved for the periods prescribed for the records used for substantially similar purposes. And,  That retention of records pertaining to added services, functions, plant, etc., the establishment of which cannot be presently foreseen, shall conform to the principles embodied herein.

      (5) Notwithstanding the provisions of the Records Retention Schedule, the Commission may, upon the request of the company, authorize a shorter period of retention for any record listed therein upon a showing by the company that preservation of such record for a longer period is not necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors or consumers.

      (b)  Each natural gas company subject to the regulations in this part shall designate one or more persons with official responsibility to supervise the natural gas company's program for preservation and the authorized destruction of its records.

      (c)  The natural gas company shall provide reasonable protection for records subject to the regulations in this part from damage by fires, floods, and other hazards and, in the selection of storage spaces, safeguard the records from unnecessary exposure to deterioration from excessive humidity, dryness, or lack of proper ventilation.

      (d)  Each natural gas company has the flexibility to select its own storage media subject to the following conditions.

      (1) The storage media must have a life expectancy at least equal to the applicable record retention period provided in § 225.3 unless there is a quality transfer from one media to another with no loss of data.

      (2) Each natural gas company is required to implement internal control procedures that assure the reliability of and ready access to data stored on machine readable media. Internal control procedures must be documented by a responsible supervisory official.

      (3) Each transfer of data from one media to another must be verified for accuracy and documented. Software and hardware required to produce readable records must be retained for the same period the media format is used.

      (e)  At the expiration of the records retention period, natural gas companies may use any appropriate method to destroy records.

      (f)  When records are destroyed or lost before the expiration of the prescribed period of retention, a certified statement listing, as far as may be determined, the records destroyed and describing the circumstances of accidental or other premature destruction or loss must be filed with the Commission within ninety (90) days from the date of discovery of the destruction.

      (g)  (1) Records related to plant in service must be retained until the facilities are permanently removed from service, all removal and restoration activities are completed, and all costs are retired from the accounting records unless accounting adjustments resulting from reclassification and original costs studies have been approved by the regulatory commission having jurisdiction. If the plant is sold, the associated records or copies thereof, must be transferred to the new owners.

      (2) Records related to additions, retirements, and betterments thereto must be retained until the Commission has determined the actual legitimate original cost of the facilities.

      (h)  “Destroy at option” constitutes authorization for destruction of records at managements' discretion if it does not conflict with other legal retention requirements or usefulness of such records in satisfying pending regulatory actions or directives.

      (i)  The natural gas companies must assure the availability of records of services performed by associated or affiliated companies with supporting cost information for the periods indicated in § 225.3 as necessary to be able to readily furnish detailed information as to the nature of the transaction, the amounts involved, and the accounts used to record the transactions.

      (j)  Natural gas companies must arrange, file, and index records so they may be readily identified and made available to Commission representatives.

      (k)  Notwithstanding the minimum retention periods provided in these regulations, if a natural gas company intends to reflect costs in a current, pending, or future rate case, or if a natural gas company has abandoned or retired a plant subsequent to the test period of its last rate case, it must retain all relevant records.

      (l)  Notwithstanding the minimum requirements, if a natural gas company is involved in pending litigation, complaint procedures, proceedings remanded by the court, or governmental proceedings, it must retain all relevant records.

      (m)  Life or mortality study data for depreciation purposes must be retained for 25 years or for 10 years after plant is retired whichever is longer.

      Subpart A—General Definitions

        § 270.101   General definitions.

#### § § 270.101

        (a)  Terms defined in the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 (NGPA) will have the same meaning for purposes of this subchapter as they have under the NGPA, unless further defined in this subchapter.

        (b)  For purposes of this part:

        (1)  means the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978.

        (2)  means the point on the Earth's surface from which drilling of a well is commenced except that in the case of a well drilled in permanent surface waters, “the Earth's surface” means the mean elevation of the surface of the water.

        (3)  means the state or federal agency identified in § 270.401.

        (4)  means natural gas that a jurisdictional agency has determined to be produced from a designated tight formation.

        (5)  means the portion of a natural gas bearing formation that was:

        (i) Designated as a tight formation by the Commission, pursuant to section 501 of the NGPA, or

        (ii) Determined to be a tight formation pursuant to section 503 of the NGPA.

        (6)  means naturally occurring natural gas released from entrapment from the fractures, pores and bedding planes of coal seams.

        (7)  means natural gas produced from fractures, micropores and bedding planes of shales deposited during the Paleozoic Devonian Period.

        (8)  can be defined as either:

        (i) The gross Devonian age stratigraphic interval encountered by a well bore, at least 95 percent of which has a gamma ray index of 0.7 or greater; or

        (ii) One continuous interval within the gross Devonian age stratigraphic interval, encountered by a well bore, as long as at least 95 percent of the selected Devonian shale interval has a gamma ray index of 0.7 or greater (but if the interval selected is more than 200 feet thick, the bottom and top 100 foot portions must meet the five percent test independently).

        (9)  means when measuring the Devonian age stratigraphic interval, the gamma ray index at any point is to be calculated by dividing the gamma ray log value at that point by the gamma log value at the shale base line established over the entire Devonian age interval penetrated by the well bore.

        (10)  means one thousand cubic feet of natural gas at 60 degrees Fahrenheit under a pressure equivalent to that of 30.00 inches of mercury at 32 degrees Fahrenheit, under standard gravitational force (980.665 centimeters per second squared).

        (11)  means a well for which permeability and/or pre-stimulation production rate data are available for a pay section in the formation for which a tight formation designation is being sought.

#### § § 270.305

        (a)  A jurisdictional agency determination designating a portion of a formation as a tight formation must be made in the form and manner prescribed in this subpart.

        (b)  A jurisdictional agency determination designating a portion of a formation as a tight formation must be made in accordance with the following guidelines:

        (1) Within the geographic boundaries of the portion of the formation being recommended for tight formation designation, the estimated in situ gas permeability, throughout the pay section, is expected to be 0.1 millidarcy (md) or less. The expected in situ permeability is to be determined through an arithmetic mean averaging of the known permeabilities obtained from the wells that penetrate, and have a pay section in, such portion of such formation.

        (2) Within the geographic boundaries of the portion of the formation being recommended for tight formation designation, the stabilized production rate of natural gas, against atmospheric pressure, of wells completed for production in such portion of such formation, without stimulation, is not expected to exceed the production rate determined in accordance with the table in this paragraph (b)(2). Such expected stabilized, pre-stimulation production rate is to be determined through an arithmetic mean averaging of the known stabilized, pre-stimulation production rates obtained from the wells that penetrate, and have a pay section in, such portion of such formation.

        (c)  Any jurisdictional agency making a determination that a formation, or portion thereof, qualifies as a tight formation will provide timely notice, in writing, of such determination, to the Commission. Such notice shall include the following to substantiate the jurisdictional agency's findings:

        (1) Geological and geographical descriptions of the formation, or portion thereof, which is determined to qualify as a tight formation; and

        (2) Geological and engineering data to support the determination, including (but not limited to):

        (i) A map of the area for which a tight formation determination is being sought that clearly locates and identifies all data wells and all dry holes that penetrate the subject formation and all wells that are currently producing from the subject formation.

        (ii) A well-by-well table of each in situ permeability value (in millidarcies), pre-stimulation stabilized production rate (in Mcf per day), and depth to the top of the formation (in feet) for each well, and the arithmetic mean of each set of data.

        (iii) For any data that the jurisdictional agency excludes from the above calculations, a statement explaining why the data was excluded.

        (iv) The underlying well test, well logs, cross-sections, or other data sources, and all calculations performed to derive the formation tops, permeability values, and pre-stimulation stabilized production rates shown in the well-by-well table.

        (v) Any other information that the jurisdictional agency deems relevant and/or that the jurisdictional agency relied upon in making its determination.

#### § § 281.204

        (a)  Each interstate pipeline listed in § 281.202 shall file tariff sheets or sections, in accordance with § 154.4 of this chapter, including an index of entitlements, which provides that if the interstate pipeline is in curtailment, natural gas will be delivered in accordance with the provisions of this subpart. If the interstate pipeline has curtailment provisions in its currently effective tariff, the tariff sheets or sections shall amend the existing curtailment provisions. If the interstate pipeline has no curtailment plan in its currently effective tariff, when it files tariff sheets or sections to amend its currently effective tariff to include a curtailment plan such curtailment plan shall comply with the requirements of this subpart. The tariff sheets or sections shall be filed no later than October 1, 1979, with a proposed effective date of November 1, 1979.

        (2)  Each interstate pipeline shall update its index of entitlements annually to reflect changes in Priority 2 entitlements. The new index of requirements shall be filed on September 15 of each year with a proposed effective date of November 1, except that if the interstate pipeline uses a rolling base period in its currently effective curtailment plan it shall file its new index of entitlements on the date upon which other end-uses of the customers of the interstate pipeline are updated in accordance with the currently effective tariff.

        (3)  The index of entitlements shall not include the volumes of natural gas for which volumes the essential agricultural user has the ability to use an alternative fuel, as determined under Subpart C of this part. Each interstate pipeline shall amend its index of entitlements pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this section to remove from the priority 2 entitlements and place in an appropriate priority of service category any such volumes or natural gas included in any index of entitlements that is effective on or after October 31, 1979.

#### § § 281.205

        (a) —(1)  Each interstate pipeline shall establish a new high-priority use category of service designated priority one (1) which shall include all the high-priority entitlements calculated in accordance with § 281.206 and those storage injection volumes calculated in accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of this section.

        (2)  Each interstate pipeline shall establish a new priority of service category designated priority two (2) which shall include all the essential agricultural use requirements calculated in accordance with § 281.207 and those storage injection volumes calculated in accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of this section.

        (3)  Each interstate pipeline may retain the priority of service categories in its currently effective tariff, but such categories shall be placed at priorities below the new priorities 1 and 2. Each interstate pipeline shall reduce the entitlements in all other existing categories of service to the extent such entitlements have been placed into the new priority of service categories 1 or 2.

        (b)  All deliveries to all customers of the interstate pipeline for all volumes of natural gas not included in priorities 1 and 2 shall be fully curtailed by the interstate pipeline before priorities 1 and 2 entitlements are curtailed. Deliveries for priority 2 entitlements shall be fully curtailed by the interstate pipelines (in accordance with the currently effective curtailment plan) before priority 1 entitlements are curtailed by the interstate pipelines. Nothing in this paragraph is intended to alter the operation of any “small customer” or “small distributor” exemption or waiver (as defined in an interstate pipeline's currently effective curtailment plan).

        (c) —(1)  Interstate pipelines shall classify customer storage injection volumes in the same manner as that used in the currently effective curtailment plan.

        (2)  Interstate pipelines which classify customer storage injection volumes on the basis of the actual end-use of the natural gas shall recalculate storage injection volumes placed in each priority of service category based upon the index of entitlements to be filed on September 15.

        (3)  Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, no interstate pipeline shall recalculate or reclassify any customer storage injection volumes, and no customer storage injection volumes shall be included as priority 1 or 2 entitlements.

        § 281.209   Attribution.

#### § § 281.209

        (a)  (1) This section sets forth the rules for attributing total essential agricultural requirements by an essential agricultural user, indirect essential agricultural requirements of an essential agricultural user by its local distribution company supplier and priority 1 and 2 entitlements by an interstate pipeline purchaser.

        (2) This section does not apply to an essential agricultural user or local distribution company which receives all its natural gas supplies from a single source, or an interstate pipeline purchaser which does not receive natural gas from any other interstate pipeline.

        (b)  (1) For purposes of attribution in accordance with this section, natural gas from all direct sources, including but not limited to pipeline production, production by independent producers, production by affiliates, SNG facilities and natural gas purchased from local distribution companies, and interstate pipelines shall be included.

        (2)(i) An essential agricultural user, which attributes under paragraph (d) a portion of the volumes which are its total essential agricultural requirements to a direct source of natural gas other than a direct supplier may not seek classification to priority 2 under § 281.207 for such portion of its total essential agricultural requirements.

        (ii) A local distribution company which attributes under paragraph (e) a portion of the volumes which are its indirect essential agricultural requirements to a direct source of natural gas other than a direct supplier may not seek classification to priority 2 under § 281.207 for such portion of its indirect essential agricultural requirements.

        (iii) An interstate pipeline purchaser which attributes under paragraph (f) a portion of the volumes of its priority 1 or 2 entitlements to a direct source of natural gas other than a direct supplier may not seek reclassification to priority 1 or classification to priority 2, respectively, for such portion of its priority 1 and 2 entitlements.

        (c)  For purposes of this section:

        (1)  means, with respect to an essential agricultural user, an interstate pipeline or local distribution company which directly supplies such essential agricultural user, with respect to a local distribution company, an interstate pipeline which directly supplies such local distribution company and, with respect to an interstate pipeline purchaser, and interstate pipeline which directly supplies the interstate pipeline purchaser.

        (2)  of a direct supplier means the fixed historical period in which entitlements of the customer of the direct supplier were established for purposes of the currently effective curtailment plan of such direct supplier.

        (3)  with respect to a particular direct supplier means the total entitlements an essential agricultural user, local distribution company or interstate pipeline is entitled to purchase from that direct supplier in a calendar year under the currently effective curtailment plan.

        (d)  (1) An essential agricultural user shall calculate its attributable essential agricultural requirements attributable to a particular direct supplier by multiplying its total essential agricultural requirements by the Annual Quantity Entitlements from such direct supplier and dividing the product (numerator) by the sum of all Annual Quantity Entitlements and all volumes received from sources not providing an Annual Quantity Entitlement to such user (denominator).

        (2) If an essential agricultural user does not have annual quantity entitlements only with respect to one of its direct suppliers, the attributable essential agricultural requirements attributable to such direct supplier shall be that part of the total essential agricultural requirements not attributed under paragraph (d)(1) of this section.

        (3) If an essential agricultural user does not have Annual Quantity Entitlements with respect to more than one of its direct suppliers, the attributable essential agricultural requirements attributable to a particular direct supplier shall be calculated by multiplying its total essential agricultural requirements by the total volume of natural gas received from such supplier in 1972 and dividing the product (numerator) by the total supplies of natural gas received from all sources in 1972 (denominator).

        (e)  A local distribution company shall calculate its attributable indirect essential agricultural requirements among its direct suppliers in the same manner as it attributed its supplies to its direct suppliers for purposes of establishing entitlements in the currently effective curtailment plans of such direct supplier.

        (f)  An interstate pipeline shall attribute Priority 1 and 2 entitlements respectively among its direct pipeline suppliers in the same manner as it attributed its supplies to its direct pipeline suppliers for purposes of establishing entitlements in the currently effective curtailment plans of such direct suppliers.

        § 284.7   Firm transportation service.

#### § § 284.7

        (a)  (1) An interstate pipeline that provides transportation service under subpart B or G or this part must offer such transportation service on a firm basis and separately from any sales service.

        (2) An intrastate pipeline that provides transportation service under Subpart C may offer such transportation service on a firm basis.

        (3)  means that the service is not subject to a prior claim by another customer or another class of service and receives the same priority as any other class of firm service.

        (4) An interstate pipeline that provided a firm sales service on May 18, 1992, and that offers transportation service on a firm basis under subpart B or G of this part, must offer a firm transportation service under which firm shippers may receive delivery up to their firm entitlements on a daily basis without penalty.

        (b)  (1) An interstate pipeline or intrastate pipeline that offers transportation service on a firm basis under subpart B, C or G must provide such service without undue discrimination, or preference, including undue discrimination or preference in the quality of service provided, the duration of service, the categories, prices, or volumes of natural gas to be transported, customer classification, or undue discrimination or preference of any kind.

        (2) An interstate pipeline that offers transportation service on a firm basis under subpart B or G of this part must provide each service on a basis that is equal in quality for all gas supplies transported under that service, whether purchased from the pipeline or another seller.

        (3) An interstate pipeline that offers transportation service on a firm basis under subpart B or G of this part may not include in its tariff any provision that inhibits the development of market centers.

        (c)  Consistent with paragraph (b) of this section, a pipeline may impose reasonable operational conditions on any service provided under this part. Such conditions must be filed by the pipeline as part of its transportation tariff.

        (d)  An interstate pipeline that offers transportation service under subpart B or G of this part must permit a shipper to make use of the firm capacity for which it has contracted by segmenting that capacity into separate parts for its own use or for the purpose of releasing that capacity to replacement shippers to the extent such segmentation is operationally feasible.

        (e)  Where the customer purchases firm service, a pipeline may impose a reservation fee or charge on a shipper as a condition for providing such service. Except for pipelines subject to subpart C of this part, if a reservation fee is charged, it must recover all fixed costs attributable to the firm transportation service, unless the Commission permits the pipeline to recover some of the fixed costs in the volumetric portion of a two-part rate. A reservation fee may not recover any variable costs or fixed costs not attributable to the firm transportation service. Except as provided in this paragraph, the pipeline may not include in a rate for any transportation provided under subpart B, C or G of this part any minimum bill or minimum take provision, or any other provision that has the effect of guaranteeing revenue.

        (f)  A person providing service under Subpart B, C or G of this part is not required to provide any requested transportation service for which capacity is not available or that would require the construction or acquisition of any new facilities.

        § 284.8   Release of firm capacity on interstate pipelines.

#### § § 284.8

        (a) An interstate pipeline that offers transportation service on a firm basis under subpart B or G of this part must include in its tariff a mechanism for firm shippers to release firm capacity to the pipeline for resale by the pipeline on a firm basis under this section.

        (b)(1) Firm shippers must be permitted to release their capacity, in whole or in part, on a permanent or short-term basis, without restriction on the terms or conditions of the release. A firm shipper may arrange for a replacement shipper to obtain its released capacity from the pipeline. A replacement shipper is any shipper that obtains released capacity.

        (2) The rate charged the replacement shipper for a release of capacity may not exceed the applicable maximum rate, except that no rate limitation applies to the release of capacity for a period of one year or less if the release is to take effect on or before one year from the date on which the pipeline is notified of the release. Payments or other consideration exchanged between the releasing and replacement shippers in a release to an asset manager as defined in paragraph (h)(3) of this section are not subject to the maximum rate.

        (c) Except as provided in paragraph (h) of this section, a firm shipper that wants to release any or all of its firm capacity must notify the pipeline of the terms and conditions under which the shipper will release its capacity. The firm shipper must also notify the pipeline of any replacement shipper designated to obtain the released capacity under the terms and conditions specified by the firm shipper.

        (d) The pipeline must provide notice of offers to release or to purchase capacity, the terms and conditions of such offers, and the name of any replacement shipper designated in paragraph (b) of this section, on an Internet web site, for a reasonable period.

        (e) The pipeline must allocate released capacity to the person offering the highest rate and offering to meet any other terms and conditions of the release. If more than one person offers the highest rate and meets the terms and conditions of the release, the released capacity may be allocated on a basis provided in the pipeline's tariff, provided however, if the replacement shipper designated in paragraph (b) of this section offers the highest rate, the capacity must be allocated to the designated replacement shipper.

        (f) Unless otherwise agreed by the pipeline, the contract of the shipper releasing capacity will remain in full force and effect, with the net proceeds from any resale to a replacement shipper credited to the releasing shipper's reservation charge.

        (g) To the extent necessary, a firm shipper on an interstate pipeline that offers transportation service on a firm basis under subpart B or G of this part is granted a limited-jurisdiction blanket certificate of public convenience and necessity pursuant to section 7 of the Natural Gas Act solely for the purpose of releasing firm capacity pursuant to this section.

        (h)(1) The following releases need not comply with the bidding requirements of paragraphs (c) through (e) of this section:

        (i) A release of capacity to an asset manager as defined in paragraph (h)(3) of this section;

        (ii) A release of capacity to a marketer participating in a state-regulated retail access program as defined in paragraph (h)(4) of this section;

        (iii) A release for more than one year at the maximum tariff rate; and

        (iv) A release for any period of 31 days or less.

        (v) If a release is exempt from bidding under paragraph (h)(1) of this section, notice of the release must be provided on the pipeline's Internet Web site as soon as possible, but not later than the first nomination, after the release transaction commences.

        (2) When a release of capacity is exempt from bidding under paragraph (h)(1)(iv) of this section, a firm shipper may not roll over, extend or in any way continue the release to the same replacement shipper using the 31 days or less bidding exemption until 28 days after the first release period has ended. The 28-day hiatus does not apply to any re-release to the same replacement shipper that is posted for bidding or that qualifies for any of the other exemptions from bidding in paragraph (h)(1) of this section.

        (3) A release to an asset manager exempt from bidding requirements under paragraph (h)(1)(i) of this section is any pre-arranged release that contains a condition that the releasing shipper may call upon the replacement shipper to deliver to, or purchase from, the releasing shipper a volume of gas up to 100 percent of the daily contract demand of the released transportation or storage capacity, as provided in paragraphs (h)(3)(i) through (h)(3)(iii) of this paragraph.

        (i) If the capacity release is for a period of one year or less, the asset manager's delivery or purchase obligation must apply on any day during a minimum period of the lesser of five months (or 155 days) or the term of the release.

        (ii) If the capacity release is for a period of more than one year, the asset manager's delivery or purchase obligation must apply on any day during a minimum period of five months (or 155 days) of each twelve-month period of the release, and on five-twelfths of the days of any additional period of the release not equal to twelve months.

        (iii) If the capacity release is a release of storage capacity, the asset manager's delivery or purchase obligation need only be up to 100 percent of the daily contract demand under the release for storage withdrawals or injections, as applicable.

        (4) A release to a marketer participating in a state-regulated retail access program exempt from bidding requirements under paragraph (h)(1)(ii) of this section is any prearranged capacity release that will be utilized by the replacement shipper to provide the gas supply requirement of retail consumers pursuant to a retail access program approved by the state agency with jurisdiction over the local distribution company that provides delivery service to such retail consumers.

        § 284.9   Interruptible transportation service.

#### § § 284.9

        (a)  (1) An interstate pipeline that provides firm transportation service under subpart B or G of this part must also offer transportation service on an interruptible basis under that subpart or subparts and separately from any sales service.

        (2) An intrastate pipeline that provides transportation service under Subpart C may offer such transportation service on an interruptible basis.

        (3)  means that the capacity used to provide the service is subject to a prior claim by another customer or another class of service and receives a lower priority than such other classes of service.

        (b) The provisions regarding non-discriminatory access, reasonable operational conditions, and limitations contained in § 284.7 (b), (c), and (f) apply to pipelines providing interruptible service under this section.

        (c)  No reservation fee may be imposed for interruptible service. A pipeline's rate for any transportation service provided under this section may not include any minimum bill provision, minimum take provision, or any other provision that has the effect of guaranteeing revenue.

        § 284.10   Rates.

#### § § 284.10

        (a)  Any rate charged for transportation service under subparts B and G of this part must be established under a rate schedule that is filed with the Commission prior to commencement of such service and that conforms to the requirements of this section.

        (b)  Maximum rates for both peak and offpeak periods must be designed to achieve the following three objectives:

        (1) Rates for service during peak periods should ration capacity;

        (2) Rates for firm service during off-peak periods and for interruptible service during all periods should maximize throughput; and

        (3) The pipeline's revenue requirement allocated to firm and interruptible services should be attained by providing the projected units of service in peak and off-peak periods at the maximum rate for each service.

        (c) —(1)  Except as provided in § 284.7(e), any rate filed for service subject to this section must be a one-part rate that recovers the costs allocated to the service to the extent that the projected units of that service are actually purchased and may not include a demand charge, a minimum bill or minimum take provision or any other provision that has the effect of guaranteeing revenue. Such rate must separately identify cost components attributable to transportation, storage, and gathering costs.

        (2)  Any rate filed for service subject to this section must be designed to recover costs on the basis of projected units of service. The fixed costs allocated to capacity reservations, as determined in accordance with § 284.7(e), should be used along with the projected nominations accepted by the pipeline to compute the unit reservation fee. The remaining fixed costs and all variable costs should be used to determine the volumetric rate computed on the basis of projected volumes to be transported. The units projected for the service in rates filed under this section may be changed only in a subsequent rate filing under section 4 of the Natural Gas Act.

        (3)  Any rate filed for service subject to this section must reasonably reflect any material variation in the cost of providing the service due to:

        (i) Whether the service is provided during a peak or an off-peak period; and

        (ii) The distance over which the transportation is provided.

        (4)  (i) Any maximum rate filed under this section must be designed to recover on a unit basis, solely those costs which are properly allocated to the service to which the rate applies.

        (ii) Any minimum rate filed under this section must be based on the average variable costs which are properly allocated to the service to which the rate applies.

        (5)  (i) Any rate schedule filed under this section must state a maximum rate and a minimum rate.

        (ii)(A) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(5)(ii)(B) of this section the pipeline may charge an individual customer any rate that is neither greater than the maximum rate nor less than the minimum rate on file for that service.

        (B) If a pipeline does not hold a blanket certificate under Subpart G of this part, it may not charge, in a transaction involving its marketing affiliate, a rate that is lower than the highest rate it charges in any transaction not involving its marketing affiliate.

        (iii) The pipeline may not file a revised or new rate designed to recover costs not recovered under rates previously in effect.

        (3) Current U.S. Geological Survey 7.5-minute series topographical maps showing the location of the facilities; and

        (4) A description of the procedures to be used for erosion control, revegetation and maintenance, and stream and wetland crossings.

        (d)  On or before May 1 of each year, a company must file (on electronic media pursuant to § 385.2011 of this chapter, accompanied by 7 paper copies) an annual report that lists for the previous calendar year each activity that is described in paragraph (a) of this section, and which was completed during the previous calendar year and exempt from the advance notification requirement pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this section. For each such activity, the company must include all of the information described in paragraph (c) of this section.

        (b)  An interstate pipeline that transports gas under subparts B or G of this part must comply with the following requirements. The regulations in this paragraph adopt the abbreviations and definitions contained in the North American Energy Standards Board Wholesale Gas Quadrant standards incorporated by reference in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.

        (1) Nominations.

        (i) Intra-day nominations.

        (A) A pipeline must give scheduling priority to an intra-day nomination submitted by a firm shipper over nominated and scheduled volumes for interruptible shippers. When an interruptible shipper's scheduled volumes are to be reduced as a result of an intra-day nomination by a firm shipper, the interruptible shipper must be provided with advance notice of such reduction and must be notified whether penalties will apply on the day its volumes are reduced.

        (B) An intra-day nomination submitted on the day prior to gas flow will take effect at the start of the gas day at 9 a.m. CCT.

        (ii)  (A) Pipelines must permit shippers acquiring released capacity to submit a nomination at the earliest available nomination opportunity after the acquisition of capacity. If the pipeline requires the replacement shipper to enter into a contract, the contract must be issued within one hour after the pipeline has been notified of the release, but the requirement for contracting must not inhibit the ability of the replacement shipper to submit a nomination at the earliest available nomination opportunity.

        (B) A pipeline must permit releasing shippers, as a condition of a capacity release, to recall released capacity and renominate such recalled capacity at each nomination opportunity. Each replacement shipper must be provided with advance notice of such recall and must be notified whether penalties will apply on the day its volumes are reduced.

        (iii) Within 60 days after a shipper request, a pipeline must file to make appropriate tariff changes at the Commission to allow multiple shippers associated with a designated agent or asset manager to be jointly and severally liable under a single firm transportation service agreement, subject to reasonable terms and conditions.

        (2)  (i)  A pipeline must enter into Operational Balancing Agreements at all points of interconnection between its system and the system of another interstate or intrastate pipeline.

        (ii)  A pipeline must establish provisions permitting shippers and their agents to offset imbalances accruing on different contracts held by the shipper with the pipeline and to trade imbalances with other shippers where such imbalances have similar operational impact on the pipeline's system.

        (iii)  A pipeline with imbalance penalty provisions in its tariff must provide, to the extent operationally practicable, parking and lending or other services that facilitate the ability of its shippers to manage transportation imbalances. A pipeline also must provide its shippers the opportunity to obtain similar imbalance management services from other providers and shall provide those shippers using other providers access to transportation and other pipeline services without undue discrimination or preference.

        (iv)  A pipeline must take all reasonable actions to minimize the issuance and adverse impacts of operational flow orders (OFOs) or other measures taken to respond to adverse operational events on its system. A pipeline must set forth in its tariff clear standards for when such measures will begin and end and must provide timely information that will enable shippers to minimize the adverse impacts of these measures.

        (v)  A pipeline may include in its tariff transportation penalties only to the extent necessary to prevent the impairment of reliable service. Pipelines may not retain net penalty revenues, but must credit them to shippers in a manner to be prescribed in the pipeline's tariff. A pipeline with penalty provisions in its tariff must provide to shippers, on a timely basis, as much information as possible about the imbalance and overrun status of each shipper and the imbalance of the pipeline's system.

        (3)  (i)(A) All electronic information provided and electronic transactions conducted by a pipeline must be provided on the public Internet. A pipeline must provide, upon request, private network connections using internet tools, internet directory services, and internet communication protocols and must provide these networks with non-discriminatory access to all electronic information. A pipeline may charge a reasonable fee to recover the costs of providing such an interconnection.

        (B) A pipeline must implement this requirement no later than June 1, 2000.

        (ii) A pipeline must comply with the following requirements for documents constituting public information posted on the pipeline web site:

        (A) The documents must be accessible to the public over the public Internet using commercially available web browsers, without imposition of a password or other access requirement;

        (B) Users must be able to search an entire document online for selected words, and must be able to copy selected portions of the documents; and

        (C) Documents on the web site should be directly downloadable without the need for users to first view the documents on the web site.

        (iii) If a pipeline uses a numeric or other designation to represent information, an electronic cross-reference table between the numeric or other designation and the information represented must be available to users, at a cost not to exceed reasonable shipping and handling.

        (iv) A pipeline must provide the same content for all information regardless of the electronic format in which it is provided.

#### § § 284.123

        (a)  Rates and charges for transportation of natural gas authorized under § 284.122(a) shall be fair and equitable as determined in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.

        (b)  (1) Subject to the conditions in §§ 284.7 and 284.9 of this chapter, an intrastate pipeline may elect to:

        (i) Base its rates upon the methodology used:

        (A) In designing rates to recover the cost of gathering, treatment, processing, transportation, delivery or similar service (including storage service) included in one of its then effective firm sales rate schedules for city-gate service on file with the appropriate state regulatory agency; or

        (B) In determining the allowance permitted by the appropriate state regulatory agency to be included in a natural gas distributor's rates for city-gate natural gas service; or

        (ii) To use the rates contained in one of its then effective transportation rate schedules for intrastate service on file with the appropriate state regulatory agency which the intrastate pipeline determines covers service comparable to service under this subpart.

        (2)(i) If an intrastate pipeline does not choose to make any election under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, it shall apply for Commission approval, by order, of the proposed rates and charges by filing with the Commission the proposed rates and charges, and information showing the proposed rates and charges are fair and equitable. Each petition for approval filed under this paragraph must be accompanied by the fee set forth in § 381.403 or by a petition for waiver pursuant to § 384.106 of this chapter.

        (ii) 150 days after the date on which the Commission received an application filed pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, the rate proposed in the application will be deemed to be fair and equitable and not in excess of an amount which interstate pipelines would be permitted to charge for providing similar transportation service, unless within the 150 day period, the Commission either extends the time for action, or institutes a proceeding in which all interested parties will be afforded an opportunity for written comments and for the oral presentation of views, data and arguments. In such proceeding, the Commission either will approve the rate or disapprove the rate and order refund, with interest, of any amount which has been determined to be in excess of those shown to be fair and equitable or in excess of the rates and charges which interstate pipelines would be permitted to charge for providing similar transportation service.

        (iii) A Commission order approving or disapproving a transportation rate under this paragraph supersedes a rate determined in accordance with paragraph (b)(1) of this section.

        (c)  The Commission presumes that all revenues received by an intrastate pipeline in connection with transportation authorized under § 284.122(a) and computed in accordance with paragraph (b)(1) of this section have been or will be taken into account by the appropriate state regulatory agency for purposes of establishing transportation charges by the intrastate pipeline for service to intrastate customers.

        (d)  If the intrastate pipeline is charging a rate computed pursuant to § 284.123(b)(1), the rate charged is presumed to be:

        (1) Fair and equitable; and

        (2) Not in excess of the rates and charges which interstate pipelines would be permitted to charge for providing similar transportation service.

        (9)  Rates of pipelines approved by the Commission pursuant to this paragraph are required to be periodically reviewed.

        (i) Any intrastate pipeline with rates so approved must file an application for rate approval under this section on or before the date five years following the date it filed the application for authorization of rates pursuant to this paragraph. Any Hinshaw pipeline that has been a granted a blanket certificate under § 284.224 of this chapter and with rates approved pursuant to this paragraph must on or before the date five years following the date it filed the application for authorization of the rates pursuant to this paragraph either file under this section cost, throughput, revenue and other data, in the form specified in § 154.313 of this chapter, to allow the Commission to determine whether any change in rates is required pursuant to section 5 of the Natural Gas Act or an application for rate authorization pursuant to this section.

        (ii) An intrastate pipeline with rates approved pursuant to the rate election in paragraph (b)(1) of this section that remain unchanged during the five-year review period which were approved based on then effective state rates may file a certification with the Commission pursuant to this paragraph (g) that the rates continue to comply on the same basis with the requirements set forth in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. Such certification of rates will meet the periodic rate review requirement set forth in this paragraph (g)(9) unless the Commission determines that further proceedings concerning the rates are appropriate.

        (iii) If the state rate used pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section for approval of a rate pursuant to this paragraph (g) is changed, not later than 30 days after that changed rate becomes effective, the intrastate pipeline must file a new rate election pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section.

        (10)  A pipeline may, pursuant to paragraph (h) of this section, withdraw in its entirety a filing made pursuant to paragraph (g) that has not been approved by filing a withdrawal motion with the Commission. A filing that is withdrawn will not fulfill the requirements under paragraph (g)(8) of this section.

        (h)  A pipeline may withdraw in its entirety a filing pursuant to this section that has not been approved by filing a withdrawal motion with the Commission.

        (1) The withdrawal motion must state that any amounts collected subject to refund in excess of the rates authorized the Commission will be refunded with interest calculated and a refund report filed with the Commission in accordance with § 154.501 of this chapter. The refunds must be made within 60 days of the date the withdrawal motion becomes effective.

        (2) The withdrawal motion will become effective, and the filing will be deemed withdrawn at the end of 15 days from the date of filing of the withdrawal motion, if no order disallowing the motion is issued within that period. If an answer in opposition is filed within the 15-day period, the withdrawal is not effective until an order accepting the withdrawal is issued.

#### § § 286.104

        Upon issuance of a Commission order that notes a finding or findings, with or without proposed remedies, with which the audited person has disagreed, the audited person may: Acquiesce in the findings and proposed remedies by not timely responding to the Commission order, in which case the Commission may issue an order approving them or taking other action; or challenge the finding or findings and any proposed remedies with which it disagreed by timely notifying the Commission in writing that it requests Commission review by means of a shortened procedure, or, if there are material facts in dispute which require cross-examination, a trial-type hearing.

        § 286.105   Shortened procedure.

#### § § 286.105

        If the audited person subject to a Commission order described in § 286.103 notifies the Commission that it seeks to challenge one or more audit findings, or proposed remedies, or both, in any combination, by the shortened procedure, the Commission shall thereupon issue a notice setting a schedule for the filing of memoranda. The person electing the use of the shortened procedure, and any other interested entities, including the Commission staff, shall file, within 45 days of the notice, an initial memorandum that addresses the relevant facts and applicable law that support the position or positions taken regarding the matters at issue. Reply memoranda shall be filed within 20 days of the date by which the initial memoranda are due to be filed. Only participants who filed initial memoranda may file reply memoranda. Subpart T of part 385 of this chapter shall apply to all filings. Within 20 days after the last date that reply memoranda under the shortened procedure may be timely filed, the audited person who elected the shortened procedure may file a motion with the Commission requesting a trial-type hearing if new issues are raised by a party. To prevail in such a motion, the audited person must show that a party to the shortened procedure raised one or more new issues of material fact relevant to resolution of a matter in the shortened procedure such that fundamental fairness requires a trial-type hearing to resolve the new issue or issues so raised. Parties to the shortened procedure and the Commission staff may file responses to the motion. In ruling upon the motion, the Commission may determine that some or all of the issues be litigated in a trial-type hearing.

        § 286.106   Form and style.

        § 292.207   Procedures for obtaining qualifying status.

#### § § 292.207

        (a) —(1)  The qualifying facility status of an existing or a proposed facility that meets the requirements of § 292.203 may be self-certified by the owner or operator of the facility or its representative by properly completing a FERC Form No. 556 and filing that form with the Commission, pursuant to § 131.80 of this chapter, and complying with paragraph (e) of this section.

        (2)  For small power production facilities pursuant to § 292.204, the owner or operator of the facility or its representative may, when completing the FERC Form No. 556, provide information asserting factors showing that the facility for which qualification or recertification is sought is at a separate site from other facilities using the same energy resource and owned by the same person(s) or its affiliates.

        (3)  Self-certification and self-recertification are effective upon filing. If no protests to a self-certification or self-recertification are timely filed pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section, no further action by the Commission is required for a self-certification or self-recertification to be effective. If protests to a self-certification or self-recertification are timely filed pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section, a self-certification or self-recertification will remain effective until the Commission issues an order revoking QF certification. The Commission will act on the protest within 90 days from the date the protest is filed; provided that, if the Commission requests more information from the protester, the entity seeking qualification or recertification, or both, the time for the Commission to act will be extended to 60 days from the filing of a complete answer to the information request. In addition to any extension resulting from a request for information, the Commission also may toll the 90-day period for one additional 60-day period if so required to rule on a protest. Authority to toll the 90-day period for this purpose is delegated to the Secretary or the Secretary's designee. Absent Commission action before the expiration of the tolling period, a protest will be deemed denied, and the self-certification or self-recertification will remain effective.

        (b) ——(1)  In lieu of the self-certification procedures in paragraph (a) of this section, an owner or operator of an existing or a proposed facility, or its representative, may file with the Commission an application for _Commission certification_ that the facility is a qualifying facility. The application must be accompanied by the fee prescribed by part 381 of this chapter, and the applicant for Commission certification must comply with paragraph (c) of this section.

        (2)  The application must include a properly completed FERC Form No. 556 pursuant to § 131.80 of this chapter. For small power production facilities pursuant to § 292.204, the owner or operator of the facility or its representative may, when completing the FERC Form No. 556, provide information asserting factors showing that the facility for which qualification is sought is at a separate site from other facilities using the same energy resource and owned by the same person(s) or its affiliates.

        (3)  (i) Within 90 days of the later of the filing of an application or the filing of a supplement, amendment or other change to the application, the Commission will either: Inform the applicant that the application is deficient; or issue an order granting or denying the application; or toll the time for issuance of an order. Any order denying certification shall identify the specific requirements which were not met. If the Commission does not act within 90 days of the date of the latest filing, the application shall be deemed to have been granted.

        (ii) For purposes of paragraph (b) of this section, the date an application is filed is the date by which the Office of the Secretary has received all of the information and the appropriate filing fee necessary to comply with the requirements of this Part.

        (c) —(1)  Any person, as defined in § 385.102(d) of this chapter, who opposes either a self-certification or self-recertification making substantive changes to the existing certification filed pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section or an application for Commission certification or Commission recertification making substantive changes to the existing certification filed pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section for which qualification or recertification is filed on or after December 31, 2020, may file a protest with the Commission. Any protest to and any intervention in a self-certification or self-recertification must be filed in accordance with §§ 385.211 and 385.214 of this chapter, on or before 30 days from the date the self-certification or self-recertification is filed. Any protestor must concurrently serve a copy of such filing pursuant to § 385.211 of this chapter. Any protest must be adequately supported, and provide any supporting documents, contracts, or affidavits to substantiate the claims in the protest.

        (2)  Protests may be filed to any initial self-certification or application for Commission certification filed on or after the effective date of this final rule, and to any self-recertification or application for Commission recertification that are filed on or after December 31, 2020 that makes substantive changes to the existing certification. Once the Commission has certified an applicant's qualifying facility status either in response to a protest opposing a self-certification or self-recertification, or in response to an application for Commission certification or Commission recertification, any later protest to a self-recertification or application for Commission recertification making substantive changes to a qualifying facility's certification must demonstrate changed circumstances that call into question the continued validity of the certification.

        (d)  Any response to a protest must be filed on or before 30 days from the date of filing of that protest and will be allowed under § 385.213(a)(2) of this chapter.

        (e) —(1)  An applicant filing a self-certification, self-recertification, application for Commission certification or application for Commission recertification of the qualifying status of its facility must concurrently serve a copy of such filing on each electric utility with which it expects to interconnect, transmit or sell electric energy to, or purchase supplementary, standby, back-up or maintenance power from, and the State regulatory authority of each state where the facility and each affected electric utility is located. The Commission will publish a notice in the  for each application for Commission certification and for each self-certification of a cogeneration facility that is subject to the requirements of § 292.205(d).

        (2) Facilities of 500 kW or more. An electric utility is not required to purchase electric energy from a facility with a net power production capacity of 500 kW or more until 90 days after the facility notifies the facility that it is a qualifying facility or 90 days after the utility meets the notice requirements in paragraph (c)(1) of this section.

        (f)  (1)(i) If a qualifying facility fails to conform with any material facts or representations presented by the cogenerator or small power producer in its submittals to the Commission, the notice of self-certification or Commission order certifying the qualifying status of the facility may no longer be relied upon. At that point, if the facility continues to conform to the Commission's qualifying criteria under this part, the cogenerator or small power producer may file either a notice of self-recertification of qualifying status pursuant to the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section, or an application for Commission recertification pursuant to the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section, as appropriate.

        (ii) The Commission may, on its own motion or on the motion of any person, revoke the qualifying status of a facility that has been certified under paragraph (b) of this section, if the facility fails to conform to any of the Commission's qualifying facility criteria under this part.

        (iii) The Commission may, on its own motion or on the motion of any person, revoke the qualifying status of a self-certified or self-recertified qualifying facility if it finds that the self-certified or self-recertified qualifying facility does not meet the applicable requirements for qualifying facilities.

        (2) Prior to undertaking any substantial alteration or modification of a qualifying facility which has been certified under paragraph (b) of this section, a small power producer or cogenerator may apply to the Commission for a determination that the proposed alteration or modification will not result in a revocation of qualifying status. This application for Commission recertification of qualifying status should be submitted in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.

        § 292.211   Petition for initial determination on whether a project has a substantial adverse effect on the environment (AEE petition).

#### § § 292.211

        (a) An applicant that has filed a petition under § 292.210 may also file an AEE petition with the Commission for an initial determination on whether the project satisfies the requirement that it has no substantial adverse effect on the environment as specified in § 292.208(b)(1).

        (b) The filing of the AEE petition does not relieve the applicant of the filing requirements of § 292.208(c).

        (c) The Commission will act on the AEE petition only if the Commission has granted the applicant's commitment of resources petition under § 292.210.

        (d)  The applicant may file the AEE petition with the application for license or exemption or at any time before the Commission issues the license or exemption.

        (e)  The AEE petition must identify the project and request that the Commission make an initial determination on the adverse environmental effects requirements in § 292.208(b)(1).

        (f) The Director of the Office of Energy Projects will make the initial determination on the AEE petition. In making this determination, the Director will consider the following:

        (1) Any proposed mitigative measures;

        (2) The consistency of the proposal with local, regional, and national resource plans and programs;

        (3) The mandatory terms and conditions of fish and wildlife agencies under section 210(j) of PURPA, or section 30(c) of the Federal Power Act; or the recommended terms and conditions of fish a wildlife agencies under Section 10(j) of the Federal Power Act, whichever is appropriate; and

        (4) Any other information which the Director believes is relevant to consider.

        (g)  The Director of the Office of Energy Projects will make the initial determination on the AEE petition after the close of the public notice period for the accepted application. If the Director's initial determination finds:

        (1) No substantial adverse effect on the environment, the Commission must wait at least 45 days before making a final determination that the project satisfies the requirements of § 292.208(b)(1).

        (2) A substantial adverse effect on the environment, the applicant may file, within 90 days of the initial finding that the project does not satisfy the requirements in § 292.208(b)(1), proposed measures to mitigate the adverse environmental effects found.

        (3)(i) The Commission will provide written notice of the Director's initial finding on the petition to the applicant, to the federal and state agencies that the applicant must consult under § 4.38 of this chapter and to any intervenors in the proceeding.

        (ii) The Commission will publish notice of the Director's initial finding in the

        (h)  (1) The Commission will issue notice of the mitigative measures filed by an applicant under paragraph (g)(2) of this section and will publish the notice in the  The mitigative measures will be on file and available to inspect or to download on the Commission's website,

        (2) The Commission will provide the State and interested persons within 90 days from the date the notice is issued to review and submit comments on the mitigative measures. The applicant for license or exemption has 15 days after the expiration of the public comment period to respond to the comments filed with the Commission.

        (i)  The proposed mitigative measures filed under paragraph (g)(2) of this section will not be considered a material amendment to the application unless the Commission finds that the proposed measures are unnecessary to, or exceed the scope of, mitigating substantial adverse effects. If the Commission finds the proposed mitigative measures constitute a material amendment, the application will be considered filed with the Commission on the date on which the applicant filed the proposed mitigative measures, and all other provisions of § 4.35(a) of this chapter will apply.

        (j)  The Commission will make a final determination on the petition at the time the Commission issues a license or exemption for the project.

        (k)  (1) If, between the Commission's initial and final findings on the AEE petition, the State does not take any action under § 292.208(b)(2), the failure to take action can be the basis for a presumption that there is not substantial adverse effect on the environment (as that term is defined in § 292.202(q)).

        (2) If the presumption in paragraph (k)(1) of this section comes into effect, it:

        (i) Is only available for those adverse effects related to the natural, recreational, cultural, or scenic attributes of the environment;

        (ii) Can only operate during the time between the Commission's initial and final findings on the AEE petition; and

        (iii) Has no affect on the Commission's independent obligation to find that the project will not have a substantial adverse effect on the environment under § 292.208(b)(1).

        (3) The presumption in paragraph (k)(1) of this section does not take effect if the State, the Commission or an interested person demonstrates that the State has acted to protect the natural watercourse under § 292.208(b)(2).

        (4) The presumption in paragraph (k)(1) of this section can be rebutted if:

        (i) The Commission determines that the project will have a substantial adverse effect on the environment related to the environmental attributes listed in paragraph (k)(2)(i) of this section; or

        (ii) Any interested person, including a State, demonstrates that the project will have a substantial adverse effect on the environment related to the environmental attributes listed in paragraph (k)(2)(i) of this section.

**Source:** Source: Order 69, 45 FR 12234, Feb. 25, 1980, unless otherwise noted.

        § 292.301   Scope.

#### § § 292.301

        (a)  This subpart applies to the regulation of sales and purchases between qualifying facilities and electric utilities.

        (b)  Nothing in this subpart:

        (1) Limits the authority of any electric utility or any qualifying facility to agree to a rate for any purchase, or terms or conditions relating to any purchase, which differ from the rate or terms or conditions which would otherwise be required by this subpart; or

        (2) Affects the validity of any contract entered into between a qualifying facility and an electric utility for any purchase.

        § 292.302   Availability of electric utility system cost data.

#### § § 292.302

        (a)  (1) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, paragraph (b) applies to each electric utility, in any calendar year, if the total sales of electric energy by such utility for purposes other than resale exceeded 500 million kilowatt-hours during any calendar year beginning after December 31, 1975, and before the immediately preceding calendar year.

        (2) Each utility having total sales of electric energy for purposes other than resale of less than one billion kilowatt-hours during any calendar year beginning after December 31, 1975, and before the immediately preceding year, shall not be subject to the provisions of this section until June 30, 1982.

        (b)  To make available data from which avoided costs may be derived, not later than November 1, 1980, June 30, 1982, and not less often than every two years thereafter, each regulated electric utility described in paragraph (a) of this section shall provide to its State regulatory authority, and shall maintain for public inspection, and each nonregulated electric utility described in paragraph (a) of this section shall maintain for public inspection, the following data:

        (1) The estimated avoided cost on the electric utility's system, solely with respect to the energy component, for various levels of purchases from qualifying facilities. Such levels of purchases shall be stated in blocks of not more than 100 megawatts for systems with peak demand of 1000 megawatts or more, and in blocks equivalent to not more than 10 percent of the system peak demand for systems of less than 1000 megawatts. The avoided costs shall be stated on a cents per kilowatt-hour basis, during daily and seasonal peak and off-peak periods, by year, for the current calendar year and each of the next 5 years;

        (2) The electric utility's plan for the addition of capacity by amount and type, for purchases of firm energy and capacity, and for capacity retirements for each year during the succeeding 10 years; and

        (3) The estimated capacity costs at completion of the planned capacity additions and planned capacity firm purchases, on the basis of dollars per kilowatt, and the associated energy costs of each unit, expressed in cents per kilowatt hour. These costs shall be expressed in terms of individual generating units and of individual planned firm purchases.

        (c)  (1) Each electric utility (other than any electric utility to which paragraph (b) of this section applies) shall, upon request:

        (i) Provide comparable data to that required under paragraph (b) of this section to enable qualifying facilities to estimate the electric utility's avoided costs for periods described in paragraph (b) of this section; or

        (ii) With regard to an electric utility which is legally obligated to obtain all its requirements for electric energy and capacity from another electric utility, provide the data of its supplying utility and the rates at which it currently purchases such energy and capacity.

        (2) If any such electric utility fails to provide such information on request, the qualifying facility may apply to the State regulatory authority (which has ratemaking authority over the electric utility) or the Commission for an order requiring that the information be provided.

        (d)  (1) After public notice in the area served by the electric utility, and after opportunity for public comment, any State regulatory authority may require (with respect to any electric utility over which it has ratemaking authority), or any non-regulated electric utility may provide, data different than those which are otherwise required by this section if it determines that avoided costs can be derived from such data.

        (2) Any State regulatory authority (with respect to any electric utility over which it has ratemaking authority) or nonregulated utility which requires such different data shall notify the Commission within 30 days of making such determination.

        (e)  (1) Any data submitted by an electric utility under this section shall be subject to review by the State regulatory authority which has ratemaking authority over such electric utility.

        (2) In any such review, the electric utility has the burden of coming forward with justification for its data.

        § 292.303   Electric utility obligations under this subpart.

#### § § 292.303

        (a)  Each electric utility shall purchase, in accordance with § 292.304, unless exempted by § 292.309 and § 292.310, any energy and capacity which is made available from a qualifying facility:

        (1) Directly to the electric utility; or

        (2) Indirectly to the electric utility in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section.

        (b)  Each electric utility shall sell to any qualifying facility, in accordance with § 292.305, unless exempted by § 292.312, energy and capacity requested by the qualifying facility.

        (c)  (1) Subject to paragraph (c)(2) of this section, any electric utility shall make such interconnection with any qualifying facility as may be necessary to accomplish purchases or sales under this subpart. The obligation to pay for any interconnection costs shall be determined in accordance with § 292.306.

        (2) No electric utility is required to interconnect with any qualifying facility if, solely by reason of purchases or sales over the interconnection, the electric utility would become subject to regulation as a public utility under part II of the Federal Power Act.

        (d)  If a qualifying facility agrees, an electric utility which would otherwise be obligated to purchase energy or capacity from such qualifying facility may transmit the energy or capacity to any other electric utility. Any electric utility to which such energy or capacity is transmitted shall purchase such energy or capacity under this subpart as if the qualifying facility were supplying energy or capacity directly to such electric utility. The rate for purchase by the electric utility to which such energy is transmitted shall be adjusted up or down to reflect line losses pursuant to § 292.304(e)(4) and shall not include any charges for transmission.

        (e)  Each electric utility shall offer to operate in parallel with a qualifying facility, provided that the qualifying facility complies with any applicable standards established in accordance with § 292.308.

        § 292.304   Rates for purchases.

#### § § 292.304

        (a)  (1) Rates for purchases shall:

        (i) Be just and reasonable to the electric consumer of the electric utility and in the public interest; and

        (ii) Not discriminate against qualifying cogeneration and small power production facilities.

        (2) Nothing in this subpart requires any electric utility to pay more than the avoided costs for purchases.

        (b)  (1) For purposes of this paragraph, “new capacity” means any purchase from capacity of a qualifying facility, construction of which was commenced on or after November 9, 1978.

        (2) Subject to paragraph (b)(3) of this section, a rate for purchases satisfies the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section if the rate equals the avoided costs determined after consideration of the factors set forth in paragraph (e) of this section

        (3) A rate for purchases (other than from new capacity) may be less than the avoided cost if the State regulatory authority (with respect to any electric utility over which it has ratemaking authority) or the nonregulated electric utility determines that a lower rate is consistent with paragraph (a) of this section, and is sufficient to encourage cogeneration and small power production.

        (4) Rates for purchases from new capacity shall be in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section, regardless of whether the electric utility making such purchases is simultaneously making sales to the qualifying facility.

        (5) In the case in which the rates for purchases are based upon estimates of avoided costs over the specific term of the contract or other legally enforceable obligation, the rates for such purchases do not violate this subpart if the rates for such purchases differ from avoided costs at the time of delivery.

        (6)  There is a rebuttable presumption that a state regulatory authority or nonregulated electric utility may use a Locational Marginal Price as a rate for as-available qualifying facility energy sales to electric utilities located in a market defined in § 292.309(e), (f), or (g).

        (7)  A state regulatory authority or nonregulated electric utility may use a Competitive Price as a rate for as-available qualifying facility energy sales to electric utilities located outside a market defined in § 292.309(e), (f), or (g). A Competitive Price may be either a Market Hub Price or a Combined Cycle Price, determined as follows:

        (i) A  is a price established at a liquid market hub which a state regulatory authority or nonregulated electric utility determines represents an appropriate measure of the electric utility's avoided cost for as-available energy, and is a hub to which the electric utility has reasonable access, based on an evaluation by the state regulatory authority or nonregulated electric utility of the relevant factors, including but not limited to the following:

        (A) Whether the hub is sufficiently liquid that prices at the hub represent a competitive price;

        (B) Whether prices developed at the hub are sufficiently transparent;

        (C) Whether the electric utility has the ability to deliver power from such hub to its load, even if its load is not directly connected to the hub; and

        (D) Whether the hub represents an appropriate market to derive an energy price for the electric utility's purchases from the relevant qualifying facility given the electric utility's physical proximity to the hub or other factors.

        (ii) A  is a price determined pursuant to a formula established by a state regulatory authority or nonregulated electric utility using published natural gas price indices, a proxy heat rate, and variable operations and maintenance costs for an efficient natural gas combined-cycle generating facility. Before establishing such a formula rate, a state regulatory authority or nonregulated electric utility must determine that the resulting _Combined Cycle Price_ represents an appropriate measure of the purchasing electric utility's avoided cost for energy, based on its evaluation of the relevant factors, including but not limited to the following:

        (A) Whether the cost of energy from an efficient natural gas combined cycle generating facility represents a reasonable measure of a competitive price in the purchasing electric utility's region;

        (B) Whether natural gas priced pursuant to particular proposed natural gas price indices would be available in the relevant market;

        (C) Whether there should be an adjustment to the natural gas price to appropriately reflect the cost of transporting natural gas to the relevant market; and

        (D) Whether the proxy heat rate used in the formula should be updated regularly to reflect improvements in generation technology.

        (8)  (i) A state regulatory authority or nonregulated electric utility may use a price determined pursuant to a competitive solicitation process to establish qualifying facility energy and/or capacity rates for sales to electric utilities, provided that such competitive solicitation process is conducted pursuant to procedures ensuring the solicitation is conducted in a transparent and non-discriminatory manner including, but not limited to, the following:

        (A) The solicitation process is an open and transparent process that includes, but is not limited to, providing equally to all potential bidders substantial and meaningful information regarding transmission constraints, levels of congestion, and interconnections, subject to appropriate confidentiality safeguards;

        (B) Solicitations are open to all sources, to satisfy that electric utility's capacity needs, taking into account the required operating characteristics of the needed capacity;

        (C) Solicitations are conducted at regular intervals;

        (D) Solicitations are subject to oversight by an independent administrator; and

        (E) Solicitations are certified as fulfilling the above criteria by the relevant state regulatory authority or nonregulated electric utility through a post-solicitation report.

        (ii) To the extent that the electric utility procures all of its capacity, including capacity resources constructed or otherwise acquired by the electric utility, through a competitive solicitation process conducted pursuant to paragraph (b)(8)(i) of this section, the electric utility shall be presumed to have no avoided capacity costs unless and until it determines to acquire capacity outside of such competitive solicitation process. However, the electric utility shall nevertheless be required to purchase energy from qualifying small power producers and qualifying cogeneration facilities.

        (iii) To the extent that the electric utility does not procure all of its capacity through a competitive solicitation process conducted pursuant to paragraph (b)(8)(i) of this section, then there shall be no presumption that the electric utility has no avoided capacity costs.

        (c)  (1) There shall be put into effect (with respect to each electric utility) standard rates for purchases from qualifying facilities with a design capacity of 100 kilowatts or less.

        (2) There may be put into effect standard rates for purchases from qualifying facilities with a design capacity of more than 100 kilowatts.

        (3) The standard rates for purchases under this paragraph:

        (i) Shall be consistent with paragraphs (a) and (e) of this section; and

        (ii) May differentiate among qualifying facilities using various technologies on the basis of the supply characteristics of the different technologies.

        (d)  (1) Each qualifying facility shall have the option either:

        (i) To provide energy as the qualifying facility determines such energy to be available for such purchases, in which case the rates for such purchases shall be based on the electric utility's avoided cost for energy calculated at the time of delivery; or

        (ii) To provide energy or capacity pursuant to a legally enforceable obligation for the delivery of energy or capacity over a specified term, in which case the rates for such purchases shall, except as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, be based on either:

        (A) The avoided costs calculated at the time of delivery; or

        (B) The avoided costs calculated at the time the obligation is incurred.

        (iii) The rate for delivery of energy calculated at the time the obligation is incurred may be based on estimates of the present value of the stream of revenue flows of future locational marginal prices, or Competitive Prices during the anticipated period of delivery.

        (2) Notwithstanding paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(B) of this section, a state regulatory authority or nonregulated electric utility may require that rates for purchases of energy from a qualifying facility pursuant to a legally enforceable obligation vary through the life of the obligation, and be set at the electric utility's avoided cost for energy calculated at the time of delivery.

        (3)  A qualifying facility must demonstrate commercial viability and financial commitment to construct its facility pursuant to criteria determined by the state regulatory authority or nonregulated electric utility as a prerequisite to a qualifying facility obtaining a legally enforceable obligation. Such criteria must be objective and reasonable.

        (e)  (1) A state regulatory authority or nonregulated electric utility may establish rates for purchases of energy from a qualifying facility based on a purchasing electric utility's locational marginal price calculated by the applicable market defined in § 292.309(e), (f), or (g), or the purchasing electric utility's applicable Competitive Price. Alternatively, a state regulatory authority or nonregulated electric utility may establish rates for purchases of energy and/or capacity from a qualifying facility based on a Competitive Solicitation Price. To the extent that capacity rates are not set pursuant to this section, capacity rates shall be set pursuant to subsection (2).

        (2) To the extent that a state regulatory authority or nonregulated electric utility does not set energy and/or capacity rates pursuant to paragraph (e)(1) of this section, the following factors shall, to the extent practicable, be taken into account in determining rates for purchases from a qualifying facility:

        (i) The data provided pursuant to § 292.302(b), (c), or (d), including State review of any such data;

        (ii) The availability of capacity or energy from a qualifying facility during the system daily and seasonal peak periods, including:

        (A) The ability of the electric utility to dispatch the qualifying facility;

        (B) The expected or demonstrated reliability of the qualifying facility;

        (C) The terms of any contract or other legally enforceable obligation, including the duration of the obligation, termination notice requirement and sanctions for non-compliance;

        (D) The extent to which scheduled outages of the qualifying facility can be usefully coordinated with scheduled outages of the electric utility's facilities;

        (E) The usefulness of energy and capacity supplied from a qualifying facility during system emergencies, including its ability to separate its load from its generation;

        (F) The individual and aggregate value of energy and capacity from qualifying facilities on the electric utility's system; and

        (G) The smaller capacity increments and the shorter lead times available with additions of capacity from qualifying facilities; and

        (iii) The relationship of the availability of energy or capacity from the qualifying facility as derived in paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section, to the ability of the electric utility to avoid costs, including the deferral of capacity additions and the reduction of fossil fuel use; and

        (iv) The costs or savings resulting from variations in line losses from those that would have existed in the absence of purchases from a qualifying facility, if the purchasing electric utility generated an equivalent amount of energy itself or purchased an equivalent amount of electric energy or capacity.

        (f)  (1) Any electric utility which gives notice pursuant to paragraph (f)(2) of this section will not be required to purchase electric energy or capacity during any period during which, due to operational circumstances, purchases from qualifying facilities will result in costs greater than those which the utility would incur if it did not make such purchases, but instead generated an equivalent amount of energy itself.

        (2) Any electric utility seeking to invoke paragraph (f)(1) of this section must notify, in accordance with applicable State law or regulation, each affected qualifying facility in time for the qualifying facility to cease the delivery of energy or capacity to the electric utility.

        (3) Any electric utility which fails to comply with the provisions of paragraph (f)(2) of this section will be required to pay the same rate for such purchase of energy or capacity as would be required had the period described in paragraph (f)(1) of this section not occurred.

        (4) A claim by an electric utility that such a period has occurred or will occur is subject to such verification by its State regulatory authority as the State regulatory authority determines necessary or appropriate, either before or after the occurrence.

        § 292.305   Rates for sales.

#### § § 292.305

        (a)  (1) Rates for sales:

        (i) Shall be just and reasonable and in the public interest; and

        (ii) Shall not discriminate against any qualifying facility in comparison to rates for sales to other customers served by the electric utility.

        (2) Rates for sales which are based on accurate data and consistent systemwide costing principles shall not be considered to discriminate against any qualifying facility to the extent that such rates apply to the utility's other customers with similar load or other cost-related characteristics.

        (b)  (1) Upon request of a qualifying facility, each electric utility shall provide:

        (i) Supplementary power;

        (ii) Back-up power;

        (iii) Maintenance power; and

        (iv) Interruptible power.

        (2) The State regulatory authority (with respect to any electric utility over which it has ratemaking authority) and the Commission (with respect to any nonregulated electric utility) may waive any requirement of paragraph (b)(1) of this section if, after notice in the area served by the electric utility and after opportunity for public comment, the electric utility demonstrates and the State regulatory authority or the Commission, as the case may be, finds that compliance with such requirement will:

        (i) Impair the electric utility's ability to render adequate service to its customers; or

        (ii) Place an undue burden on the electric utility.

        (c)  The rate for sales of back-up power or maintenance power:

        (1) Shall not be based upon an assumption (unless supported by factual data) that forced outages or other reductions in electric output by all qualifying facilities on an electric utility's system will occur simultaneously, or during the system peak, or both; and

        (2) Shall take into account the extent to which scheduled outages of the qualifying facilities can be usefully coordinated with scheduled outages of the utility's facilities.

        § 292.306   Interconnection costs.

#### § § 292.306

        (a)  Each qualifying facility shall be obligated to pay any interconnection costs which the State regulatory authority (with respect to any electric utility over which it has ratemaking authority) or nonregulated electric utility may assess against the qualifying facility on a nondiscriminatory basis with respect to other customers with similar load characteristics.

        (b)  Each State regulatory authority (with respect to any electric utility over which it has ratemaking authority) and nonregulated utility shall determine the manner for payments of interconnection costs, which may include reimbursement over a reasonable period of time.

        § 292.307   System emergencies.

#### § § 292.307

        (a)  A qualifying facility shall be required to provide energy or capacity to an electric utility during a system emergency only to the extent:

        (1) Provided by agreement between such qualifying facility and electric utility; or

        (2) Ordered under section 202(c) of the Federal Power Act.

        (b)  During any system emergency, an electric utility may discontinue:

        (1) Purchases from a qualifying facility if such purchases would contribute to such emergency; and

        (2) Sales to a qualifying facility, provided that such discontinuance is on a nondiscriminatory basis.

        § 292.308   Standards for operating reliability.

#### § § 292.308

        Any State regulatory authority (with respect to any electric utility over which it has ratemaking authority) or nonregulated electric utility may establish reasonable standards to ensure system safety and reliability of interconnected operations. Such standards may be recommended by any electric utility, any qualifying facility, or any other person. If any State regulatory authority (with respect to any electric utility over which it has ratemaking authority) or nonregulated electric utility establishes such standards, it shall specify the need for such standards on the basis of system safety and reliability.

        § 292.309   Termination of obligation to purchase from qualifying facilities.

#### § § 292.309

        (a) After August 8, 2005, an electric utility shall not be required, under this part, to enter into a new contract or obligation to purchase electric energy from a qualifying cogeneration facility or a qualifying small power production facility if the Commission finds that the qualifying cogeneration facility or qualifying small power facility production has nondiscriminatory access to:

        (1)(i) Independently administered, auction-based day ahead and real time wholesale markets for the sale of electric energy; and

        (ii) Wholesale markets for long-term sales of capacity and electric energy; or

        (2)(i) Transmission and interconnection services that are provided by a Commission-approved regional transmission entity and administered pursuant to an open access transmission tariff that affords nondiscriminatory treatment to all customers; and

        (ii) Competitive wholesale markets that provide a meaningful opportunity to sell capacity, including long-term and short-term sales, and electric energy, including long-term, short-term and real-time sales, to buyers other than the utility to which the qualifying facility is interconnected. In determining whether a meaningful opportunity to sell exists, the Commission shall consider, among other factors, evidence of transactions within the relevant market; or

        (3) Wholesale markets for the sale of capacity and electric energy that are, at a minimum, of comparable competitive quality as markets described in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section.

        (b) For purposes of § 292.309(a), a renewal of a contract that expires by its own terms is a “new contract or obligation” without a continuing obligation to purchase under an expired contract.

        (c) For purposes of paragraphs (a)(1), (2) and (3) of this section, with the exception of paragraph (d) of this section, there is a rebuttable presumption that a qualifying facility has nondiscriminatory access to the market if it is eligible for service under a Commission-approved open access transmission tariff or Commission-filed reciprocity tariff, and Commission-approved interconnection rules.

        (1) If the Commission determines that a market meets the criteria of paragraphs (a)(1), (2) or (3) of this section, and if a qualifying facility in the relevant market is eligible for service under a Commission-approved open access transmission tariff or Commission-filed reciprocity tariff, a qualifying facility may seek to rebut the presumption of access to the market by demonstrating,  that it does not have access to the market because of operational characteristics or transmission constraints.

        (2) For purposes of paragraphs (a)(1), (2), and (3) of this section, a qualifying small power production facility with a capacity between 5 megawatts and 20 megawatts may additionally seek to rebut the presumption of access to the market by demonstrating that it does not have access to the market in light of consideration of other factors, including, but not limited to:

        (i) Specific barriers to connecting to the interstate transmission grid, such as excessively high costs and pancaked delivery rates;

        (ii) Unique circumstances impacting the time or length of interconnection studies or queues to process the small power production facility's interconnection request;

        (iii) A lack of affiliation with entities that participate in the markets in paragraphs (a)(1), (2), and (3) of this section;

        (iv) The qualifying small power production facility has a predominant purpose other than selling electricity and should be treated similarly to qualifying cogeneration facilities;

        (v) The qualifying small power production facility has certain operational characteristics that effectively prevent the qualifying facility's participation in a market; or

        (vi) The qualifying small power production facility lacks access to markets due to transmission constraints. The qualifying small power production facility may show that it is located in an area where persistent transmission constraints in effect cause the qualifying facility not to have access to markets outside a persistently congested area to sell the qualifying facility output or capacity.

        (d)(1) For purposes of paragraphs (a)(1), (2), and (3) of this section, there is a rebuttable presumption that a qualifying cogeneration facility with a capacity at or below 20 megawatts does not have nondiscriminatory access to the market.

        (2) For purposes of paragraphs (a)(1), (2), and (3) of this section, there is a rebuttable presumption that a qualifying small power production facility with a capacity at or below 5 megawatts does not have nondiscriminatory access to the market.

        (3) Nothing in paragraphs (d)(1) through (3) affects the rights the rights or remedies of any party under any contract or obligation, in effect or pending approval before the appropriate State regulatory authority or non-regulated electric utility on or before February 16, 2021, to purchase electric energy or capacity from or to sell electric energy or capacity to a small power production facility between 5 megawatts and 20 megawatts under this Act (including the right to recover costs of purchasing electric energy or capacity).

        (4) For purposes of implementing paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this section, the Commission will not be bound by the standards set forth in § 292.204(a)(2).

        (e) Midcontinent Independent System Operator, Inc. (MISO), PJM Interconnection, L.L.C. (PJM), ISO New England Inc. (ISO-NE), and New York Independent System Operator, Inc. (NYISO) qualify as markets described in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section, and there is a rebuttable presumption that small power production facilities with a capacity greater than 5 megawatts and cogeneration facilities with a capacity greater than 20 megawatts have nondiscriminatory access to those markets through Commission-approved open access transmission tariffs and interconnection rules, and that electric utilities that are members of such regional transmission organizations or independent system operators should be relieved of the obligation to purchase electric energy from the qualifying facilities.

        (1) A qualifying facility above 20 MW may seek to rebut this presumption by demonstrating,  that:

        (i) The qualifying facility has certain operational characteristics that effectively prevent the qualifying facility's participation in a market; or

        (ii) The qualifying facility lacks access to markets due to transmission constraints. The qualifying facility may show that it is located in an area where persistent transmission constraints in effect cause the qualifying facility not to have access to markets outside a persistently congested area to sell the qualifying facility output or capacity.

        (2) A small power producer qualifying facility between 5 megawatts and 20 megawatts may show it does not have access to the market in light of consideration of other factors, including, but not limited to:

        (i) Specific barriers to connecting to the interstate transmission grid, such as excessively high costs and pancaked delivery rates;

        (ii) Unique circumstances impacting the time or length of interconnection studies or queues to process the small power production facility's interconnection request;

        (iii) A lack of affiliation with entities that participate in the markets in section § 292.309(a)(1), (2), and (3);

        (iv) The qualifying small power production facility has a predominant purpose other than selling electricity and should be treated similarly to qualifying cogeneration facilities;

        (v) The qualifying small power production facility has certain operational characteristics that effectively prevent the qualifying facility's participation in a market; or

        (vi) The qualifying small power production facility lacks access to markets due to transmission constraints. The qualifying small power production facility may show that it is located in an area where persistent transmission constraints in effect cause the qualifying facility not to have access to markets outside a persistently congested area to sell the qualifying facility output or capacity.

        (f) The Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) qualifies as a market described in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, and there is a rebuttable presumption that small power production facilities with a capacity greater than five megawatts and cogeneration facilities with a capacity greater than 20 megawatts have nondiscriminatory access to that market through Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUCT) approved open access protocols, and that electric utilities that operate within ERCOT should be relieved of the obligation to purchase electric energy from the qualifying facilities.

        (1) A qualifying facility above 20 MW may seek to rebut this presumption by demonstrating,  that:

        (i) The qualifying facility has certain operational characteristics that effectively prevent the qualifying facility's participation in a market; or

        (ii) The qualifying facility lacks access to markets due to transmission constraints. The qualifying facility may show that it is located in an area where persistent transmission constraints in effect cause the qualifying facility not to have access to markets outside a persistently congested area to sell the qualifying facility output or capacity.

        (2) A small power producer qualifying facility between 5 megawatts and 20 megawatts may show it does not have access to the market in light of consideration of other factors, including, but not limited to:

        (i) Specific barriers to connecting to the interstate transmission grid, such as excessively high costs and pancaked delivery rates;

        (ii) Unique circumstances impacting the time or length of interconnection studies or queues to process the small power production facility's interconnection request;

        (iii) A lack of affiliation with entities that participate in the markets in section § 292.309(a)(1), (2), and (3);

        (iv) The qualifying small power production facility has a predominant purpose other than selling electricity and should be treated similarly to qualifying cogeneration facilities;

        (v) The qualifying small power production facility has certain operational characteristics that effectively prevent the qualifying facility's participation in a market; or

        (vi) The qualifying small power production facility lacks access to markets due to transmission constraints. The qualifying small power production facility may show that it is located in an area where persistent transmission constraints in effect cause the qualifying facility not to have access to markets outside a persistently congested area to sell the qualifying facility output or capacity.

        (g) The California Independent System Operator and Southwest Power Pool, Inc. satisfy the criteria of § 292.309(a)(2)(i).

        (h) No electric utility shall be required, under this part, to enter into a new contract or obligation to purchase from or sell electric energy to a facility that is not an existing qualifying cogeneration facility unless the facility meets the criteria for new qualifying cogeneration facilities established by the Commission in § 292.205.

        (i) For purposes of § 292.309(h), an “existing qualifying cogeneration facility” is a facility that:

        (1) Was a qualifying cogeneration facility on or before August 8, 2005; or

        (2) Had filed with the Commission a notice of self-certification or self-recertification, or an application for Commission certification, under § 292.207 prior to February 2, 2006.

        (j) For purposes of § 292.309(h), a “new qualifying cogeneration facility” is a facility that satisfies the criteria for qualifying cogeneration facilities pursuant to § 292.205.

#### § § 292.310

        (a) An electric utility may file an application with the Commission for relief from the mandatory purchase requirement under § 292.303(a) pursuant to this section on a service territory-wide basis. Such application shall set forth the factual basis upon which relief is requested and describe why the conditions set forth in § 292.309(a)(1), (2) or (3) have been met. After notice, including sufficient notice to potentially affected qualifying cogeneration facilities and qualifying small power production facilities, and an opportunity for comment, the Commission shall make a final determination within 90 days of such application regarding whether the conditions set forth in § 292.309(a)(1), (2) or (3) have been met.

        (b) Sufficient notice shall mean that an electric utility must identify with names and addresses all potentially affected qualifying facilities in an application filed pursuant to paragraph (a).

        (c) An electric utility must submit with its application for each potentially affected qualifying facility: The docket number assigned if the qualifying facility filed for self-certification or an application for Commission certification of qualifying facility status; the net capacity of the qualifying facility; the location of the qualifying facility depicted by state and county, and the name and location of the substation where the qualifying facility is interconnected; the interconnection status of each potentially affected qualifying facility including whether the qualifying facility is interconnected as an energy or a network resource; and the expiration date of the energy and/or capacity agreement between the applicant utility and each potentially affected qualifying facility. All potentially affected qualifying facilities shall include:

        (1) Those qualifying facilities that have existing power purchase contracts with the applicant;

        (2) Other qualifying facilities that sell their output to the applicant or that have pending self-certification or Commission certification with the Commission for qualifying facility status whereby the applicant will be the purchaser of the qualifying facility's output;

        (3) Any developer of generating facilities with whom the applicant has agreed to enter into power purchase contracts, as of the date of the application filed pursuant to this section, or are in discussion, as of the date of the application filed pursuant to this section, with regard to power purchase contacts;

        (4) The developers of facilities that have pending state avoided cost proceedings, as of the date of the application filed pursuant to this section; and

        (5) Any other qualifying facilities that the applicant reasonably believes to be affected by its application filed pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section.

        (d) The following information must be filed with an application:

        (1) Identify whether applicant seeks a finding under the provisions of § 292.309(a)(1), (2), or (3).

        (2) A narrative setting forth the factual basis upon which relief is requested and describing why the conditions set forth in § 292.309(a)(1), (2), or (3) have been met. Applicant should also state in its application whether it is relying on the findings or rebuttable presumptions contained in § 292.309(e), (f) or (g). To the extent applicant seeks relief from the purchase obligation with respect to a qualifying facility 20 megawatts or smaller, and thus seeks to rebut the presumption in § 292.309(d), applicant must also set forth, and submit evidence of, the factual basis supporting its contention that the qualifying facility has nondiscriminatory access to the wholesale markets which are the basis for the applicant's filing.

        (3) Transmission Studies and related information, including:

        (i) The applicant's long-term transmission plan, conducted by applicant, or the RTO, ISO or other relevant entity;

        (ii) Transmission constraints by path, element or other level of comparable detail that have occurred and/or are known and expected to occur, and any proposed mitigation including transmission construction plans;

        (1) Confirm and approve the rate schedules for the period beginning with the date such rates where placed in effect on an interim basis or the effective date requested in the application to the expiration date requested in the application but not to exceed a five-year period, or for such lesser period, as the Commission deems appropriate;

        (2) Remand the filing for further development of the record to support the filed rate schedules;

        (3) Order an evidentiary hearing if there are questions of fact which can not be resolved from the record or through staff evaluation;

        (4) Disapprove the filed rates; or

        (5) Take such other action that the Commission considers appropriate.

        (f)  If the Commission disapproves the rates, the Administrator will be provided a 120-day period, or other period as the Commission may deem appropriate, to prepare substitute rates that resolve the Commission's concerns. If the filed rates have been approved on an interim basis, the rates will continue in effect on an interim basis until the Commission takes final action.

        (g) —(1)  If a rate collected by any power marketing administration on an interim basis exceeds the rate which is confirmed and approved by the Commission as a final rate, the Administrator, pursuant to any conditions established by the Commission, must refund with interest any portion of the rate increase collected during the interim period which exceeds the final rate. The Administrator may make refunds by means of a net energy billing which reflects the value of any overcharge or other appropriate methods.

        (2)  Except as otherwise provided by the Commission, the Administrator must compute any amount of interest based on the revenues collected subject to refund and required to be refunded under this paragraph by using:

        (i) With respect to the rates of the Bonneville Power Administration, the rate of interest or a weighted average of all rates of interest charged to the Bonneville Power Administration by the U.S. Treasury during the period for which the computation is made;

        (ii) With respect to the rates of other Power Marketing Administrations, the rates of interest computed in accordance with the formula contained in DOE Order No. RA 6120.2, available from the Department of Energy (Office of Power Marketing Coordination) and the Power Marketing Administrations.

        (h)  The Commission's Secretary will publish in the  a notice of any action taken under paragraph (e) of this section and will mail the notice to the persons on the Commission's service list.

      § 301.3   Filing procedures.

#### § § 301.3

      (a)  The procedures established by Bonneville's Administrator provide the filing requirements for all Utilities that file an Appendix 1 with Bonneville. Utilities must file Appendix 1s, ASC forecast models, and other required documents with Bonneville in compliance with _Bonneville's ASC review procedures._

      (b)  The Exchange Period will be equal to the term of Bonneville's Rate Period. ASCs will change during the Exchange Period only for the reasons provided in § 301.4.

      § 301.4   Exchange Period Average System Cost determination.

#### § § 301.4

      (a)  (1) This section describes the method Bonneville will use to escalate the Base Period ASC to and through the Exchange Period to calculate the Exchange Period ASC.

      (2) Bonneville will escalate the Bonneville-approved Base Period ASC to the midpoint of the fiscal year for a one-year Rate Period/Exchange Period, and to the midpoint of the two-year period for a two-year Rate Period/Exchange Period to calculate Exchange Period ASCs.

      (3) For purposes of the escalation referenced in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, Bonneville will use the following codes in the ASC forecast model to calculate the Exchange Period ASCs:

      (i) A&G—Administrative and General.

      (ii) CACNT—Customer Account.

      (iii) CD—Construction, Distribution Plant.

      (iv) CONSTANT—Constant.

      (v) CSALES—Customer Sales.

      (vi) CSERVE—Customer Service.

      (vii) COAL—Coal.

      (viii) DMN—Distribution Maintenance.

      (ix) DOPS—Distribution Operations

      (x) HMN—Hydro Maintenance.

      (xi) HOPS—Hydro Operations.

      (xii) INF—Inflation.

      (xiii) NATGAS—Natural Gas.

      (xiv) NFUEL—Nuclear Fuel.

      (xv) NMN—Nuclear Maintenance.

      (xvi) NOPS—Nuclear Operations.

      (xvii) OMN—Other Production Maintenance.

      (xviii) OOPS—Other Production Operations.

      (xix) SNM—Steam Maintenance.

      (xx) SOPS—Steam Operations.

      (xxi) TMN—Transmission Maintenance.

      (xxii) TOPS—Transmission Operations.

      (xxiii) WAGES—Wages.

      (4) Table 1 identifies which codes from paragraph (a)(3) of this section apply to the line items and associated FERC Accounts in the Appendix 1. Bonneville will use Global Insight as the source of data for the escalation codes identified in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, except for the NATGAS and CONSTANT codes. For the NATGAS code identified in paragraph (a)(3)(xiii) of this section, Bonneville will calculate the escalation rate using Bonneville's most current forecast of natural gas prices. The code CONSTANT in paragraph (a)(3)(iv) of this section indicates that no escalation to the Account will be made.

      (5) Bonneville will base the costs of power products purchased from Bonneville on Bonneville's forecast of prices for its products.

      (6) Bonneville will escalate the Public Purpose Charge forward to the midpoint of the Exchange Period by the same rate of growth as total Contract System Load.

      (7) If any of the escalators specified in paragraph (a) of this section are no longer available, Bonneville will designate a replacement source of such escalator(s) that, as near as possible, replicates the results produced by the prior escalator. If a replacement source is not available, Bonneville will use the INF escalation code identified in paragraph (a)(3)(xii) of this section as the replacement escalator.

      (b) —(1)  Bonneville will use the INF escalation code identified in paragraph (a)(3)(xii) of this section to escalate long-term and intermediate-term (as defined by the Commission) firm purchased power costs and long-term and intermediate-term sales for resale revenues.

      (2)  (i) The short-term purchases and short-term sales for resale for the Base Period will be used as the starting values. A Utility will be allowed to include new plant additions, and to use a utility-specific forecast for the price of purchased power and for the price of sales for resale in order to value purchased power expenses and sales for resale revenue to be included in the Exchange Period ASC.

      (ii) Bonneville will use the following method to determine separate market prices to forecast short-term purchased power expenses and sales for resale revenues to calculate Exchange Period ASCs:

      (A) The Utility's average short-term purchased power price and short-term sales for resale price will be calculated for each year for the most recent three years of actual data (Base Period and prior two years).

      (B) The midpoint between the Utility's average short-term purchased power price and the average short-term sales for resale price will be calculated for each of the years in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(A) of this section.

      (C) The percentage spread around the Utility's midpoint between the average short-term purchase power price and short-term sales for resale price will be calculated for each of the years identified in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(A) of this section.

      (D) A weighted average spread for the Utility's most recent three years of actual data (Base Period and prior two years) will be calculated. The following weighting scale will be used:

      () Three (3) times Base Period spread.

      () Two (_2_) times (Base Period minus 1) spread.

      () One (1) time (Base Period minus 2) spread.

      (E) The Base Period midpoint calculated in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(B) of this section will be escalated at the same rate as Bonneville's electric market price forecast.

      (F) The weighted average spread calculated in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(D) of this section will be applied to the escalated midpoint price calculated in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(E) of this section to determine the purchased power price and sales for resale price to value purchased power expenses and sales for resale revenues to be included in the Exchange Period ASC.

      (iii) The method described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section will be used to forecast the electric market price for power purchases needed to meet load growth not met by major resource additions, and to forecast the electric market price for any additional surplus power sales resulting from major resource additions.

      (c)  (1) During the Exchange Period, Bonneville will allow changes to a Utility's ASC to account for major resource additions or reductions that are used to meet a Utility's retail load. These changes, however, must meet the requirements of paragraph (c)(3) of this section and the materiality threshold described in paragraph (c)(4) of this section in order for Bonneville to allow an ASC to change. The ASC reflecting the major resource addition or reduction will be determined by Bonneville in the ASC review process during the Review Period.

      (2) For major resource additions, the change to ASC will become effective when the resource begins commercial operation, or power is received under the purchased power contract. For major resource reductions, the change to ASC will become effective when the resource is sold, retired, or transferred.

      (3) A major resource addition or reduction must be related to one or more of the following categories to be eligible for consideration as a major resource:

      (i) Production or generating resource investments;

      (ii) Transmission investments;

      (iii) Long-term generating contracts;

      (iv) Pollution control and environmental compliance investments relating to generating resources;

      (v) Long-term transmission contracts;

      (vi) Hydroelectric relicensing costs and fees; and

      (vii) Plant rehabilitation investments.

      (4) Major resource additions or reductions that meet the criteria identified in paragraph (c)(3) of this section will be allowed to change a Utility's ASC within an Exchange Period provided that the major resource addition or reduction results in a 2.5 percent or greater change in a Utility's Base Period ASC. Bonneville will allow a Utility to submit stacks of individual resources that, when combined, meet the 2.5 percent or greater materiality threshold, provided, however, that each resource in the stack must result in a change to the Utility's Base Period ASC of 0.5 percent or more.

      (5) At the time the Utility submits its Appendix 1 filing, the Utility will provide its forecast of major resource additions or reductions and all associated costs. The forecast will cover the period from the end of the Base Period to the end of the Exchange Period.

      (6) Bonneville will calculate new transmission wheeling revenues associated with new transmission investment using the following formula:

      (7) The forecast of major resource additions or reduction costs to be included in the Utility's Exchange Period ASC will be reviewed by Bonneville in the ASC review process that is conducted during the Review Period.

      (8) All major resources included in an ASC calculation prior to the start of the Exchange Period will be projected forward to the midpoint of the Exchange Period.

      (9) For each major resource addition or reduction that is forecasted to occur during the Exchange Period, Bonneville will calculate the difference in ASC between the ASC without the major resource addition or reduction and the ASC with the major resource addition or reduction (ASC delta) at the midpoint of the Exchange Period.

      (10) Once the major resource addition or reduction becomes effective, as determined by paragraph (c)(2) of this section, Bonneville will add the ASC delta to the Utility's existing ASC to determine its new ASC.

      (11) For purposes of calculating ratios with Distribution Plant, Bonneville will escalate the Base Period average per-MWh cost of Distribution Plant forward to the midpoint of the Exchange Period, and use the escalated average cost to determine the distribution-related cost of meeting load growth since the Base Period.

      (12) Bonneville will escalate the cost of General Plant, Accounts 389 through 399.1, forward to the midpoint of the Exchange Period by calculating the ratio of each Account's value in the Base Period to the sum of Production, Transmission, and Distribution plant values in the Base Period, and then multiplying the Base Period ratio times the forecasted value for Production, Transmission, and Distribution plant.

      (13) Bonneville will issue procedural rules to ensure the confidentiality of information provided by Utilities regarding any major resource additions or reductions as part of its review process. Bonneville will provide parties with an opportunity to comment on the rules prior to their implementation in the review process. Failure to provide needed information may result in exclusion of the related costs from the Utility's ASC. However, load growth will be assumed to be met with purchases in the wholesale market, as described in paragraph (e) of this section. If the Utility fails to supply confidential resource data, it loses the difference between the cost of the resource and the price of electricity in the wholesale market.

      (d)  All Utilities are required to provide a forecast of their Contract System Load and associated Exchange Load, as well as a current distribution loss analysis as described in Endnote e of Appendix 1, with their Appendix 1 filings. The load forecast for Contract System Load and Exchange Load will start with the Base Period and extend through four (4) years after the Exchange Period. The load forecast for Contract System Load and Exchange Load will be provided on a monthly basis for the Exchange Period.

      (e)  All forecast load growth not met by major resource additions will be met by purchased power at the forecasted utility-specific, short-term purchased power price.

      (1) The Utility's forecast Load Growth will be met with electric market purchases priced at the Utility's forecast short-term purchased power price as determined in paragraph (b) of this section unless the Utility forecasts major resource additions.

      (2) In the event of major resource additions, forecast Load Growth will be met by the major resource(s). If the major resource is less than total forecast load growth, the unmet Load Growth will be met with electric market purchases priced at the Utility's forecast short-term purchased power price.

      (3) In the event the power provided by a major resource exceeds the Utility's forecast Load Growth, the excess power will be used to reduce the Utility's short-term purchases. If short-term power purchases are reduced to zero, any remaining power will be sold as surplus power at the short-term sales for resale price as determined in paragraph (b) of this section.

      (f)  In the event a Utility forecasts that it will acquire a new service territory, or lose a portion of its existing service territory, and the gain or loss of that territory results in a 2.5 percent or greater change to the Utility's Base Period ASC, the Utility must file two Appendix 1 filings with Bonneville as follows:

      (1) First, a Base Period ASC that does not reflect the acquisition or loss of service territory; and

      (2) Second, a Base Period ASC that incorporates the following changes:

      (i) A forecast of the increase or reduction in Contract System Load associated with the acquisition or reduction in service territory.

      (ii) A forecast of the increase or reduction in Contract System Cost associated with the acquisition or reduction of the service territory.

      (iii) A forecast of capital and operating cost increases or reductions associated with the change in service territory.

      (iv) A forecast of the changes in purchased power expenses, sales for resale revenues, and other debits or credits based on the changes in the service territory.

      (3) Because the date of the actual change to the Utility's service territory could differ from the forecast date used to determine the ASC during the Review Period, Bonneville will not adjust the Utility's ASC until the change in service territory takes place.

      (g)  For Consumer-owned Utilities that elect to execute Regional Dialogue CHWM contracts, Bonneville will use the following approach:

      (1) Use the RHWM System Resources as determined in the Tiered Rates Methodology (TRM) process.

      (2) Determine the RHWM Exchange Load.

      (3) Calculate the Utility's Contract System Cost as described in the ASC Methodology.

      (4) Determine the fully allocated cost of resources used to meet Contract System Load that is not met by:

      (i) The lesser of the Utility's RHWM or Forecast New Requirement, plus

      (ii) Existing Resources for CHWM (as defined in the Tiered Rates Methodology).

      (5) RHWM Contract System Cost = Contract System Cost minus fully allocated cost of resources (from paragraph (g)(4) of this section).

      (6) RHWM Average System Cost = RHWM Contract System Cost (from paragraph (g)(5) of this section)/RHWM System Resource (from paragraph (g)(1) of this section).

      (h)  Utilities must file an Appendix 1, including ASC information, by June 1 of each year, as required in § 301.3, for Bonneville's review and determination of a Base Period ASC. Utilities will file multiple, contingent, Base Period ASC filings to reflect changes to service territories as required in paragraph (f) of this section.

      § 301.5   Changes in Average System Cost methodology.

#### § § 301.5

      (a) The Administrator, at his or her discretion, or upon written request from three-quarters of the utilities that are parties to contracts authorized by section 5(c) of the Northwest Power Act, or from three-quarters of Bonneville's preference customers, or from three-quarters of Bonneville's direct-service industrial customers may initiate a consultation process as provided in section 5(c) of the Northwest Power Act. After completion of this process, Bonneville's Administrator may file the new ASC methodology with the Commission.

      (b) The Administrator will not initiate any consultation process until one year of experience has been gained under the then-existing ASC methodology, that is, one year after the then-existing ASC methodology is adopted by Bonneville and approved by the Commission, through interim or final approval, whichever occurs first.

      (c) The Administrator may, from time to time, issue interpretations of the ASC methodology. The Administrator also may modify the functionalization code of any Account to comply with the limitations identified in sections 5(c)(7)(A)-(C) of the Northwest Power Act or to conform to Commission revisions to the Uniform System of Accounts.

      § 301.6   Appendix 1 instructions.

#### § § 301.6

      (a) Appendix 1 is the form on which a Utility reports its Contract System Cost, Contract System Load, and other necessary data for the calculation of ASC. Appendix 1 is an electronic template consisting of seven schedules and several supporting files that must be completed by the Utility in accordance with these instructions and with the provisions of the endnotes following the schedules.

      (b) Appendix 1 filings must be accompanied by an attestation statement of the Chief Financial Officer of the Utility or other responsible official who possesses the financial and accounting knowledge necessary to complete the attestation statement.

      (c) The primary source of data for the Investor-owned Utilities' Appendix 1 filings is the Utility's prior year FERC Form 1 filings with the Commission. Any items not applicable to the Utility must be identified.

      (d) For Consumer-owned Utilities that do not follow the Commission's Uniform System of Accounts, filings must include reconciliation between Utility Accounts and the items allowed as Contract System Cost. In addition, the cost-of-service report must be reviewed by an independent accounting or consulting firm, and must be accompanied by a report from that independent accounting or consulting firm that outlines the review work that was performed in preparing the cost-of-service report along with an assurance statement that the information contained in the cost-of-service report is presented fairly in all material respects.

      (e) The Appendix 1 template is available electronically at  The primary schedules are:

      (1) Schedule 1: Plant Investment/Rate Base

      (2) Schedule 1A: Cash Working Capital

      (3) Schedule 2: Capital Structure and Rate of Return

      (4) Schedule 3: Expenses

      (5) Schedule 3A: Taxes

      (6) Schedule 3B: Other Included Items

      (7) Schedule 4: Average System Cost

      (f) The filing Utility must reference and attach work papers, documentation and other required information that support costs and loads, including details of allocation and functionalization. All references to the Commission's Accounts are to the Commission's Uniform System of Accounts, as amended by subsequent Commission actions. The costs includable in the attached schedules are those includable by reason of the definitions in the Commission's Accounts. If the Commission's Accounts are later revised or renumbered, any changes will be incorporated into the Appendix 1 by reference, except to the extent Bonneville determines that a particular change results in a change in the type of costs allowable for Residential Exchange Program purposes. In that event, Bonneville will address the changes, including escalation rules, in its review process for the following Exchange Period.

      (g) Bonneville may require a Utility to account for all transactions with affiliated entities as though the affiliated entities were owned in whole or in part by the Utility, if necessary, to properly determine and/or functionalize the Utility's costs.

      (h) A Utility operating in more than one Pacific Northwest Jurisdiction must file one Appendix 1.

      (i)(1) A Utility operating in a Jurisdiction within the Pacific Northwest and within Jurisdictions outside the Pacific Northwest must allocate its total system costs among its Jurisdictions within the Pacific Northwest and outside the Pacific Northwest in accord with the same allocation methods and procedures used by the Regulatory Body(ies) to establish Jurisdictional costs and resulting revenue requirements. The Utility's Appendix filing must include details of the allocation.

      (2) The allocation must exclude all costs of additional resources used to meet loads outside the Pacific Northwest, as required by section 5(c)(7) of the Northwest Power Act. All schedule entries and supporting data must be in accord with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles and Practices as these principles and practices apply to the electric utility industry.

      (j) A Utility must file an attestation statement with each Appendix 1 filing and supporting documentation for each Review Period.

      § 301.7   Average System Cost methodology functionalization.

#### § § 301.7

      (a) Functionalization of each Account included in a Utility's ASC must be according to the functionalization prescribed in Table 1,  Direct analysis on an Account may be performed only if Table 1 states specifically that a Utility may perform a direct analysis on the Account, with the exception of conservation costs. Utilities will be able to functionalize all conservation-related costs to Production, regardless of the Account in which they are recorded. The direct analysis must be consistent with the directions provided in this section.

      (b)

      (1) DIRECT—Direct Analysis.

      (2) PROD—Production.

      (3) TRANS—Transmission.

      (4) DIST—Distribution/Other.

      (5) PTD—Production, Transmission, Distribution/Other Ratio.

      (6) TD—Transmission, Distribution/Other Ratio.

      (7) GP—General Plant Ratio.

      (8) GPM—General Plant Maintenance Ratio.

      (9) PTDG—Production, Transmission, Distribution/Other, General Plant Ratio.

      (10) LABOR—Labor Ratio.

      (c)

      (1) Functionalization of certain Accounts may be based on Direct Analysis or with a default ratio associated with that specific Account as shown in Table 1. Once a Utility uses a specific functionalization method for an Account, the Utility may not change the functionalization method for that Account without prior written approval from Bonneville.

      (2) The Utility must submit with its Appendix 1 all work papers, documents, or other materials that demonstrate that the functionalization under its Direct Analysis assigns costs, revenues, debits or credits based upon the actual and/or intended functional use of those items. Failure to submit the documentation will result in the entire account being functionalized to Distribution/Other, or Production, or Transmission, as appropriate.

      (d)  (1) Direct analysis, if allowed or required by Table 1, assigns costs, revenues, debits and credits to the Production, Transmission, and/or Distribution/Other function of the Utility. The only exception to this requirement is for Accounts that include conservation-related costs. Subject to the provisions of paragraph (d)(4) of this section, a Utility may conduct a Direct Analysis on any Account that contains conservation-related costs. The Direct Analysis performed by a Utility is subject to Bonneville review and approval.

      (2) Bonneville will not allow a Utility to use a combination of Direct Analysis and a prescribed functionalization method for the same Account. The Utility can develop and use a functionalization ratio, or use a prescribed functionalization method, if the Utility, through Direct Analysis, can justify how the ratio reflects the functional nature of the costs, revenues, debits, or credits included in any Account.

      (3) A Utility that wishes to include advertising and promotion costs related to conservation will use Direct Analysis.

      (4) If a Utility records conservation costs in an Account that is functionalized to Distribution/Other, the Utility will identify and document the conservation-related costs included in the Account, and the balance of the costs will be functionalized to Distribution/Other. The presence of conservation-related costs in an Account does not authorize the Utility to perform a Direct Analysis on the entire Account. This option allows a Utility to assign conservation costs in the specified Account to Production based on analysis and support from the Utility that demonstrates the cost assignment is appropriate. The Utility must submit with its ASC filing all work papers, documents, and other materials that demonstrate the functionalization contained in its Direct Analysis and assign costs based upon the actual and/or intended functional use of those items. Failure to submit the documentation will result in the entire Account being functionalized to Distribution/Other for all schedules with the exception of items included in Schedule 3B,  where certain Accounts must be functionalized to Production as appropriate.

      (ii) The interest required to be paid under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section shall be compounded quarterly.

      (3) Any pipeline company required to make refunds pursuant to this section shall bear all costs of such refunding.

      (4) If any rate or charge described in paragraph (a) of this section that is found not to be justified by the Commission is shared between two or more pipeline companies, each pipeline company which shared in the unjustified rates or charges is required to refund to the pipeline company that published the tariff, not less than five days prior to the refund date ordered by the Commission under paragraph (c)(1) of this section,

      (i) That portion of the unjustified rates or charges shared, and

      (ii) The appropriate interest as required in paragraph (c)(2) of this section for the period during which the refundable amounts were held.

      § 341.3   Form of tariff.

#### § § 341.3

      (a) Tariffs may be filed either by dividing the tariff into tariff sections or as an entire document.

      (b)  All tariff publications must contain the following information in the following order:

      (1)  The title page of each tariff must contain the following information:

      (i) The FERC tariff number designation, in the upper right hand corner, numbered consecutively, and the FERC tariff number designation of the tariff that is canceled, if any, under it;

      (ii) The corporate name of the carrier;

      (iii) The type of rates,  local, joint, or proportional, and the commodity to which the tariff applies,  crude, petroleum product, or jet fuel;

      (iv) Governing tariffs,  separate “rules and regulations” tariffs, if any;

      (v) The specific Commission order pursuant to which the tariff is issued;

      (vi) The issue date, which must be shown on the lower left side, and the effective date, which must be shown on the lower right side;

      (vii) The expiration date, if applicable;

      (viii) The name of the issuing officer or duly appointed official issuing the tariff, the complete street and mailing address of the carrier, and the name and phone number of the individual responsible for compiling the tariff publication.

      (2)  Tariffs of more than nine pages in length must contain a table of contents. A table of contents is optional for tariffs which are less than 10 pages in length.

      (3)

      (4)

      (5)  These statements must explain the proper application of rates and rules.

      (6)  (i) All rules affecting the rates or the services provided for in the tariff publication must be included. A special rule affecting a particular item or rate must be referred to specifically in that item or in connection with that rate.

      (ii) Each rule must be given a separate item number, (, Item No. 1), and the title of each rule must be distinctive.

      (iii) Except as provided in § 341.10, tariffs may not include any rules that substitute for any rates named in the tariff or found in any other tariff. Rules may not provide that traffic of any nature will be “transported only by special agreement” or any other provision of similar meaning.

      (iv) Rules may be separately published in a general rules tariff when it is not desirable or practicable to include the governing rules in the rate tariff. Rate tariffs that do not contain rules must make specific reference, by FERC Tariff number, to the governing general rules tariff.

      (v) When joint rate tariffs refer to a separate governing rules tariff, such separate tariff must be concurred in by all joint carriers.

      (7)  Rates must be stated explicitly in cents, or in dollars and cents, per barrel or other specified unit. The names or designations of the places from and to which the rates apply must be arranged in a simple and systematic manner. Any related services performed by the carrier in connection with the rates must be clearly identified and explained. Duplicative or conflicting rates for the same service are prohibited.

      (8)  Routing over which the rates apply must be stated so that the actual routes may be ascertained. This may be accomplished by stating that the rates apply via all routes of the carrier except as otherwise specifically stated in the tariff.

      (9)  Reference marks, abbreviations, and note references must be explained at the end of each tariff publication. U.S. Postal Service state abbreviations and other commonly used abbreviations need not be explained.

      (10)

      (i) All tariff publications must identify where changes have been made in existing rates or charges, rules, regulations or practices, or classifications. One of the following letter designations or uniform symbols may be used to indicate the change, and insertions, other than to tables and rates, must be indicated by either highlight, background shading, bold, or underline, with deleted text indicated by strike-through:

      (ii) Reissued items must include in the square or brackets the number of the tariff supplement where the item was first issued or amended. If the letter designation is used, the number of the supplement must be shown together with the letter. The references must be explained at the end of the tariff. For example: “[R2] Reissued from Supplement No. 2, effective [].”

      (iii) The symbols and letter designations contained in paragraph (b)(10)(i) of this section must not be used for any other purpose.

      (iv) When the same change is made in all or in substantially all rates in a tariff, a tariff supplement, or a tariff or tariff supplement page, that fact and the nature of the change must be indicated in distinctive type at the top of the title page of the issue, or at the top of each page, as appropriate. For example: “All rates in this issue are increased,” or “All rates on this page are reduced unless otherwise indicated.”

      (v) When a tariff publication that cancels a previous tariff publication does not include points of origin or destination, or rates, rules, or routes that were contained in the prior tariff publication, the new tariff publication must indicate the cancellation. If such omissions effect changes in charges or services, that fact must be indicated by the use of the symbols prescribed in paragraph (b)(10)(i) of this section.

      (vi) Only revisions to tariff provisions identified in the filing constitute the tariff filing. Revisions to unidentified portions of the rate schedule or tariff are not considered part of the filing nor will any acceptance of the filing by the Commission constitute acceptance of such unmarked changes.

      (11) Tariff publications must be consecutively numbered.

      § 341.4   Amendments of tariff filings.

#### § § 341.4

      A carrier may file to amend or modify a tariff contained in a tariff filing at any time during the pendency of the filing. Such filing will toll the notice period as provided in § 341.2(b) for the original filing, and the filing becomes provisionally effective 31 days from the original filing and, in the absence of Commission action, fully effective 31 days from the date of the filing of amendment or modification.

      § 341.9   Index of tariffs.

#### § § 341.9

      (a)  Each carrier with more than two tariffs or concurrences must post on its public Web site a complete index of all effective tariffs to which it is a party, either as an initial, intermediate, or delivering carrier. The index must be arranged in sections as indicated in paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section and must show as to each tariff:

      (1) The FERC Tariff number;

      (2) The full name of the issuing carrier or agent;

      (3) The type of tariff or description of the traffic to which it applies, including origin and destination points; and

      § 341.10   Application of rates to intermediate points.

#### § § 341.10

      (a)  (1) A carrier may provide in its tariff that existing rates between points named in the tariff will be applied to transportation movements from intermediate origin points not named in the tariff to named destination points, and from named origin points to intermediate destination points not named in the tariff.

      (2) A carrier must file a tariff publication applicable to the transportation movements within 30 days of the start of the service if the intermediate point is to be used on a continuous basis for more than 30 days.

      (b) —(1)  The rate for service provided to a published destination point from an origin point not specifically named in the tariff, but located intermediate to published origin and destination points, must be the same as the published rate from the next more distant origin point. Application of this provision is subject to the following:

      (i) If branch or diverging lines create two or more “next more distant” points, the carrier must apply the rate which results in the lowest charge.

      (ii) If the intermediate point is located between two published origin points, the carrier must apply the rate which results in the higher charge.

      (iii) If the intermediate point is between more than two published origin points due to branch or diverging lines, the carrier must eliminate all such points except that from which the lowest charge is applicable.

      (iv) If there is in any other tariff a commodity rate from the proposed intermediate origin point that is applicable to the same movement, the carrier should not apply this rule from such intermediate point.

      (2)  The rate for service provided from a published origin point to a destination point not specifically named in the tariff, but located intermediate to published origin and destination points, must be the same as the published rate to the next more distant destination point. Application of this provision is subject to the following:

      (i) If branch or diverging lines create two or more “next more distant” points, the carrier must apply the rate which results in the lowest charge.

      (ii) If the intermediate point is located between two published destination points, the carrier must apply the rate which results in the higher charge.

      (iii) If the intermediate point is between more than two published destination points due to branch or diverging lines, the carrier must eliminate all such points except that from which the lowest charge is applicable.

      (iv) If there is in any other tariff a commodity rate to the proposed intermediate destination point that is applicable to the same movement, the carrier should not apply the provisions of this rule to such intermediate point.

      (3)  Both paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section may apply in connection with the same rate. In this instance, both regulations should be used to establish rates from intermediate points of origin to intermediate points of destination.

      § 341.11   Rejection of tariff publications and other filed materials.

#### § § 341.11

      (a)  The Commission may reject tariff publications or any other material submitted for filing that fail to comply with the requirements set forth in this part or violate any statute, or any regulation, policy or order of the Commission.

      (b)  The FERC Tariff number assigned to a tariff publication that has been rejected may not be used again.

#### § § 341.13

      (a)  A proposed tariff publication which is not yet effective may be withdrawn at any time by filing a notice with the Commission with a certification that all subscribers have been notified by copy of such withdrawal.

      (b)  A tariff publication that has been permitted to become effective subject to investigation may be withdrawn at any time by filing a notice with the Commission, which includes a transmittal letter, a certification that all subscribers have been notified of the withdrawal, and the previous tariff provisions that are to be reinstated upon withdrawal of the tariff publication under investigation. Such withdrawal shall be effective immediately upon the submission of the notice, unless a specific effective date is set forth in the notice, and must have the following effects:

      (1) Any proceeding with respect to such tariff publication shall be terminated;

      (2) The previous tariff rate shall be reinstated; and

      (3) Any amounts collected under the withdrawn tariff publication which are in excess of the previous tariff rate shall be refunded within 30 days of the withdrawal with interest as calculated by § 340.1 of this chapter.

      (c)  The FERC Tariff number assigned to a tariff publication which has been withdrawn may not be used again.

#### § § 341.14

      (a)  Applications for waiver of the notice and tariff requirements of section 6(3) of the interstate Commerce Act must be filed by the carrier concurrently with the tariff publication being proposed. The letter of transmittal must identify the filing as requesting a waiver under section 6(3) of the Interstate Commerce Act. The application must state in detail any unusual circumstance or emergency situation that supports the requested waiver. If the application requests permission to make changes in joint tariffs, it must state that it is made on behalf of all carriers party to the proposed change. Tariff publications issued on short notice must contain the following statement on the Title Pages:

      (b)  To permit short-notice filings to become effective as requested, the tariff publications filed concurrently with special permission requests for short (less than 30 days) notice will be deemed conditionally accepted for filing, subject to refund, until the Commission has had a full 30-day review period in which to process the filing.

The refund obligation will automatically terminate with no refunds due at the end of the full 30-day notice period absent an order to the contrary issued by the Commission.

      (c)  The special permission requested will be deemed automatically granted at the end of the full 30-day notice period absent an order denying such request.

      § 341.15   Long and short haul or aggregate of intermediate rates.

#### § § 341.15

      (a)  Carriers may file requests for relief from the provisions of section 4 of the Interstate Commerce Act in order to charge a greater amount for a shorter distance over the same line or route in the same direction, or to charge greater compensation as a through rate than the aggregate of the intermediate rates. Such request will be deemed granted unless the Commission denies the request within 30 days of the filing.

      (b)  A request for section 4 relief must contain the following information:

      (1) The names of the carriers for which the relief is being requested.

      (2) The FERC tariff numbers which contain the rates or charges referred to in the application, and identification of all the particular and related rates in question delineating origin and destination points.

      (3) An accurate and complete statement giving the basis and reasoning why section 4 relief is necessary.

      (4) A statement that the lower rates for longer than for shorter hauls over the same line or route are reasonably compensatory.

      (5) A map showing the pipelines and origin and destination points in question and other pertinent information.

      (c)  Applications for section 4 relief must be filed concurrently with the tariff publication filing establishing those rates. The transmittal letter must identify the filing as requesting section 4 relief.

      (d)  Tariff publications filed containing such rates shall plainly state on the title page of the tariff publication that the rates contained therein contravene section 4 of the Interstate Commerce Act.

      (e)  When a carrier aggregates intermediate rates to make up through rates, it may round the resulting through rate to the nearest 0.5 whole cent.

**Source:** Source: Order 561, 58 FR 58779, Nov. 4, 1993, unless otherwise noted.

      § 342.0   Applicability.

#### § § 342.0

      (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, rate changes by oil pipelines shall be governed by this part.

      (b)  This part shall not apply to the Trans-Alaska Pipeline authorized by the Trans-Alaska Pipeline Authorization Act (43 U.S.C. 1651, ) or to any pipeline delivering oil directly or indirectly to the Trans-Alaska Pipeline.

      § 342.1   General rule.

#### § § 342.1

      Each carrier subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under the Interstate Commerce Act:

      (a) Must establish its initial rates subject to such Act pursuant to § 342.2; and

      (b) Must make any change in existing rates pursuant to § 342.3 or § 342.4, whichever is applicable, unless directed otherwise by the Commission.

      § 342.2   Establishing initial rates.

#### § § 342.2

      A carrier must justify an initial rate for new service by:

      (a) Filing cost, revenue, and throughput data supporting such rate as required by part 346 of this chapter; or

      (b) Filing a sworn affidavit that the rate is agreed to by at least one non-affiliated person who intends to use the service in question,  that if a protest to the initial rate is filed, the carrier must comply with paragraph (a) of this section.

> [Order 561, 58 FR 58779, Nov. 4, 1993, as amended at 59 FR 59146, Nov. 16, 1994]

      § 342.3   Indexing.

#### § § 342.3

      (a)  A rate charged by a carrier may be changed, at any time, to a level which does not exceed the ceiling level established by paragraph (d) of this section, upon compliance with the applicable filing and notice requirements and with paragraph (b) of this section. A filing under this section proposing to change a rate that is under investigation and subject to refund, must take effect subject to refund.

      (b)  The carrier must comply with Part 341 of this title. Carriers must specify in their letters of transmittal required in § 341.2(c) of this chapter the rate schedule to be changed, the proposed new rate, the prior rate, the prior ceiling level, and the applicable ceiling level for the movement. No other rate information is required to accompany the proposed rate change.

      (c)  The index year is the period from July 1 to June 30.

      (d)  (1) A carrier must compute the ceiling level for each index year by multiplying the previous index year's ceiling level by the most recent index published by the Commission. The index will be published by the Commission prior to June 1 of each year.

      (2) The index published by the Commission will be based on the change in the final Producer Price Index for Finished Goods (PPI-FG), seasonally adjusted, as published by the U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, for the two calendar years immediately preceding the index year. The index will be calculated by dividing the PPI-FG for the calendar year immediately preceding the index year, by the previous calendar year's PPI-FG.

      (3) A carrier must compute the ceiling level each index year without regard to the actual rates filed pursuant to this section. All carriers must round their ceiling levels each index year to the nearest hundredth of a cent.

      (4) For purposes of computing the ceiling level for the period January 1, 1995 through June 30, 1995, a carrier must use the rate in effect on December 31, 1994 as the previous index year's ceiling level in the computation in paragraph (d)(1) of this section. If the rate in effect on December 31, 1994 is subsequently lowered by Commission order pursuant to the Interstate Commerce Act, the ceiling level based on such rate must be recomputed, in accordance with paragraph (d)(1) of this section, using the rate established by such Commission order in lieu of the rate in effect on December 31, 1994.

      (5) When an initial rate, or rate changed by a method other than indexing, takes effect during the index year, such rate will constitute the applicable ceiling level for that index year. If such rate is subsequently lowered by Commission order pursuant to the Interstate Commerce Act, the ceiling level based on such rate must be recomputed, in accordance with paragraph (d)(1) of this section, using the rate established by such Commission order as the ceiling level for the index year which includes the effective date of the rate established by such Commission order.

      (e)  If the ceiling level computed pursuant to § 342.3(d) is below the filed rate of a carrier, that rate must be reduced to bring it into compliance with the new ceiling level; provided, however, that a carrier is not required to reduce a rate below the level deemed just and reasonable under section 1803(a) of the Energy Policy Act of 1992, if such section applies to such rate or to any prior rate. The rate decrease must be accomplished by filing a revised tariff publication with the Commission to be effective July 1 of the index year to which the reduced ceiling level applies.

      § 342.4   Other rate changing methodologies.

#### § § 342.4

      (a)  A carrier may change a rate pursuant to this section if it shows that there is a substantial divergence between the actual costs experienced by the carrier and the rate resulting from application of the index such that the rate at the ceiling level would preclude the carrier from being able to charge a just and reasonable rate within the meaning of the Interstate Commerce Act. A carrier must substantiate the costs incurred by filing the data required by part 346 of this chapter. A carrier that makes such a showing may change the rate in question, based upon the cost of providing the service covered by the rate, without regard to the applicable ceiling level under § 342.3.

      (b)  A carrier may attempt to show that it lacks significant market power in the market in which it proposes to charge market-based rates. Until the carrier establishes that it lacks market power, these rates will be subject to the applicable ceiling level under § 342.3.

      (c)  A carrier may change a rate without regard to the ceiling level under § 342.3 if the proposed change has been agreed to, in writing, by each person who, on the day of the filing of the proposed rate change, is using the service covered by the rate. A filing pursuant to this section must contain a verified statement by the carrier that the proposed rate change has been agreed to by all current shippers.

      (1)  This statement must summarize the total cost of service for a carrier (operating and maintenance expense, depreciation and amortization, return, and taxes) developed from Statements B through G described in paragraphs (c) (2) through (7) of this section.

      (2)  This statement must set forth the operation, maintenance, administration and general, and depreciation expenses for the test period. Items used in the computations or derived on this statement must consist of operations, including salaries and wages, supplies and expenses, outside services, operating fuel and power, and oil losses and shortages; maintenance, including salaries and wages, supplies and expenses, outside services, and maintenance and materials; administrative and general, including salaries and wages, supplies and expenses, outside services, rentals, pensions and benefits, insurance, casualty and other losses, and pipeline taxes; and depreciation and amortization.

      (3)  This statement must set forth the rate base for return purposes from Statement E in paragraph (c)(5) of this section and must also state the claimed rate of return and the application of the claimed rate of return to the overall rate base. The claimed rate of return must consist of a weighted cost of capital, combining the rate of return on debt capital and the real rate of return on equity capital. Items used in the computations or derived on this statement must include deferred earnings, equity ratio, debt ratio, weighted cost of capital, and costs of debt and equity.

      (4)  This statement must set forth the income tax computation. Items used in the computations or derived on this statement must show: return allowance, interest expense, equity return, annual amortization of deferred earnings, depreciation on equity AFUDC, underfunded or overfunded ADIT amortization amount, taxable income, tax factor, and income tax allowance.

      (5)  This statement must set forth the return rate base. Items used in the computations or derived on this statement must include beginning balances of the rate base at December 31, 1983, working capital (including materials and supplies, prepayments, and oil inventory), accrued depreciation on carrier plant, accrued depreciation on rights of way, and accumulated deferred income taxes; and adjustments and end balances for original cost of retirements, interest during construction, AFUDC adjustments, original cost of net additions and retirements from land, original cost of net additions and retirements from rights of way, original cost of plant additions, original cost accruals for depreciation, AFUDC accrued depreciation adjustment, original cost depreciation accruals added to rights of way, net charge for retirements from accrued depreciation, accumulated deferred income taxes, changes in working capital (including materials and supplies, prepayments, and oil inventory), accrued deferred earnings, annual amortization of accrued deferred earnings, and amortization of starting rate base write-up.

      (6)  This statement must set forth the computation of allowances for funds used during construction (AFUDC) including the AFUDC for each year commencing in 1984 and a summary of AFUDC and AFUDC depreciation for the years 1984 through the test year.

      (7)  This statement must set forth the gross revenues for the actual 12 months of experience as computed under both the presently effective rates and the proposed rates. If the presently effective rates are not at the maximum ceiling rate established under § 342.3 of this chapter, then gross revenues must also be computed and set forth as if the ceiling rates were effective for the 12 month period.

#### § § 346.3

      (a) A carrier that files material in support of initial rates or change in rates under § 346.2 and has recorded asset retirement obligations on its books must provide a schedule, as part of the supporting workpapers, identifying all cost components related to the asset retirement obligations that are included in the book balances of all accounts reflected in the cost of service computation supporting the proposed rates. However, all cost components related to asset retirement obligations that would impact the calculation of rate base, such as carrier property and related accumulated depreciation and accumulated deferred income taxes, may not be reflected in rates and must be removed from the rate base calculation through a single adjustment.

      (b) A carrier seeking to recover nonrate base costs related to asset retirement costs in rates must provide, with its filing under § 346.2 of this part, a detailed study supporting the amounts proposed to be collected in rates.

      (c) A carrier who has recorded asset retirement obligations on its books but is not seeking recovery of the asset retirement costs in rates, must remove all asset retirement obligations related cost components from the cost of service supporting its proposed rates.

To the extent available, the statement must include all pertinent data about transportation alternatives and other constraining competition.

      (5)  This statement must describe potential competition in the relevant markets. To the extent available, the statement must include data about the potential competitors, including their costs, and their distance in miles from the carrier's terminals and major consuming markets.

      (6)  This statement must consist of maps showing the carrier's principal transportation facilities, the points at which service is rendered under its tariff, the direction of flow of each line, the location of each of its terminals, the location of each of its major consuming markets, and the location of the alternatives to the carrier, including their distance in miles from the carrier's terminals and major consuming markets. The statement must include a general system map and maps by geographic markets. The information required by this statement may be on separate pages.

      (7)  This statement must set forth the calculation of the market concentration of the relevant markets using the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index. The statement must also set forth the carrier's market share based on receipts in its origin markets and deliveries in its destination markets, if the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index is not based on those factors. The statement must also set forth the calculation of other market power measures relied on by the carrier. The statement must include complete particulars about the carrier's calculations.

      (8)  This statement must describe any other factors that bear on the issue of whether the carrier lacks significant market power in the relevant markets. The description must explain why those other factors are pertinent.

      (9)  This statement must include the proposed testimony in support of the application and will serve as the carrier's case-in-chief, if the Commission sets the application for hearing. The proposed witness must subscribe to the testimony and swear that all statements of fact contained in the proposed testimony are true and correct to the best of his or her knowledge, information, and belief.

      § 349.1   Notice to audited person.

#### § § 349.1

      An audit conducted by the Commission or its staff under authority of the Interstate Commerce Act may result in a notice of deficiency or audit report or similar document containing a finding or findings that the audited person has not complied with a requirement of the Commission with respect to, but not limited to, the following: A filed tariff or tariffs, contracts, data, records, accounts, books, communications or papers relevant to the audit of the audited person; and the activities or operations of the audited person. The notice of deficiency, audit report or similar document may also contain one or more proposed remedies that address findings of noncompliance. Where such findings, with or without proposed remedies, appear in a notice of deficiency, audit report or similar document, such document shall be provided to the audited person, and the finding or findings, and any proposed remedies, shall be noted and explained. The audited person shall timely indicate in a written response any and all findings or proposed remedies, or both, in any combination, with which the audited person disagrees. The audited person shall have 15 days from the date it is sent the notice of deficiency, audit report or similar document to provide a written response to the audit staff indicating any and all findings or proposed remedies, or both, in any combination, with which the audited person disagrees, and such further time as the audit staff may provide in writing to the audited person at the time the document is sent to the audited person. The audited person may move the Commission for additional time to provide a written response to the audit staff and such motion shall be granted for good cause shown. Any initial order that the Commission subsequently may issue with respect to the notice of deficiency, audit report or similar document shall note, but not address on the merits, the finding or findings, or the proposed remedy or remedies, or both, in any combination, with which the audited person disagreed. The Commission shall provide the audited person 30 days to respond to the initial Commission order concerning a notice of deficiency, audit report or similar document with respect to the finding or findings or any proposed remedy or remedies, or both, in any combination, with which it disagreed.

      § 349.2   Response to notification.

#### § § 349.2

      Upon issuance of a Commission order that notes a finding or findings, or proposed remedy or remedies, or both, in any combination, with which the audited person has disagreed, the audited person may: Acquiesce in the findings and/or proposed remedies by not timely responding to the Commission order, in which case the Commission may issue an order approving them or taking other action; or challenge the finding or findings and/or any proposed remedies with which it disagreed by timely notifying the Commission in writing that it requests Commission review by means of a shortened procedure, or, if there are material facts in dispute which require cross-examination, a trial-type hearing.

      § 349.3   Shortened procedure.

#### § § 349.3

      If the audited person subject to a Commission order described in § 349.1 notifies the Commission that it seeks to challenge one or more audit findings, or proposed remedy or remedies, or both, in any combination, by the shortened procedure, the Commission shall thereupon issue a notice setting a schedule for the filing of memoranda. The person electing the use of the shortened procedure, and any other interested entities, including the Commission staff, shall file, within 45 days of the notice, an initial memorandum that addresses the relevant facts and applicable law that support the position or positions taken regarding the matters at issue. Reply memoranda shall be filed within 20 days of the date by which the initial memoranda are due to be filed. Only participants who filed initial memoranda may file reply memoranda. Subpart T of part 385 of this chapter shall apply to all filings. Within 20 days after the last date that reply memoranda under the shortened procedure may be timely filed, the audited person who elected the shortened procedure may file a motion with the Commission requesting a trial-type hearing if new issues are raised by a party. To prevail in such a motion, the audited person must show that a party to the shortened procedure raised one or more new issues of material fact relevant to resolution of a matter in the shortened procedure such that fundamental fairness requires a trial-type hearing to resolve the new issue or issues so raised. Parties to the shortened procedure and the Commission staff may file responses to the motion. In ruling upon the motion, the Commission may determine that some or all of the issues be litigated in a trial-type hearing.

      § 349.4   Form and style.

#### § § 349.4

      Each copy of such memorandum must be complete in itself. All pertinent data should be set forth fully, and each memorandum should set out the facts and argument as prescribed for briefs in § 385.706 of this chapter.

      § 349.5   Verification.

#### § § 349.5

      The facts stated in the memorandum must be sworn to by persons having knowledge thereof, which latter fact must affirmatively appear in the affidavit. Except under unusual circumstances, such persons should be those who would appear as witnesses if hearing were had to testify as to the facts stated in the memorandum.

      § 349.6   Determination.

#### § § 349.6

      If no formal hearing is had the matter in issue will be determined by the Commission on the basis of the facts and arguments submitted.

      § 349.7   Assignment for oral hearing.

#### § § 349.7

      Except when there are no material facts in dispute, when a person does not consent to the shortened procedure, the Commission will assign the proceeding for hearing as provided by subpart E of part 385 of this chapter. Notwithstanding a person's not giving consent to the shortened procedure, and instead seeking assignment for hearing as provided for by subpart E of part 385 of this chapter, the Commission will not assign the proceeding for a hearing when no material facts are in dispute. The Commission may also, in its discretion, at any stage in the proceeding, set the proceeding for hearing.

    (c)  means income or loss for a period, exclusive of related income tax expense.

    (e) “Temporary difference” means a difference between the tax basis of an asset or liability and its reported amount in the financial statements that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in future years when the reported amount of the asset or liability is recovered or settled, respectively. Some events recognized in financial statements do not have tax consequences. Certain revenues are exempt from taxation and certain expenses are not deductible. Events that do not have tax consequences do not give rise to temporary differences.

    (f) “Deductible temporary difference” means temporary differences that result in deductible amounts in future years when the related asset or liability is recovered or settled, respectively.

    (g) “Deferred tax asset” means the deferred tax consequences attributable to deductible temporary differences and carryforwards.

    (e)  and  refer to net income (or net loss) and _financial position of an investee_ determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

    (f)  means net income less dividends declared whether received or not.

    (g)  is the date on which the investor assumes the rights of ownership. Ordinarily this is the date assets are received and other assets are given or securities issued.

    32. (a)  refers to a component of an entity whose activities represent a separate major line of business or class of customer. A segment may be in the form of a subsidiary, a division, or a department, and in some cases a joint venture or other nonsubsidiary investee, provided that its assets, results of operations, and activities can be clearly distinguished, physically and operationally and for financial reporting purposes, from the other assets, results of operations, and activities of the entity. The fact that the results of operations of the segment being sold or abandoned cannot be separately identified strongly suggests that the transaction should not be classified as a segment of business.

    (b)  means the date on which the management having authority to approve the action commits itself to a formal plan to dispose of a segment of the business, whether by abandonment or sale. The measurement date for disposals requiring Commission approval shall be the service date of the Order authorizing the disposal.

    33.  means the portion of any demand deposit (or any time deposit or certificate of deposit) maintained by a carrier (or by any person on behalf of the carrier) which constitutes support for existing borrowing arrangements of the carrier (or any person) with a lending institution. Such arrangements include both outstanding borrowings and the assurance of future credit availability. (The compensating balance requirement should be adjusted by the amount of float unless such adjustment would cause the compensating balance to be greater than the cash balance per carrier's books. The float adjustment is made by subtracting the float from the compensating balance requirement if the collected bank ledger balance exceeds the cash balance per carrier's books or by adding the float to the compensating balance requirement if the collected bank ledger balance is less than the cash balance per carrier's books.)

    34.  means deposits and withdrawals in transit which constitute a difference between the collected bank ledger balance and the cash balance per carrier's books.

    35. (a)  encompasses any instrument representing ownership shares (e.g., common, preferred, and other capital stock), or the right to acquire (e.g., warrants, rights, and call options) or dispose of (e.g., put options) ownership shares in an enterprise at fixed or determinable prices. The term does not encompass preferred stock that by its terms either must be redeemed by the issuing enterprise or is redeemable at the option of the investor, nor does it include treasury stock or convertible bonds.

    (b)  as applied to an equity security, means an equity security as to which sales prices or bid and ask prices are currently available on a national securities exchange (i.e., those registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission) or in the over-the-counter market. In the over-the-counter market, an equity security shall be considered marketable when a quotation is publicly reported by the National Association of Securities Dealers Automatic Quotations System or by the National Quotations Bureau, Inc. ( in the later case, That quotations are available from at least three dealers.) Equity securities traded in foreign markets shall be considered marketable when such markets are of a breadth and scope comparable to those referred to above. This definition is not met by restricted stock (securities for which sale is restricted by a governmental or contractual requirement except where such requirement terminates within one year or where the holder has the power to cause the requirement to be met within one year). Any portion of the stock which can reasonably be expected to qualify for sale within one year, such as may be the case under Rule 144 or similar rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, is not considered restricted.

    (c)  refers to the aggregate of the market price of a single share or unit times the number of shares or units of each marketable equity security in the portfolio. When an entity has taken positions involving short sales, sales of calls, and purchases of puts for marketable equity securities and the same securities are included in the portfolio, those contracts shall be taken into consideration in the determination of market value of the marketable equity securities.

    (d)  as applied to a marketable equity security, refers to the original cost as adjusted for unrealized holding gains and losses.

    1-1  Accounts are prescribed to record the cost of property used in transportation and related operations and for revenues, expenses, taxes, rents, and other items of income for such operations. Separate accounts are prescribed for cost of property not used in transportation operations and for income and expenses pertaining thereto; for other investments and related income; for extraordinary and prior period items, including applicable income taxes; and for assets and liabilities.

    In addition, stockholders' equity accounts, designed to segregate directly contributed capital from appropriated and unappropriated retained income, are provided. Retained income accounts form the connecting link between the income account and the equity section of the balance sheet. They are provided to record the transfer of net income or loss for the year; certain capital transactions; and, when authorized by the Commission, other items.

    1-2  (a) Carriers shall keep their accounts and records in accordance with the prescribed accounts. In addition, clearing accounts, temporary accounts, and subdivisions of any account may be kept provided the integrity of the prescribed accounts is not impaired. Each carrier shall keep its books of account, and all other books, records and memoranda which support the entries in such books of account, so as to be able to furnish readily full information as to any item included in any account. Each entry shall be supported by such detailed information as will permit ready identification, analysis, and verification of all facts relevant thereto.

    (b) The books and records referred to herein include not only accounting records in a limited technical sense, but all records, such as minute books, stock books, reports, correspondence, memorandums, etc., which may be useful in developing the history of or facts regarding any transaction.

    (c) No carrier shall destroy any books, records, memoranda, etc., which support entries to its accounts unless destruction is permitted by the regulations governing preservation of records, Part 356 of this chapter.

    (49 U.S.C. 5b, 304, 320, 904, 913, 917, 1003, 1012)

    1-3  (a) Each carrier shall keep its books on a monthly basis so that all transactions, as nearly as may be ascertained, shall be entered in the accounts not later than 60 days after the last day of the period for which the accounts are stated, except that the time within which the final entries for the year ending December 31 shall be made may be extended to such date in the following March as shall not interfere with the preparation and filing of the annual report.

    (b) Changes shall not be made in the accounts for periods covered by reports that have been filed with the Commission unless the changes have first been authorized by the Commission.

    1-4  (a) This system of accounts shall be kept by the accrual method of accounting. The basis used for accruing income and expense items each month shall be consistently applied and any change in such basis or any unusual accruals involving material amounts shall be promptly reported to the Commission.

    (b) When the amount of any transaction cannot be accurately determined in time for inclusion in the applicable month's accounts, an estimated amount shall be entered in the proper accounts. Appropriate adjustments shall be made as soon as the actual amounts become known or at the time a substantial change is indicated. Carriers are not required to anticipate minor items which do not appreciably affect the accounts.

    1-5  Ordinary delayed items and adjustments arising during the current year which are applicable to prior years shall be included in the same account which would have been charged or credited if the item had been taken up or the adjustments made in the year to which it pertained. When the amount of a delayed item or adjustment is relatively so large that its inclusion in net income for a single month would seriously distort the accounts for the month (but not for the year), such amount may be distributed in equal monthly charges or credits, as the case may be, to the remaining months of the calendar year. See instruction 1-6 for instructions covering extraordinary and prior period items of a nonrecurring nature.

    1-6  (a)  All items of profit and loss recognized during the year are includible in ordinary income unless evidence clearly supports their classification as extraordinary items. Extraordinary items are characterized by both their unusual nature and infrequent occurrence taking into account the environment in which the firm operates; they must also meet the materiality standard.

    Unusual means the event or transaction must possess a high degree of abnormality and be of a type clearly unrelated to, or only incidentally related to the ordinary and typical activities of the entity.

    Infrequent occurrence means the event or transaction shall be of a type not reasonably expected to recur in the foreseeable future.

    (b)  Material events unusual in nature or infrequent in occurrence but not both, thus not meeting both criteria for classification as extraordinary, shall be includible in the accounts provided as separate components of income/expense from continuing operations. Such items are not to be reported net of income taxes.

    (c)  The results of continuing operations shall be reported separately from discontinued operations and any gain or loss resulting from disposal of a segment of a business (see definition 32(a)) shall be reported in conjunction with the related results of discontinued operations and not as an extraordinary item. The disposal of a segment of a business shall be distinguished from other disposals of assets incident to the evolution of the entity's business, such as the disposal of part of a line of business, the shifting of production or marketing activities for a particular line of business from one location to another, the phasing out of a product line or class of service, and other changes occasioned by technological improvements. If a loss is expected from the proposed sale or abandonment of a segment, the estimated loss shall be provided for at the measurement date (see definition 32(b)). If a gain is expected, it shall be recognized when realized, which ordinarily is the disposal date (see definition 32(c)).

    (d)  The correction of an error in the financial statements of a prior period and adjustments that result from realization of income tax benefits of preacquisition loss carryforwards of purchased subsidiaries shall be accounted for as prior period adjustments and excluded from the determination of net income from the current year. All other revenues, expenses, gains, and losses recognized during a period shall be included in the net income of that period.

    (e)  A change in accounting principle or accounting entity should be referred to this Commission for approval. The cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle should ordinarily be reflected in the account provided for in determining net income; in certain cases accounting changes may be reflected as prior period adjustments. Changes in accounting estimates should ordinarily be reflected prospectively.

    (f)  As a general standard an item shall be considered material when it exceeds 10 percent of annual income (loss) before extraordinary items. An item may also be considered in relation to the trend of annual earnings before extraordinary items or other appropriate criteria. Items shall be considered individually and not in the aggregate in determining materiality. However, the effects of a series of related transactions arising from a single specific and identifiable event or plan of action shall be aggregated to determine materiality.

    (g)  Items shall be included in the accounts provided for extraordinary items, unusual or infrequent items, discontinued operations, prior period adjustments and cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles only upon approval of the Commission. If the carrier retains the service of an independent accountant, a request for using these accounts shall be accompanied by a letter from the independent accountant approving or otherwise commenting on the request.

    1-7  Items appearing in instructions and in the texts of various accounts are merely representative and are not intended to cover all of the items includible therein.

    1-8

    (a)  Monthly depreciation charges shall be made by the straight-line method to operating expenses in conformity with the group plan of accounting applicable to all carrier property except property included in accounts 101, 151, 171, Land, and 187, Construction Work in Progress.

    (b)  (1) Separate composite annual percentage rates will be prescribed for each depreciable account except that the Commission may authorize the use of component rates upon specific request from a carrier. Carriers becoming subject to this system of accounts and carriers acquiring property for which no rates have been previously prescribed shall file, within six months, composite annual percentage rates applicable to the book cost of each class of depreciable carrier property as will distribute the service value, by the straight-line method, in equal annual charges to operating expenses during the service life of the property. These rates shall be used by the carrier until the rates prescribed by the Commission become effective. Such rates shall, for each primary account comprised of more than one class of property, produce a depreciation charge equal to the sum of the amounts that would otherwise be chargeable for each of the various classes of property included in the account. Carriers shall base these percentage rates on estimated service values and service lives developed from engineering and other studies. The rates filed shall be accompanied by a statement showing the bases and the methods employed in the rate determination.

    (2) Carriers shall be prepared at any time upon the direction of the Commission to compute and submit revised percentage rate studies. When a carrier believes that any rate prescribed by the Commission is no longer applicable, it shall submit the rate which it believes should be established supported by full particulars for consideration by the Commission.

    (3) A carrier shall keep records of property and property retirements that will reflect the service life of property which has been retired, or will permit the determination of service life indications by mortality, turnover, or other appropriate methods; and also such records as will reflect the percentage of net salvage value for property retired from each class of depreciable carrier property.

    (c)  In computing monthly charges, the annual percentage rates shall be applied to the depreciation base as of the first of each month and the result divided by twelve.

    (d)  Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, upon the retirement of depreciable property the service value shall be charged in its entirety to account 31, Accrued Depreciation—Carrier Property. Any amounts of insurance recovered from casualty losses involving depreciable property retired shall be credited thereto.

    (e)  (1) When circumstances indicate that newly acquired property should be subject to amortization, or that the prescribed depreciation rates based on the service lives of certain property are no longer applicable, because the source of traffic will be exhausted before the end of the physical service life, the carrier shall submit to the Commission for approval amortization or depreciation rates based on the estimated remaining service life of the property accompanied by full information justifying the request.

    (2) A carrier may request, or the Commission may direct, that special accounting be applied in situations causing undue inflation or deflation of depreciation reserves, such as premature or unusual retirements or sales of depreciable property, or related insurance recoveries. A carrier's request for special accounting shall contain full particulars concerning the situation, including the basis for its proposal. Alternative accounting techniques shall be applied to the extent approved or directed by the Commission.

    1-9  Monthly depreciation charges for all depreciable property recorded in account 34, Noncarrier Property, shall be made to account 620, Income from Noncarrier Property, with concurrent credits to account 35, Accrued Depreciation—Noncarrier Property. The depreciation charges shall be such as to distribute the service values equitably over the service life of the property.

    1-10  Monthly charges shall be made to account 540, Depreciation and Amortization, to amortize the cost of fixed life intangibles such as permits, patents and franchises which are directly related to pipeline operations. Monthly charges shall be made to account 660, Miscellaneous Income Charges, to amortize the cost of intangibles such as goodwill which are not directly associated with pipeline operations. The amortization charges shall be such as to distribute the cost by the straight-line method in equal annual charges over the life or expected period of benefit.

    1-11  To maintain uniformity of accounting, carriers shall submit questions of doubtful interpretation to the Commission for consideration and decision.

    1-12  (a) The interperiod tax allocation method of accounting shall be applied to all material temporary differences (see definition 30(e)) between the tax basis of an asset or liability and its reported amount in the financial statements that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in future years. Carriers may elect, as provided by the Revenue Act of 1971, to account for the investment tax credit by either the flow through method or the deferred method of accounting. See paragraphs (d) and (e) below. All income taxes (Federal, State, and other) currently accruable for income tax return purposes shall be charged to account 670, Income taxes on income from continuing operations, and account 695, Income taxes on extraordinary items, as applicable.

    (b) Under the interperiod tax allocation method of accounting a deferred tax liability or asset is to be recognized for all temporary differences (see definition 30(e)) that result in taxable amounts in future years when the related asset or liability is recovered or settled. Deferred taxes are classified as current or noncurrent based on the classification of the related asset or liability. A carrier shall apply the applicable enacted tax rate in determining the amount of deferred taxes. The carrier shall adjust its deferred tax liabilities and assets for the effect of the change in tax law or rates in the period that the change is enacted. The adjustment shall be recorded in the proper deferred tax balance sheet accounts based on the nature of the temporary difference and the related classification requirements of the account.

    (c) An entity shall record the income tax effects of a net operating loss carryforward or a tax credit carryforward as a deferred tax asset in the year the loss occurs. In the event that it is more likely than not (a likelihood of more than 50 percent) that some portion of its deferred tax assets will not be realized, a carrier shall reduce the asset by a valuation allowance. The valuation allowance should be recorded in a separate subaccount of the deferred tax asset account. The carrier shall disclose full particulars as to the nature and amount of each type of operating loss and tax credit carryforward in the notes to its financial statements.

    (d) Carriers electing to account for the investment tax credit by the flow through method shall credit account 670, Income taxes on income from continuing operations, or account 695, Income taxes on extraordinary items, as applicable, and charge to account 56, Taxes payable, with the amount of investment tax credit utilized in the current accounting period. When the flow through method is followed for the investment tax credit, account 671, Provision for deferred taxes, shall reflect the difference between the tax payable (after recognition of allowable investment tax credit) based on taxable income and tax expense (with full recognition of investment tax credit that would be allowable based on accounting income) based on accounting income.

    (e) Carriers electing to account for the investment tax credit by the deferred method shall concurrently with making the entries prescribed in (d) above charge account 671, “Provision for deferred taxes” or account 696, “Provision for deferred taxes—extraordinary items,” as applicable, and shall credit account 64, Accumulated Deferred Income Tax Liabilities with the investment tax credit utilized as a reduction of the current year's tax liability but deferred for accounting purposes. The investment tax credit so deferred shall be amortized by credits to account 671, “Provision for deferred taxes”.

    1-13  (a) The records and supporting data of all transactions with affiliated companies shall be maintained in a separate file. The types of transactions referred to in this paragraph are for management services or any other type of services rendered, sale or use of facilities or any other type of assets or property. The file shall be maintained so as to enable the carrier, to furnish accurate information with supporting documentation about particular transactions within 15 days of the request. We do not intend the file to include data relating to ordinary carrier operations (e.g. lawful tariff charges).

    (b) Each bill rendered by an affiliated company shall state specifically the basis used for determining charges, unless the file contains other information to support the specific basis for charges.

    (c) Punched cards, magnetic tapes, discs, or other machine-sensible device used for recording, consolidating, and summarizing accounting transactions and records with a carrier's electronic or automatic data processing system may constitute a file within the meaning of this instruction.

    (d) The carrier shall record, as the cost of assets or services received from an affiliated supplier, the invoice price (plus any incidental costs related to those transactions) in those cases where the invoice price can be determined from a prevailing price list of the affiliated supplier available to the general public in the normal course of business. If no such price list exists, the charges shall be recorded at the lower of their cost to the originating affiliated supplier (less all applicable valuation reserves in case of asset sales), or their estimated fair market value determined on the basis of a representative study of similar competitive and arm's-length or bargained transactions.

    Any difference between actual transaction price and the above, as well as charges that are not transportation related, shall be considered of a financing nature and shall be recorded, accordingly, as nonoperating charges or credits. (See Instruction 1-14).

    (e) Nothing contained herein shall be construed as restraining the carrier from subdividing accounts (see Instruction 1-2(a)) for the purpose of recording separately transactions with affiliated companies.

    1-14  All charges to the accounts prescribed in this system of accounts for carrier property, operating revenues, operating and maintenance expenses, and other carrier expenses, shall be just, reasonable and not exceed amounts necessary to the honest and efficient operations and management of carrier business. Payments shall not exceed the fair market value of goods and services acquired in an arm's-length transaction. Any payments in excess of such just and reasonable charges shall be included in account 660, Miscellaneous Income Charges.

    1-15

    (a) Accounts 11 “Temporary investments,” 20 “Investments in affiliated companies,” and 21 “Other investments” shall be maintained in such a manner as to reflect the marketable equity portion ( definition 35) and other securities or investments.

    (b) For the purpose of determining net ledger value, the marketable equity securities in account 11 shall be considered the current portfolio and the marketable equity securities in accounts 20 and 21 (combined) shall be considered the noncurrent portfolio.

    (c) Carriers will categorize their security investments as held-to-maturity, trading, or available-for-sale. Unrealized holding gains and losses on trading type investment securities will be recorded in accounts 640, miscellaneous income, and 660, miscellaneous income charges, as appropriate. Unrealized holding gains and losses on available-for-sale type investment securities shall be recorded in account 77, accumulated other comprehensive income.

    1-16  To the extent that any oil pipeline company, required to file annual reports with the Commission, did not correctly report State or other income taxes on continuing operations for the 1976, 1977, and 1978 reporting years, such company is ordered to disclose the amount of the accounting change in the space for notes and remarks provided in its 1979 Annual Report Form P, Schedule 300-A, of the Commission.

    1-17

    (a) Carriers shall record items of other comprehensive income in account 77, accumulated other comprehensive income. Amounts included in this account shall be maintained by each category of other comprehensive income. Examples of categories of other comprehensive income include, foreign currency items, minimum pension liability adjustments, unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale type securities and cash flow hedge amounts. Supporting records shall be maintained for account 77 so that the company can readily identify the cumulative amount of other comprehensive income for each item included in this account.

    (b) When an item of other comprehensive income enters into the determination of net income in the current or subsequent periods, a reclassification adjustment shall be recorded in account 77 to avoid double counting of that amount.

    1-18

    (a) A carrier shall recognize derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in the financial statements and measure those instruments at fair value, except those falling within recognized exceptions, the most common of which being the normal purchases and sales scope exception. Normal purchases or sales are contracts that provide for the purchase or sale of goods that will be delivered in quantities expected to be used or sold by the utility over a reasonable period in the normal course of business. A derivative instrument is a financial instrument or other contract with all three of the following characteristics:

    (1) It has one or more underlyings and a notional amount or payment provision. Those terms determine the amount of the settlement or settlements, and, in some cases, whether or not a settlement is required.

    (2) It requires no initial net investment or an initial net investment that is smaller than would be required for other types of contracts that would be expected to have similar response to changes in market factors.

    (3) Its terms require or permit net settlement, can readily be settled net by a means outside the contract, or provides for delivery of an asset that puts the recipient in a position not substantially different from net settlement.

    (b) The accounting for the changes in the fair value of derivative instruments depends upon its intended use and designation. Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments not designated as fair value or cash flow hedges shall be recorded in account 46, derivative instrument assets, or account 65, derivative instrument liabilities, as appropriate, with the gains recorded in account 640, miscellaneous income, and losses recorded in account 660, miscellaneous income charges.

    (c) A derivative instrument may be specifically designated as a fair value or cash flow hedge. A hedge may be used to manage risk to price, interest rates, or foreign currency transactions. An entity shall maintain documentation of the hedge relationship at the inception of the hedge that details the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge, the nature of the risk being hedged, and how hedge effectiveness will be determined.

    (d) If the carrier designates the derivative instrument as a fair value hedge against exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset, liability, or a firm commitment, it shall record the change in fair value of the derivative instrument designated as a fair value hedge to account 47, derivative instrument assets-hedges, or account 66, derivative instrument liabilities-hedges, as appropriate, with a corresponding adjustment to the subaccount of the item being hedged. The ineffective portion of the hedge transaction shall be reflected in the same income or expense account that will be used when the hedged item enters into the determination of net income. In the case of a fair value hedge of a firm commitment, a new asset or liability is created. As a result of the hedge relationship, the new asset or liability will become part of the carrying amount of the item being hedged.

    (e) If the carrier designates the derivative instrument as a cash flow hedge against exposure to variable cash flows of a probable forecasted transaction, it shall record changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument in account 47, derivative instrument assets-hedges, or account 66, derivative instrument liabilities-hedges, as appropriate, with a corresponding amount in account 77, accumulated other comprehensive income, for the effective portion of the hedge. The ineffective portion of the hedge transaction shall be reflected in the same income or expense account that will be used when the hedged item enters into the determination of net income. Amounts recorded in other comprehensive income shall be reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods that the hedged forecasted item enters into the determination of net income.

    1-19

    (a) An  represents a liability for the legal obligation associated with the retirement of a tangible long-lived asset that a utility is required to settle as a result of an existing or enacted law, statute, ordinance, or written or oral contract or by legal construction of a contract under the doctrine of promissory estoppel. An  represents the amount capitalized when the liability is recognized for the long-lived asset that gives rise to the legal obligation. The amount recognized for the liability and an associated _asset retirement cost_ shall be stated at the fair value of the _asset retirement obligation_ in the period in which the obligation is incurred.

    (b) The carrier shall initially record a liability for an asset retirement obligation in account 67, Asset retirement obligations, and charge the associated asset retirement costs to account 30, Carrier property, and account 34, Noncarrier property, as appropriate, related to the property that gives rise to the legal obligation. The asset retirement cost shall be depreciated over the useful life of the related asset that gives rise to the obligations. For periods subsequent to the initial recording of the asset retirement obligation, a carrier shall recognize the period to period changes of the asset retirement obligation that result from the passage of time due to the accretion of the liability and any subsequent measurement revisions to the initial liability for the legal obligation recorded in account 67, Asset retirement obligations, as follows:

    (1) The carrier shall record the accretion of the liability by debiting account 591, Accretion expense, for carrier property, account 620, Income (net) from noncarrier property, for noncarrier property and crediting account 67, Asset retirement obligations; and

    (2) The carrier shall recognize any subsequent measurement changes of the liability initially recorded in account 67, Asset retirement obligations, for each specific asset retirement obligation as an adjustment of that liability in account 67 with the corresponding adjustment to carrier property and noncarrier property accounts, as appropriate. The utility shall on a timely basis monitor any measurement changes of the asset retirement obligations.

    (c) Gains or losses resulting from the final settlement of asset retirement obligations for carrier plant resulting from the difference between the amount of the liability for the asset retirement obligation in account 67, Asset retirement obligations, and the actual amount to settle the obligation, shall be recorded in account 592, Gains or losses on asset retirement obligations.

    (d) Gains or losses resulting from the final settlement of asset retirement obligations for noncarrier plant resulting from the difference between the amount of the liability for the asset retirement obligation in account 67, Asset retirement obligations, and the actual amount to settle the obligation, shall be recorded in account 620, Income (net) from noncarrier property.

    (e) Separate subsidiary records shall be maintained for each asset retirement obligation showing the initial liability and associated asset retirement cost, any incremental amounts of the liability incurred in subsequent reporting periods for additional layers of the original liability and related asset retirement cost, the accretion of the liability, the subsequent measurement changes to the asset retirement obligation, the depreciation and amortization of the asset retirement costs and related accumulated depreciation, and the settlement date and actual amount paid to settle the obligation. For purposes of analyses a carrier shall maintain supporting documentation so as to be able to furnish accurately and expeditiously with respect to each asset retirement obligation the full details of the identity and nature of the legal obligation, the year incurred, the identity of the plant giving rise to the obligation, the full particulars relating to each component and supporting computations related to the measurement of the asset retirement obligation.

    2-1  In the group of accounts designated as current assets shall be included cash and other assets or resources commonly identified as those which are reasonably expected to be realized in cash or sold or consumed within a one-year period. There shall not be included any amount the collection of which is not reasonably assured by the known financial condition of the debtor or otherwise. Items of current character but of doubtful value shall be written down or written off to account 510, Supplies and Expenses, or to account 660, Miscellaneous Income Charges, as appropriate.

    2-2  (a) This group of accounts shall include the cost of long-term investments in securities other than those of the accounting carrier, investment advances, sinking and other funds, cash value of life insurance policies, and other items of similar nature.

    (b) Investment in securities shall be recorded at cost at time of acquisition excluding amounts paid for accrued interest and dividends. When securities with a fixed maturity date are purchased at a discount or premium, such discount or premium shall be amortized over the remaining life of the securities by periodical debits or credits to the account in which the cost of the securities is recorded with corresponding credits or debits to interest income. If the amount of the discount or premium is minor, the investment may be maintained at actual cost without adjustment, and the amount of discount or premium recorded in the interest income account at the time the securities mature.

    (c)(1)  the carrier shall follow the principles of equity accounting for (1) all investments in corporate joint ventures (see definition 31(c)), and (2) all investments in voting stock of affiliated companies giving the carrier the ability to significantly influence the operating and financial policies of an investee (see definition 31(b)). For purposes of this instruction an investment of 20 percent or more of the outstanding voting stock of an investee will indicate the ability to exercise significant influence over an investee in the absence of evidence to the contrary.

    (2) Since the equity method is not to be effected by entries in the books of accounts but is to apply only in financial reports to the Commission, the carrier shall establish worksheet or memorandum accounts. Three basic worksheet or memorandum accounts are needed:

    (a) An investment account to include (1) equity in the undistributed earnings or losses of the investee since the date of acquisition (see definition 31(g)); (2) accumulated amortization of the difference between cost and net assets at date of acquisition (see (c)(3) below); and other adjustments for disposition or writedown of investments.

    (b) An income account to include (1) the investor's share of the investee's undistributed profits or losses for each reporting period subsequent to acquisition of the investment except that in the year of acquisition such amount shall be determined from the date of acquisition; (2) amortization for the reporting period of the difference between cost and net assets at date of acquisition. This account shall be closed at year-end to the retained income memorandum account discussed in paragraph (c) below.

    (c) A retained income account to include (1) equity in the undistributed earnings or losses of the investee since the date of acquisition; (2) accumulated amortization of the difference between cost and net assets acquired at date of acquisition (see (c)(3) below).

    (d) Other memorandum accounts will be needed for such adjustments as gains and losses on disposition of investments, recognition of impairments in value, the investor's share of extraordinary and prior period items reported in the investee's financial statements (see instruction 1-6), and provision for deferred taxes where it is reasonable to assume that undistributed earnings of an investee will be transferred to the investor in a taxable distribution. These memorandum accounts shall be closed at year-end to the retained income memorandum account discussed in paragraph (c) above.

    (3) The carrier shall retain the following information for each investee in support of the worksheet or memorandum accounts:

    (a) Original cost of investment.

    (b) Equity in net assets of investee at date of acquisition.

    (c) Allocation of difference between cost and equity in net assets, namely, to specific assets of investee or to goodwill.

    (d) Accumulated amortization of difference between cost and equity in net assets.

    (e) Unamortized balance of difference between cost and equity in net assets.

    (f) Equity in undistributed earnings/losses for each year since date of acquisition.

    (g) Dividends received since date of acquisition if determinable.

    (h) Proceeds from sale of investments.

    (4) Any difference between the investor's cost and its share of the net assets of the investee at date of acquisition shall be allocated to specific assets of the investee to the extent the difference is attributable to them. When the difference is allocated to depreciable or amortizable assets, depreciation and amortization (through the investment and income memorandum accounts) should absorb the difference over the remaining life of the related assets. If the difference is not related to specific accounts, it should be considered goodwill and amortized over a reasonable period not to exceed 40 years. For investments made prior to November 1, 1970, amortization of goodwill is not required in the absence of evidence that the goodwill has a limited term of existence.

    (5) The financial statements of the investee that are used for equity accounting should be timely. If the accounting year of the investee differs from that of the investor then the most recent available financial statements may be used. The lag in reporting should be consistent from period to period.

    (6) Material profits or losses on transactions between the investor and investee shall be eliminated until realized by either company as if the two were consolidated.

    (7) A transaction of the investee of a capital nature that affects the investor's share of the investee's stockholder's equity should be reported in the financial statements as if the two were consolidated.

    (8) The investor shall deduct any dividends applicable to outstanding cumulative preferred stock whether or not declared, and any other dividends declared when computing its share of undistributed earnings or losses.

    (9) The investor shall suspend application of the equity method when the investment (including the investment memorandum account) together with any net advances made to the investee is reduced to zero. Additional losses shall not be provided for unless the investor has guaranteed obligations of the investee or is otherwise committed to provide further financial support for the investee. If the investee subsequently reports net income the investor shall resume applying the equity method at such time as its share of that net income equals the share of net losses not recognized during the period of suspension.

    (10) When the investor's voting stock interest falls below the level of ownership described in paragraph (c)(1) of this instruction, the investment no longer qualifies for the equity method. Should dividends received on the investment in subsequent periods exceed the investor's share of earnings for such periods, the investment memorandum and income memorandum accounts shall be reduced by the excess amount.

    (11) When the level of ownership of an investment increases to that described in paragraph (c)(1) of this instruction, the equity method shall be applied. The memorandum accounts for the investment, income (for current year's equity in undistributed earnings less amortization), and retained income (for prior years' equity in undistributed earnings less amortization) shall be adjusted retroactively on a step-by-step basis determining the equity in net assets at date of acquisition, amortization adjustment, and equity in undistributed earnings or losses at each level of ownership. Where small purchases are made over a period of time and then a purchase is made which qualifies the investment for the equity method, the date of latest purchase may be used as date of acquisition. In those situations where the information needed to apply the equity method is not determinable, the date of acquisition may be considered as January 1, 1974.

    (12) Information having significance with respect to the investor's ownership in investees shall be disclosed in notes to financial statements of annual reports filed with the Commission in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

    2-3  The cost of property owned that is devoted to transportation service shall be recorded in account 30, Carrier Property, and in account 33, Operating Oil Supply. This includes carrier's investment in jointly-owned transportation property in which it has an undivided ownership interest. The cost of other property not directly associated with pipeline operations shall be included in account 34, Noncarrier Property. Property used in both carrier and noncarrier services shall be classified in account 30 or account 34 according to its dominant use.

    2-4  Account 40, Organization Costs and Other Intangibles, is prescribed for organization costs and other intangible assets, such as patents and franchises. These intangible assets shall be recorded at cost. Accounts are also prescribed for assets not otherwise provided for and for charges applicable to future periods.

    2-5  In this group of accounts shall be included obligations which are payable on demand or mature or become due within one year from the date of the balance sheet.

    2-6  Includible under this category of account are those obligations which are not due to be liquidated within one year from the date of the balance sheet. Estimates of future fire losses or other contingencies shall not be accounted for as current expenses or recorded as liabilities. Such contingencies may be provided for by appropriations of retained income, the losses to be recognized in income when sustained.

    2-7

    (a) A contingency is an existing condition, situation, or set of circumstances involving uncertainty as to possible gain or loss to a carrier that will ultimately be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. Resolution of the uncertainty may confirm the acquisition of an asset or the reduction of a liability or the loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability.

    (b) An estimated loss from a contingent liability shall be charged to income if it is probable that an asset had been impaired or a liability had been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The carrier shall disclose in a footnote in its annual report any accrued contingent liabilities, along with any contingent liabilities not meeting both conditions for accrual if there is a reasonable possibility that a liability may have been incurred.

    (c) Contingent assets should not be reflected in the accounts. The carrier shall disclose in a footnote in its annual report any contingencies that might result in an asset.

    3-1  (a) In general the carrier property accounts shall be charged with the cost of property purchased or constructed and with the cost of additions and improvements. However, the acquisition of properties comprising a distinct operating system, or an integral portion thereof, when the purchase price exceeds $250,000, shall be accounted for in accordance with the provisions set forth in instruction 3-11.

    (b) The cost of purchased property is the net price paid on a cash basis, or if other than money is given, the current value of that consideration. Cost includes the purchase price; sales, use, and excise taxes, and ad valorem taxes during periods of construction; transportation charges; insurance in transit; installation charges; and expenditures for testing and final preparation for use.

    (c) Property acquired from an affiliated company through purchase or transfer shall be recorded together with the related accrued depreciation and liabilities assumed, if any, in the appropriate property accounts at the same amount that it was recorded on the books of the affiliate. When the purchase price exceeds the net book value of the property acquired, the difference shall be charged to retained income. When the purchase price is less than the net book value, the difference shall be credited to account 73, Additional Paid-in Capital. This does not apply to small miscellaneous purchases or transfers.

    (d) The purchase of a proportionate share of a pipeline system or facility owned in undivided interests shall be recorded at the amount that the percentage of interest acquired bears to the whole. Any excess of deficiency of purchase price over the amount so recorded shall be debited to account 44, Other Deferred Charges, or credited to account 63, Other Noncurrent Liabilities, as appropriate, and amortized in equal periodic amounts over the remaining service life of the system or facility through income.

    3-2 [Reserved]

    3-3  The cost of constructing property chargeable to the carrier property accounts shall include direct and other costs as described hereunder:

    (1) Cost of labor includes the amount paid for labor performed by the carrier's own employees and officers. This includes payroll taxes, vacation pay, pensions, holiday pay and traveling and other incidental expenses of employees.

    (ii) There shall be deducted from such interest charges a proportion of premium on securities sold. There shall be added a proportion of discount and expense on funded debt issued for the acquisition or construction of carrier property.

    (b) Property. (1) The book cost, as set forth in paragraph c below, of units of property retired and of minor items of property retired and not replaced shall be written out of the property account as of date of retirement, and the service value shall be charged to account 31, Accrued Depreciation—Carrier Property.

    (2) In case of casualty loss, insurance proceeds recovered shall be credited to account 31, Accrued Depreciation—Carrier Property, in an amount not to exceed the book cost of the property involved. Any excess amount shall be credited to account 640, Miscellaneous Income.

    (3) Carrier property no longer used nor held for carrier operations but used or intended for use in noncarrier operations shall be transferred, along with the amount of past accrued depreciation, estimated if necessary, to noncarrier property.

    (c) The book cost of carrier property retired shall be determined from the carrier's records and if this cannot be done it shall be estimated. When it is impracticable to determine the book cost of each unit, due to the relatively large number or small cost thereof, an appropriate average book cost of the units, with due allowance for any differences in size and character, shall be used as the book cost of the units retired. Oil pipelines must furnish the particulars of such estimates to the Commission, if requested.

    3-8  (a) When retired property is salvaged for material or parts which are to be reused by the carrier, the salvage shall be priced at current second-hand value, not to exceed original cost, and charged to account 17, Material and Supplies, or other appropriate account.

Resulting increases or decreases in the length of the line shall be accounted for as additions or retirements of property.

    (b) In accounting for relocation of trunk lines involving units of property, the replaced property shall be retired and the cost of the new property included in the appropriate primary property accounts. When public improvement projects are involved, the cost of the new property shall be (1) the book cost less depreciation or amortization of the replaced property, less the net salvage value recovered, plus (2) costs incurred by the carrier, less any amounts contributed by governmental agencies or others.

    3-10  (a) The value of contributions or property received from others including governmental agencies shall not be recorded in the property accounts; however, memorandum entries should be made in the records of the carrier describing the property received, the value thereof, and all other pertinent information related thereto.

    (b) Property contributed by an affiliate shall be recorded in the property accounts together with the related accrued depreciation at the same amounts that were recorded on the books of the affiliate provided, however, that the amount of contribution made by non-carrier affiliates shall not exceed the fair value of the property received.

    3-11  Accounting for property acquired by business combination of two or more corporations, or the acquisition of properties comprising a distinct operating system, or integral portion thereof as specified in section 3-1, shall depend on whether there has been (1) a merger or consolidation in a “pooling of interests” or (2) a “purchase.” A “pooling of interests” may exist when holders of all or substantially all of the ownership interests, usually common stock, in the constituent corporations or entities become the owners of a surviving corporation or a new corporation which owns the assets and business of the constituent corporations or entities directly or through one or more subsidiaries. However, when the stockholders of one of the constituent corporations obtain 90 percent or more of the voting interest in the combined enterprise; or when there is a plan or firm intention and understanding to retire a substantial part of the capital stock issued to the owners of one or more of the constituent corporations or substantial changes in ownership which occurred shortly before or planned to occur shortly after the combination, the combination may be considered a “purchase.”

    (a)  (1) In accounting for a “pooling of interests,” no new basis of accountability arises. The assets and liabilities of the constituent companies or entities and the related accrued depreciation and amortization accounts along with the retained income or deficit accounts shall be carried forward, adjusted, if necessary, to conform with the accounting rules of the Commission.

    (2) When the total par value or stated value of no-par capital stock of the succeeding corporation is greater than that of the constituent corporations, the excess shall be charged first to the amount in account 73, Additional Paid-in Capital, that is not otherwise restricted, and the Balance to account 75, Unappropriated Retained Income.

    (3) When the par value or stated value of no-par capital stock of the succeeding corporation is less than that of the constituent corporations, the difference shall be credited to account 73, Additional Paid-in Capital.

    (b)  In accounting for a “purchase,” the assets shall be recorded on the books of the acquiring carrier at cost as of the date of acquisition or, if other than money is given, at the fair value of such consideration. Liabilities assumed shall be recorded in the appropriate accounts according to the accounting rules of the Commission.

    (c)  (1) Tentative journal entries recording the acquisition of pipeline properties shall be submitted to the Commission for consideration and approval. The entries shall give a complete description of the property purchased and the basis upon which the amounts of the entries have been determined. Any portion of the purchase price attributable to intangible property shall be separately recorded as hereinafter provided in account 40, Organization Costs and Other Intangibles.

    (2) When the costs of individual or groups of transportation property are not specified in the agreement or in supporting documents, or when separate costs are not provided for the physical property and the intangible property, the total purchase price shall be equitably apportioned among the appropriate property or other accounts, based on the percentage relationship between the purchase price and the original cost of property shown in the valuation records of the Commission or the fair market value of the properties. The portion of the total price assignable to the physical property shall be supported by independent appraisal or such other information as the Commission may consider appropriate. In no event shall amounts recorded for physical properties and other assets acquired exceed the total purchase price.

    (3)(a) Where the purchase price is in excess of amounts recorded for the net assets acquired, such excess shall be included in account 40, Organization Costs and Other Intangibles.

    (b) The excess of the purchase price over amounts includable in the primary carrier property accounts shall be amortized through account 660, “Miscellaneous income charges,” or otherwise disposed of, as the Commission may approve or direct.

    PART 356—PRESERVATION OF RECORDS FOR OIL PIPELINE COMPANIES

### Part 356

**Authority:** Authority: 42 U.S.C. 7101-7352; 49 U.S.C. 1-27; E.O. 12009, 3 CFR 1978 Comp. p. 142.

**Source:** Source: Order 617, 65 FR 48166, Aug. 7, 2000, unless otherwise noted.

      § 356.1   Promulgation.

#### § § 356.1

      This part is prescribed and promulgated as the regulations governing the preservation of records by oil pipeline companies subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission, to the extent and in the manner set forth therein. This part is enforceable as of the date the oil pipeline company becomes subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission.

      § 356.2   General instructions.

#### § § 356.2

      (a)  (1) The regulations in this part apply to all books of account and other records prepared by or on behalf of the oil pipeline companies.

      (2) The regulations in this part must not be construed as excusing compliance with other lawful requirements of any other governmental body, Federal or State, prescribing other record keeping requirements or for preservation of records longer than those prescribed in this part.

      (3) To the extent that any Commission regulations may provide for a different retention period, the records should be retained for the longer of the retention periods.

      (4) Unless otherwise specified in the schedule in § 356.3, duplicate copies of records may be destroyed at any time. Provided, however, that such duplicate copies must not contain significant information not shown on the originals.

      (5) Records other than those listed in the schedule may be destroyed at the option of the oil pipeline company. Provided, however, that records which are used in lieu of those listed must be preserved for the periods prescribed for the records used for substantially similar purposes and that retention of records pertaining to added services, functions, plant, etc., the establishment of which cannot be presently foreseen, must conform to the principles embodied herein.

      (6) Notwithstanding the provision of the records retention schedule, the Commission may, upon request of the oil pipeline company, authorize shorter retention periods for any records listed in § 356.3. The oil pipeline companies must show that the longer retention periods are no longer necessary or appropriate to protect the public interest, investors, or consumers. A waiver from any provision of these regulations may be made by the Commission upon its own initiative or upon submission of a written request by the company. Each request for waiver must demonstrate that unusual circumstances warrant a departure from prescribed retention periods, procedures, or techniques, or that compliance with such prescribed requirements would impose an unreasonable burden on the company.

      (b)  Each oil pipeline company subject to the provision of this part must designate one or more persons to supervise the oil pipeline company's program for preservation and authorized destruction of records.

      (c)  Each oil pipeline company subject to these regulations must provide reasonable protection for records. The records must have protections from fire, floods, and other hazards. Storage spaces, will also prevent unnecessary exposure to deterioration from excessive humidity, dryness, or lack of proper ventilation.

      (d)  (1) Each oil pipeline company has the flexibility to select its own storage media.

      (2) The storage media must have a life expectancy at least equal to the applicable record retention period provided in § 356.3 unless there is a quality transfer from one media to another with no loss of data.

      (3) Each oil pipeline company is required to implement internal control procedures that assure the reliability of and ready access to data stored on machine readable media. Internal control procedures must be documented by a responsible supervisory official.

      (e)  Oil pipeline companies may use any appropriate method to destroy permitted records.

      (f)  When records are destroyed or lost before the expiration of the prescribed period of retention, a certified statement listing, as far as may be determined, the records destroyed, and describing the circumstances of accidental or other premature destruction or loss must be filed with the Commission within ninety (90) days from the date of discovery of such destruction.

      (g)  “Destroy at option” constitutes authorization for destruction of records at managements' discretion if it does not conflict with other legal retention requirements or usefulness of such records in satisfying pending regulatory action or directives.

      (h)  Oil pipeline companies must assure the availability of records of services performed by associated companies for the periods indicated in § 356.3 as necessary to be able to readily furnish detailed information as to the nature of transaction, the involved, and the accounts used to record the transactions.

      (i)  Oil pipeline companies must arrange, file, and index records so they may be readily identified and made available to Commission representatives.

      (j)  The schedule of records in § 356.3 shows the periods of time that designated records must be preserved. However, not withstanding the minimum retention periods provided in this regulation, if an oil pipeline company intends to reflect costs in a current, pending, or future rate case, or if an oil pipeline company has abandoned or retired plant subsequent to the test period of its last rate case, it must retain the appropriate records to support the costs, and adjustments proposed in the next or current rate case.

      (k)  Notwithstanding the minimum requirements, if an oil pipeline company is involved in pending litigation, complaint proceedings, proceedings remanded by the court, or governmental proceedings, it must retain all relevant records.

      (l)  The records referred to in these regulations may be destroyed after business is discontinued and the company is completely liquidated. The records may not be destroyed until dissolution is final and all transactions are completed. When a company is merged with another company under jurisdiction of the Commission, the successor company must preserve records of the merged company in accordance with these regulations.

      (m)  Life or mortality study data for depreciation purposes must be retained for 25 years or for 10 years after plant is retired.

      § 356.3   Preservation of records for oil pipeline companies.

        (2) File a written explanation why the material change in facts does not affect its status; or

        (3) Notify the Commission that it no longer seeks to maintain its exempt wholesale generator or foreign utility company status.

        (d)  (1) If an exempt wholesale generator or a foreign utility company fails to conform to the criteria for such status or fails to conform with any material facts or representations presented in its submittals to the Commission, the notice of self-certification of the status of the facility or Commission order certifying the status of the facility may no longer be relied upon.

        (2) The Commission may, on its own motion or on the complaint of any person, revoke the status of a facility or company, if the facility or company fails to conform to any of the criteria under this part for such status.

        (e) An exempt wholesale generator shall not be subject to any requirements of this part other than § 366.7, , procedures for obtaining exempt wholesale generator status. A foreign utility company shall not be subject to any requirements of this part other than § 366.7, , procedures for obtaining foreign utility company status.

        (22)  means a holding company, together with its subsidiary companies.

        (23)  means the costs of a general overhead nature such as general services, housekeeping costs, and other support cost which cannot be separately identified to a single or group of associate and non-associate companies and, therefore, must be allocated. Costs incidental to or related to indirect items should also be classified as an indirect cost.

        (24)  means advances, represented by notes or by book accounts only, with respect to which it is mutually agreed or intended between the creditor and debtor that they must be settled by the issuance of securities or must not be subject to current settlement.

This definition includes expenditures for the implementation or development of new and/or existing concepts until technically feasible and commercially feasible operations are verified. When conducted on behalf of an associate or non-associate utility company such research, development, and demonstration costs should be reasonably related to the existing or future business of such company. The term includes, but is not limited to: All the costs incidental to the design, development or implementation of an experimental facility, a plant process, a product, a formula, an invention, a system or similar items, and the improvement of already existing items of a like nature; amounts expended in connection with the proposed development and/or proposed delivery of alternate sources of electricity or substitute or synthetic gas supplies (alternate fuel sources, for example, an experimental coal gasification plant or an experimental plant synthetically producing gas from liquid hydrocarbons); and the costs of obtaining its own patent, such as attorney's fees expended in making and perfecting a patent application.

        (46)  means the total of direct and indirect costs incurred to provide a service to an associate or non-associate company which are properly charged to expense by the service company.

        (47)  means the time between the date property is placed in service, or property is leased to others, and the date of its retirement. If depreciation is accounted for on a production basis rather than on a time basis, then service life should be measured in terms of the appropriate unit of production.

        (48)  means the difference between the cost and net salvage value of service property.

        (49)  means any commission, board, agency, or officer, by whatever name designated, of a State, municipality, or other political subdivision of a State that, under the laws of such State, has jurisdiction to regulate public-utility companies.

> [Order 684, 71 FR 65226, Nov. 7, 2006, as amended by Order 731, 74 FR 68529, Dec. 28, 2009]

        § 367.3   Records.

#### § § 367.3

        (a) Each service company must keep its books of account, and all other books, records, and memoranda that support the entries in the books of account, so as to be able to furnish full information on any item included in any account. Each entry must be supported by sufficient detailed information that will permit ready identification, analysis, and verification of all facts relevant and related to the records.

        (b) The books and records referred to in this part include not only accounting records in a limited technical sense, but all other records, such as minutes books, stock books, reports, correspondence, and memoranda, that may be useful in developing the history of or facts regarding any transaction.

        (c) No service company may destroy any books or records unless the destruction is permitted by the rules and regulations of the Commission.

        (d) In addition to prescribed accounts, clearing accounts, temporary or experimental accounts, and subaccounts of any accounts may be kept, provided the integrity of the prescribed accounts is not impaired.

        (e) The arrangement or sequence of the accounts prescribed in this part must not be controlling as to the arrangement or sequence in report forms that may be prescribed by the Commission.

        § 367.4   Numbering system.

#### § § 367.4

        (a) The account numbering plan used in this part consists of a system of three-digit whole numbers as follows:

        (1) 100-199, Assets and other debits.

        (2) 200-299, Liabilities and other credits.

        (3) 300-399, Property accounts.

        (4) 400-432 and 434-435, Income accounts.

        (5) 433, 436 and 439, Retained earnings accounts.

        (6) 457-458, Revenue accounts.

        (7) 500-599, Electric operating expenses.

        (8) 800-894, Gas operating expenses.

        (9) 900-949, Customer accounts, customer service and informational, sales, and general and administrative expenses.

        (b) The numbers prefixed to account titles are to be considered as parts of the titles. Each service company, however, may adopt for its own purposes a different system of account numbers ( General Instructions in § 367.3(d)) provided that the numbers prescribed in this part must appear in the descriptive headings of the ledger accounts and in the various sources of original entry; however, if a service company uses a different system of account numbers and it is not practicable to show the prescribed account numbers in the various sources of original entry, the reference to the prescribed account numbers may be omitted from the various sources of original entry. Each service company using different account numbers for its own purposes must keep readily available a list of the account numbers that it uses and a reconciliation of those account numbers with the account numbers provided in this part. It is intended that the service company's records must be kept so as to permit ready analysis by prescribed accounts (by direct reference to sources of original entry to the extent practicable) and to permit preparation of financial and operating statements directly from the records at the end of each accounting period according to the prescribed accounts.

        § 367.5   Accounting period.

#### § § 367.5

        Each service company must keep its books on a monthly basis so that for each month all transactions applicable to the account, as nearly as may be ascertained, must be entered in the books of the service company. Amounts applicable or assignable to a single or group of associate and non-associate companies must be segregated monthly. Each service company must close its books at the end of each calendar year unless otherwise authorized by the Commission.

        § 367.6   Submittal of questions.

#### § § 367.6

        To maintain uniformity of accounting, service companies must submit questions of doubtful interpretation to the Commission for consideration and decision.

        § 367.7   Item list.

#### § § 367.7

        Lists of items appearing in the texts of the accounts or elsewhere in this part are for the purpose of indicating clearly the application of the prescribed accounting. The lists are intended to be representative, but not exhaustive. The appearance of an item in a list warrants the inclusion of the item in the account mentioned only when the text of the account also indicates inclusion inasmuch as the same item frequently appears in more than one list. The proper entry in each instance must be determined by the texts of the accounts.

        § 367.8   Extraordinary items.

#### § § 367.8

        Extraordinary items are to be recognized according to the rules which are considered generally accepted accounting principles. These items are related to the effects of events and transactions that have occurred during the current period and that are of an unusual nature and infrequent occurrence. Each item recognized as extraordinary must be disclosed in the notes to financial statements ( Accounts 434 and 435 in §§ 367.4340 and 367.4350).

        § 367.9   Prior period items.

#### § § 367.9

        (a) Items of profit and loss related to the following must be accounted for as prior period adjustments and excluded from the determination of net income for the current year:

        (1) Correction of an error in the financial statements of a prior year.

        (2) Adjustments that result from realization of income tax benefits of pre-acquisition operating loss carry forwards of purchased subsidiaries.

        (b) All other items of profit and loss recognized during the year must be included in the determination of net income for that year.

        § 367.10   Unaudited items.

#### § § 367.10

        Whenever a financial statement is required by the Commission, if it is known that a transaction has occurred that affects the accounts but the amount involved in the transaction and its effect upon the accounts cannot be determined with absolute accuracy, the amount must be estimated and the estimated amount included in the proper accounts. The service company is not required to anticipate minor items that would not appreciably affect the accounts.

        § 367.11   Distribution of pay and expenses of employees.

#### § § 367.11

        The charges to property, operating expense and other accounts for services and expenses of employees engaged in activities chargeable to various accounts, such as construction, maintenance, and operations, must be based upon the actual time engaged in the respective classes of work, or an appropriate allocation method.

        § 367.12   Payroll distribution.

#### § § 367.12

        Underlying accounting data must be maintained so that the distribution of the cost of labor charged direct to the various accounts will be readily available. The underlying data must permit a reasonably accurate distribution to be made of the cost of labor charged initially to clearing accounts so that the total labor cost may be classified among construction, cost of removal, or operating functions.

        § 367.13   Accounting to be on accrual basis.

#### § § 367.13

        (a) The service company is required to keep its accounts on the accrual basis. This requires the inclusion in its accounts of all known transactions of appreciable amount that affect the accounts. If bills covering the transactions have not been received or rendered, the amounts must be estimated and appropriate adjustments made when the bills are received. When the amount is ascertained, the necessary adjustments must be made through the accounts in which the estimate was recorded. If it is determined during the interval that a material adjustment will be required, the estimate must be adjusted through the current accounts. The service company is not required to anticipate minor items which would not appreciably affect these accounts.

        (b) When payments are made in advance for items such as insurance, rents, taxes or interest, the amount applicable to future periods must be charged to account 165, Prepayments (§ 367.1650), and spread over the periods to which they are applicable by credits to account 165 (§ 367.1650), and charges to the accounts appropriate for the expenditure.

        § 367.14   Transactions with associate companies.

#### § § 367.14

        Each service company must keep its accounts and records so as to be able to furnish accurately and expeditiously statements of all transactions with associate companies. The statements may be required to show the general nature of the transactions, the amounts involved in the transactions and the amounts included in each account prescribed in this part with respect to such transactions. Transactions with associate companies must be recorded in the appropriate accounts for transactions of the same nature. Nothing contained in this part, however, must be construed as restraining the service company from subdividing accounts for the purpose of recording separately transactions with associate companies.

        § 367.15   Contingent assets and liabilities.

#### § § 367.15

        Contingent assets represent a possible source of value to the service company contingent upon the fulfillment of conditions regarded as uncertain. Contingent liabilities include items that, under certain conditions, may become obligations of the service company but that are neither direct nor assumed liabilities at the date of the balance sheet. The service company must be prepared to give a complete statement of significant contingent assets and liabilities (including cumulative dividends on preference stock) in its annual report and at such other times as may be requested by the Commission.

        § 367.16   Long-term debt: Premium, discount and expense, and gain or loss on reacquisition.

#### § § 367.16

        (a) A separate premium, discount and expense account must be maintained for each class and series of long-term debt (including receivers' certificates) issued or assumed by the service company. The premium must be recorded in account 225, Unamortized premium on long-term debt (§ 367.2250), the discount must be recorded in account 226, Unamortized discount on long-term debt—Debit (§ 367.2260), and the expense of issuance must be recorded in account 181, Unamortized debt expense (§ 367.1810). The premium, discount and expense must be amortized over the life of the respective issues under a plan that will distribute the amounts equitably over the life of the securities. The amortization must be on a monthly basis, and the amounts relating to discounts and expenses must be charged to account 428, Amortization of debt discount and expense (§ 367.4280). The amounts relating to premiums must be credited to account 429, Amortization of premium on debt—Credit (§ 367.4290).

        (b) When long-term debt is reacquired the difference between the amount paid upon reacquisition of any long-term debt and the face value, adjusted for unamortized discount, expenses or premium, as the case may be, applicable to the debt redeemed must be recognized currently in income and recorded in account 421, Miscellaneous income or loss (§ 367.4210), or account 426.5, Other deductions (§ 367.4265).

        § 367.17   Comprehensive inter-period income tax allocation.

#### § § 367.17

        (a) Where there are timing differences between the periods in which transactions affect taxable income and the periods in which they enter into the determination of pretax accounting income, the income tax effects of such transactions are to be recognized in the periods in which the differences between book accounting income and taxable income arise and in the periods in which the differences reverse using the deferred tax method. In general, comprehensive inter-period tax allocation should be followed whenever transactions enter into the determination of pretax accounting income for the period even though some transactions may affect the determination of taxes payable in a different period, as further qualified in this section.

        (b) Once comprehensive inter-period tax allocation has been initiated, either in whole or in part, it must be practiced on a consistent basis and must not be changed or discontinued without prior Commission approval.

        (c) Tax effects deferred currently will be recorded as deferred debits or deferred credits in accounts 190, Accumulated deferred income taxes (§ 367.1900), 282, Accumulated deferred income taxes—Other property (§ 367.2820), and 283, Accumulated deferred income taxes—Other (§ 367.2830), as appropriate. The resulting amounts recorded in these accounts must be disposed of as prescribed in this system of accounts or as otherwise authorized by the Commission.

        § 367.18   Criteria for classifying leases.

#### § § 367.18

        (a) If, at its inception, a lease meets one or more of the following criteria, the lease must be classified as a capital lease. Otherwise, it must be classified as an operating lease.

        (1) The lease transfers ownership of the property to the lessee by the end of the lease term.

        (2) The lease contains a bargain purchase option.

        (3) The lease term is equal to 75 percent or more of the estimated economic life of the leased property. However, if the beginning of the lease term falls within the last 25 percent of the total estimated economic life of the leased property, including earlier years of use, this criterion must not be used for purposes of classifying the lease.

        (4) The present value at the beginning of the lease term of the minimum lease payments, excluding that portion of the payments representing executory costs such as insurance, maintenance, and taxes to be paid by the lessor, including any related profit, equals or exceeds 90 percent of the excess of the fair value of the leased property to the lessor at the inception of the lease over any related investment tax credit retained by the lessor and expected to be realized by the lessor. However, if the beginning of the lease term falls within the last 25 percent of the total estimated economic life of the leased property, including earlier years of use, this criterion must not be used for purposes of classifying the lease. The lessee must compute the present value of the minimum lease payments using its incremental borrowing rate, unless:

        (i) It is practicable for the company to learn the implicit rate computed by the lessor, and

        (ii) The implicit rate computed by the lessor is less than the lessee's incremental borrowing rate.

        (iii) If both of those conditions are met, the lessee must use the implicit rate.

        (b) If, at any time, the lessee and lessor agree to change the provisions of the lease, other than by renewing the lease or extending its term, in a manner that would have resulted in a different classification of the lease under the criteria in paragraph (a) of this section had the changed terms been in effect at the inception of the lease, the revised agreement must be considered as a new agreement over its term, and the criteria in paragraph (a) of this section must be applied for purposes of classifying the new lease. Likewise, any action that extends the lease beyond the expiration of the existing lease term, such as the exercise of a lease renewal option other than those already included in the lease term, must be considered as a new agreement and must be classified according to the criteria in paragraph (a) of this section. Changes in estimates (for example, changes in estimates of the economic life or of the residual value of the leased property) or changes in circumstances (for example, default by the lessee) must not give rise to a new classification of a lease for accounting purposes.

        § 367.19   Accounting for leases.

#### § § 367.19

        (a) All leases must be classified as either capital or operating leases.

        (b) The service company must record a capital lease as an asset in account 101.1, Property under capital leases (§ 367.1011) and an obligation in account 227, Obligations under capital leases—Non-current (§ 367.2270), or account 243, Obligations under capital leases—Current (§ 367.2430), at an amount equal to the present value at the beginning of the lease term of minimum lease payments during the lease term, excluding that portion of the payments representing executory costs such as insurance, maintenance, and taxes to be paid by the lessor, together with any related profit. However, if the determined amount exceeds the fair value of the leased property at the inception of the lease, the amount recorded as the asset and obligation must be the fair value.

        (c) The service company, as a les_see_, must recognize an asset retirement obligation ( General Instructions in § 367.22) arising from the property under a capital lease unless the obligation is recorded as an asset and liability under a capital lease. The service company must record the asset retirement cost by debiting account 101.1, Property under capital leases (§ 367.1011), and crediting the liability for the asset retirement obligation in account 230, Asset retirement obligations (§ 367.2300). Asset retirement costs recorded in account 101.1 (§ 367.1011) must be amortized by charging rent expense ( Operating Expense Instructions in § 367.82) or account 421, Miscellaneous income or loss (§ 367.4210), as appropriate, and crediting a separate subaccount of the account in which the asset retirement costs are recorded. Charges for the periodic accretion of the liability in account 230, Asset retirement obligations (§ 367.2300), must be recorded by a charge to account 411.10, Accretion expense (§ 367.4118), for service company property, and account 421, Miscellaneous income or loss (§ 367.4210), for non-service company property and a credit to account 230, Asset retirement obligations (§ 367.2300).

        (d) Rental payments on all leases must be charged to rent expense, fuel expense, construction work in progress, or other appropriate accounts as they become payable.

        (e) For a capital lease, for each period during the lease term, the amounts recorded for the asset and obligation must be reduced by an amount equal to the portion of each lease payment that would have been allocated to the reduction of the obligation, if the payment had been treated as a payment on an installment obligation (liability) and allocated between interest expense and a reduction of the obligation so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance.

        § 367.20   Depreciation accounting.

#### § § 367.20

        (a)  Service companies must use a method of depreciation that allocates in a systematic and rational manner the service value of depreciable property over the service life of the property.

        (b)  Estimated useful service lives of depreciable property must be supported by objective evidence and analysis, including where appropriate engineering, economic, or other depreciation studies.

        (c)  Service companies must use percentage rates of depreciation that are based on a method of depreciation that allocates the service value of depreciable property over the service life of the property. Where composite depreciation rates are used, they must be based on the weighted average estimated useful service lives of the depreciable property comprising the composite group.

        § 367.22   Accounting for asset retirement obligations.

#### § § 367.22

        (a) An asset retirement obligation represents a liability for the legal obligation associated with the retirement of a tangible, long-lived asset that a service company is required to settle as a result of an existing or enacted law, statute, ordinance, or written or oral contract, or by legal construction of a contract under the doctrine of promissory estoppel. An asset retirement cost represents the amount capitalized when the liability is recognized for the long-lived asset that gives rise to the legal obligation. The amount recognized for the liability and an associated asset retirement cost must be stated at the fair value of the asset retirement obligation in the period in which the obligation is incurred.

        (b) The service company must initially record a liability for an asset retirement obligation in account 230, Asset retirement obligations (§ 367.2300), and charge the associated asset retirement costs to service company property (including account 101.1 in § 367.1011) related to the property that gives rise to the legal obligation. The asset retirement cost must be depreciated over the useful life of the related asset that gives rise to the obligations. For periods subsequent to the initial recording of the asset retirement obligation, a service company must recognize the period to period changes of the asset retirement obligation that result from the passage of time due to the accretion of the liability and any subsequent measurement changes to the initial liability for the legal obligation recorded in account 230, Asset retirement obligations (§ 367.2300), as follows:

        (1) The service company must record the accretion of the liability by debiting account 411.10, Accretion expense (§ 367.4118); and

        (2) The service company must recognize any subsequent measurement changes of the liability initially recorded in account 230, Asset retirement obligations (§ 367.2300), for each specific asset retirement obligation as an adjustment of that liability in account 230 with the corresponding adjustment to service company property. The service company must on a timely basis monitor any measurement changes of the asset retirement obligations.

        (c) Gains or losses resulting from the settlement of asset retirement obligations associated with service company property resulting from the difference between the amount of the liability for the asset retirement obligation included in account 230, Asset retirement obligations (§ 367.2300), and the actual amount paid to settle the obligation shall be accounted for as follows:

        (1) Gains shall be credited to account 421, Miscellaneous income or loss (§ 367.4210), and;

        (2) Losses shall be charged to account 426.5, Other deductions (§ 367.4265).

        (d) Separate subsidiary records must be maintained for each asset retirement obligation showing the initial liability and associated asset retirement cost, any incremental amounts of the liability incurred in subsequent reporting periods for additional layers of the original liability and related asset retirement cost, the accretion of the liability, the subsequent measurement changes to the asset retirement obligation, the depreciation and amortization of the asset retirement costs and related accumulated depreciation, and the settlement date and actual amount paid to settle the obligation. For purposes of analysis, a service company must maintain supporting documentation so as to be able to furnish accurately and expeditiously with respect to each asset retirement obligation the full details of the identity and nature of the legal obligation, the year incurred, the identity of the plant giving rise to the obligation, the full particulars relating to each component and supporting computations related to the measurement of the asset retirement obligation.

        § 367.23   Transactions with non-associate companies.

#### § § 367.23

        When a service or construction is performed for non-associate companies at an amount other than cost, the amount of revenues in excess or deficiency of the cost on servicing the non-associate companies must be charged to account 458.4, Excess or deficiency on servicing non-associate utility companies (§ 367.4584). A deficiency incurred in a project deemed beneficial to the associate companies may be charged to associate companies subject to disallowance by a State Commission or Federal Commission having jurisdiction over the rates or services of the associate companies. To the extent not charged, or if disallowed, the deficiency will be charged to account 458.4 (§ 367.4584). In computing charges to associate companies for any calendar year, any net credit in this account must be deducted from amounts reimbursable by associate companies as compensation for use of capital invested in the service company.

        § 367.24   Construction and service contracts for other companies.

#### § § 367.24

        (a) Expenditures made in the performance of construction or service contracts, under which the service company undertakes projects to construct physical property for associate or non-associate companies must be recorded in Account 412, Cost and expenses of construction or other services (§ 367.4120). The service company must keep records pursuant to its cost allocation system indicating the cost of each contract or project, the amount of service costs allocated to the contracts, and the additional classification of expenditures relating to projects that will meet the accounting requirements of the company for which the work is performed.

        (b) Account 412 (§ 367.4120) will include:

        (1) The cost of materials, construction payrolls, outside services, and other expenses which are directly attributable to the performance of service or construction contracts for other companies.

        (2) The cost of goods procured directly attributable to the performance of service or construction contracts for other companies.

        (3) The related salaries, expense of officers and employees, pay of employees on the service company's regular staff specifically assigned to construction work, and other expenses of maintaining the service company's organization and equipment.

        (4) The support services performed by the service company in connection with the procurement of goods for associate companies.

        § 367.25   Determination of service cost.

#### § § 367.25

        A service must be deemed at cost and fair allocation of costs requires an accurate accounting for the elements that makes up the aggregate expense of conducting the business of the service company. In the accounts prescribed in this part, the total amounts included in the expense accounts during any period plus the amount that appropriately may be added as compensation for the use of capital constitute cost during that period.

        § 367.26   Departmental classification.

#### § § 367.26

        Salaries and wages and all other costs must be classified by departmental or other functional category in accordance with the departmental organization of the service company to provide a readily available basis for analysis.

        § 367.27   Billing procedures.

#### § § 367.27

        Charges for services to associate public-utility companies must be made monthly with sufficient information and in sufficient detail to permit such company, where applicable, to identify and classify the charge in terms of the system of accounts prescribed by the regulatory authorities to which it is subject. The information provided to associate public-utility companies must provide a summary of the accounts by service provided and showing the charges, classified as direct cost, indirect cost, and compensation for use of capital.

        § 367.28   Methods of allocation.

#### § § 367.28

        Indirect costs and compensation for use of capital must be allocated to projects in accordance with the service company's applicable and currently effective methods of allocation. Both direct and allocated indirect costs on projects must be assigned among those companies in the same manner. The cost accumulation system must identify the methods of allocation and the accounts to be charged. Companies must be notified in writing of any change in the methods of allocation.

        § 367.29   Compensation for use of capital.

#### § § 367.29

        A servicing transaction is deemed to be performed at no more than cost if the price of the service does not exceed a fair and equitable allocation of expenses plus reasonable compensation for necessary capital procured through the issuance of capital stock. Interest on borrowed capital and compensation for the use of capital must only represent a reasonable return on the amount of capital reasonably necessary for the performance of services or construction work for, or the sale of goods to, associate companies. The compensation may be estimated and must be computed monthly. The amount of compensation must be stated separately in each billing to the associate companies. An annual statement to support the amount of compensation for use of capital billed for the previous 12 months and how it was calculated must be supplied to each associate company at the end of the calendar year.

        § 367.30   Cost accumulation system for associate companies.

#### § § 367.30

        Service companies must maintain a detailed classification of service costs, that permits costs to be identified with the functional processes of the associate companies served. To permit the classification, each service company must maintain a cost accumulation system, as described in Definitions § 367.1(a)(12), for accumulating reimbursable costs and charges to the associate companies served, and maintain time records for all service company employees in order to support the accounting allocation of all expenses assignable to the types of services performed and chargeable to the associate companies served. Service company employee records must permit a ready identification of the hours worked, account numbers charged, and other code designations that facilitate proper classification.

        (b) When the consideration given for property is other than cash, the value of the consideration must be determined on a cash basis ( Definitions § 367.1(a)(11)). In the entry recording the transaction, the actual consideration must be described with sufficient particularity to identify it. The service company must be prepared to furnish the Commission the particulars of its determination of the cash value of the consideration, if other than cash.

        (d) The service company property accounts must not include the cost or other value of service company property contributed to the company. Contributions in the form of money or its equivalent toward the construction of property must be credited to accounts charged with the cost of such construction. Property constructed from contributions of cash or its equivalent must be shown as a reduction to gross property constructed when assembling cost data for posting to property ledgers of accounts. The accumulated gross costs of property must be recorded as a debit in the plant ledger of accounts along with the related amount of contributions concurrently recorded as a credit.

        § 367.51   Components of construction.

#### § § 367.51

        (a) For service companies, the cost of construction properly included in the service company property accounts must include, where applicable, the direct and overhead costs as listed and defined as follows:

        (1) Contract work includes amounts paid for work performed under contract by other companies, firms, or individuals, costs incident to the award of such contracts, and the inspection of the work.

        (2) Labor includes the pay and expenses of employees of the service company engaged in construction work, and related workmen's compensation insurance, payroll taxes and similar items of expense.

        (3)(i) Materials and supplies includes the purchase price at the point of free delivery plus customs duties, excise taxes, the cost of inspection, loading and transportation, the related stores expenses, and the cost of fabricated materials from the service company's shop. In determining the cost of materials and supplies used for construction, proper allowance must be made for unused materials and supplies, for materials recovered from temporary structures used in performing the work involved, and for discounts allowed and realized in the purchase of materials and supplies.

        (ii) The cost of individual items of equipment of small value (for example, $500 or less) or of short life, including small portable tools and implements, must not be charged to service company property accounts unless the correctness of the accounting is verified by current inventories. The cost must be charged to the appropriate operating expense or clearing accounts, according to the use of the items, or, if the items are consumed directly in construction work, the cost must be included as part of the cost of the construction.

        (4) Transportation includes the cost of transporting employees, materials and supplies, tools, purchased equipment, and other work equipment (when not under own power) to and from points of construction. It includes amounts paid to others as well as the cost of operating the service company's own transportation equipment. ( paragraph (a)(5) of this section.)

        (5) Special machine service includes the cost of labor (optional), materials and supplies, depreciation, and other expenses incurred in the maintenance, operation and use of special machines, such as steam shovels, pile drivers, derricks, ditchers, scrapers, material unloaders, and other labor saving machines; also expenditures for rental, maintenance and operation of machines of others. It does not include the cost of small tools and other individual items of small value or short life which are included in the cost of materials and supplies. ( paragraph (a)(3) of this section.) When a particular construction job requires the use for an extended period of time of special machines, transportation or other equipment, the associated net book cost, less the appraised or salvage value at time of release from the job, must be included in the cost of construction.

        (6) Shop service includes the proportion of the expense of the service company's shop department assignable to construction work except that the cost of fabricated materials from the service company's shop must be included in materials and supplies.

        (7) Protection includes the cost of protecting the service company's property from fire or other casualties and the cost of preventing damages to others, or to the property of others, including payments for discovery or extinguishment of fires, cost of apprehending and prosecuting incendiaries, related witness fees, amounts paid to municipalities and others for fire protection, and other analogous items of expenditures in connection with construction work.

        (8) Injuries and damages includes expenditures or losses in connection with construction work on account of injuries to persons and damages to the property of others; also the cost of investigation of, and defense against, actions for the injuries and damages. Insurance recovered or recoverable on account of compensation paid for injuries to persons incident to construction must be credited to the account or accounts to which such compensation is charged. Insurance recovered or recoverable on account of property damages incident to construction must be credited to the account or accounts charged with the cost of the damages.

        (9) Privileges and permits includes payments for and expenses incurred in securing temporary privileges, permits or rights in connection with construction work, such as for the use of private or public property, streets, or highways, but it does not include rents.

        (10) Rents include amounts paid for the use of construction quarters and office space occupied by construction forces and amounts properly includible in construction costs for the facilities jointly used.

        (12) General administration capitalized includes the portion of the pay and expenses of the general officers and administrative and general expenses applicable to construction work.

        (13) Engineering services includes amounts paid to other companies, firms, or individuals engaged by the service company to plan, design, prepare estimates, supervise, inspect, or give general advice and assistance in connection with construction work.

        (14) Insurance includes premiums paid or amounts provided or reserved as self-insurance for the protection against loss and damages in connection with construction, by fire or other casualty injuries to or death of persons other than employees, damages to property of others, defalcation of employees and agents, and the nonperformance of contractual obligations of others. It does not include workmen's compensation or similar insurance on employees included as labor in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.

        (15) Law expenditures includes the general law expenditures incurred in connection with construction and the directly related court and legal costs, other than law expenses included in protection in paragraph (a)(7) of this section, and in injuries and damages in paragraph (a)(8) of this section.

        (16) Taxes include taxes on physical property (including land) during the period of construction and other taxes properly includible in construction costs before the facilities become available for service.

        (17) Interest cost on funds used during construction which are allowed to be capitalized following generally accepted accounting principles.

        (18)  The earnings and expenses during construction must constitute a component of construction costs.

        (19)  When it is necessary that employees be trained to operate or maintain property that is being constructed and the property is not conventional in nature, or is new to the company's operations, these costs may be capitalized as a component of construction cost. Once property is placed in service, the capitalization of training costs must cease and subsequent training costs must be expensed. ( Operating Expense Instructions in § 367.83.)

        (20) Studies include the costs of studies such as safety or environmental studies mandated by regulatory bodies relative to property under construction. Studies relative to facilities in service must be charged to account 183, Preliminary survey and investigation charges (§ 367.1830).

        (21)  The costs recognized as a result of asset retirement obligations incurred during the construction and testing of service company property must constitute a component of construction costs.

        (b) [Reserved]

        § 367.52   Overhead construction costs.

#### § § 367.52

        (a) All overhead construction costs, such as engineering, supervision, general office salaries and expenses, construction engineering and supervision by others than the service company, law expenses, insurance, injuries and damages, relief and pensions, taxes and interest, must be charged to particular jobs or units on the basis of the amounts of the reasonably applicable overheads.

        (b) As far as practicable, the determination of payroll charges includible in construction overheads must be based on the related time card distributions. Where this procedure is impractical, special studies must be made periodically of the time of supervisory employees devoted to construction activities to the end that only the overhead costs that have a definite relation to construction must be capitalized.

        (c) The records supporting the entries for overhead construction costs must be kept so as to show the total amount of each overhead for each year, the nature and amount of each overhead expenditure charged to each construction project and to each property account, and the bases of distribution of such costs.

        § 367.53   Service company property purchased or sold.

#### § § 367.53

        (a) When service company property is acquired by purchase, merger, consolidation, liquidation, or otherwise, after the effective date of this system of accounts, the costs of acquisition, including related incidental expenses, must be charged to the appropriate service company property accounts and account 107, Construction work in progress (§ 367.1070), as appropriate.

        (b) If property acquired is in a physical condition so that it is necessary to rehabilitate it substantially in order to bring the property up to the standards of the service company, the cost of the work, except replacements, must be accounted for as a part of the purchase price of the property.

        (c) Unless otherwise authorized by the Commission, all service company property acquired from an affiliate company must be recorded at its book value. Additionally, if property is acquired that is in excess of $10 million and has been previously devoted to public service at a price above book value, the service company must file with the Commission the proposed journal entries associated with the acquisition within six months from the date of acquisition of the property.

        (d) When service company property is sold, conveyed, or transferred to another by sale, merger, consolidation, or otherwise, the book cost of the property sold or transferred to another must be credited to the appropriate service company property accounts. The amounts (estimated, if not known) carried with respect the accounts for accumulated provision for depreciation and amortization must be charged to those accounts. The difference, if any, between the net amount of debits and credits and the consideration received for the property (less commissions and other expenses of making the sale) must be included in account 421.1, Gain on disposition of property (§ 367.4211), or account 421.2, Loss on disposition of property (§ 367.4212).

        (e) In connection with the acquisition of service company property previously devoted to service company operations or acquired from an associate company, the service company must procure, if possible, all existing records relating to the property acquired or related certified copies, and must preserve the records in conformity with regulations or practices governing the preservation of records of its own construction.

        § 367.54   Expenditures on leased property.

#### § § 367.54

        (a) The cost of substantial initial improvements (including repairs, rearrangements, additions, and betterments) made to prepare service company property leased to be used for a period of more than one year, and the cost of subsequent substantial additions, replacements, or betterments to the property, must be charged to the service company property account appropriate for the class of property leased. If the service life of the improvements is terminable by action of the lease, the cost, less net salvage, of the improvements must be spread over the life of the lease by charges to account 404, Amortization of limited-term service property (§ 367.4040). However, if the service life is not terminated by action of the lease but by depreciation proper, the cost of the improvements, less net salvage, must be accounted for as depreciable property. The provisions of this paragraph are applicable to property leased under either capital leases or operating leases.

        (b) If improvements made to property leased for a period of more than one year are of relatively minor cost, or if the lease is for a period of not more than one year, the cost of the improvements must be charged to the account in which the rent is included, either directly or by amortization.

        § 367.55   Land and land rights.

#### § § 367.55

        (a) The accounts for land and land rights must include the cost of land owned in fee by the service company and rights. Interests, and privileges held by the service company in land owned by others, such as leaseholds, easements, water and water power rights, diversion rights, submersion rights, rights-of-way, and other like interests in land. Do not include in the accounts for land and land rights and rights-of-way costs incurred in connection with first clearing and grading of land and rights-of-way and the damage costs associated with the construction and installation of property. The costs must be included in the appropriate property accounts directly benefited.

        (b) Where special assessments for public improvements provide for deferred payments, the full amount of the assessments must be charged to the appropriate land account and the unpaid balance must be carried in an appropriate liability account. Interest on unpaid balances must be charged to the appropriate interest account. If any part of the cost of public improvements is included in the general tax levy, the related amount must be charged to the appropriate tax account.

        (c) The net profit from the sale of timber, cord wood, sand, gravel, other resources or other property acquired with the rights-of-way or other lands must be credited to the appropriate property account to which it is related. Where land is held for a considerable period of time and timber and other natural resources on the land at the time of purchase increases in value, the net profit (after giving effect to the cost of the natural resources) from the sales of timber or its products or other natural resources must be credited to the appropriate operating income account when the land has been recorded in account 101, Service company property (§ 367.1010), otherwise to account 421, Miscellaneous income or loss (§ 367.4210).

        (d) Separate entries must be made for the acquisition, transfer, or retirement of each parcel of land, and each land right (except rights of way for distribution lines), or water right, having a life of more than one year. A record must be maintained showing the nature of ownership, full legal description, area, map reference, purpose for which used, city, county, and tax district on which situated, from whom purchased or to whom sold, payment given or received, other costs, contract date and number, date of recording of deed, and book and page of record. Entries transferring or retiring land or land rights must refer to the original entry recording its acquisition.

        (e) Any difference between the amount received from the sale of land or land rights, less agents' commissions and other costs incident to the sale, and the book cost of such land or rights, must be included in account 421.1, Gain on disposition of property (§ 367.4211), or account 421.2, Loss on disposition of property (§ 367.4212), when the property has been recorded in account 101, Service company property (§ 367.1010). Appropriate adjustments of the accounts must be made with respect to any structures or improvements located on the land sold.

        (f) The cost of buildings and other improvements (other than public improvements) must not be included in the land accounts. If, at the time of acquisition of an interest in land the interest extends to buildings or other improvements (other than public improvements) that are then devoted to operations, the land and improvements must be separately appraised and the cost allocated to land and buildings or improvements on the basis of the appraisals. If the improvements are removed or wrecked without being used in operations, the cost of removing or wrecking must be charged and the salvage credited to the account in which the cost of the land is recorded.

        (g) Provisions must be made for amortizing amounts carried in the accounts for limited-term interests in land so as to apportion equitably the cost of each interest over the life thereof. ( account 111, Accumulated provision for amortization of service company property in § 367.1110, and account 404, Amortization of limited-term property in § 367.4040.)

        § 367.57   Equipment.

#### § § 367.57

        (a) The cost of equipment chargeable to the service company property accounts, unless otherwise indicated in the text of an equipment account, includes the related net purchase price, sales taxes, investigation and inspection expenses necessary to such purchase, expenses of transportation when borne by the service company, labor employed, materials and supplies consumed, and expenses incurred by the service company in unloading and placing the equipment in readiness to operate. Also include those costs incurred in connection with the first clearing and grading of land and rights-of-way and the damage costs associated with construction and installation of property.

        (b) Exclude from equipment accounts hand and other portable tools, that are likely to be lost or stolen or that have relatively small value (for example, $500 or less) or short life, unless the correctness of the related accounting as service company property is verified by current inventories. Special tools acquired and included in the purchase price of equipment must be included in the appropriate property account. Portable drills and similar tool equipment when used in connection with the operation and maintenance of a particular plant or department, such as production, transmission, distribution, or similar items, or in stores, must be charged to the property account appropriate for their use.

        (c) The equipment accounts must include angle irons and similar items that are installed at the base of an item of equipment, but piers and foundations that are designed to be as permanent as the buildings that house the equipment, or that are constructed as a part of the building and that cannot be removed without cutting into the walls, ceilings or floors or without in some way impairing the building, must be included in the building accounts.

        (d) The cost of efficiency or other tests made subsequent to the date equipment becomes available for service must be charged to the appropriate expense accounts, except that tests to determine whether equipment meets the specifications and requirements as to efficiency, performance, and similar items, guaranteed by manufacturers, made after operations have commenced and within the period specified in the agreement or contract of purchase may be charged to the appropriate service company property account.

        § 367.58   Property record system required for service company property.

#### § § 367.58

        (a) Each service company must keep its cost allocation system so as to show the nature of each addition to or retirement of service company property, the related total cost, the source or sources of costs, and the property account or accounts to which charged or credited. Records covering jobs of short duration may be cleared monthly.

        (b) Each service company must maintain records in which, for each property account, the amounts of the annual additions and retirements are classified so as to show the number and cost of the various record units or retirement units.

        § 367.59   Additions and retirements of property.

#### § § 367.59

        (a) For the purpose of avoiding undue refinement in accounting for additions to and retirements and replacements of service company property, all property will be considered as consisting of retirement units and minor items of property. Each company must maintain a written property units listing for use in accounting for additions and retirements of property and apply the listing consistently.

        (b) The addition and retirement of retirement units must be accounted for as follows:

        (1) When a retirement unit is added, the related cost must be added to the appropriate service company property account.

        (2) When a retirement unit is retired, with or without replacement, the related book cost must be credited to the property account in which it is included, determined in the manner provided in paragraph (d) of this section. If the retirement unit is of a depreciable class, the book cost of the unit retired and credited to service company property must be charged to the accumulated provision for depreciation applicable to the property. The cost of removal and the salvage must be charged or credited, as appropriate, to the depreciation account.

        (c) The addition and retirement of minor items of property must be accounted for as follows:

        (1) When a minor item of property that did not previously exist is added to service company property, the related cost must be accounted for in the same manner as for the addition of a retirement unit, as provided in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, if a substantial addition results, otherwise the charge must be to the appropriate maintenance expense account.

        (2) When a minor item of property is retired and not replaced, the related book cost must be credited to the property account in which it is included; and, in the event the minor item is a part of depreciable property, the account for accumulated provision for depreciation must be charged with the book cost and cost of removal and credited with the salvage. If, however, the book cost of the minor item retired and not replaced has been or will be accounted for by its inclusion in the retirement unit of which it is a part when the unit is retired, no separate credit to the property account is required when the minor item is retired.

        (3) When a minor item of depreciable property is replaced independently of the retirement unit of which it is a part, the cost of replacement must be charged to the maintenance account appropriate for the item. However, if the replacement effects a substantial betterment (the primary aim of which is to make the property affected more useful, more efficient, of greater durability, or of greater capacity), the excess cost of the replacement over the estimated cost at current prices of replacing without betterment must be charged to the appropriate property account.

        (d) The book cost of service company property retired must be the amount at which the property is included in the property accounts, including all components of construction costs. The book cost must be determined from the service company's records and, if this cannot be done, it must be estimated. Service companies must furnish the particulars of the estimates to the Commission, if requested. When it is impracticable to determine the book cost of each unit, due to the relatively large number or related small cost, an appropriate average book cost of the units, with due allowance for any differences in size and character, must be used as the book cost of the units retired.

        (e) The book cost of land retired must be credited to the appropriate land account. If the land is sold, the difference between the book cost (less any accumulated provision for related depreciation or amortization that has been authorized and provided) and the sale price of the land (less commissions and other expenses of making the sale) must be recorded in accounts 421.1, Gain on disposition of property (§ 367.4211) or 421.2, Loss on disposition of property (§ 367.4212), as appropriate.

        (f) The book cost less net salvage of depreciable service company property retired must be charged in its entirety to account 108, Accumulated provision for depreciation of service company property (§ 367.1080).

        (g) The accounting for the retirement of amounts included in account 303, Miscellaneous intangible property (§ 367.3030), and the items of limited-term interest in land included in the accounts for land and land rights, must be as provided for in the text of account 111, Accumulated provision for amortization of service company property (§ 367.1110), account 404, Amortization of limited-term property (§ 367.4040), and account 405, Amortization of other property (§ 367.4050).

        § 367.82   Rents.

#### § § 367.82

        (a) The rent expense accounts provided under the several functional groups of expense accounts must include all rents, including taxes paid by the lessee on leased property, for property used in the operations of the service company, except:

        (1) Minor amounts paid for occasional or infrequent use of any property or equipment and all amounts paid for use of equipment that, if owned, would be includible in property accounts 391 to 398 (§§ 367.3910 to 367.3980), inclusive, that must be treated as an expense item and included in the appropriate functional account, and

        (2) Rents that are chargeable to clearing accounts, and distributed from the clearing accounts to the appropriate account. If rents cover property used for more than one function, such as production and transmission, or by more than one department, the rents must be apportioned to the appropriate rent expense or clearing accounts of each department on an actual, or, if necessary, an estimated basis.

        (b) When a portion of property or equipment rented from others for use in connection with service company operations is subleased, the revenue derived from the subleasing must be credited to the rent revenue account in operating revenues. However, if the rent was charged to a clearing account, amounts received from subleasing the property must be credited to the clearing account.

        (c) The cost, when incurred by the lessee, of operating and maintaining leased property, must be charged to the accounts appropriate for the expense if the property were owned.

        (d) The cost incurred by the lessee of additions and replacements to property leased from others must be accounted for as provided in Service Company Property Instruction in § 367.54.

        § 367.83   Training costs.

#### § § 367.83

        When it is necessary that employees be trained to specifically operate or maintain facilities that are being constructed, the related costs must be accounted for as a current operating and maintenance expense. These expenses must be charged to the appropriate functional accounts currently as they are incurred. However, when the training costs involved relate to facilities that are not conventional in nature, or are new to the service company's operations, these costs may be capitalized until the time that the facilities are ready for functional use.

          (b) The amounts included in this account are to be established by those charges which would have been included in net income, or accumulated other comprehensive income, determinations in the current period under the general requirements of the Uniform System of Accounts but for it being probable that such items will be included in a different period(s) for purposes of developing rates that the utility is authorized to charge for its utility services. When specific identification of the particular source of a regulatory asset cannot be made, such as in plant phase-ins, rate moderation plans, or rate levelization plans, account 407.4, Regulatory credits (§ 367.4074), must be credited.

          (b) The records supporting the entries to this account must be kept so that the service company can furnish full information as to each deferred debit included in this account.

          § 367.1880   Account 188, Research, development, or demonstration expenditures.

          (b) Costs that are minor or of a general or recurring nature must be transferred from this account to the appropriate operating expense function or, if the costs are common to the overall operations or cannot be feasibly allocated to the various operating accounts, then the costs must be recorded in account 930.2, Miscellaneous general expenses (§ 367.9302).

          (c) In certain instances, a service company may incur large and significant research, development, and demonstration expenditures that are nonrecurring and that would distort the annual research, development, and demonstration charges for the period. In such a case, the portion of such amounts that causes the distortion may be amortized to the appropriate operating expense account over a period not to exceed five years, unless otherwise authorized by the Commission.

          (d) The entries in this account must be maintained so as to show separately each project along with complete detail of the nature and purpose of the research, development, and demonstration project together with the related costs.

          (b) This account must be credited and account 410.1, Provision for deferred income taxes, operating income (§ 367.4101), or account 410.2, Provision for deferred income taxes, other income and deductions (§ 367.4102), as appropriate, must be debited with an amount equal to that by which income taxes payable for the year are lower because of prior payment of taxes as provided by paragraph (a) of this section, because of difference in timing for tax purposes of particular items of income or income deductions from that recognized by the utility for general accounting purposes. The credit to this account and debit to account 410.1 (§ 367.4101), or 410.2 (§ 367.4102) must, in general, represent the effect on taxes payable in the current year of the smaller amount of book income recognized for tax purposes as compared to the amount recognized in the service company's current accounts with respect to the item or class of items for which deferred tax accounting by the service company was authorized by the Commission.

          (c) The service company is restricted in its use of this account to the purpose provided in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.

    PART 368—PRESERVATION OF RECORDS OF HOLDING COMPANIES AND SERVICE COMPANIES

**Source:** Source: Order 684, 71 FR 65262, Nov. 7, 2006, unless otherwise noted.

      § 368.1   Promulgation.

#### § § 368.1

      This part is prescribed and promulgated as the regulations governing the preservation of records by any holding company and by any service company within a holding company system subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005 (42 U.S.C. §§ 16451 ).

      § 368.2   General instructions.

#### § § 368.2

      (a)  (1) The regulations in this part apply to all books of account and other records prepared, maintained or held by any agent or employee on behalf of the company. The specification in the schedule in § 368.3 of a record related to a type of transaction includes all documents and correspondence, not redundant or duplicative of other records retained, needed to explain or verify the transaction.

      (2) Company means a service company or a holding company as defined in § 367.1 of this chapter. Public utilities, licensees, and natural gas companies must continue to use parts 125 and 225 of this chapter.

      (3) Any company subject to this regulation, that, as agent, operator, lessor or otherwise, maintains or has possession of any records relating to the operation, property or obligations of a public utility, licensee, or natural gas company, as defined in the Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C. §§ 824 ), the Natural Gas Act (15 U.S.C. §§ 717 ), or the laws of any state within which the public utility, licensee, or natural gas company operates, must comply with the laws or regulations as to record retention and destruction which would apply to the records if they were records of the public utility, licensee, or natural gas company as codified in parts 125 and 225 of this chapter.

      (4) The regulations in this part should not be construed as excusing compliance with other lawful requirements of any other governmental body, Federal or State, prescribing other record keeping requirements or for preservation of records longer than those prescribed in this part.

      (5) To the extent that any Commission regulations may provide for a different record retention period, the records must be retained for the longer of the retention periods.

      (6) Records, other than those listed in the schedule, may be destroyed at the option of the company. However, records that are used in lieu of those listed must be preserved for the periods prescribed for the records used for substantially similar purposes. Additionally, retention of records pertaining to added services, functions, plant, and other similar service, the establishment of which cannot be presently foreseen, must conform to the principles embodied in this section.

      (7) Notwithstanding the provisions of the records retention schedule in this section, the Commission may, upon the request of the company, authorize a shorter period of retention for any record listed in the schedule upon a showing by the company that preservation of the record for a longer period is not necessary or appropriate, in the public interest or for the protection of investors or consumers.

      (b)  Each company subject to these record retention regulations must designate one or more officials to supervise the preservation or authorized destruction of its records.

      (c)  The company must provide reasonable protection from damage by fire, flood, and other hazards for records required by these record retention regulations to be preserved and, in the selection of storage space, safeguard such records from unnecessary exposure to deterioration from excessive humidity, dryness, or lack of proper ventilation.

      (d)  At each site or location where company records are kept or stored, the records must be arranged, filed, and currently indexed so that records may be readily identified and made available for inspection by authorized representatives of any regulatory agency concerned, including the Commission.

      (e)  Each company has the flexibility to select its own storage media subject to the following conditions.

      (1) The storage media must have a life expectancy at least equal to the applicable record retention period provided in § 368.3 of this chapter unless there is a quality transfer from one media to another with no loss of data.

      (2) Each company is required to implement internal control procedures that assure the reliability of, and ready access to, data stored on machine readable media. Internal control procedures must be documented by a responsible supervisory official.

      (3) Each transfer of data from one media to another must be verified for accuracy and documented. Software and hardware required to produce readable records must be retained for the same period the media format is used.

      (f)  At the expiration of the retention period, the company may use any appropriate method to destroy records. Precautions should be taken, however, to macerate or otherwise destroy the legibility of records, the content of which is forbidden by law to be divulged to unauthorized persons.

      (g)  When records are destroyed or lost before the expiration of the prescribed period of retention, a certified statement listing, as far as may be determined, the records destroyed and describing the circumstances of accidental or other premature destruction or loss must be filed with the Commission within 90 days from the date of discovery of the destruction.

      (h)  The schedule of records retention periods constitutes a part of these records retention regulations. The schedule prescribes the periods of time that designated records must be preserved. Plant records related to public utilities and licensees and natural gas companies must be retained in accordance with §§ 125.3 and 225.3 of this chapter.

      (i)  “Destroy at option” constitutes authorization for destruction of records at managements' discretion if the destruction does not conflict with other legal retention requirements or usefulness of the records in satisfying pending regulatory actions or directives. “Destroy at option after audit” requires retention until the company has received an opinion from its independent accountants with respect to the financial statements including the transactions to which the records relate.

      (j)  Holding companies and service companies must assure the availability of records of services performed by and for public utilities and licensees and natural gas companies with supporting cost information for the periods indicated in §§ 125.3 and 225.3 of this chapter as necessary to be able to readily furnish detailed information as to the nature of the transaction, the amounts involved, and the accounts used to record the transactions.

      (k)  Notwithstanding the minimum retention periods provided in these regulations, the company must retain the appropriate records to support the costs and adjustments proposed in any rate case.

      (l)  Notwithstanding the minimum requirements, if a company is involved in pending litigation, complaint procedures, proceedings remanded by the court, or governmental proceedings, it must retain all relevant records.

      (m)  Life or mortality study data for depreciation purposes must be retained for 25 years or for 10 years after property is retired, whichever is longer.

All agenda documents considered in connection with any Commission action shall be identified in such minutes.

        (2) The Secretary shall maintain a complete verbatim copy of the transcript, a complete copy of the minutes, or a complete electronic recording of each meeting, or portion of a meeting, closed to the public, for a period of at least two years after such meeting, or until one year after the conclusion of any Commission proceeding with respect to which the meeting or portion was held, whichever occurs later.

Copies of such transcript, or minutes, or a transcription of such recording shall be furnished to any person at the actual cost of duplication or transcription.

        (2) The determination of the Director of the Division of Public Information to withhold information pursuant to paragraph (f)(1) of this section may be appealed to the General Counsel or the General Counsel's designee, in accordance with § 388.107 of this chapter.

#### § § 376.208

        All outstanding Commission orders, rules and regulations shall remain in force and effect during the continuance of emergency conditions, except to the extent modified in accordance with authority exercised under this subpart.

        § 376.209   Continuity of Operations Plan and suspension of Commission operations.

#### § § 376.209

        (a)(1)(i)  The Commission's Continuity of Operations Plan may be activated by the Chairman (or the Chairman's delegate pursuant to § 376.205, as appropriate). In circumstances in which the Commission's Continuity of Operations Plan is activated, Commission headquarters operations may be temporarily disrupted in whole or in part or communications with Commission headquarters may be temporarily unavailable, either of which may prevent the public or the Commission from meeting regulatory or statutory requirements. After the Commission's Continuity of Operations Plan is activated, Commission operations other than emergency functions may be suspended in whole or in part by the Chairman (or the Chairman's delegate, as appropriate). The provisions of this section are effective upon activation of the Continuity of Operations Plan and the subsequent suspension of Commission operations, in whole or in part, and shall remain in effect up to 30 days, or such shorter time than 30 days as the Chairman (or the Chairman's delegate, as appropriate) determines to be appropriate, or such longer time than 30 days as the Commission (or the Commission's delegate pursuant to section 376.204 of this Part, as appropriate) determines to be appropriate. Resumption of Commission operations following activation of the Continuity of Operations Plan and any subsequent suspension of Commission operations, in whole or in part, may occur either simultaneously for all activities, or over time for just some activities, and in such manner and at such time, as the Chairman (or the Chairman's delegate, as appropriate) or the Commission (or the Commission's delegate, as appropriate) determines to be appropriate.

        (ii)  During periods when the Commission's Continuity of Operations Plan is activated and, following such activation, when Commission operations are subsequently suspended in whole or in part, the Chairman (or the Chairman's delegate pursuant to § 376.205, as appropriate) will notify the public that the Continuity of Operations Plan has been activated and that Commission operations have been suspended in whole or in part by sending a press release announcing that fact to major wire services, industry press, and appropriate metropolitan area radio stations The Commission's Web site () or the Commission's alternative Web site (), as appropriate, will be activated and a notice that the Continuity of Operations Plan has been activated and that Commission operations have been suspended in whole or in part will be prominently displayed thereon. The Web site or alternative Web site, as appropriate, will act as a resource for the press, industry, and general public. An additional press release will be sent to appropriate media outlets and a notice will be prominently displayed on the Commission's Web site or alternative Web site, as appropriate, when the Continuity of Operations Plan is deactivated and the Commission's headquarters are reopened or reconstituted and Commission operations resume.

        (2)  Notwithstanding other provisions of this section, during periods when the Commission's Continuity of Operations Plan is activated and, following such activation, when Commission operations are subsequently suspended in whole or in part, the Commission will continue to conduct emergency functions. As part of its emergency functions, the Commission will act on requests to ensure continued construction of essential natural gas facilities with sensitive construction timelines, on Commencement of Service requests, and on completion of dam safety work, in a manner consistent with the maintenance of environmental protections. Also as part of its emergency functions, the Commission will ensure that its personnel are available to respond to plant accidents or reportable incidents at LNG facilities, and to address dam safety, public safety, and security incidents at jurisdictional hydropower projects and to address other matters involving the safety of human life or protection of property. Alternate channels of communication will include measures to ensure that these activities can go forward unhindered.

        (b)  During periods when the Commission's Continuity of Operations Plan is activated and, following such activation, when Commission operations are suspended in whole or in relevant part, a Transmission Provider affected by the same emergency affecting the Commission may, for up to 30 days, or such other time as the Chairman (or the Chairman's delegate pursuant to § 376.205, as appropriate) may direct, delay compliance with the requirement to report to the Commission each emergency that resulted in any deviation from the standards of conduct within 24 hours of such deviation. If the emergency prevents such Transmission Provider from posting information on its OASIS or Internet Web site, the Transmission Provider may, for up to 30 days, or such shorter time as the Chairman (or the Chairman's delegate, as appropriate) may direct or such longer time as the Commission (or the Commission's delegate pursuant to § 376.204, as appropriate) may direct, also delay compliance with the requirements of § 358.4(a)(2) of this chapter to post this information on its OASIS or Internet Web site, as applicable.

        (c)  Unless otherwise directed, for those pending matters where the date that the Commission must act falls during the period when the Continuity of Operations Plan is activated and, following such activation, when Commission operations are suspended in whole or in relevant part and also during the 14 days thereafter, the Commission tolls, for purposes of further consideration, the time period in which the Commission must act. Such matters include:

        (1) 60-day period to act on requests for Exempt Wholesale Generator or Foreign Utility Company status;

        (2) 90-day period for acting on requests for certification of qualifying facility status;

        (10) 45-day protest period for protesting Prior Notice Filings, and the 30-day period for resolving and filing to withdraw such Protests;

        (11) 30-day period for acting on requests for rehearing;

        (12) Time periods for action by a presiding officer or the Motions Commissioner, as well as by the Commission, on motions to permit interlocutory appeals, interlocutory appeals and certified questions; and

        (13) 90-day period for acting on applications requesting relief from, or reinstatement of, an electric utility's mandatory purchase obligation pursuant to section 210(m) of the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978.

        (d)  Unless otherwise directed, during periods when the Commission's Continuity of Operations Plan is activated and, following such activation, when Commission operations are suspended in whole or in relevant part, the requirements to file by a certain date are suspended when communications with Commission headquarters are unavailable such that filings, submissions, and notifications cannot be received by the Commission. Unless otherwise directed by the Chairman (or the Chairman's delegate pursuant to § 376.205, as appropriate), those filings, submissions, and notifications, the filing of which was suspended, will be due the first day that communications with Commission headquarters are available such that filings, submissions, and notifications can be received by the Commission.

        (h)  During periods when the Continuity of Operations Plan is activated and, following such activation, when Commission operations are suspended in whole or in relevant part, all evidentiary hearings, prehearing conferences, settlement conferences, and other meetings before presiding officers are suspended, and any requirement that a presiding officer act on motions (including motions to permit interlocutory appeals and to certify questions) is also suspended. Service of data requests and other discovery, and responses thereto, by and to the Commission's Trial Staff is similarly suspended. Upon resumption of Commission operations in whole or in relevant part, such hearings, conferences and other meetings will be rescheduled, action on motions also will be rescheduled, and service of data requests and other discovery, and responses thereto, by and to the Commission's Trial Staff, will similarly be rescheduled, by the presiding officer or the Commission, as appropriate.

        (i)  Unless otherwise directed, if the date by which the Commission is required to act on a petition for enforcement action under section 210(h)(2) of the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 falls during a period when the Continuity of Operations Plan is activated and, following such activation, when Commission operations are suspended in whole or in relevant part, and also during the 14 days thereafter, the Commission will not initiate such an enforcement action under section 210(h)(2) of the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 and the petitioner may itself bring its own enforcement action in the appropriate court.

      § 380.1   Purpose.

#### § § 380.1

      The regulations in this part implement the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's procedures under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA). These regulations supplement the regulations of the Council on Environmental Quality, 40 CFR parts 1500 through 1508. The Commission will comply with the regulations of the Council on Environmental Quality except where those regulations are inconsistent with the statutory requirements of the Commission.

      § 380.2   Definitions and terminology.

#### § § 380.2

      For purposes of this part—

      (a)  means a category of actions described in § 380.4, which do not individually or cumulatively have a significant effect on the human environment and which the Commission has found to have no such effect and for which, therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental impact statement is required. The Commission may decide to prepare environmental assessments for the reasons stated in § 380.4(b).

      (b)  means the Federal Energy Regulatory _Commission_.

      (c)  means the _Council_ on Environmental Quality.

      (d)  means a concise public document for which the Commission is responsible that serves to:

      (1) Briefly provide sufficient evidence and analysis for determining whether to prepare an environmental impact statement or a finding of no significant impact.

      (2) Aid the Commission's compliance with NEPA when no environmental impact statement is necessary.

      (3) Facilitate preparation of a statement when one is necessary. Environmental assessments must include brief discussions of the need for the proposal, of alternatives as required by section 102(2)(E) of NEPA, of the environmental impacts of the proposed action and alternatives, and a listing of agencies and persons consulted.

      (e)  (EIS) means a detailed written statement as required by section 102(2)(C) of NEPA. DEIS means a draft EIS and FEIS means a final EIS.

      (f)  means any community that has been historically marginalized and overburdened by pollution. Environmental justice communities include, but may not be limited to, minority populations, low-income populations, or indigenous peoples.

      (g)  or ER means that part of an application submitted to the Commission by an applicant for authorization of a proposed action which includes information concerning the environment, the applicant's analysis of the environmental impact of the action, or alternatives to the action required by this or other applicable statutes or regulations.

      (h)  (FONSI) means a document by the Commission briefly presenting the reason why an action, not otherwise excluded by § 380.4, will not have a significant effect on the human environment and for which an environmental impact statement therefore will not be prepared. It must include the environmental assessment or a summary of it and must note other environmental documents related to it. If the assessment is included, the FONSI need not repeat any of the discussion in the assessment but may incorporate it by reference.

      (a)  For the actions which require an environmental assessment or environmental impact statement, environmental considerations will be addressed at appropriate major decision points.

      (1) In proceedings involving a party or parties and not set for trial-type hearing, major decision points are the approval or denial of proposals by the Commission or its designees.

      (2) In matters set for trial-type hearing, the major decision points are the initial decision of an administrative law judge or the decision of the Commission.

      (3) In a rulemaking proceeding, the major decision points are the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking and the Final Rule.

      (b)  The Commission will include environmental assessments, findings of no significant impact, or environmental impact statements, and any supplements in the record of the proceeding.

      (c)  Notwithstanding any provision in this part, the Commission may dismiss or deny an application without performing an environmental impact statement or without undertaking environmental analysis.

      § 380.12   Environmental reports for Natural Gas Act applications.

#### § § 380.12

      (a)  (1) The applicant must submit an environmental report with any application that proposes the construction, operation, or abandonment of any facility identified in § 380.3(c)(2)(i). The environmental report shall consist of the thirteen resource reports and related material described in this section.

      (2) The detail of each resource report must be commensurate with the complexity of the proposal and its potential for environmental impact. Each topic in each resource report shall be addressed or its omission justified, unless the resource report description indicates that the data is not required for that type of proposal. If material required for one resource report is provided in another resource report or in another exhibit, it may be incorporated by reference. If any resource report topic is required for a particular project but is not provided at the time the application is filed, the environmental report shall explain why it is missing and when the applicant anticipates it will be filed.

      (3) The appendix to this part contains a checklist of the minimum filing requirements for an environmental report. Failure to provide at least the applicable checklist items will result in rejection of the application unless the Director of the Office of Energy Projects determines that the applicant has provided an acceptable reason for the item's absence and an acceptable schedule for filing it. Failure to file within the accepted schedule will result in rejection of the application.

      (b)  As appropriate, each resource report shall:

      (1) Address conditions or resources that might be directly or indirectly affected by the project;

      (2) Identify significant environmental effects expected to occur as a result of the project;

      (3) Identify the effects of construction, operation (including maintenance and malfunctions), and termination of the project, as well as cumulative effects resulting from existing or reasonably foreseeable projects;

      (4) Identify measures proposed to enhance the environment or to avoid, mitigate, or compensate for adverse effects of the project;

      (5) Provide a list of publications, reports, and other literature or communications, including agency contacts, that were cited or relied upon to prepare each report. This list should include the name and title of the person contacted, their affiliations, and telephone number;

      (6) Whenever this section refers to “mileposts” the applicant may substitute “survey centerline stationing” if so desired. However, whatever method is chosen should be used consistently throughout the resource reports.

      (c)  This report is required for all applications. It will describe facilities associated with the project, special construction and operation procedures, construction timetables, future plans for related construction, compliance with regulations and codes, and permits that must be obtained. Resource Report 1 must:

      (1) Describe and provide location maps of all jurisdictional facilities, including all aboveground facilities associated with the project (such as: meter stations, pig launchers/receivers, valves), to be constructed, modified, abandoned, replaced, or removed, including related construction and operational support activities and areas such as maintenance bases, staging areas, communications towers, power lines, and new access roads (roads to be built or modified). As relevant, the report must describe the length and diameter of the pipeline, the types of aboveground facilities that would be installed, and associated land requirements. It must also identify other companies that must construct jurisdictional facilities related to the project, where the facilities would be located, and where they are in the Commission's approval process.

      (2) Identify and describe all nonjurisdictional facilities, including auxiliary facilities, that will be built in association with the project, including facilities to be built by other companies.

        (b)  The costs determined under paragraph (a) of this section will be assessed as annual charges to each public utility providing transmission service based on the proportion of the megawatt-hours of transmission of electric energy in interstate commerce of each such public utility in the immediately preceding reporting year (either a calendar year or fiscal year, depending on which accounting convention is used by the public utility to be charged) to the sum of the megawatt-hours of transmission of electric energy in interstate commerce in the immediately preceding reporting year of all such public utilities.

        (c)  (1) For purposes of computing annual charges, as of January 1, 2002, a public utility, as defined in § 382.102(b), that provides transmission service must submit under oath to the Office of the Secretary by April 30 of each year an original and conformed copies of the following information (designated as FERC Reporting Requirement No. 582 (FERC-582)): The total megawatt-hours of transmission of electric energy in interstate commerce, which for purposes of computing the annual charges and for purposes of this reporting requirement, will be measured by the sum of the megawatt-hours of all unbundled transmission (including MWh delivered in wheeling transactions and MWh delivered in exchange transactions) and the megawatt-hours of all bundled wholesale power sales (to the extent these latter megawatt-hours were not separately reported as unbundled transmission). This information must be reported to 3 decimal places;  3,105 KWh will be reported as 3.105 MWh.

        (2) Corrections to the information reported on FERC-582, as of January 1, 2002, must be submitted under oath to the Office of the Secretary on or before the end of each calendar year in which the information was originally reported (i.e., on or before the last day of the year that the Commission is open to accept such filings).

        (d)  The adjusted costs of administration of the electric regulatory program as it applies to Power Marketing Agencies will be assessed against each power marketing agency based on the proportion of the megawatt-hours of sales of each power marketing agency in the immediately preceding reporting year (either a calendar year or fiscal year, depending on which accounting convention is used by the power marketing agency to be charged) to the sum of the megawatt-hours of sales in the immediately preceding reporting year of all power marketing agencies being assessed annual charges.

        (a) The adjusted costs of administration of the oil regulatory program will be assessed against each oil pipeline company based on the proportion of the total operation revenues of each oil pipeline company for the immediately preceding calendar year to the sum of the operating revenues for the immediately preceding calendar year of all oil pipeline companies being assessed annual charges.

        (b) No oil pipeline company's annual charge may exceed a maximum charge established each year by the Commission to equal 6.339 percent of the adjusted costs of administration of the oil regulatory program. The maximum charge will be rounded to the nearest $1000. For every company with an annual charge determined to be above the maximum charge, that company's annual charge will be set at the maximum charge, and any amount above the maximum charge will be reapportioned to the remaining companies. The reapportionment will be computed using the method outlined in paragraph (a) of this section (but excluding any company whose annual charge is already set at the maximum amount). This procedure will be repeated until no company's annual charge exceeds the maximum charge.

        (1) If the deponent is a witness at a hearing, any participant may use the deposition of that witness at the time of the witness' examination to contradict, impeach, or complete the testimony of that witness.

        (2) Any objection to the taking of a deposition based on the disqualification of the officer before whom it is to be taken is waived, unless the objection is made before the deposition begins or as soon thereafter as the disqualification becomes known or could be discovered with reasonable diligence.

        (3) Any objection to the competency of the witness or the competency, relevancy, or materiality of testimony is not waived by failure to make the objection before or during the taking of the deposition, unless the basis for the objection might have been removed if the objection had been presented at the taking of the deposition.

        (4) Any objection to errors and irregularities occurring at the oral examination in the manner of taking the deposition, in the form of the questions and answers, in the oath or affirmation, or in the conduct of participants, and errors of any kind that might be obviated, removed or cured if presented at the deposition, is waived unless objection is made at the taking of the deposition.

        (5) Any objection based on errors or irregularities in the manner in which the testimony is transcribed or the deposition is prepared, signed, certified, endorsed, or otherwise dealt with by the officer is waived, unless the objection is made with reasonable promptness after the defect is, or with due diligence should have been, ascertained.

        (b)  A request for inspection of documents or property under this section must describe with reasonable particularity the documents or other property to which access is sought. The request must also specify a reasonable time, place, and manner of making the inspection.

        § 385.408   Admissions (Rule 408).

#### § § 385.408

        (a)  A participant may serve upon any other participant a written request for admission of the genuineness of any document or the truth of any matter of fact. The request must be served upon all participants.

        (b)  (1) Any request for admission of the genuineness of a document must be accompanied by a legible copy of the document, unless it was previously furnished, is in the possession of the recipient of the request, or is readily available for inspection and copying.

        (2) The truth of specified matters of fact or the genuineness of the documents described in a request are deemed admitted unless, within 20 days after service of the request or any longer period designated in the request, the participant that receives the request serves upon the requesting participant a written answer or objection addressed to the matters in the request.

        (3) An answer must specifically admit or deny the truth of the matters in the request or set forth in detail the reasons why the answering participant cannot admit or deny the truth of each matter. A denial of the truthfulness of the requested admission must fairly discuss the substance of the requested admission and, when good faith requires that a participant qualify the answer or deny only a part of the matter of which an admission is requested, the participant must specify that which is true and qualify or deny the remainder. The answer must be served on all participants.

        (c)  Any admission made by a participant under this section is for the purpose of the pending proceeding only, is not an admission for any other purpose, and may not be used against the participant in any other proceeding. Any matter admitted under this rule is conclusively established unless the presiding officer, on motion, permits withdrawal or amendment of the admission. The presiding officer may permit withdrawal or amendment of an admission, if the presiding officer finds that the presentation of the merits of the proceeding will be promoted and the participant who obtained the admission has failed to satisfy the presiding officer that withdrawal or amendment of the admission will prejudice that participant in maintaining his position in the proceeding.

        § 385.409   Subpoenas (Rule 409).

#### § § 385.409

        (a)  On request, the presiding officer may issue a subpoena for the attendance of a witness at a deposition or hearing or for the production of documents. A request for a subpoena must be served on all participants.

        (b)  A subpoena issued under this section must be served by personal service, substituted service, registered mail, or certified mail. A subpoena may be served by the marshal, by his deputy, or by any other person who is not a party or an employee of a party and is at least 18 years of age. If personal service is made by any person other than a United States marshal or deputy marshal, return of service must be accompanied by an affidavit to the Secretary or the presiding officer and must state the time and manner of service of the subpoena.

        (c)  Fees paid to subpoenaed persons will be in accordance with Rule 510(e).

        (d)  Objections to subpoenas must be made in accordance with Rule 410.

        § 385.410   Objections to discovery, motions to quash or to compel, and protective orders (Rule 410).

#### § § 385.410

        (a) —(1)  A participant, or a recipient of a subpoena, who does not intend to comply with a discovery request must notify in writing the participant seeking discovery within a reasonable time in advance of the date on which a response or other action in conformance with the discovery request is due. A recipient of a subpoena may either provide a notice of objection or file a motion to quash.

        (2)  (i) Unless an objection to discovery under this section is based on the ground that production would impose an undue burden, the objecting participant must provide the participant seeking discovery with a schedule of items withheld and a statement of:

        (A) The character and specific subject matter of each item; and

        (B) The specific objection asserted for each item.

        (ii) If an objection under this section is based on the ground that production of the requested material would impose an undue burden, the objecting participant must provide the participant seeking discovery with a description of the approximate number of documents that would have to be produced and a summary of the information contained in such documents.

        (3)  If the discovery to which objection is made is not a request for documents, the objection must clearly state the grounds on which the participant bases its objection.

        (4)  The fact that information has not been compiled or processed in the form requested is not a basis for objection unless the objection presents grounds for limiting discovery under paragraph (c) of this section.

        (b)  Any participant seeking discovery may file a motion to compel discovery, if:

        (1) A participant to whom a data request is made or upon whom an interrogatory is served under Rule 406 fails or refuses to make a full, complete, and accurate response;

        (2) A person named in a notice of intent to take a deposition or a subpoena fails or refuses to appear for the deposition;

        (3) An organization named in a notice of intent to take a deposition fails or refuses to designate one or more persons to testify on its behalf under Rule 404(b)(3);

        (4) A deponent fails or refuses to answer fully, completely, and accurately a question propounded or to sign the transcript of the testimony as required by Rule 404(f)(2);

        (5) A participant upon whom a request for admissions is served fails or refuses to respond to the request in accordance with Rule 408(b); or

        (6) A participant upon whom an order to produce or to permit inspection or entry is served under Rule 407 fails or refuses to comply with that order.

        (c)  A presiding officer may, by order, deny or limit discovery or restrict public disclosure of discoverable matter in order to:

        (1) Protect a participant or other person from undue annoyance, burden, harassment or oppression;

        (2) Prevent undue delay in the proceeding;

        (3) Preserve a privilege of a participant, person, or governmental agency;

        (4) Prevent a participant from requiring another participant to provide information which is readily available to the requesting participant from other sources with a reasonable expenditure of effort given the requesting participant's position and resources;

        (5) Prevent unreasonably cumulative or duplicative discovery requests; or

        (6) Provide a means by which confidential matters may be made available to participants so as to prevent public disclosure. Material submitted under a protective order may nevertheless be subject to Freedom of Information Act requests and review.

        (d) —(1)  (i) In the absence of controlling Commission precedent, privileges will be determined in accordance with decisions of the Federal courts with due consideration to the Commission's need to obtain information necessary to discharge its regulatory responsibilities.

        (ii) A presiding officer may not quash a subpoena or otherwise deny or limit discovery on the ground of privilege unless the presiding officer expressly finds that the privilege claimed is applicable. If a presiding officer finds that a qualified privilege has been established, the participant seeking discovery must make a showing sufficient to warrant discovery despite the qualified privilege.

        (iii) A presiding officer may issue a protective order under Rule 410(c) to deny or limit discovery in order to preserve a privilege of a participant, person, or governmental agency.

        (2)  (i) If discovery under this subpart would require the production of Commission information, documents, or other matter that might fall within a privilege, the Commission trial staff must identify in writing the applicable privilege along with the matters claimed to be privileged or the individuals from whom privileged information is sought, to the presiding officer and the parties.

        (ii) If the presiding officer determines that the privilege claimed for the Commission is applicable, the Commission information, documents, or other matter may not be produced. If the presiding officer determines that no privilege is applicable, that a privilege is waived, or that a qualified privilege is overcome, the presiding officer will certify the matter to the Commission in accordance with Rule 714. Certification to the Commission under this paragraph must describe the material to be disclosed and the reasons which, in the presiding officer's view, justify disclosure. The information will not be disclosed unless the Commission affirmatively orders the material disclosed.

#### § § 385.411

        (a)  If a participant or any other person fails to obey an order compelling discovery, the presiding officer may, after notice to the participant or person and an opportunity to be heard, take one or more of the following actions, but may not dismiss or otherwise terminate the proceeding:

        (1) Certify the matter to the Commission with a recommendation for dismissal or termination of the proceeding, termination of that participant's right to participate in the proceeding, institution of civil action, or any other sanction available to the Commission by law;

        (2) Order that the matters to which the order compelling discovery relates are taken as established for the purposes of the proceeding in accordance with the position of the participant obtaining the order;

        (3) Order that a participant be precluded from supporting or opposing such positions or introducing such matters in evidence as the presiding officer designates;

        (4) Order that all or part of any pleading by a participant be struck or that the proceeding or a phase of the proceeding be stayed until the order compelling discovery is obeyed; and

        (5) Recommend to the Commission that it take action under Rule 2102 against a representative of the participant if the presiding officer believes that the representative has engaged in unethical or improper professional conduct.

        (b)  If the person disobeying an order compelling discovery is an agent, officer, employee, attorney, partner, or director of a participant, the presiding officer may take any of the actions described in paragraph (a) against that participant.

#### § § 385.509

        (a)  The presiding officer should exclude from evidence any irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious material.

The presiding officer may also direct the preparation and distribution of any briefs and other documents which the presiding officer determines will substantially expedite the proceeding.

        (i) The presiding officer, if the offer is filed after a hearing has been ordered under subpart E of this part and before the presiding officer certifies the record to the Commission; or

        (ii) The Commission.

        (3) If an offer of settlement pertains to multiple proceedings that are in part pending before the Commission and in part set for hearing, any participant may by motion request the Commission to consolidate the multiple proceedings and to provide any other appropriate procedural relief for purposes of disposition of the settlement.

        (c)  (1) An offer of settlement must include:

        (i) The settlement offer;

        (ii) A separate explanatory statement;

        (iii) Copies of, or references to, any document, testimony, or exhibit, including record citations if there is a record, and any other matters that the offerer considers relevant to the offer of settlement; and

        (e)  (1) An offer of settlement that is not approved by the Commission, and any comment on that offer, is not admissible in evidence against any participant who objects to its admission.

        (2) Any discussion of the parties with respect to an offer of settlement that is not approved by the Commission is not subject to discovery or admissible in evidence.

        (f)  (1) A comment on an offer of settlement must be filed with the Secretary who will transmit the comment to the Commission, if the offer of settlement was transmitted to the Commission, or to the presiding officer in any other case.

        (3) Any failure to file a comment constitutes a waiver of all objections to the offer of settlement.

        (4) Any comment that contests an offer of settlement by alleging a dispute as to a genuine issue of material fact must include an affidavit detailing any genuine issue of material fact by specific reference to documents, testimony, or other items included in the offer of settlement, or items not included in the settlement, that are relevant to support the claim. Reply comments may include responding affidavits.

        (g)  (1) If comments on an offer are transmitted to the presiding officer and the presiding officer finds that the offer is not contested by any participant, the presiding officer will certify to the Commission the offer of settlement, a statement that the offer of settlement is uncontested, and any hearing record or pleadings which relate to the offer of settlement.

        (2) If comments on an offer of settlement are transmitted to the Commission, the Commission will determine whether the offer is uncontested.

        (3) An uncontested offer of settlement may be approved by the Commission upon a finding that the settlement appears to be fair and reasonable and in the public interest.

        (h)  (1)(i) If the Commission determines that any offer of settlement is contested in whole or in part, by any party, the Commission may decide the merits of the contested settlement issues, if the record contains substantial evidence upon which to base a reasoned decision or the Commission determines there is no genuine issue of material fact.

        (ii) If the Commission finds that the record lacks substantial evidence or that the contesting parties or contested issues can not be severed from the offer of settlement, the Commission will:

        (A) Establish procedures for the purpose of receiving additional evidence before a presiding officer upon which a decision on the contested issues may reasonably be based; or

        (B) Take other action which the Commission determines to be appropriate.

        (ii) Any offer of settlement or part of any offer may be certified to the Commission if the presiding officer determines that there is no genuine issue of material fact. Any certification by the presiding officer must contain the determination that there is no genuine issue of material fact and any hearing record or pleadings which relate to the offer or part of the offer being certified.

        (iii) Any offer of settlement or part of any offer may be certified to the Commission, if:

        (A) The parties concur on a motion for omission of the initial decision as provided in Rule 710, or, if all parties do not concur in the motion, the presiding officer determines that omission of the initial decision is appropriate under Rule 710(d), and

        (B) The presiding officer determines that the record contains substantial evidence from which the Commission may reach a reasoned decision on the merits of the contested issues.

        (iv) If any contesting parties or contested issues are severable, the uncontested portions of the settlement may be certified immediately by the presiding officer to the Commission for decision, as provided in paragraph (g) of this section.

        (i)  Any procedural right that a participant has in the absence of an offer of settlement is not affected by Commission disapproval, or approval subject to condition, of the uncontested portion of the offer of settlement.

        § 385.603   Settlement of negotiations before a settlement judge (Rule 603).

#### § § 385.603

        (a)  This section applies to any proceeding set for hearing under subpart E of this part and to any other proceeding in which the Commission has ordered the appointment of a settlement judge.

        (b)  For purposes of this section,  means the administrative law judge appointed by the Chief Administrative Law Judge to conduct settlement negotiations under this section.

        (c)  (1) Any participant may file a motion requesting the appointment of a settlement judge with the presiding officer, or, if there is no presiding officer for the proceeding, with the Commission.

        (2) A presiding officer may request the Chief Administrative Law Judge to appoint a settlement judge.

        (3) A motion under paragraph (c)(1) of this section may be acted upon at any time, and the time limitations on answers in Rule 213(d) do not apply.

        (4) Any answer or objection filed after a motion has been acted upon will not be considered.

        (d)  The Commission may, on motion or otherwise, order the Chief Administrative Law Judge to appoint a settlement judge.

        (e)  The Chief Administrative Law Judge may appoint a settlement judge for any proceeding, if requested by the presiding officer under paragraph (c)(2) of this section or if the presiding officer concurs in a motion made under paragraph (c)(1) of this section.

        (f)  The Chief Administrative Law Judge will appoint a settlement judge by an order, which specifies whether, and to what extent, the proceeding is suspended pending termination of settlement negotiations conducted in accordance with this section. The order may confine the scope of any settlement negotiations to specified issues.

        (g)  (1) A settlement judge will convene and preside over conferences and settlement negotiations between the participants and assess the practicalities of a potential settlement.

        (2)(i) A settlement judge will report to the Chief Administrative Law Judge or the Commission, as appropriate, describing the status of the settlement negotiations and evaluating settlement prospects.

        (ii) In any such report, the settlement judge may recommend the termination or continuation of settlement negotiations conducted under this section.

        (iii) The first report by the settlement judge will be made not later than 30 days after the appointment of the settlement judge. The Commission or the Chief Administrative Law Judge may order additional reports at any time.

        (h)  Unless an order of the Commission directing the appointment of a settlement judge provides otherwise, settlement negotiations conducted under this section will terminate upon the order of the Chief Administrative Law Judge issued after consultation with the settlement judge.

        § 385.604   Alternative means of dispute resolution (Rule 604).

#### § § 385.604

        (a)  (1) Participants may, subject to the limitations of paragraph (a)(2) of this section, use alternative means of dispute resolution to resolve all or part of any pending matter if the participants agree. The alternative means of dispute resolution authorized under subpart F of this part will be voluntary procedures that supplement rather than limit other available dispute resolution techniques.

        (2) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, the decisional authority will not consent to use of an alternative dispute resolution proceeding if:

        (i) A definitive or authoritative resolution of the matter is required for precedential value;

        (ii) The matter involves or may bear upon significant questions of policy that require additional procedures before a final resolution may be made, and the proceeding would not likely serve to develop a recommended policy;

        (iii) Maintaining established policies is of special importance;

        (iv) The matter significantly affects persons or organizations who are not parties to the proceeding;

        (v) A full public record of the proceeding is important, and a dispute resolution proceeding cannot provide a record; or

        (vi) The Commission must maintain continuing jurisdiction over the matter with authority to alter the disposition of the matter in the light of changed circumstances, and a dispute resolution proceeding would interfere with the Commission's fulfilling that requirement.

        (3) If one or more of the factors outlined in paragraph (a)(2) of this section is present, alternative dispute resolution may nevertheless be used if the alternative dispute resolution proceeding can be structured to avoid the identified factor or if other concerns significantly outweigh the identified factor.

        (4) A determination to use or not to use a dispute resolution proceeding under subpart F of this part is not subject to judicial review.

        (5) Settlement agreements reached through the use of alternative dispute resolution pursuant to subpart F of this part will be subject to the provisions of Rule 602, unless the decisional authority, upon motion or otherwise, orders a different procedure.

        (b)  For the purposes of subpart F of this part:

        (1)  means any procedure that is used, in lieu of an adjudication, to resolve issues in controversy, including but not limited to, settlement negotiations, conciliation, facilitation, mediation, factfinding, minitrials, and arbitration, or any combination thereof;

        (2)  means any decision by an arbitrator resolving the issues in controversy;

        (3)  means any oral or written communication prepared for the purposes of a dispute resolution proceeding, including any memoranda, notes or work product of the neutral, parties or non-party participant. A written agreement to enter into a dispute resolution proceeding, or a final written agreement or arbitral award reached as a result of a dispute resolution proceeding, is not a dispute resolution communication;

        (4)  means any alternative means of dispute resolution that is used to resolve an issue in controversy in which a neutral may be appointed and specified parties participate;

        (5)  means information is provided:

        (i) With the expressed intent of the source that it not be disclosed, or

        (ii) Under circumstances that create a reasonable expectation on behalf of the source that the information will not be disclosed;

        (6)  means an issue which is or is anticipated to be material to a decision in a proceeding before the Commission and which is the subject of disagreement between participants who would be substantially affected by the decision or between the Commission and any such participants;

        (7)  means an individual who, with respect to an issue in controversy, functions specifically to aid the parties in resolving the controversy;

        (8)  in a dispute resolution proceeding that is used to resolve an issue in controversy in a proceeding involving an application for a license or exemption to construct, operate, and maintain a hydroelectric project pursuant to the Federal Power Act or the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act shall include such state and federal agencies and Indian tribes as have statutory roles or a direct interest in such hydroelectric proceedings.

        (c)  (1) A neutral may be a permanent or temporary officer or employee of the Federal Government (including an administrative law judge), or any other individual who is acceptable to the participants to a dispute resolution proceeding. A neutral must have no official, financial, or personal conflict of interest with respect to the issues in controversy, except that a neutral who is not a government employee may serve if the interest is fully disclosed in writing to all participants and all participants agree.

        (2) A neutral serves at the will of the participants, unless otherwise provided.

        (3) Neutrals may be selected from among the Commission's administrative law judges or other employees, from rosters kept by the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, the Administrative Conference of the United States, the American Arbitration Association, or from any other source.

        (d)  (1) The participants may at any time submit a written proposal to use alternative means of dispute resolution to resolve all or part of any matter in controversy or anticipated to be in controversy before the Commission.

        (2) For matters set for hearing under subpart E of this part, a proposal to use alternative means of dispute resolution must be filed with the presiding administrative law judge.

        (3) For all other matters, a proposal to use alternative means of dispute resolution may be filed with the Secretary for consideration by the appropriate decisional authority.

        (4) The appropriate decisional authority will issue an order, approving or denying, under the guidelines in Rule 604(a) (2) and (3), a proposal to use alternative means of dispute resolution. Denial of a proposal to use alternative dispute resolution will be in the form of an order and will identify the specific reasons for the denial. A proposal to use alternative dispute resolution is deemed approved unless an order denying approval is issued within 30 days after the proposal is filed.

        (5) Any request to modify a previously-approved ADR proposal must follow the same procedure used for the initial approval.

        (e)  A proposal to use alternative means of dispute resolution must be in writing and include:

        (1) A general identification of the issues in controversy intended to be resolved by the proposed alternative dispute resolution method,

        (2) A description of the alternative dispute resolution method(s) to be used,

        (3) The signatures of all participants or evidence otherwise indicating the consent of all participants; and

        (4) A certificate of service pursuant to Rule 2010(h).

        (f)  The decisional authority may order reports on the status of the alternative dispute resolution proceeding at any time.

        § 385.605   Arbitration (Rule 605).

#### § § 385.605

        (a)  (1) The participants may at any time submit a written proposal to use binding arbitration under the provisions of Rule 605 to resolve all or part of any matter in controversy, or anticipated to be in controversy, before the Commission.

        (2) The proposal must be submitted as provided in Rule 604(d).

        (3) The proposal must be in writing and contain the information required in Rule 604(e).

        (4) An arbitration proceeding under this rule may be monitored as provided in Rule 604(f).

        (b)  (1) The participants to an arbitration proceeding are entitled to select the arbitrator.

        (2) The arbitrator must be a neutral who meets the criteria of a neutral under Rule 604(c).

        (1) Regulate the course of and conduct arbitral hearings;

        (2) Administer oaths and affirmations;

        (3) Compel the attendance of witnesses and the production of evidence to the extent the Commission is authorized by law to do so; and

        (4) Make awards.

        (d)  (1) The arbitrator will set a time and place for the hearing on the dispute and must notify the participants not less than 5 days before the hearing.

        (2) Any participant wishing that there be a record of the hearing must:

        (i) Prepare the record;

        (ii) Notify the other participants and the arbitrator of the preparation of the record;

        (iii) Furnish copies to all identified participants and the arbitrator; and

        (iv) Pay all costs for the record, unless the participants agree otherwise or the arbitrator determines that the costs should be apportioned.

        (3)(i) Participants to the arbitration are entitled to be heard, to present evidence material to the controversy, and to cross-examine witnesses appearing at the hearing to the same extent as in a proceeding under Subpart E of this part;

        (ii) The arbitrator may, with the consent of the participants, conduct all or part of the hearing by telephone, television, computer, or other electronic means, if each participant has an opportunity to participate.

        (iii) The hearing must be conducted expeditiously and in an informal manner.

        (iv) The arbitrator may receive any oral or documentary evidence, except that irrelevant, immaterial, unduly repetitious, or privileged evidence may be excluded by the arbitrator.

        (v) The arbitrator will interpret and apply relevant statutory and regulatory requirements, legal precedents, and policy directives.

        (4) No interested person will make or knowingly cause to be made to the arbitrator an unauthorized  communication relevant to the merits of the proceeding, unless the participants agree otherwise. If a communication is made in violation of this prohibition, the arbitrator will ensure that a memorandum of the communication is prepared and made a part of the record, and that an opportunity for rebuttal is allowed. Upon receipt of such communication, the arbitrator may require the offending participant to show cause why the claim of the participant should not be resolved against the participant as a result of the improper conduct.

        (5) The arbitrator will make the award within 30 days after the close of the hearing or the date of the filing of any briefs authorized by the arbitrator, whichever date is later, unless the participants and the arbitrator agree to some other time limit.

        (e)  (1)(i) The award in an arbitration proceeding under Subpart F of this chapter will include a brief, informal discussion of the factual and legal basis for the award.

        (ii) The prevailing participants must file the award with the Commission, along with proof of service on all participants.

        (3) A final award is binding on the participants to the arbitration proceeding.

        (4) An award may not serve as an estoppel in any other proceeding for any issue that was resolved in the proceeding. The award also may not be used as precedent or otherwise be considered in any factually unrelated proceeding or in any other arbitration proceeding.

        § 385.606   Confidentiality in dispute resolution proceedings (Rule 606).

#### § § 385.606

        (a) Except as provided in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section, a neutral in a dispute resolution proceeding shall not voluntarily disclose, or through discovery or compulsory process be required to disclose, any information concerning any dispute resolution communication or any communication provided in confidence to the neutral, unless:

        (1) All participants in the dispute resolution proceeding and the neutral consent in writing;

        (2) The dispute resolution communication has otherwise already been made public;

        (3) The dispute resolution communication is required by statute to be made public, but a neutral should make the communication public only if no other person is reasonably available to disclose the communication; or

        (4) A court determines that the testimony or disclosure is necessary to:

        (i) Prevent a manifest injustice;

        (ii) Help establish a violation of law; or

        (iii) Prevent harm to the public health or safety of sufficient magnitude in the particular case to outweigh the integrity of dispute resolution proceedings in general by reducing the confidence of participants in future cases that their communications will remain confidential.

        (b) A participant in a dispute resolution proceeding shall not voluntarily disclose, or through discovery or compulsory process be required to disclose, any information concerning any dispute resolution communication, unless:

        (1) All participants to the dispute resolution proceeding consent in writing;

        (2) The dispute resolution communication has otherwise already been made public;

        (3) The dispute resolution communication is required by statute to be made public;

        (4) A court determines that the testimony or disclosure is necessary to:

        (i) Prevent a manifest injustice;

        (ii) Help establish a violation of law; or

        (iii) Prevent harm to the public health and safety of sufficient magnitude in the particular case to outweigh the integrity of dispute resolution proceedings in general by reducing the confidence of participants in future cases that their communications will remain confidential; or

        (5) The dispute resolution communication is relevant to determining the existence or meaning of an agreement or award that resulted from the dispute resolution proceeding or to the enforcement of the agreement or award.

        (c) Any dispute resolution communication that is disclosed in violation of paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section shall not be admissible in any proceeding.

        (d)(1) The participants may agree to alternative confidential procedures for disclosures by a neutral. The participants must inform the neutral before the commencement of the dispute resolution proceeding of any modifications to the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section that will govern the confidentiality of the dispute resolution proceeding. If the participants do not so inform the neutral, paragraph (a) of this section shall apply.

        (2) To qualify for the exemption established under paragraph (l) of this section, an alternative confidential procedure under this paragraph may not provide for less disclosure than confidential procedures otherwise provided under this rule.

        (e) If a demand for disclosure, by way of discovery request or other legal process, is made upon a participant regarding a dispute resolution communication, the participant will make reasonable efforts to notify the neutral and the other participants of the demand. Any participant who receives the notice and within 15 calendar days does not offer to defend a refusal of the neutral to disclose the requested information waives any objection to the disclosure.

        (f) Nothing in Rule 606 prevents the discovery or admissibility of any evidence that is otherwise discoverable, merely because the evidence was presented in the course of a dispute resolution proceeding.

        (g) Paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section do not preclude disclosure of information and data that are necessary to document an agreement reached or order issued pursuant to a dispute resolution proceeding.

        (h) Paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section do not prevent the gathering of information for research and educational purposes, in cooperation with other agencies, governmental entities, or dispute resolution programs, so long as the participants and the specific issues in controversy are not identifiable.

        (i) Paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section do not prevent use of a dispute resolution communication to resolve a dispute between the neutral in a dispute resolution proceeding and a participant in the proceeding, so long as the communication is disclosed only to the extent necessary to resolve the dispute.

        (j) Nothing in this section precludes parties from seeking privileged treatment for documents under this chapter.

        (k) Where disclosure is authorized by this section, nothing in this section precludes use of a protective agreement or protective orders.

        (l) A dispute resolution communication that may not be disclosed under this rule shall also be exempt from disclosure under 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(3).

#### § § 385.905

        (a) Upon commencement of a proceeding, the contested order will be automatically stayed pending review pursuant to this subpart unless and until, upon request of the Secretary or other participant, the presiding officer finds that the public interest requires immediate compliance with the contested order.

        (b) The Secretary or other participants may at any time prior to the hearing under Rule 909 (Hearing), if requested; or, if there is no hearing, within 30 days of the commencement of the proceeding under Rule 904 (Commencement of proceeding); file a petition requesting that the contested order not be stayed, or that the stay be lifted, and setting forth the legal and factual basis for the request.

        (d) The presiding officer may grant the petition requesting immediate compliance where he finds that the public interest so requires and will notify the participants of the determination.

        (e) If the presiding officer does not grant the petition under paragraph (b) of this section within 10 days after it is filed, the petition is denied. Prior to the expiration of the 10-day period the presiding officer may extend the period for decision for up to 7 days. At the end of the extension, the petition, if not granted, is denied.

        (f) If the petition under paragraph (b) of this section is denied, the presiding officer will notify the participants of such denial.

        § 385.906   Pleadings (Rule 906).

#### § § 385.906

        (a)  (1) Within 20 days after the commencement of a proceeding, the Secretary:

        (i) Will file with the Secretary for the presiding officer a copy of the contested order; and

        (ii) May, in addition, elect to file a statement setting forth the factual elements of the alleged violation, which statement the Secretary will serve on all participants in the proceeding.

        (2) If the petitioner requests permission to raise new facts or issues pursuant to Rule 907(a) (new facts and issues), the Secretary may file, within 10 days after the filing of the petitioner's answer, a reply responding to the petitioner's request to raise new facts or issues. In the reply, the Secretary may also request the permission of the presiding officer to raise new facts or issues under the criteria set forth in Rule 907(b) (new facts and issues) and to conduct discovery relating to the new facts or issues he may raise pursuant to Rule 907(b) (new facts and issues). Failure by the Secretary to request permission to raise new facts or issues or to conduct discovery in this reply constitutes a waiver of the opportunity to do so at a later time in the proceeding.

        (3) The Secretary will file with the Secretary of the Commission, for the presiding officer, and serve upon other participants in the proceedings, a brief in support of the affirmative case, which will set forth:

        (i) The elements of the alleged violation, including references to the authorities upon which the Secretary relies, including but not limited to regulations, rulings, interpretations and decisions on appeals and exceptions issued by the Department or its predecessor agencies and precedents established by the Commission; and

        (ii) A complete statement of the factual and legal basis of the contested order.

        (4) The Secretary's brief will be filed according to the following time period appropriate to the particular proceeding:

        (i) If no participant (including persons requesting intervention) has requested permission to raise new facts or issues or to conduct discovery pursuant to paragraphs (a)(2), (b)(2), (c)(7), and (c)(8) of this section, within 20 days after the filing of the petitioner's answer under paragraph (b)(1) of this section;

        (ii) If the presiding officer has determined, under Rule 908(d) (discovery) that no discovery shall be permitted, within 20 days after the presiding officer's determination under such rule;

        (iii) If discovery is permitted under Rule 908(d) (discovery) within 20 days after the conclusion of the time period set for discovery under such rule;

        (b)  (1) Within 15 days after petitioner gives written notice to the Office of Hearings and Appeals of the Department of Energy pursuant to 10 CFR 205.199C(b) that petitioner wishes to appeal the remedial order, the petitioner must file with the Secretary of the Commission, for the presiding officer, and serve upon the Secretary and other participants in the proceedings, an answer to the contested order admitting or denying each of the Secretary's findings in the contested order and setting forth affirmative defenses, if any. Each answer filed with the Secretary of the Commission by the petitioner, in accordance with this paragraph, must be accompanied by the fee prescribed by § 381.303 of this chapter.

        (2) In the answer, the petitioner may:

        (i) Contest any part of the record;

        (ii) Request permission to raise new facts or issues not raised in the prior proceedings if the new facts or issues meet the criteria set forth in Rule 907(a) (new facts and issues); and

        (iii) Request permission to conduct discovery, subject to criteria provided in Rule 908(a) (discovery). Failure by the petitioner to contest the record or to request permission to raise new facts or issues or to conduct discovery in this answer constitutes a waiver of the opportunity to do so at a later time in the proceeding.

        (3) Within 15 days after filing of the Secretary's brief under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, the petitioner shall file with the Secretary of the Commission, for the presiding officer, and serve upon other participants in the proceeding, a brief stating fully the objections to the contested order, including references to the authorities upon which the petitioner relies, including but not limited to regulations, rulings, interpretations, and decisions on appeals and exceptions issued by the Department or its predecessor agencies and precedents established by the Commission.

        (c)  (1) A person qualifying under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, may request the presiding officer to permit intervention in the proceeding under this subpart in accordance with the procedures described in this paragraph.

        (2) A motion to intervene may be filed by any person claiming:

        (i) An interest which may be directly affected and which is not adequately protected by existing parties and as to which the persons requesting intervention may be bound by the Commissions action in the proceeding; or

        (ii) Any other interest of such nature that participation by the person requesting intervention may be in the public interest.

        (3) A motion to intervene must set forth clearly and concisely the facts from which the nature of the requester's alleged right or interest can be determined, the grounds of the proposed intervention, and the position of the intervener in the proceeding, so as fully and completely to advise the participants and the presiding officer as to the specific issues of fact or law to be raised or controverted, by admitting, denying, or otherwise answering, specifically and in detail, each material allegation of fact or law raised or controverted, including references to the authorities upon which the requester relies, including, but not limited to, regulations, rulings, interpretations, and decisions on appeals and exceptions issued by the Department or its predecessor agencies and precedents established by the Commission.

        (4) Motions to intervene may be filed with the Secretary of the Commission, for the presiding officer, within 20 days after the commencement of the proceeding under Rule 904 (commencement of proceedings) unless, in extraordinary circumstances and for good cause shown, the presiding officer authorizes a late filing. A person requesting intervention must serve the motion to intervene on the participants in the proceeding at the same time the request is filed with the Secretary of the Commission.

        (5) A participant in the proceedings may file an answer to a motion to intervene. Failure to object constitutes a waiver of any objection to the granting of such request. If made, answers must be filed within 15 days after the filing of the request to intervene.

        (6) After expiration of the time for filing answers to requests to intervene or default thereof, as provided in paragraph (c)(5) of this section, the presiding officer will grant or deny such request, in whole or in part, or may, if found to be appropriate, authorize limited participation. The presiding officer will serve the determination on a motion to intervene upon the participants in the proceeding and upon the person requesting intervention. A person wholly or partially denied intervention may take an interlocutory appeal of the order denying intervention, under Rule 715 (interlocutory appeals to the Commission from rulings of presiding officers), and will be considered a “participant” (as that term is defined in Rule 102(b) (definitions)) for the limited purpose of permitting that person to file an interlocutory appeal under Rule 715 (interlocutory appeals to the Commission from rulings of presiding officers) contesting denial, in whole or in part, of that person's motion to intervene.

        (7) A person filing a motion to intervene, may request therein the permission of the presiding officer to raise new facts or issues not raised in the prior proceedings on the contested order, if the new facts or issues meet the criteria set forth in Rule 903(c) (request for nondisclosure of information). Failure by the person requesting permission to intervene to request permission to raise new facts or issues in the motion to intervene constitutes a waiver of the opportunity to do so at a later time in the proceeding.

        (8) A person filing a motion to intervene may request the permission of the presiding officer to conduct discovery, subject to the conditions set forth in Rule 908(c) (discovery). Failure by the person requesting permission to intervene to request permission to conduct discovery in the motion to intervene constitutes a waiver of the opportunity to do so at a later time in the proceeding.

        (d)  (1) Each party will file, as an appendix to each pleading which cites documents in the record developed in the prior proceedings on the remedial order, one copy of each such document in its entirety and, if any such document contains information exempt from public disclosure pursuant to Rule 903, a second copy of such document with such information deleted. The top of the first page of each such document will contain the word “PUBLIC” or “NONPUBLIC,” to indicate whether it contains such exempt information.

        (2) One copy of each version shall be served on counsel for the petitioner and/or the Secretary, and one copy of the PUBLIC version shall be served on counsel for each other participant separately represented unless the conditions of Rule 903 are met, in which situation such counsel shall be served with copies of both versions.

        (3) In compiling their appendices, the parties will include only documents specifically cited and relied upon in their pleadings. They will have regard for the fact that the Secretary's entire administrative record is always available to the Commission and will not include irrelevant or duplicative documents in the appendices.

      Subpart L [Reserved]

      Subpart M—Cooperative Procedure with State Commissions

        § 385.1301   Policy (Rule 1301).

#### § § 385.1301

        (a) The Federal Power and Natural Gas Acts, sections 209 and 17, respectively, authorize cooperation between the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the State commissions of the several States in the administration of said Acts, which include authorization for:

        (1) Reference of any matter arising in the administration of these Acts to a board to be composed of a member or members from a State or States affected, or to be affected, by the particular matters pending before the Commission;

        (2) Conferences with State commissions regarding the relationship between rate structures, costs, accounts, charges, practices, classifications, and regulations of public utilities or natural gas companies subject to the jurisdiction of such State commissions and of the Commission; and

        (3) Joint hearings with State commissions in connection with any matter with respect to which the Commission is authorized to act.

        (b) The matters that should be the subject of a conference referred to a board, or heard at a joint hearing of State commissions and the Commission, obviously, cannot be determined in advance. It is understood, therefore, that the Commission or any State commission will freely suggest cooperation with respect to any proceeding or matter affecting any public utility or natural gas company subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission and of a State commission, and concerning which it is believed that cooperation will be in the public interest.

        § 385.1302   Notice (Rule 1302).

#### § § 385.1302

        (a)  (1) Whenever there is instituted before the Commission any proceeding under either the Federal Power Act or the Natural Gas Act, the State commission or commissions of the State or States affected thereby will be given notice thereof immediately by the Commission. As deemed necessary for an understanding of the subject matter, each such notice will be supplemented by copies of applications, complaints, petitions, or orders instituting proceedings. Each such notice given to a State commission will request that the Commission be notified within a reasonable time whether the proceeding is deemed one that should be considered under the cooperative provisions of this subpart, and, if so, to advise the Commission as to the nature of its interest in the matter, and further, to specify whether it desires a conference, the creation of a board, or a joint or concurrent hearing, as defined in this subpart and the reasons for such request.

        (2) Any commission suggesting some form of such cooperative procedure should also state whether there is pending, or will be pending before it, a proceeding in which a concurrent hearing might appropriately be held and whether its proposal is for such hearing covering such proceeding and the proceeding pending before the Commission.

        (3) A State commission recommending to the Commission reference of a proceeding to a board, under either the Federal Power Act or the Natural Gas Act, should state with fullness the reasons which led it to believe that such reference is desirable and in the public interest.

        (4) Upon the receipt from a State commission of a communication suggesting cooperation, the Commission will consider the same, and may confer with the commission making the request and with other interested commissions, if any, in such manner as may be most suitable, and, if cooperation in the manner proposed, or in any other manner, appears to be practicable and desirable, will so advise each interested State commission, and will invite it to participate therein.

        (b)  (1) Each State commission should, in like manner, notify the Commission of any proceeding instituted before it the subject matter of which is also subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission, or in which it believes the Commission is interested. Such notice should be supplemented by copies of applications, petitions, complaints, or orders instituting proceedings which may be necessary to an understanding of the subject matter. Such notice should include the suggestions which the State commission may wish to make concerning cooperative procedure.

        (2) Upon receipt of such notice, the Commission will consider the same and will promptly notify the State commission whether or not in its opinion cooperation in the manner proposed, or in any other manner, appears to be practicable and desirable. The Commission is free to propose cooperative procedures whether or not such proposal of cooperation has been made by the State commission first giving notice of the proceeding.

        (c)  In the event that cooperation in a particular proceeding has been determined upon, the Commission or a State commission before which the proceeding is pending will so advise each interested State commission and will invite it to take part therein.

        § 385.1303   Conferences (Rule 1303).

#### § § 385.1303

        Inasmuch as experience has proved that informal conferences are the means most often used to enable commissions to work together to promote good regulation, affording means whereby common understandings may be reached, and the imposition of inconsistent or conflicting regulations upon companies subject to both Federal and State control may be avoided and means whereby State commissions may secure the assistance in State regulatory work which sections 209 and 17, respectively, of the Federal Power and Natural Gas Acts authorize the Commission to extend, any commission, Federal or State, should always feel free to suggest a conference to another commission, concerning any matter of regulation subject to the jurisdiction of either, with respect to which it is believed that a cooperative conference may be in the public interest. The commission desiring a conference upon any such matter should notify other interested commissions without delay, and thereupon the Commission or a State commission, as may be agreed, will promptly arrange for a conference in which all interested commissions will be invited to be represented.

        § 385.1304   Procedure governing matters referred to a board (Rule 1304).

#### § § 385.1304

        (a) It is believed that the statutory provisions of sections 209 and 17, respectively, of the Federal Power and Natural Gas Acts, for the reference of a proceeding to a board constituted as therein provided, were designed for use in unusual cases, and as a means of relief to the Commission when it might find itself unable to hear and determine cases before it, in the usual course, without undue delay.

        (b) Whenever the Commission, either upon its own motion or upon the suggestion of a State commission or at the request of any interested party, determines that it is desirable to refer a matter arising in the administration either of the Natural Gas Act or Part II of the Federal Power Act, to a board to be composed of a member or members from the State or States affected or to be affected by such matter, the procedure will be as follows: The Commission will send a request to each interested State commission to nominate a specified number of members to serve on such board. Whenever more than one State is involved, the representation of each State concerned shall be equal, unless one or more of the States affected chooses to waive such right of equal representation. The Commission will specify the functions to be performed by such board in each instance. When the member or members of any board have been nominated and appointed in accordance with the provisions of either section 209 of the Federal Power Act or section 17 of the Natural Gas Act, the Commission will issue an order referring the particular matter to such board, and such order will fix the time and place of hearing, define the “force and effect” which an action of the board will have, the manner in which the proceedings will be conducted, and specify the allowances to be made for the expense of the members of the board. As far as applicable, the rules of practice and procedure as from time to time adopted or prescribed by the Commission will govern such board. The board will have authority to adjourn the hearing from day to day, subpoena witnesses, rule on the relevancy, competency, and materiality of evidence, and will, after hearing all interested parties, submit its report to the Commission.

        § 385.1305   Joint and concurrent hearings (Rule 1305).

#### § § 385.1305

        (a) The term “joint hearing” used in sections 209 and 17, respectively, of the Federal Power and Natural Gas Acts is understood to cover any hearing in which members of the Commission and members of one or more State commissions may sit together in a proceeding pending before one such commission, whether or not a proceeding or proceedings involving similar or corresponding issues be pending before any other commission.

        (b) Two different types of proceedings have been called “joint hearings”. One is that type of proceeding where members of one or more State commissions sit with members of the Commission for information or in an advisory capacity. The State commissioners in such case do not develop a record for their respective commissions and may not, at their own discretion, make a recommendation to the Commission. The other type of joint hearing is often referred to as a “concurrent hearing”. Under this procedure the Commission and one or more State commissions sit together to hear and jointly make a record upon a matter over which all of the participating commissions have jurisdiction and responsibility for action.

        (c) The Commission or any State commission or commissions should feel free to suggest or request a joint or concurrent hearing at any time. It is believed that the concurrent hearing is the type of cooperative hearing which is likely to be most useful and effective.

        (d) Whenever a concurrent hearing has been agreed upon by the Commission and one or more State commissions, the procedure will be:

        (1) Each commission will designate the representative or representatives of such commission to sit at such concurrent hearing, and will designate the representative who will be the presiding officer for such commission.

        (2) It will be understood that participation in such concurrent hearing will in no way affect the complete control by each commission of the proceeding before it. It will be understood, also, that participation in either a joint or concurrent hearing will in no way preclude any commission from causing to be presented in any such case pertinent evidence with respect to matters in issue.

        (3) The representative designated by the Commission will be the presiding officer to announce rulings with respect to which there is no disagreement; and such rulings will be considered concurrent rulings. However, the presiding officer for any commission which does not concur in any ruling may announce a divergent ruling and such divergent ruling, whether with respect to the admissibility of evidence or any other matter, will be considered the ruling for his or her commission.

        (4) The record of the concurrent hearing will be the record of each commission participating, except that, if divergent rulings are made, the rulings will be reported so as to separate and distinguish clearly the record of the respective participating commissions and the evidence admitted in each record, in accordance with the rulings of the respective commissions. If, in any proceeding, the ruling of one presiding officer has the effect of admitting any voluminous exhibit or testimony which is excluded by the ruling of another presiding officer, the taking of such evidence, whenever possible, will be deferred until after the completion of the proceedings which can be conducted under concurrent rulings. When such testimony is taken, the transcript of such evidence will be made available to the participating commissions, if desired.

        (5) In all respects concerning which there is no divergence of ruling, the hearing will be conducted in accordance with the rules of practice and procedure prescribed by the Commission, subject to the express understanding that each participating State commission will control its own record and make its own rulings as to the admissibility of evidence and as to other matters affecting its proceedings, and will make its own separate final decision or order therein.

        (e) Before either the Commission or a participating State commission will enter any order or orders in a concurrent proceeding, opportunity will be afforded for conference between the Commission and the State commissions participating.

        (f) Whenever a joint hearing other than a concurrent hearing is agreed upon, the commissioners which take part therein will agree upon the procedure to be followed in such hearing in advance of the opening of the same. With respect to any concurrent hearing, a special agreement may be made by the commissions taking part therein for a procedure or action differing from that outlined in this plan.

        (g) Cooperation between two or more commissions in a concurrent hearing will preclude either from taking the position of an advocate or a litigant. If a commission wishes to take such a position, it will not be a cooperating participant in that proceeding. In such situation the appropriate method of procedure will be intervention under Rule 214.

        § 385.1306   Intervention by State commissions (Rule 1306).

#### § § 385.1306

        Any interested State commission may intervene in any proceeding before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, as provided in Rule 214.

        (c)  (1) Any person who is or will be a direct participant in an act, transaction, or circumstance affected by the NGPA or a rule issued by the Commission under the NGPA may file with the Office of the General Counsel a request for an interpretation.

        (2) Requests for interpretations must be addressed to the Office of the General Counsel as follows:

        (3) Requests for interpretation under this paragraph need not be filed with the Secretary.

        (d) —(1)  A request for interpretation must contain a full and complete statement of the relevant and material facts pertaining to the act, transaction, or circumstance that is the subject of the request for interpretation. When the request pertains to only one step of a larger integrated transaction, the facts, circumstances, and other relevant information pertaining to the entire transaction must be included in the request.

        (2)  The request must clearly designate the section of the statute, regulation, rule, or part thereof which the person making the request seeks to have interpreted and must set forth clearly and concisely the question for which an interpretation is sought. The request may also set forth a proposed answer to the question.

        (3)  If the request proposes a particular answer:

        (i) The request must set forth a legal analysis in support of the proposed answer and cite relevant authorities in support thereof.

        (ii) The request must set forth the legal and business consequences which will flow from the proposed answer.

        (4)  (i) The request must be accompanied by a statement that to the best of the applicant's personal information, knowledge, and belief there is no untrue statement of a material or relevant fact and there is no omission of a material or relevant fact made in the request.

        (ii) Any untrue statement or omission of a material or relevant fact upon which the Office of the General Counsel relied in a request for an interpretation is deemed to be a statement or entry under section 1001 of Title 18, United States Code.

        (5)  (i) A person submitting a request must specify each person who is a direct participant in the circumstance, act or transaction; must notify them in writing of the request for an interpretation; and must send them a copy of such request. Such notification and the addresses of the persons notified must be included in a request to the General Counsel.

        (ii) Each person notified pursuant to paragraph (d)(5)(i) of this section may submit information regarding any fact provided in the request of which it has personal knowledge, if such fact is different from the facts presented by the applicant. Such fact must be presented to the Office of the General Counsel as set forth in paragraph (d)(4) of this section.

        (6) The request must be accompanied by the fee prescribed in § 381.405 of this chapter or by a petition for waiver pursuant to § 381.106 of this chapter.

        (e)  The General Counsel may request additional information, documentation or legal analysis in connection with any request for any interpretation.

        (f)  Information submitted in a request for interpretation may be used by the Commission or its Staff in their official capacity. Any information received will be placed in a public file in the Commission's Office of Public Information.

        (g)  (1) Except as provided in paragraph (g)(2) of this section, the General Counsel will provide a copy of his or her written interpretation of the NGPA or rule as applied to the act, transaction, or circumstance presented upon the person who made the request for the interpretation and upon persons named in the request as direct participants in the act, transaction, or circumstance.

        (2) The General Counsel may determine not to issue an interpretation, in which case the person who made the request and direct participants as specified in the request will be notified in writing of the decision not to issue an interpretation, and the reason for the decision.

        (3) Only those persons to whom an interpretation is specifically addressed and other persons who are named in the request, who have been informed by the applicant for an interpretation of the pendency of the request and who are direct participants in the act, transaction or circumstance presented, may rely upon it. The effectiveness of an interpretation depends entirely on the accuracy of the facts presented to the General Counsel. If a material or relevant fact has been misrepresented or omitted or if any material or relevant fact changes after an interpretation is issued or if the action taken differs from the facts presented in the request, the interpretation may not be relied upon by any person.

        (4) An interpretation may be rescinded or modified prospectively at any time. A rescission or modification is effected by notifying persons entitled to rely on the interpretation at the address contained in the original request.

        (5) Any interpretation based on the NGPA or a rule issued thereunder in effect at the time of issuance may be relied upon only to the extent such law or rule remains in effect.

        (6) Except as provided in paragraphs (g)(3), (g)(4) and (g)(5) of this section, the Staff will not recommend any action to the Commission which is inconsistent with the position espoused in the interpretation. The interpretation of the General Counsel is not the interpretation of the Commission. An interpretation provided by the General Counsel is given without prejudice to the Commission's authority to consider the same or like question and to issue a declaratory order to take other action which has the effect of rescinding, revoking, or modifying the interpretation of the General Counsel.

        (h)  There is no appeal to the Commission of an interpretation.

        (i)  Upon the petition of any person or upon its own motion, the Commission may publish in the  an interpretative rule regarding any question arising under the NGPA or a rule promulgated thereunder. Any person is entitled to rely upon an interpretative rule.

        (j)  Except for the notification provisions of paragraph (d)(5) of this section, the provisions of this section apply to any petition for an adjustment which is deemed a request for an interpretation under Rule 1117. Notice to all parties to an adjustment proceeding under subpart K of this part that is deemed to be a request for an interpretation will be given under Rule 1117(d)(1).

      § 388.108   Requests for Commission records not available from the Commission's website,

#### § § 388.108

      (a)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, a person may request access to Commission records, including records maintained in electronic format, that are not available through the Commission's website,  by using the following procedures:

      (i) The request must be in writing, addressed to the Director, Office of External Affairs, and clearly marked “Freedom of Information Act Request.”

      (ii) The request must include:

      (A) A statement by the requester of a willingness to pay a reasonable fee or fees not to exceed a specific amount, or

      (B) A request for waiver or reduction or fees.

      (iii) The request must identify the fee category of the request, consistent with the provisions of § 388.109(b) (1) and (2).

      (2) A request that fails to provide the identification required in paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section will not be processed until the Director, Office of External Affairs, can ascertain the requester's fee category.

      (3) A request for records received by the Commission not addressed and marked as indicated in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section will be so addressed and marked by Commission personnel as soon as it is properly identified, and forwarded immediately to the Director, Office of External Affairs.

      (4) Requests made pursuant to this section will be considered to be received upon actual receipt by the Director, Office of External Affairs, unless otherwise indicated in paragraph (a)(5) of this section.

      (5) Except for the purpose of making a determination regarding expedited processing under paragraph (d)(3) of this section, no request will be deemed received while there is an unresolved fee waiver issue under § 388.109(b)(6), unless the requester has provided a written statement agreeing to pay some or all fees pending the outcome of the waiver question.

      (b)(1)  Upon receipt of a request, the Director, Office of External Affairs, will place the request in one of three tracks for processing:

      (i) Track One—records that are readily identifiable and were previously cleared for release (including those subject to multiple requests and placed on );

      (ii) Track Two—records that are readily identifiable, and require limited review; and

      (iii) Track Three—complex and/or voluminous records requiring a significant search and/or review.

      (2) Each track specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section will be processed on a first in, first out basis, where practicable. A requester may modify a request to obtain processing on a faster track.

      (c)(1)  Except as provided in paragraphs (c)(4) and (d)(3) of this section, within 20 working days after receipt of the request for agency records, the Director, Office of External Affairs, will comply with the request or deny the request in whole or in part, and will notify the requester of the determination, of the reasons for a decision to withhold any part of a requested document, and of the right of the requester to appeal any adverse determination in writing to the General Counsel or General Counsel's designee.

      (2) The Director, Office of External Affairs, will attempt to provide records in the form or format requested, where feasible, but will not provide more than one copy of any record to a requester.

      (3) Any determination by the Director, Office of External Affairs, to withhold information will, where feasible, indicate the approximate volume of information withheld, and will indicate, for partially-released materials, where redactions have been made, unless to do so would harm an interest protected by a FOIA exemption.

      (4) The Director will consider whether partial disclosure of information is possible whenever it is determined that a document is exempt and will take reasonable steps to segregate and release nonexempt information.

      (5) The Director will only withhold information where it is reasonably foreseeable that disclosure would harm an interest protected by an exemption or disclosure is prohibited by law or otherwise exempted from disclosure under FOIA Exemption 3.

      (d)(1)  A requester may seek expedited processing on the basis of a compelling need. Expedited processing will be granted if the requester demonstrates that:

      (i) Failure to obtain the records on an expedited basis can reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual, or

      (ii) In the case of a requester primarily engaged in the dissemination of information, there is an urgency to inform the public concerning Federal Government activity.

      (2) A request for expedited processing under this section must be supported with detailed credible documentation, including a statement certified to be true and correct to the requester's best knowledge and belief.

      (3) The Director, Office of External Affairs, will decide within 10 calendar days of receipt of the request whether it is eligible for expedited processing. The Director will notify the requester of the reasons for denial of expedited processing and of the right of the requester to appeal to the General Counsel or General Counsel's designee.

      (e) The procedure for appeal of denial of a request for Commission records, or denial of a request for expedited processing, is set forth in § 388.110.

      § 388.109   Fees for record requests.

#### § § 388.109

      (a)  (1) The fee for finding and duplicating records available from the Commission's website,  will vary depending on the size and complexity of the request. A person can obtain a copy of the schedule of fees from the Commission's website,  In addition, copies of data extracted from the Commission's files through electronic media are available on a reimbursable basis, upon written request to the Commission.

      (2) Stenographic reports of Commission hearings are made by a private contractor. Interested persons may obtain copies of public hearing transcripts from the contractor at prices set in the contract, or through the search and duplication service noted above. Copies of the contract are available for public inspection on the Commission's website,

      (b)  The cost of duplication of records not available from the Commission's website,  will depend on the number of documents requested, the time necessary to locate the documents requested, and the category of the persons requesting the records. The procedures for appeal of denial of requests for fee waiver or reduction are set forth in § 388.110.

      (1)  For the purpose of paragraph (b) of this section.

      (i)  request means a request from or on behalf of one who seeks information for a use or purpose that furthers commercial trade, or profit interests as these phrases are commonly known or have been interpreted by the courts in the context of the Freedom of Information Act.

      (ii)  refers to a preschool, a public or private elementary or secondary school, an institution of graduate higher education, an institution of undergraduate higher education, an institution of professional education, and an institution of vocational education, which operates a program of scholarly research.

      (iii)  refers to an installation that is not operated on a commercial basis and which is operated solely for the purpose of conducting scientific research the results of which are not intended to promote any particular product or industry.

      (iv)  refers to any person actively gathering _news_ for an entity that is organized and operated to publish or broadcast news to the public. The term  means information that is about current events that would be of current interest to the public. Examples of news media entities include television or radio stations broadcasting to the public at large, and publishers of periodicals (but only in those instances when the periodicals can qualify as disseminations of “news”) who make their products available for purchase or subscription by the general public. These examples are not intended to be all-inclusive. Moreover, as traditional methods of news delivery evolve (e.g. electronic dissemination of newspapers through telecommunication services), such alternative media may be included in this category. A  journalist may be regarded as working for a news organization if the journalist can demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication through that organization, even though the journalist is not actually employed by the news organization. A publication contract would be the clearest proof, but the Commission may also look to the past publication record of a requester in making this determination.

      (2)  (i) If documents are requested for commercial use, the Commission will charge the employee's hourly pay rate plus 16% for benefits for document search time and for document review time, and 15 cents per page for duplication. Commercial use requests are not entitled to two hours of free search time or 100 free pages of reproduction of documents.

      (ii) If documents are not sought for commercial use and the request is made by an educational or non-commercial scientific institution, whose purpose is scholarly or scientific research, or a representative of the news media, the Commission will charge 15 cents per page for duplication. There is no charge for the first 100 pages.

      (iii) For a request not described in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) or (ii) of this section, the Commission will charge the employees hourly pay rate plus 16 percent for benefits for document search and 15 cents per page for duplication. There is no charge for the first 100 pages of reproduction and the first two hours of search time will be furnished without charge.

      (iv) The Director, Office of External Affairs, will normally provide documents by regular mail, with postage prepaid by the Commission. However, the requester may authorize special delivery, such as express mail, at the requester's own expense.

      (v) The Commission, or its designee, may establish minimum fees below which no charges will be collected, if it determines that the costs of routine collection and processing of the fees are likely to equal or exceed the amount of the fees. If total fees assessed by Commission staff for a Freedom of Information Act request are less than the appropriate threshold, the Commission may not charge the requesters.

      (vi) Payment of fees must be by check or money order made payable to the U.S. Treasury.

      (vii) Requesters may not file multiple requests at the same time, each seeking portions of a document or documents, solely in order to avoid payment of fees. When the Commission reasonably believes that a requester, or a group of requesters acting in concert, is attempting to break a request down into a series of requests for the purpose of evading assessment of fees, or otherwise reasonably believes that two or more requests constitute a single request, the Commission may aggregate any such requests accordingly. The Commission will not aggregate multiple requests on unrelated subjects from a requester. Aggregated requests may qualify for an extension of time under § 388.110(b).

      (3)  The Commission may assess charges for time spent searching, even if it fails to locate the records, or if records located are determined to be exempt from disclosure. If the Commission estimates that search charges are likely to exceed $25, it will notify the requester of the estimated amount of search fees, unless the requester has indicated in advance willingness to pay fees as high as those anticipated. The requester can meet with Commission personnel with the object of reformulating the request to meet his or her needs at a lower cost.

      (4)  The Commission will assess interest charges on an unpaid bill starting on the 31st day following the day on which the billing was sent. Interest will be at the rate prescribed in 31 U.S.C. 3717 and will accrue from the date of the billing.

      (5)  The Commission will require a requester to make an advance payment, , payments before work is commenced or continued on a request, if:

      (i) The Commission estimates or determines that allowable charges that a requester may be required to pay are likely to exceed $250. The Commission will notify the requester of the estimated cost and either require satisfactory assurance of full payment where the requester has a history of prompt payment of fees, or require advance payment of charges if a requester has no history of payment; or

      (ii) A requester has previously failed to pay a fee charged in a timely fashion. The Commission will require the requester to pay the full amount owed plus any applicable interest, and to make an advance payment of the full amount of the estimated fee before the Commission will begin to process a new request or a pending request from that requester. When the Commission requires advance payment or an agreement to pay under this paragraph, or under § 388.108(a)(5), the administrative time limits prescribed in this part will begin only after the Commission has received the required payments, or agreements.

      (c)  (1) Any fee described in this section may be reduced or waived if the requester demonstrates that disclosure of the information sought is:

      (i) In the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government, and

      (ii) Not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.

      (2) The Commission will consider the following criteria to determine the public interest standard:

      (i) Whether the subject of the requested records concerns the operations or activities of the government;

      (ii) Whether the disclosure is likely to contribute to an understanding of government operations or activities;

      (iii) Whether disclosure of the requested information will contribute to public understanding; and

      (iv) Whether the disclosure is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of government operations or facilities.

      (3) The Commission will consider the following criteria to determine the commercial interest of the requester:

      (i) Whether the requester has a commercial interest that would be furthered by the requested disclosure; and, if so

      (ii) Whether the magnitude of the identified commercial interest of the requester is sufficiently large, in comparison with the public interest in disclosure, that disclosure is primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.

      (4) This request for fee reduction or waiver must accompany the initial request for records and will be decided under the same procedures used for record requests.

      (d)  The Commission will use the authorities mandated in the Debt Collection Act of 1982, 31 U.S.C. 3711, 3716-3719 (1982), including disclosure to consumer reporting agencies and use of collection agencies, where appropriate, to encourage payment of outstanding unpaid FOIA invoices.

      (e) —(1)  The Commission, by its designee, the Executive Director, will update the fees established in this section each fiscal year. The Executive Director will publish the fees in the

      (2)  The fee applicable to a particular Freedom of Information Act request will be the fee in effect on the date that the request is received.

      (f) The Commission will not charge search fees (or duplication fees for requesters with preferred fee status) where, after extending the time limit for unusual circumstances, as described in § 388.110, the Director does not provide a timely determination.

      (1) If there are unusual circumstances, as described in § 388.110, and there are more than 5,000 responsive pages to the request, the Commission may charge search fees (or, for requesters in preferred fee status, may charge duplication fees) where the requester received timely written notice and the Commission has discussed with the requester via written mail, electronic mail, or telephone (or made not less than 3 good-faith attempts to do so) how the requester could effectively limit the scope of the request; or

      (2) If a court determines that exceptional circumstances exist, the Commission's failure to comply with a time limit will be excused for the length of time provided by the court order.

      (a)(1) Determination letters shall indicate that a requester may seek assistance from the FOIA Public Liaison. A person whose request for records, request for fee waiver, or request for expedited processing is denied in whole or in part may seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services, or may appeal the determination to the General Counsel or General Counsel's designee within 90 days of the determination.

      (2) Appeals filed pursuant to this section must be in writing, addressed to the General Counsel of the Commission, and clearly marked “Freedom of Information Act Appeal.” Such an appeal received by the Commission not addressed and marked as indicated in this paragraph will be so addressed and marked by Commission personnel as soon as it is properly identified and then will be forwarded to the General Counsel. Appeals taken pursuant to this paragraph will be considered to be received upon actual receipt by the General Counsel.

      (3) The General Counsel or the General Counsel's designee will make a determination with respect to any appeal within 20 working days after the receipt of such appeal. An appeal of the denial of expedited processing will be considered as expeditiously as possible within the 20 working day period. If, on appeal, the denial of the request for records, fee reduction, or expedited processing is upheld in whole or in part, the General Counsel or the General Counsel's designee will notify the person making the appeal of the provisions for judicial review of that determination.

      (b)(1)  In unusual circumstances, the time limits prescribed for making the initial determination pursuant to § 388.108 and for deciding an appeal pursuant to this section may be extended by up to 10 working days, by the Secretary, who will send written notice to the requester setting forth the reasons for such extension and the date on which a determination or appeal is expected to be dispatched.

      (2) The extension permitted by paragraph (b)(1) of this section may be made longer than 10 working days when the Commission notifies the requester within the initial response time that the request cannot be processed in the specified time, and the requester is provided an opportunity to limit the scope of the request to allow processing within 20 working days; or to arrange with the Commission an alternative time frame.

      (3) Two or more requests aggregated into a single request under § 388.109(b)(2)(vii) may qualify for an extension of time if the requests, as aggregated, otherwise satisfy the unusual circumstances specified in this section.

      (4)  means:

      (i) The need to search for and collect the requested records from field facilities or other establishments that are separate from the office processing the requests;

      (ii) The need to search for, collect, and appropriately examine a voluminous amount of separate and distinct records which are demanded in a single request; or

      (iii) The need for consultation, which will be conducted with all practicable speed, with another agency having a substantial interest in the determination of the request or among two or more components of the agency having substantial subject-matter interest therein.

      (5) Whenever the Commission extends the time limit, pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section, by more than ten additional working days, the written notice will notify the requester of the right to seek dispute resolution services from the Office of Government Information Services.

      § 388.111   Procedures in event of subpoena.

#### § § 388.111

      (a)(1) The procedures specified in this section will apply to all subpoenas directed to Commission employees that relate in any way to the employees' official duties. These procedures will also apply to subpoenas directed to former Commission employees if the subpoenas seek nonpublic materials or information acquired during Commission employment. The provisions of paragraph (c) of this section will also apply to subpoenas directed to the Commission.

      (2) For purposes of this section,

      (i)  except where otherwise specified, includes “special government employees” and other Commission employees; and

      (ii)  includes any material or information which is exempt from availability for public inspection and copying;

      (iii)  includes consultants and other employees as defined by section 202 of Title 18 of the United States Code.

      (iv)  means any compulsory process in a case or matter, including a case or matter to which the Commission is not a party;

      (b) Any employee who is served with a subpoena must promptly advise the General Counsel of the Commission of the service of the subpoena, the nature of the documents or information sought, and all relevant facts and circumstances. Any former employee who is served with a subpoena that concerns nonpublic information shall promptly advise the General Counsel of the Commission of the service of the subpoena, the nature of the documents or information sought, and all relevant facts and circumstances.

      (c) A party causing a subpoena to be issued to the Commission or any employee or former employee of the Commission must furnish a statement to the General Counsel of the Commission. This statement must set forth the party's interest in the case or matter, the relevance of the desired testimony or documents, and a discussion of whether the desired testimony or documents are reasonably available from other sources. If testimony is desired, the statement must also contain a general summary of the testimony and a discussion of whether Commission records could be produced and used in lieu of testimony. Any authorization for testimony will be limited to the scope of the demand as summarized in such statement.

      (d) Commission records or information which are not part of the public record will be produced only upon authorization by the Commission.

      (e) The Commission or its designee will consider and act upon subpoenas under this section with due regard for statutory restrictions, the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure, and the public interest, taking into account factors such as applicable privileges including the deliberative process privilege; the need to conserve the time of employees for conducting official business; the need to avoid spending the time and money of the United States for private purposes; the need to maintain impartiality between private litigants in cases where a substantial government interest is not involved; and the established legal standards for determining whether justification exists for the disclosure of confidential information and records.

      (f) The Commission authorizes the General Counsel or the General Counsel's designee to make determinations under this section.

      § 388.112   Requests for privileged treatment for documents submitted to the Commission.

#### § § 388.112

      (a)  By following the procedures specified in this section, any person submitting a document to the Commission may request privileged treatment for some or all of the information contained in a particular document that it claims is exempt from the mandatory public disclosure requirements of the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552 (FOIA), and should be withheld from public disclosure. For the purposes of the Commission's filing requirements, non-CEII subject to an outstanding claim of exemption from disclosure under FOIA will be referred to as privileged material. The rules governing CEII are contained in § 388.113.

      (b)  (1) General Procedures. A person requesting that material be treated as privileged information must include in its filing a justification for such treatment in accordance with the filing procedures posted on the Commission's Web site at  A person requesting that a document filed with the Commission be treated as privileged in whole or in part must designate the document as privileged in making an electronic filing or clearly indicate a request for such treatment on a paper filing. The cover page and pages or portions of the document containing material for which privileged treatment is claimed should be clearly labeled in bold, capital lettering, indicating that it contains privileged or confidential information, as appropriate, and marked “DO NOT RELEASE.” The filer also must submit to the Commission a public version with the information that is claimed to be privileged material redacted, to the extent practicable.

      (2) Procedures for Proceedings with a Right to Intervene. The following procedures set forth the methods for filing and obtaining access to material that is filed as privileged in complaint proceedings and in any proceeding to which a right to intervention exists:

      (i) If a person files material as privileged material in a complaint proceeding or other proceeding to which a right to intervention exists, that person must include a proposed form of protective agreement with the filing, or identify a protective agreement that has already been filed in the proceeding that applies to the filed material. This requirement does not apply to material submitted in hearing or settlement proceedings, or if the only material for which privileged treatment is claimed consists of landowner lists or privileged information filed under §§ 380.12(f) and 380.16(f) of this chapter.

      (ii) The filer must provide the public version of the document and its proposed form of protective agreement to each entity that is required to be served with the filing.

      (iii) Any person who is a participant in the proceeding or has filed a motion to intervene or notice of intervention in the proceeding may make a written request to the filer for a copy of the complete, non-public version of the document. The request must include an executed copy of the protective agreement and a statement of the person's right to party or participant status or a copy of their motion to intervene or notice of intervention. Any person may file an objection to the proposed form of protective agreement. A filer, or any other person, may file an objection to disclosure, generally or to a particular person or persons who have sought intervention.

      (iv) If no objection to disclosure is filed, the filer must provide a copy of the complete, non-public document to the requesting person within 5 days after receipt of the written request that is accompanied by an executed copy of the protective agreement. If an objection to disclosure is filed, the filer shall not provide the non-public document to the person or class of persons identified in the objection until ordered by the Commission or a decisional authority.

      (v) For material filed in proceedings set for trial-type hearing or settlement judge proceedings, a participant's access to material for which privileged treatment is claimed is governed by the presiding official's protective order.

      (vi) For landowner lists, information filed as privileged under §§ 380.12(f) and 380.16(f) of this chapter, forms filed with the Commission, and other documents not covered above, access to this material can be sought pursuant to a FOIA request under § 388.108. Applicants are not required under paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of this section to provide intervenors with landowner lists and the other materials identified in the previous sentence.

      (c)  (1) For documents filed with the Commission:

      (i) The documents for which privileged treatment is claimed will be maintained in the Commission's document repositories as non-public until such time as the Commission may determine that the document is not entitled to the treatment sought and is subject to disclosure consistent with § 388.108. By treating the documents as nonpublic, the Commission is not making a determination on any claim of privilege status. The Commission retains the right to make determinations with regard to any claim of privilege status, and the discretion to release information as necessary to carry out its jurisdictional responsibilities.

      (ii) The request for privileged treatment and the public version of the document will be made available while the request is pending.

      (2) For documents submitted to Commission staff. The notification procedures of paragraphs (d), (e), and (f) of this section will be followed before making a document public.

      (d)  When a FOIA requester seeks a document for which privilege status has been claimed, or when the Commission itself is considering release of such information, the Commission official who will decide whether to release the information or any other appropriate Commission official will notify the person who submitted the document and give the person an opportunity (at least five calendar days) in which to comment in writing on the request. A copy of this notice will be sent to the requester.

      (e)  Notice of a decision by the Commission, the Chairman of the Commission, the Director, Office of External Affairs, the General Counsel or General Counsel's designee, a presiding officer in a proceeding under part 385 of this chapter, or any other appropriate official to deny a claim of privilege, in whole or in part, will be given to any person claiming that the information is privileged no less than 5 calendar days before disclosure. The notice will briefly explain why the person's objections to disclosure are not sustained by the Commission. A copy of this notice will be sent to the FOIA requester.

      (f) Notification of suit in Federal courts. When a FOIA requester brings suit to compel disclosure of information for which a person has claimed privileged treatment, the Commission will notify the person who submitted the documents of the suit.

      § 388.113   Critical Energy/Electric Infrastructure Information (CEII).

#### § § 388.113

      (a)  This section governs the procedures for submitting, designating, handling, sharing, and disseminating Critical Energy/Electric Infrastructure Information (CEII) submitted to or generated by the Commission. The Commission reserves the right to restrict access to previously filed information as well as Commission-generated information containing CEII. Nothing in this section limits the ability of any other Federal agency to take all necessary steps to protect information within its custody or control that is necessary to ensure the safety and security of the electric grid. To the extent necessary, such agency may consult with the CEII Coordinator regarding the treatment or designation of such information.

      (b)  The procedures in this section implement section 215A of the Federal Power Act, and provide a comprehensive overview of the manner in which the Commission will implement the CEII program.

      (c)  For purposes of this section:

      (1)  means information related to critical electric infrastructure, or proposed critical electrical infrastructure, generated by or provided to the Commission or other Federal agency other than classified national security information, that is designated as critical electric infrastructure information by the Commission or the Secretary of the Department of Energy pursuant to section 215A(d) of the Federal Power Act. Such term includes information that qualifies as critical energy infrastructure information under the Commission's regulations. Critical Electric Infrastructure Information is exempt from mandatory disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(3) and shall not be made available by any Federal, State, political subdivision or tribal authority pursuant to any Federal, State, political subdivision or tribal law requiring public disclosure of information or records pursuant to section 215A(d)(1)(A) and (B) of the Federal Power Act.

      (2)  means specific engineering, vulnerability, or detailed design information about proposed or existing critical infrastructure that:

      (i) Relates details about the production, generation, transportation, transmission, or distribution of energy;

      (ii) Could be useful to a person in planning an attack on critical infrastructure;

      (iii) Is exempt from mandatory disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552; and

      (iv) Does not simply give the general location of the critical infrastructure.

      (3)  means a system or asset of the bulk-power system, whether physical or virtual, the incapacity or destruction of which would negatively affect national security, economic security, public health or safety, or any combination of such matters.

      (4)  means existing and proposed systems and assets, whether physical or virtual, the incapacity or destruction of which would negatively affect security, economic security, public health or safety, or any combination of those matters.

      (d)  The following criteria and procedures apply to information labeled as CEII:

      (1) For information submitted to the Commission:

      (i) A person requesting that information submitted to the Commission be treated as CEII must include with its submission a justification for such treatment in accordance with the filing procedures posted on the Commission's Web site at  The justification must provide how the information, or any portion of the information, qualifies as CEII, as the terms are defined in paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section. The submission must also include a clear statement of the date the information was submitted to the Commission, how long the CEII designation should apply to the information and support for the period proposed. Failure to provide the justification or other required information could result in denial of the designation and release of the information to the public.

      (ii) In addition to the justification required by paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section, a person requesting that information submitted to the Commission be treated as CEII must clearly label the cover page and pages or portions of the information for which CEII treatment is claimed in bold, capital lettering, indicating that it contains CEII, as appropriate, and marked “DO NOT RELEASE.” The submitter must also segregate those portions of the information that contain CEII (or information that reasonably could be expected to lead to the disclosure of the CEII) wherever feasible. The submitter must also submit to the Commission a public version with the information where CEII is redacted, to the extent practicable.

      (iii) If a person files material as CEII in a complaint proceeding or other proceeding to which a right to intervention exists, that person must include a proposed form of protective agreement with the filing, or identify a protective agreement that has already been filed in the proceeding that applies to the filed material.

      (iv) The information for which CEII treatment is claimed will be maintained in the Commission's files as non-public until such time as the Commission may determine that the information is not entitled to the treatment sought. By treating the information as CEII, the Commission is not making a determination on any claim of CEII status. The Commission retains the right to make determinations with regard to any claim of CEII status at any time, and the discretion to release information as necessary to carry out its jurisdictional responsibilities. Although unmarked information may be eligible for CEII treatment, the Commission will treat unmarked information as CEII only if it is properly designated as CEII pursuant to Commission regulations.

      (v) The CEII Coordinator will evaluate whether the submitted information or portions of the information are covered by the definitions in paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section prior to making a designation as CEII.

      (vi) Subject to the exceptions set forth in paragraph (f)(5) of this section, when a CEII requester seeks information for which CEII status has been claimed, or when the Commission itself is considering release of such information, the CEII Coordinator or any other appropriate Commission official will notify the person who submitted the information and give the person an opportunity (at least five business days) in which to comment in writing on the request. A copy of this notice will be sent to the requester. Notice of a decision by the Commission, or the CEII Coordinator to make a release of CEII, will be given to any person claiming that the information is CEII no less than five business days before disclosure. The notice will respond to any objections to disclosure from the submitter that are not sustained. Where applicable, a copy of this notice will be sent to the CEII requester.

      (2) For Commission-generated information:

      (i) After consultation with the Office Director for the office that created the information, or the Office Director's designee, the CEII Coordinator will designate Commission-generated information as CEII after determining that the information or portions of the information are covered by the definitions in paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section. Commission-generated CEII shall include clear markings to indicate the information is CEII and the date of the designation.

      (ii) The Commission will segregate non-CEII from Commission-generated CEII or information that reasonably could be expected to lead to the disclosure of CEII wherever feasible.

      (e)  All CEII designations will be subject to the following conditions:

      (1) A designation may last for up to a five-year period, unless re-designated. In making a determination as to whether the designation should be extended, the CEII Coordinator will take into account information provided in response to paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section, and any other information, as appropriate.

      (2) A designation may be removed at any time, in whole or in part, if the Commission determines that the unauthorized disclosure of CEII could no longer be used to impair the security or reliability of the bulk-power system or distribution facilities or any other form of energy infrastructure.

      (3) The Commission will treat CEII or documents marked as CEII as non-public after the designation has lapsed until the CEII Coordinator determines to un-designate the information.

      (4) If a CEII designation is removed, the submitter will receive notice and an opportunity to comment. The CEII Coordinator will notify the submitter of the information and give the submitter an opportunity (at least five business days) in which to comment in writing prior to the removal of the designation. Notice of a removal decision will be given to any submitter claiming that the information is CEII no less than five business days before disclosure. The notice will briefly explain why the submitter's objections to the removal of the designation are not sustained by the Commission

      (f)  The Commission, taking into account standards of the Electric Reliability Organization, will facilitate voluntary sharing of CEII with, between, and by Federal, state, political subdivision, and tribal authorities; the Electric Reliability Organization; regional entities; information sharing and analysis centers established pursuant to Presidential Decision Directive 63; owners, operators, and users of critical electric infrastructure in the United States; and other entities determined appropriate by the Commission. The process will be as follows:

      (1) The Director of any Office of the Commission or his designee that wishes to voluntarily share CEII shall consult with the CEII Coordinator prior to the Office Director or his designee making a determination on whether to voluntarily share the CEII.

      (2) Consistent with paragraph (d) of this section, the Commission retains the discretion to release information as necessary to carry out its jurisdictional responsibilities in facilitating voluntary sharing or, in the case of information provided to other federal agencies, the Commission retains the discretion to release information as necessary for those agencies to carry out their jurisdictional responsibilities.

      (3) All entities receiving CEII must execute either a non-disclosure agreement or an acknowledgement and agreement. A copy of each agreement will be maintained by the Office Director with a copy to the CEII Coordinator.

      (4) When the Commission voluntarily shares CEII pursuant to this subsection, the Commission may impose additional restrictions on how the information may be used and maintained.

      (5) Submitters of CEII shall receive notification of a limited release of CEII no less than five business days before disclosure, except in instances where voluntary sharing is necessary for law enforcement purposes, to maintain infrastructure security, to address potential threats, when notice would not be practicable, and where there is an urgent need to quickly disseminate the information. When prior notice is not given, the Commission will provide submitters of CEII notice of a limited release of the CEII as soon as practicable.

      (g)  (1) An owner/operator of a facility, including employees and officers of the owner/operator, may obtain CEII relating to its own facility, excluding Commission-generated information except inspection reports/operation reports and any information directed to the owner-operators, directly from Commission staff without going through the procedures outlined in paragraph (g)(5) of this section. Non-employee agents of an owner/operator of such facility may obtain CEII relating to the owner/operator's facility in the same manner as owner/operators as long as they present written authorization from the owner/operator to obtain such information. Notice of such requests must be given to the CEII Coordinator, who shall track this information.

      (2) An employee of a federal agency acting within the scope of his or her federal employment may obtain CEII directly from Commission staff without following the procedures outlined in paragraph (g)(5) of this section. Any Commission employee at or above the level of division director or its equivalent may rule on requests for access to CEII by a representative of a federal agency. To obtain access to CEII, an agency employee must sign an acknowledgement and agreement, which states that the agency will protect the CEII in the same manner as the Commission and will refer any requests for the information to the Commission. Notice of each such request also must be given to the CEII Coordinator, who shall track this information.

      (3) A landowner whose property is crossed by or in the vicinity of a project may receive detailed alignment sheets containing CEII directly from Commission staff without submitting a non-disclosure agreement as outlined in paragraph (g)(5) of this section. A landowner must provide Commission staff with proof of his or her property interest in the vicinity of a project.

      (4) Any person who is a participant in a proceeding or has filed a motion to intervene or notice of intervention in a proceeding may make a written request to the filer for a copy of the complete CEII version of the document without following the procedures outlined in paragraph (g)(5) of this section. The request must include an executed copy of the applicable protective agreement and a statement of the person's right to party or participant status or a copy of the person's motion to intervene or notice of intervention. Any person may file an objection to the proposed form of protective agreement. A filer, or any other person, may file an objection to disclosure, generally or to a particular person or persons who have sought intervention. If no objection to disclosure is filed, the filer must provide a copy of the complete, non-public document to the requesting person within five business days after receipt of the written request that is accompanied by an executed copy of the protective agreement. If an objection to disclosure is filed, the filer shall not provide the non-public document to the person or class of persons identified in the objection until ordered by the Commission or a decisional authority.

      (5) If any requester not described above in paragraphs (g)(1) through (4) of this section has a particular need for information designated as CEII, the requester may request the information using the following procedures:

      (i) File a signed, written request with the Commission's CEII Coordinator. The request must contain the following:

      (A) Requester's name (including any other name(s) which the requester has used and the dates the requester used such name(s)), title, address, and telephone number; and the name, address, and telephone number of the person or entity on whose behalf the information is requested;

      (B) A detailed Statement of Need, which must state: The extent to which a particular function is dependent upon access to the information; why the function cannot be achieved or performed without access to the information; an explanation of whether other information is available to the requester that could facilitate the same objective; how long the information will be needed; whether or not the information is needed to participate in a specific proceeding (with that proceeding identified); and an explanation of whether the information is needed expeditiously.

      (C) An executed non-disclosure agreement as described in paragraph (h)(2) of this section;

      (D) A signed statement attesting to the accuracy of the information provided in the request; and

      (E) A requester shall provide his or her date and place of birth upon request, if it is determined by the CEII Coordinator that this information is necessary to process the request.

      (ii) A requester who seeks the information on behalf of all employees of an organization should clearly state that the information is sought for the organization, that the requester is authorized to seek the information on behalf of the organization, and that all individuals in the organization that have access to the CEII will agree to be bound by a non-disclosure agreement that must be executed.

      (iii) After the request is received, the CEII Coordinator will determine if the information is CEII, and, if it is, whether to release the CEII to the requester. The CEII Coordinator will balance the requester's need for the information against the sensitivity of the information. If the requester is determined to be eligible to receive the information requested, the CEII Coordinator will determine what conditions, if any, to place on release of the information.

      (iv) If the CEII Coordinator determines that the CEII requester has not demonstrated a valid or legitimate need for the CEII or that access to the CEII should be denied for other reasons, this determination may be appealed to the General Counsel pursuant to § 388.110. The General Counsel will decide whether the information is properly classified as CEII, which by definition is exempt from release under FOIA, and whether the Commission should in its discretion make such CEII available to the CEII requester in view of the requester's asserted legitimacy and need.

      (v) Once a CEII requester has been verified by Commission staff as a legitimate requester who does not pose a security risk, his or her verification will be valid for the remainder of that calendar year. Such a requester is not required to provide detailed information about himself or herself with subsequent requests during the calendar year. He or she is also not required to file a non-disclosure agreement with subsequent requests during the calendar year because the original non-disclosure agreement will apply to all subsequent releases of CEII.

      (vi) An organization that is granted access to CEII pursuant to paragraph (g)(5)(ii) of this section may seek to add additional individuals to the non-disclosure agreement within one (1) year of the date of the initial CEII request. Such an organization must provide the names of the added individuals to the CEII Coordinator and certify that notice of each added individual has been given to the submitter. Any newly added individuals must execute a supplement to the original non-disclosure agreement indicating their acceptance of its terms. If there is no written opposition within five business days of notifying the CEII Coordinator and the submitter concerning the addition of any newly added individuals, the CEII Coordinator will issue a standard notice accepting the addition of these names to the non-disclosure agreement. If the submitter files a timely opposition with the CEII Coordinator, the CEII Coordinator will issue a formal determination addressing the merits of such opposition. If an organization that is granted access to CEII pursuant to paragraph (g)(5)(ii) of this section wants to add new individuals to its non-disclosure agreement more than one year after the date of its initial CEII request, the organization must submit a new CEII request pursuant to paragraph (g)(5)(ii) of this section and a new non-disclosure agreement for each new individual added.

      (vii) The CEII Coordinator will attempt to respond to the requester under this section according to the timing required for responses under the FOIA in § 388.108(c).

      (viii) Fees for processing CEII requests will be determined in accordance with § 388.109.

      (ix) Nothing in this section should be construed as requiring the release of proprietary information, personally identifiable information, cultural resource information, information on rare species of plants and animals, and other comparable data protected by statute or any privileged information, including information protected by the deliberative process privilege.

      (h)  Unauthorized disclosure of CEII is prohibited.

      (1) To ensure that the Commissioners, Commission employees, and Commission contractors protect CEII from unauthorized disclosure, internal controls will describe the handling, marking, and security controls for CEII.

      (2) Any individual who requests information pursuant to paragraph (g)(5) of this section must sign and execute a non-disclosure agreement, which indicates the individual's willingness to adhere to limitations on the use and disclosure of the information requested. The non-disclosure agreement will, at a minimum, require the following: CEII will only be used for the purpose for which it was requested; CEII may only be discussed with authorized recipients; CEII must be kept in a secure place in a manner that would prevent unauthorized access; CEII must be destroyed or returned to the Commission upon request; the Commission may audit the recipient's compliance with the non-disclosure agreement; CEII provided pursuant to the agreement is not subject to release under either FOIA or Sunshine Laws; a recipient is obligated to protect the CEII even after a designation has lapsed until the CEII Coordinator determines the information should no longer be designated as CEII under paragraph (e)(2) of this section; and a recipient is required to promptly report all unauthorized disclosures of CEII to the Commission.

      (i)  Any officers, employees, or agents of the Commission who knowingly and willfully disclose CEII in a manner that is not authorized under this section will be subject to appropriate sanctions, such as removal from the federal service, or possible referral for criminal prosecution. Commissioners who knowingly and willfully disclose CEII without authorization may be referred to the Department of Energy Inspector General. The Commission will take responsibility for investigating and, as necessary, imposing sanctions on its employees and agents.

      (j)  (1) Submitters who receive a determination that the Commission intends to remove a CEII designation may appeal that determination. The submitter must file notice of its intent to appeal that determination within five business days of the determination. The notice of intent to file an appeal must be sent to the General Counsel, with a copy to the CEII Coordinator. A statement in support of the notice of appeal must be submitted to the General Counsel within 20 business days of the date of the determination. The appeal will be considered received upon receipt of the statement in support of the notice of appeal.

      (2) Individuals who receive a determination denying a request for the release of CEII, in whole or in part, or a determination denying a request to change the designation of CEII may appeal such determinations.
