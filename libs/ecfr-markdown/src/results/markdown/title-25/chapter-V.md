#### § § 900.1

      These regulations are prepared, issued, and maintained jointly by the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the Secretary of the Interior, with the active participation and representation of Indian tribes, tribal organizations, and individual tribal members pursuant to the guidance of the Negotiated Rulemaking procedures required by section 107 of the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act.

      § 900.2   Purpose and scope.

#### § § 900.2

      (a)  These regulations codify uniform and consistent rules for contracts by the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) and the Department of the Interior (DOI) in implementing title I of the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act, Public Law 93-638, 25 U.S.C. 450  as amended and sections 1 through 9 preceding that title.

      (b)  Included under this part are programs administered (under current or future law or interagency agreement) by the DHHS and the DOI for the benefit of Indians for which appropriations are made to other Federal agencies.

      (c)  Each contract, including grants and cooperative agreements in lieu of contracts awarded under section 9 of the Act, shall include by reference the provisions of this part, and any amendment thereto, and they are binding on the Secretary and the contractor except as otherwise specifically authorized by a waiver under section 107(e) of the Act.

      (d)  Access to records maintained by the Secretary is governed by the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) and other applicable Federal law.

      § 900.3   Policy statements.

#### § § 900.3

      (a)  (1) Congress has recognized the obligation of the United States to respond to the strong expression of the Indian people for self-determination by assuring maximum Indian participation in the direction, planning, conduct and administration of educational as well as other Federal programs and services to Indian communities so as to render such programs and services more responsive to the needs and desires of those communities.

      (2) Congress has declared its commitment to the maintenance of the Federal Government's unique and continuing relationship with, and responsibility to, individual Indian tribes and to the Indian people as a whole through the establishment of a meaningful Indian self-determination policy which will permit an orderly transition from the Federal domination of programs for, and services to, Indians to effective and meaningful participation by the Indian people in the planning, conduct, and administration of those programs and services. In accordance with this policy, the United States is committed to supporting and assisting Indian tribes in the development of strong and stable tribal governments, capable of administering quality programs and developing the economies of their respective communities.

      (3) Congress has declared that a major national goal of the United States is to provide the quantity and quality of educational services and opportunities which will permit Indian children to compete and excel in the life areas of their choice, and to achieve the measure of self-determination essential to their social and economic well-being.

      (4) Congress has declared that the programs, functions, services, or activities that are contracted and funded under this Act shall include administrative functions of the Department of the Interior and the Department of Health and Human Services (whichever is applicable) that support the delivery of services to Indians, including those administrative activities supportive of, but not included as part of, the service delivery programs described in this paragraph that are otherwise contractible. The administrative functions referred to in the preceding sentence shall be contractible without regard to the organizational level within the Department that carries out such functions. Contracting of the administrative functions described herein shall not be construed to limit or reduce in any way the funding for any program, function, service, or activity serving any other tribe under the Act or any other law. The Secretary is not required to reduce funding for programs, projects, or activities serving a tribe to make funds available to another Indian tribe or tribal organization under this Act.

      (5) Congress has further declared that each provision of the Act and each provision of contracts entered into thereunder shall be liberally construed for the benefit of the tribes or tribal organizations to transfer the funding and the related functions, services, activities, and programs (or portions thereof), that are otherwise contractible under the Act, including all related administrative functions, from the Federal government to the contractor.

      (6) Congress has declared that one of the primary goals of the 1994 amendments to the Act was to minimize the reporting requirements applicable to tribal contractors and to eliminate excessive and burdensome reporting requirements. Reporting requirements over and above the annual audit report are to be negotiated with disagreements subject to the declination procedures of section 102 of the Act.

      (7) Congress has declared that there not be any threshold issues which would avoid the declination, contract review, approval, and appeal process.

      (8) Congress has declared that all self-determination contract proposals must be supported by the resolution of an Indian tribe(s).

      (9) Congress has declared that to the extent that programs, functions, services, and activities carried out by tribes and tribal organizations pursuant to contracts entered into under this Act reduce the administrative or other responsibilities of the Secretary with respect to the operation of Indian programs and result in savings that have not otherwise been included in the amount of contract funds determined under section 106(a) of the Act, the Secretary shall make such savings available for the provision of additional services to program beneficiaries, either directly or through contractors, in a manner equitable to both direct and contracted programs.

      (b)  (1) It is the policy of the Secretary to facilitate the efforts of Indian tribes and tribal organizations to plan, conduct and administer programs, functions, services and activities, or portions thereof, which the Departments are authorized to administer for the benefit of Indians because of their status as Indians. The Secretary shall make best efforts to remove any obstacles which might hinder Indian tribes and tribal organizations including obstacles that hinder tribal autonomy and flexibility in the administration of such programs.

      (2) It is the policy of the Secretary to encourage Indian tribes and tribal organizations to become increasingly knowledgeable about the Departments' programs administered for the benefit of Indians by providing information on such programs, functions and activities and the opportunities Indian tribes have regarding them.

      (3) It is the policy of the Secretary to provide a uniform and consistent set of rules for contracts under the Act. The rules contained herein are designed to facilitate and encourage Indian tribes to participate in the planning, conduct, and administration of those Federal programs serving Indian people. The Secretary shall afford Indian tribes and tribal organizations the flexibility, information, and discretion necessary to design contractible programs to meet the needs of their communities consistent with their diverse demographic, geographic, economic, cultural, health, social, religious and institutional needs.

      (4) The Secretary recognizes that contracting under the Act is an exercise by Indian tribes of the government-to-government relationship between the United States and the Indian tribes. When an Indian tribe contracts, there is a transfer of the responsibility with the associated funding. The tribal contractor is accountable for managing the day-to-day operations of the contracted Federal programs, functions, services, and activities. The contracting tribe thereby accepts the responsibility and accountability to the beneficiaries under the contract with respect to use of the funds and the satisfactory performance of the programs, functions, services and activities funded under the contract. The Secretary will continue to discharge the trust responsibilities to protect and conserve the trust resources of Indian tribes and the trust resources of individual Indians.

      (5) The Secretary recognizes that tribal decisions to contract or not to contract are equal expressions of self-determination.

      (6) The Secretary shall maintain consultation with tribal governments and tribal organizations in the Secretary's budget process relating to programs, functions, services and activities subject to the Act. In addition, on an annual basis, the Secretary shall consult with, and solicit the participation of, Indian tribes and tribal organizations in the development of the budget for the Indian Health Service and the Bureau of Indian Affairs (including participation of Indian tribes and tribal organizations in formulating annual budget requests that the Secretary submits to the President for submission to Congress pursuant to section 1105 of title 31, United States Code).

      (7) The Secretary is committed to implementing and fully supporting the policy of Indian self-determination by recognizing and supporting the many positive and successful efforts and directions of tribal governments and extending the applicability of this policy to all operational components within the Department. By fully extending Indian self-determination contracting to all operational components within the Department having programs or portions of programs for the benefit of Indians under section 102(a)(1) (A) through (D) and for the benefit of Indians because of their status as Indians under section 102(a)(1)(E), it is the Secretary's intent to support and assist Indian tribes in the development of strong and stable tribal governments capable of administering quality programs that meet the tribally determined needs and directions of their respective communities. It is also the policy of the Secretary to have all other operational components within the Department work cooperatively with tribal governments on a government-to-government basis so as to expedite the transition away from Federal domination of Indian programs and make the ideals of Indian self-government and self-determination a reality.

      (8) It is the policy of the Secretary that the contractibility of programs under this Act should be encouraged. In this regard, Federal laws and regulations should be interpreted in a manner that will facilitate the inclusion of those programs or portions of those programs that are for the benefit of Indians under section 102(a)(1) (A) through (D) of the Act, and that are for the benefit of Indians because of their status of Indians under section 102(a)(1)(E) of the Act.

      (9) It is the Secretary's policy that no later than upon receipt of a contract proposal under the Act (or written notice of an Indian tribe or tribal organization's intention to contract), the Secretary shall commence planning such administrative actions, including but not limited to transfers or reductions in force, transfers of property, and transfers of contractible functions, as may be necessary to ensure a timely transfer of responsibilities and funding to Indian tribes and tribal organizations.

      (10) It is the policy of the Secretary to make available to Indian tribes and tribal organizations all administrative functions that may lawfully be contracted under the Act, employing methodologies consistent with the methodology employed with respect to such functions under titles III and IV of the Act.

      (11) The Secretary's commitment to Indian self-determination requires that these regulations be liberally construed for the benefit of Indian tribes and tribal organizations to effectuate the strong Federal policy of self-determination and, further, that any ambiguities herein be construed in favor of the Indian tribe or tribal organization so as to facilitate and enable the transfer of services, programs, functions, and activities, or portions thereof, authorized by the Act.

      (d) Impeding awards by other Departments and agencies of the United States to Indian tribes to administer Indian programs under any other applicable law.

      § 900.22   For what reasons can the Secretary decline a proposal?

#### § § 900.22

      The Secretary may only decline to approve a proposal for one of five specific reasons:

      (a) The service to be rendered to the Indian beneficiaries of the particular program or function to be contracted will not be satisfactory;

      (b) Adequate protection of trust resources is not assured;

      (c) The proposed project or function to be contracted for cannot be properly completed or maintained by the proposed contract;

      (d) The amount of funds proposed under the contract is in excess of the applicable funding level for the contract, as determined under section 106(a) of the Act; or

      (e) The program, function, service, or activity (or a portion thereof) that is the subject of the proposal is beyond the scope of programs, functions, services, or activities covered under section 102(a)(1) of the Act because the proposal includes activities that cannot lawfully be carried out by the contractor.

#### § § 900.23

      No. The Secretary may not decline to enter into a contract with an Indian tribe or tribal organization based on any objection that will be overcome through the contract.

#### § § 900.24

      No. The Secretary may only decline a proposal based upon one or more of the five reasons listed above. If a contract affects the preexisting level of services to any other tribe, the Secretary shall address that effect in the Secretary's annual report to Congress under section 106(c)(6) of the Act.

      § 900.25   What if only a portion of a proposal raises one of the five declination criteria?

#### § § 900.25

      The Secretary must approve any severable portion of a proposal that does not support a declination finding described in § 900.20, subject to any alteration in the scope of the proposal that the Secretary and the Indian tribe or tribal organization approve.

      § 900.26   What happens if the Secretary declines a part of a proposal on the ground that the proposal proposes in part to plan, conduct, or administer a program, function, service or activity that is beyond the scope of programs covered under section 102(a) of the Act, or proposes a level of funding that is in excess of the applicable level determined under section 106(a) of the Act?

#### § § 900.26

      In those situations the Secretary is required, as appropriate, to approve the portion of the program, function, service, or activity that is authorized under section 102(a) of the Act, or approve a level of funding that is authorized under section 106(a) of the Act. As noted in § 900.25, the approval is subject to any alteration in the scope of the proposal that the Secretary and the Indian tribe or tribal organization approve.

      § 900.27   If an Indian tribe or tribal organization elects to contract for a severable portion of a proposal, does the Indian tribe or tribal organization lose its appeal rights to challenge the portion of the proposal that was declined?

#### § § 900.27

      No, but the hearing and appeal procedures contained in these regulations only apply to the portion of the proposal that was declined.

      § 900.28   Is technical assistance available to an Indian tribe or tribal organization to avoid declination of a proposal?

#### § § 900.28

      Yes. In accordance with section 103(d) of the Act, upon receiving a proposal, the Secretary shall provide any necessary requested technical assistance to an Indian tribe or tribal organization, and shall share all relevant information with the Indian tribe or tribal organization, in order to avoid declination of the proposal.

      § 900.29   What is the Secretary required to do if the Secretary decides to decline all or a portion of a proposal?

#### § § 900.29

      If the Secretary decides to decline all or a severable portion of a proposal, the Secretary is required:

      (a) To advise the Indian tribe or tribal organization in writing of the Secretary's objections, including a specific finding that clearly demonstrates that (or that is supported by a controlling legal authority that) one of the conditions set forth in § 900.22 exists, together with a detailed explanation of the reason for the decision to decline the proposal and, within 20 days, any documents relied on in making the decision; and

      (b) To advise the Indian tribe or tribal organization in writing of the rights described in § 900.31.

      § 900.30   When the Secretary declines all or a portion of a proposal, is the Secretary required to provide an Indian tribe or tribal organization with technical assistance?

#### § § 900.30

      Yes. The Secretary shall provide additional technical assistance to overcome the stated objections, in accordance with section 102(b) of the Act, and shall provide any necessary requested technical assistance to develop any modifications to overcome the Secretary's stated objections.

      § 900.31   When the Secretary declines all or a portion of a proposal, is an Indian tribe or tribal organization entitled to any appeal?

#### § § 900.31

      Yes. The Indian tribe or tribal organization is entitled to an appeal on the objections raised by the Secretary, with an agency hearing on the record, and the right to engage in full discovery relevant to any issue raised in the matter. The procedures for appeals are in subpart L of these regulations. Alternatively, at its option the Indian tribe or tribal organization has the right to sue in Federal district court to challenge the Secretary's decision.

      § 900.32   Can the Secretary decline an Indian tribe or tribal organization's proposed successor annual funding agreement?

#### § § 900.32

      No. If it is substantially the same as the prior annual funding agreement (except for funding increases included in appropriations acts or funding reductions as provided in section 106(b) of the Act) and the contract is with DHHS or the BIA, the Secretary shall approve and add to the contract the full amount of funds to which the contractor is entitled, and may not decline, any portion of a successor annual funding agreement. Any portion of an annual funding agreement proposal which is not substantially the same as that which was funded previously (e.g., a redesign proposal; waiver proposal; different proposed funding amount; or different program, service, function, or activity), or any annual funding agreement proposal which pertains to a contract with an agency of DOI other than the BIA, is subject to the declination criteria and procedures in subpart E. If there is a disagreement over the availability of appropriations, the Secretary may decline the proposal in part under the procedure in subpart E.

      § 900.33   Are all proposals to renew term contracts subject to the declination criteria?

#### § § 900.33

      Department of Health and Human Services and the Bureau of Indian Affairs will not review the renewal of a term contract for declination issues where no material and substantial change to the scope or funding of a program, functions, services, or activities has been proposed by the Indian tribe or tribal organization. Proposals to renew term contracts with DOI agencies other than the Bureau of Indian Affairs may be reviewed under the declination criteria.

    Subpart F—Standards for Tribal or Tribal Organization Management Systems

      General

        § 900.35   What is the purpose of this subpart?

#### § § 900.35

        This subpart contains the minimum standards for the management systems used by Indian tribes or tribal organizations when carrying out self-determination contracts. It provides standards for an Indian tribe or tribal organization's financial management system, procurement management system, and property management system.

        § 900.36   What requirements are imposed upon Indian tribes or tribal organizations by this subpart?

#### § § 900.36

        When carrying out self-determination contracts, Indian tribes and tribal organizations shall develop, implement, and maintain systems that meet these minimum standards, unless one or more of the standards have been waived, in whole or in part, under section 107(e) of the Act and subpart K.

        § 900.37   What provisions of Office of Management and Budget (OMB) circulars or the “common rule” apply to self-determination contracts?

#### § § 900.37

        The only provisions of OMB Circulars and the only provisions of the “common rule” that apply to self-determination contracts are the provisions adopted in these regulations, those expressly required or modified by the Act, and those negotiated and agreed to in a self-determination contract.

        § 900.38   Do these standards apply to the subcontractors of an Indian tribe or tribal organization carrying out a self-determination contract?

#### § § 900.38

        An Indian tribe or tribal organization may require that some or all of the standards in this subpart be imposed upon its subcontractors when carrying out a self-determination contract.

        § 900.39   What is the difference between a standard and a system?

#### § § 900.39

        (a) Standards are the minimum baseline requirements for the performance of an activity. Standards establish the “what” that an activity should accomplish.

        (b) Systems are the procedural mechanisms and processes for the day-to-day conduct of an activity. Systems are “how” the activity will be accomplished.

        § 900.40   When are Indian tribe or tribal organization management standards and management systems evaluated?

#### § § 900.40

        (a) Management standards are evaluated by the Secretary when the Indian tribe or tribal organization submits an initial contract proposal.

        (b) Management systems are evaluated by an independent auditor through the annual single agency audit report that is required by the Act and OMB Circular A-128.

        § 900.41   How long must an Indian tribe or tribal organization keep management system records?

#### § § 900.41

        The Indian tribe or tribal organization must retain financial, procurement and property records for the minimum periods described below. Electronic, magnetic or photographic records may be substituted for hard copies.

        (a)  Financial records include documentation of supporting costs incurred under the contract. These records must be retained for three years from the date of submission of the single audit report to the Secretary.

        (b)  Procurement records include solicitations, purchase orders, contracts, payment histories and records applicable of significant decisions. These records must be retained for three years after the Indian tribe or tribal organization or subcontractors make final payment and all other pending matters are closed.

        (c)  Property management records of real and personal property transactions must be retained for three years from the date of disposition, replacement, or transfer.

        (d)  Records pertaining to any litigation, audit exceptions or claims requiring management systems data must be retained until the action has been completed.

        § 900.42   What are the general financial management system standards that apply to an Indian tribe carrying out a self-determination contract?

#### § § 900.42

        An Indian tribe shall expend and account for contract funds in accordance with all applicable tribal laws, regulations, and procedures.

        § 900.43   What are the general financial management system standards that apply to a tribal organization carrying out a self-determination contract?

#### § § 900.44

        The fiscal control and accounting procedures of an Indian tribe or tribal organization shall be sufficient to:

        (a) Permit preparation of reports required by a self-determination contract and the Act; and

        (b) Permit the tracing of contract funds to a level of expenditure adequate to establish that they have not been used in violation of any restrictions or prohibitions contained in any statute that applies to the self-determination contract.

        § 900.45   What specific minimum requirements shall an Indian tribe or tribal organization's financial management system contain to meet these standards?

#### § § 900.45

        An Indian tribe or tribal organization's financial management system shall include provisions for the following seven elements.

        (a)  The financial management system shall provide for accurate, current, and complete disclosure of the financial results of self-determination contract activities. This includes providing the Secretary a completed Financial Status Report, SF 269A, as negotiated and agreed to in the self-determination contract.

        (b)  The financial management system shall maintain records sufficiently detailed to identify the source and application of self-determination contract funds received by the Indian tribe or tribal organization. The system shall contain sufficient information to identify contract awards, obligations and unobligated balances, assets, liabilities, outlays, or expenditures and income.

        (c)  The financial management system shall maintain effective control and accountability for all self-determination contract funds received and for all Federal real property, personal property, and other assets furnished for use by the Indian tribe or tribal organization under the self-determination contract.

        (d)  The financial management system shall permit the comparison of actual expenditures or outlays with the amounts budgeted by the Indian tribe or tribal organization for each self-determination contract.

        (e)  The financial management system shall be sufficient to determine the reasonableness, allowability, and allocability of self-determination contract costs based upon the terms of the self-determination contract and the Indian tribe or tribal organization's applicable OMB cost principles, as amended by the Act and these regulations. (The following chart lists certain OMB Circulars and suggests the entities that may use each, but the final selection of the applicable circular may differ from those shown, as agreed to by the Indian tribe or tribal organization and the Secretary. Agreements between an Indian tribe or tribal organization and the Secretary currently in place do not require renegotiation.) Copies of these circulars are available from the Executive Office of the President, Publications Service, 725 17th Street N. W., Washington, D. C. 20503.

        (f)  The financial management system shall contain accounting records that are supported by source documentation, e.g., canceled checks, paid bills, payroll records, time and attendance records, contract award documents, purchase orders, and other primary records that support self-determination contract fund expenditures.

        (g)  The financial management system shall provide for accurate, current, and complete disclosure of cash revenues disbursements, cash-on-hand balances, and obligations by source and application for each Indian tribe or tribal organization, and subcontractor if applicable, so that complete and accurate cash transactions may be prepared as required by the self-determination contract.

        § 900.46   What requirements are imposed upon the Secretary for financial management by these standards?

#### § § 900.46

        The Secretary shall establish procedures, consistent with Treasury regulations as modified by the Act, for the transfer of funds from the United States to the Indian tribe or tribal organization in strict compliance with the self-determination contract and the annual funding agreement.

      Procurement Management System Standards

        § 900.47   When procuring property or services with self-determination contract funds, can an Indian tribe or tribal organization follow the same procurement policies and procedures applicable to other Indian tribe or tribal organization funds?

#### § § 900.47

        Indian tribes and tribal organizations shall have standards that conform to the standards in this subpart. If the Indian tribe or tribal organization relies upon standards different than those described below, it shall identify the standards it will use as a proposed waiver in the initial contract proposal or as a waiver request to an existing contract.

        § 900.48   If the Indian tribe or tribal organization does not propose different standards, what basic standards shall the Indian tribe or tribal organization follow?

#### § § 900.48

        (a) The Indian tribe or tribal organization shall ensure that its vendors and/or subcontractors perform in accordance with the terms, conditions, and specifications of their contracts or purchase orders.

        (b) The Indian tribe or tribal organization shall maintain written standards of conduct governing the performance of its employees who award and administer contracts.

        (1) No employee, officer, elected official, or agent of the Indian tribe or tribal organization shall participate in the selection, award, or administration of a procurement supported by Federal funds if a conflict of interest, real or apparent, would be involved.

        (2) An employee, officer, elected official, or agent of an Indian tribe or tribal organization, or of a subcontractor of the Indian tribe or tribal organization, is not allowed to solicit or accept gratuities, favors, or anything of monetary value from contractors, potential contractors, or parties to sub-agreements, with the following exemptions. The Indian tribe or tribal organization may exempt a financial interest that is not substantial or a gift that is an unsolicited item of nominal value.

        (3) These standards shall also provide for penalties, sanctions, or other disciplinary actions for violations of the standards.

        (c) The Indian tribe or tribal organization shall review proposed procurements to avoid buying unnecessary or duplicative items and ensure the reasonableness of the price. The Indian tribe or tribal organization should consider consolidating or breaking out procurement to obtain more economical purchases. Where appropriate, the Indian tribe or tribal organization shall compare leasing and purchasing alternatives to determine which is more economical.

        (d) The Indian tribe or tribal organization shall conduct all major procurement transactions by providing full and open competition, to the extent necessary to assure efficient expenditure of contract funds and to the extent feasible in the local area.

        (1) Indian tribes or tribal organizations shall develop their own definition for “major procurement transactions.”

        (2) As provided in sections 7 (b) and (c) of the Act, Indian preference and tribal preferences shall be applied in any procurement award.

        (e) The Indian tribe or tribal organization shall make procurement awards only to responsible entities who have the ability to perform successfully under the terms and conditions of the proposed procurement. In making this judgment, the Indian tribe or tribal organization will consider such matters as the contractor's integrity, its compliance with public policy, its record of past performance, and its financial and technical resources.

        (f) The Indian tribe or tribal organization shall maintain records on the significant history of all major procurement transactions. These records may include, but are not limited to, the rationale for the method of procurement, the selection of contract type, the contract selection or rejection, and the basis for the contract price.

        (g) The Indian tribe or tribal organization is solely responsible, using good administrative practice and sound business judgment, for processing and settling all contractual and administrative issues arising out of a procurement. These issues include, but are not limited to, source evaluation, protests, disputes, and claims.

        (1) The settlement of any protest, dispute, or claim shall not relieve the Indian tribe or tribal organization of any obligations under a self-determination contract.

        (2) Violations of law shall be referred to the tribal or Federal authority having proper jurisdiction.

        § 900.49   What procurement standards apply to subcontracts?

#### § § 900.49

        Each subcontract entered into under the Act shall at a minimum:

        (a) Be in writing;

        (b) Identify the interested parties, their authorities, and the purposes of the contract;

        (c) State the work to be performed under the contract;

        § 900.50   What Federal laws, regulations, and Executive Orders apply to subcontractors?

#### § § 900.50

        Certain provisions of the Act as well as other applicable Federal laws, regulations, and Executive Orders apply to subcontracts awarded under self-determination contracts. As a result, subcontracts should contain a provision informing the recipient that their award is funded with Indian Self-Determination Act funds and that the recipient is responsible for identifying and ensuring compliance with applicable Federal laws, regulations, and Executive Orders. The Secretary and the Indian tribe or tribal organization may, through negotiation, identify all or a portion of such requirements in the self-determination contract and, if so identified, these requirements should be identified in subcontracts.

      Property Management System Standards

        § 900.51   What is an Indian tribe or tribal organization's property management system expected to do?

#### § § 900.51

        An Indian tribe or tribal organization's property management system shall account for all property furnished or transferred by the Secretary for use under a self-determination contract or acquired with contract funds. The property management system shall contain requirements for the use, care, maintenance, and disposition of Federally-owned and other property as follows:

        (a) Where title vests in the Indian tribe, in accordance with tribal law and procedures; or

        (c) To ensure that property is used for an Indian tribe or tribal organization's self-determination contract(s) until the property is declared excess to the needs of the contract consistent with the Indian tribe or tribal organization's property management system.

        § 900.55   What are the standards for inventories?

#### § § 900.55

        A physical inventory should be conducted at least once every 2 years. The results of the inventory shall be reconciled with the Indian tribe or tribal organization's internal property and accounting records.

        § 900.56   What maintenance is required for property?

#### § § 900.56

        Required maintenance includes the performance of actions necessary to keep the property in good working condition, the procedures recommended by equipment manufacturers, and steps necessary to protect the interests of the contractor and the Secretary in any express warranties or guarantees covering the property.

        § 900.57   What if the Indian tribe or tribal organization chooses not to take title to property furnished or acquired under the contract?

#### § § 900.57

        If the Indian tribe or tribal organization chooses not to take title to property furnished by the government or acquired with contract funds, title to the property remains vested in the Secretary. A list of Federally-owned property to be used under the contract shall be included in the contract.

        § 900.58   Do the same accountability and control procedures described above apply to Federal property?

#### § § 900.58

        Yes, except that requirements for the inventory and disposal of Federal property are different.

        § 900.59   How are the inventory requirements for Federal property different than for tribal property?

#### § § 900.59

        There are three additional requirements:

        (a) The Indian tribe or tribal organization shall conduct a physical inventory of the Federally-owned property and reconcile the results with the Indian tribe or tribal organization's property records annually, rather than every 2 years;

        (b) Within 90 days following the end of an annual funding agreement, the Indian tribe or tribal organization shall certify and submit to the Secretary an annual inventory of all Federally-owned real and personal property used in the contracted program; and

        (a) The Indian tribe or tribal organization shall state whether the Indian tribe or tribal organization wants to dispose of or return the property.

        (b) If the Secretary does not respond within 60 days, the Indian tribe or tribal organization may return the property to the Secretary, who shall accept transfer, custody, control, and responsibility for the property (together with all associated costs).

    Subpart G—Programmatic Reports and Data Requirements

      § 900.65   What programmatic reports and data shall the Indian tribe or tribal organization provide?

#### § § 900.65

      Unless required by statute, there are no mandatory reporting requirements. Each Indian tribe or tribal organization shall negotiate with the Secretary the type and frequency of program narrative and program data report(s) which respond to the needs of the contracting parties and that are appropriate for the purposes of the contract. The extent of available resources will be a consideration in the negotiations.

      § 900.66   What happens if the Indian tribe or tribal organization and the Secretary cannot come to an agreement concerning the type and/or frequency of program narrative and/or program data report(s)?

#### § § 900.66

      Any disagreements over reporting requirements are subject to the declination criteria and procedures in section 102 of the Act and subpart E.

      § 900.67   Will there be a uniform data set for all IHS programs?

#### § § 900.67

      IHS will work with Indian tribe or tribal organization representatives to develop a mutually defined uniform subset of data that is consistent with Congressional intent, imposes a minimal reporting burden, and which responds to the needs of the contracting parties.

      § 900.68   Will this uniform data set be required of all Indian tribe or tribal organizations contracting with the IHS under the Act?

#### § § 900.68

      No. The uniform data set, applicable to the services to be performed, will serve as the target for the Secretary and the Indian tribes or tribal organizations during individual negotiations on program data reporting requirements.

        § 900.101   Is excess BIA or IHS real property to which an Indian tribe or tribal organization has taken title eligible for facilities operation and maintenance funding from the Secretary?

#### § § 900.101

        Yes.

      Excess or Surplus Government Property of Other Agencies

        § 900.102   What is excess or surplus government property of other agencies?

#### § § 900.102

    Subpart J—Construction

      § 900.110   What does this subpart cover?

#### § § 900.110

      (a) This subpart establishes requirements for issuing fixed-price or cost-reimbursable contracts to provide: design, construction, repair, improvement, expansion, replacement, erection of new space, or demolition and other related work for one or more Federal facilities.

      (2) While planning services and construction management services as defined in § 900.113 may be included in a construction contract under this subpart, they may also be contracted separately using the model agreement in section 108 of the Act.

      § 900.111   What activities of construction programs are contractible?

#### § § 900.111

      The Secretary shall, upon the request of any Indian tribe or tribal organization authorized by tribal resolution, enter into a self-determination contract to plan, conduct, and administer construction programs or portions thereof.

#### § § 900.112

      (a) Construction programs generally include the following activities in phases which can vary by funding source (an Indian tribe or tribal organization should contact its funding source for more information regarding the conduct of its program):

      (1)  The phase during which an initial assessment and determination of project need is made and supporting information collected for presentation in a project application. This project application process is explained in more detail in § 900.122;

      (2)  The phase during which planning services are provided. This phase can include conducting and preparing a detailed needs assessment, developing justification documents, completing and/or verifying master plans, conducting predesign site investigations and selection, developing budget cost estimates, conducting feasibility studies, and developing a project Program of Requirements (POR);

      (3)  The phase during which licensed design professional(s) using the POR as the basis for design of the project, prepare project plans, specifications, and other documents that are a part of the construction documents used to build the project. Site investigation and selection activities are completed in this phase if not conducted as part of the planning phase.

      (1) Management; and

      (2) Environmental, archeological, cultural resource, historic preservation, and similar assessments and associated activities.

      § 900.113   Definitions.

#### § § 900.113

      (a)  means a fixed-price or cost-reimbursement self-determination contract for a construction project, except that such term does not include any contract:

      (1) That is limited to providing planning services and construction management services (or a combination of such services);

      (2) For the Housing Improvement Program or roads maintenance program of the Bureau of Indian Affairs administered by the Secretary of the Interior; or

      (3) For the health facility maintenance and improvement program administered by the Secretary of Health and Human Services.

      (b)  (CMS) means activities limited to administrative support services; coordination; and monitoring oversight of the planning, design, and construction process. An Indian tribe or tribal organization's employee or construction management services consultant (typically an engineer or architect) performs such activities as:

      (1) Coordination and information exchange between the Indian tribe or tribal organization and the Federal government;

      (2) Preparation of Indian tribe or tribal organization's construction contract proposals;

      (3) Indian tribe or tribal organization subcontract scope of work identification and subcontract preparation, and competitive selection of Indian tribe or tribal organization construction contract subcontractors (see § 900.110);

      (4) Review of work to ensure compliance with the POR and/or the construction contract. This does not involve construction project management as defined in paragraph (d) of this section.

      (c)  include programs for the planning, design, construction, repair, improvement, and expansion of buildings or facilities, including but not limited to, housing, law enforcement and detention facilities, sanitation and water systems, roads, schools, administration and health facilities, irrigation and agricultural work, water conservation, flood control, and port facilities, and environmental, archeological, cultural resource, historic preservation, and conduct of similar assessments.

      (d)  means direct responsibility for the construction project through day-to-day on-site management and administration of the project. Activities may include cost management, project budgeting, project scheduling, procurement services.

      (g)  (POR) is a planning document developed during the planning phase for an individual project. It provides background about the project; site information; programmatic needs; and, for facilities projects, a detailed room-by-room listing of spaces, including net and gross sizes, finish materials to be used, furnishings and equipment, and other information and design criteria on which to base the construction project documents.

      (h)  means the description of the work to be provided through a contract issued under this subpart and the methods and processes to be used to accomplish that work. A scope of work is typically developed based on criteria provided in a POR during the design phase, and project construction documents (plans and specifications) during the construction phase.

      § 900.114   Why is there a separate subpart in these regulations for construction contracts and grants?

#### § § 900.114

      There is a separate subpart because the Act differentiates between construction contracts and the model agreement in section 108 of the Act which is required for contracting other activities. Construction contracts are separately defined in the Act and are subject to a separate proposal and review process.

      § 900.115   How do self-determination construction contracts relate to ordinary Federal procurement contracts?

#### § § 900.115

      (a) A self-determination construction contract is a government-to-government agreement that transfers control of the construction project, including administrative functions, to the contracting Indian tribe or tribal organization to facilitate effective and meaningful participation by the Indian tribe or tribal organization in planning, conducting, and administering the construction project, and so that the construction project is responsive to the true needs of the Indian community. The Secretary's role in the conduct of a contracted construction project is limited to the Secretary's responsibilities set out in § 900.131.

      (b) Self-determination construction contracts are not traditional “procurement” contracts.

      (1) With respect to a construction contract (or a subcontract of such a construction contract), the provisions of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act (41 U.S.C. 401 ) and the regulations promulgated under that Act, shall apply to a construction contract or subcontract only to the extent that application of the provision is:

      (i) Necessary to ensure that the contract may be carried out in a satisfactory manner;

      (ii) Directly related to the construction activity; and

      (iii) Not inconsistent with the Act.

      (2) A list of the Federal requirements that meet the requirements of this paragraph shall be included in an attachment to the contract under negotiations between the Secretary and the Indian tribe or tribal organization.

      (3) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, no Federal law listed in section 105(3)(C)(ii) of the Act or any other provision of Federal law (including an Executive order) relating to acquisition by the Federal government shall apply to a construction contract that an Indian tribe or tribal organization enters into under this Act, unless expressly provided in the law.

      (c) Provisions of a construction contract under this subpart shall be liberally construed in favor of the contracting Indian tribe or tribal organization.

      § 900.116   Are negotiated fixed-price contracts treated the same as cost-reimbursable contracts?

#### § § 900.116

      Yes, except that in negotiated fixed-price construction contracts, appropriate clauses shall be negotiated to allocate properly the contract risks between the government and the contractor.

      § 900.117   Do these “construction contract” regulations apply to planning services?

#### § § 900.117

      (a) These regulations apply to planning services contracts only as provided in this section.

      (1) The Indian tribe or tribal organization shall submit to the Secretary for review and approval the POR documents produced as a part of a model contract under section 108 of the Act or under a construction contract under this subpart.

      (i) Within 60 days after receipt of the POR from the Indian tribe or tribal organization for a project that has achieved priority ranking or that is funded, the Secretary shall:

      (A) Approve the POR;

      (B) Notify the Indian tribe or tribal organization of and make available any objections to the POR that the Secretary may have; or

      (C) Notify the Indian tribe or tribal organization of the reasons why the Secretary will be unable either to approve the POR or to notify the Indian tribe or tribal organization of any objections within 60 days, and state the time within which the notification will be made, provided that the extended time shall not exceed 60 additional days.

      (ii) Within a maximum of 180 days after receipt of a POR from an Indian tribe or tribal organization for a project that is not funded and is not described in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section, the Secretary shall:

      (A) Approve the POR; or

      (B) Notify the Indian tribe or tribal organization of and make available any objections to the POR; or

      (C) Notify the Indian tribe or tribal organization of the reasons why the Secretary will be unable either to approve the POR or to notify the Indian tribe or tribal organization of any objections within 180 days, and state the time within which the notification will be made, provided that the extended time shall not exceed 60 additional days.

      (2) Any failure of the Secretary to act on a POR within the applicable period required in paragraph (a)(1) of this section will be deemed a rejection of the POR and will authorize the commencement of any appeal as provided in section 110 of the Act, or, if a model agreement under section 108 of the Act is used, the disputes provision of that agreement.

      (3) If an Indian tribe or tribal organization elects to provide planning services as part of a construction contract rather than under a model agreement as set out in section 108 of the Act, the regulations in this subpart shall apply.

      (b) The parties to the contract are encouraged to consult during the development of the POR and following submission of the POR to the Secretary.

      § 900.118   Do these “construction contract” regulations apply to construction management services?

#### § § 900.118

      No. Construction management services may be contracted separately under section 108 of the Act. Construction management services consultants and/or Indian tribe or tribal organization employees assist and advise the Indian tribe or tribal organization to implement construction contracts, but have no contractual relationship with or authority to direct construction contract subcontractors.

      (a) If the Indian tribe or tribal organization chooses to contract solely for construction management services, these services shall be limited to:

      (1) Coordination and exchange of information between the Indian tribe or tribal organization and the Secretary;

      (2) Review of work produced by the Secretary to determine compliance with:

      (i) The POR and design contract during the design stage; or

      (ii) The project construction documents during the construction stage;

      (3) Disputes shall be resolved in accordance with the disputes clause of the CMS contract.

      (b) If the Indian tribe or tribal organization conducts CMS under section 108 of the Act and the Indian tribe or tribal organization contracts separately under this subpart for all or some of the activities in § 900.110, the contracted activities shall be limited to:

      (1) Coordination and exchange of information between the Indian tribe or tribal organization and Secretary;

      (2) Preparation of tribal or tribal organization construction subcontract scope of work identification and subcontract preparation, and competitive selection of tribal or tribal organization construction contract subcontractors;

      (3) Review of work produced by tribal or tribal organization construction subcontractors to determine compliance with:

      (i) The POR and the design contract during the design stage; or

      (ii) The project construction documents during the construction stage.

      § 900.119   To what extent shall the Secretary consult with affected Indian tribes before spending funds for any construction project?

#### § § 900.119

      Before spending any funds for a planning, design, construction, or renovation project, whether subject to a competitive application and ranking process or not, the Secretary shall consult with any Indian tribe or tribal organization(s) that would be significantly affected by the expenditure to determine and to follow tribal preferences to the greatest extent feasible concerning: size, location, type, and other characteristics of the project.

      § 900.120   How does an Indian tribe or tribal organization find out about a construction project?

#### § § 900.120

      Within 30 days after the Secretary's allocation of funds for planning phase, design phase, or construction phase activities for a specific project, the Secretary shall notify, by registered mail with return receipt in order to document mailing, the Indian tribe or tribal organization(s) to be benefitted by the availability of the funds for each phase of a project. The Secretarial notice of fund allocation shall offer technical assistance in the preparation of a contract proposal.

      (a) The Secretary shall, within 30 days after receiving a request from an Indian tribe or tribal organization, furnish the Indian tribe or tribal organization with all information available to the Secretary about the project including, but not limited to: construction drawings, maps, engineering reports, design reports, plans of requirements, cost estimates, environmental assessments, or environmental impact reports and archeological reports.

      (b) An Indian tribe or tribal organization is not required to request this information prior to submitting a notification of intent to contract or a contract proposal.

      (c) The Secretary shall have a continuing responsibility to furnish information.

      § 900.121   What happens during the preplanning phase and can an Indian tribe or tribal organization perform any of the activities involved in this process?

#### § § 900.121

      (a) The application and ranking process for developing a priority listing of projects varies between agencies. There are, however, steps in the selection process that are common to most selection processes. An Indian tribe or tribal organization that wishes to secure a construction project should contact the appropriate agency to determine the specific steps involved in the application and selection process used to fund specific types of projects. When a priority process is used in the selection of construction projects, the steps involved in the application and ranking process are as follows:

      (1)  The agency solicits applications from Indian tribes or tribal organizations. In the request for applications, the Secretary provides specific information regarding the type of project to be funded, the objective criteria that will be used to evaluate applications, the points or weight that each criterion will be assigned, and the time when applications are due. An Indian tribe or tribal organization may prepare the application (technical assistance from the agency, within resources available, shall be provided upon request from an Indian tribe or tribal organization) or may rely upon the agency to prepare the application.

      (2)  The Secretary evaluates the applications based on the criteria provided as part of the application preparation process. The Secretary applies only criteria and weights assigned to each criteria that were disclosed to the Indian tribe or tribal organization during the application stage. The applications are then ranked in order from the application that best meets application criteria to the application that least meet the application criteria.

      (3)  Before final acceptance of a ranked application, the information, such as demographic information, deficiency levels reported in application, the condition of existing facilities, and program housing needs, is validated. During this process, additional information may be developed by the Indian tribe or tribal organization in support of the original information or the Secretary may designate a representative of the Department to conduct an on-site review of the information contained in the application.

      (b) [Reserved]

      § 900.122   What does an Indian tribe or tribal organization do if it wants to secure a construction contract?

#### § § 900.122

      (a) The Act establishes a special process for review and negotiation of proposals for construction contracts which is different than that for other self-determination contract proposals. The Indian tribe or tribal organization should notify the Secretary of its intent to contract. After notification, the Indian tribe or tribal organization should prepare its contract proposal in accordance with the sections of this subpart. While developing its construction contract proposal, the Indian tribe or tribal organization can request technical assistance from the Secretary. Not later than 30 days after receiving a request from an Indian tribe or tribal organization, the Secretary shall provide to the Indian tribe or tribal organization all information available about the construction project, including construction drawings, maps, engineering reports, design reports, plans of requirements, cost estimates, environmental assessments, or environmental impact reports, and archaeological reports. The responsibility of the Secretary to furnish this information shall be a continuing one.

      (b) At the request of the Indian tribe or tribal organization and before finalizing its construction contract proposal, the Secretary shall provide for a precontract negotiation phase during the development of a contract proposal. Within 30 days the Secretary shall acknowledge receipt of the proposal and, if requested by the Indian tribe or tribal organization, shall confer with the Indian tribe or tribal organization to develop a negotiation schedule. The negotiation phase shall include, at a minimum:

      (1) The provision of technical assistance under section 103 of the Act and paragraph (a) of this section;

      (2) A joint scoping session between the Secretary and the Indian tribe or tribal organization to review all plans, specifications, engineering reports, cost estimates, and other information available to the parties, for the purpose of identifying all areas of agreement and disagreement;

      (3) An opportunity for the Secretary to revise plans, designs, or cost estimates of the Secretary in response to concerns raised, or information provided by, the Indian tribe or tribal organization;

      (4) A negotiation session during which the Secretary and the Indian tribe or tribal organization shall seek to develop a mutually agreeable contract proposal; and

      (5) Upon the request of the Indian tribe or tribal organization, the use of alternative dispute resolution to resolve remaining areas of disagreement under the dispute resolution provisions under subchapter IV of chapter 5 of the United States Code.

      § 900.123   What happens if the Indian tribe or tribal organization and the Secretary cannot develop a mutually agreeable contract proposal?

#### § § 900.123

      (a) If the Secretary and the Indian tribe or tribal organization are unable to develop a mutually agreeable construction contract proposal under the procedures in § 900.122, the Indian tribe or tribal organization may submit a final contract proposal to the Secretary. Not later than 30 days after receiving the final contract proposal, the Secretary shall approve the contract proposal and award the contract, unless, during the period the Secretary declines the proposal under sections 102(a)(2) and 102(b) of the Act (including providing opportunity for an appeal under section 102(b)).

      (b) Whenever the Secretary declines to enter into a self-determination contract or contracts under section 102(a)(2) of the Act, the Secretary shall:

      (1) State any objections to the contract proposal (as submitted by the Indian tribe or tribal organization) in writing and provide all documents relied on in making the declination decision within 20 days of such decision to the Indian tribe or tribal organization;

      (2) Provide assistance to the Indian tribe or tribal organization to overcome the stated objections;

      (3) Provide the Indian tribe or tribal organization with a hearing on the record with the right to engage in full discovery relevant to any issue raised in the matter and the opportunity for appeal on the objections raised, under the regulations set forth in subpart L, except that the Indian tribe or tribal organization may, in lieu of filing the appeal, initiate an action in a Federal district court and proceed directly under section 110(a) of the Act.

      § 900.124   May the Indian tribe or tribal organization elect to use a grant in lieu of a contract?

#### § § 900.124

      Yes. A grant agreement or a cooperative agreement may be used in lieu of a contract under sections 102 and 103 of the Act when agreed to by the Secretary and the Indian tribe or tribal organization. Under the grant concept, the grantee will assume full responsibility and accountability for design and construction performance within the funding limitations. The grantee will manage and administer the work with minimal involvement by the government. The grantee will be expected to have acceptable management systems for finance, procurement, and property. The Secretary may issue Federal construction guidelines and manuals applicable to its construction programs, and the government shall accept tribal proposals for alternatives which are consistent with or exceed Federal guidelines or manuals applicable to construction programs.

      § 900.127   What can be included in the Indian tribe or tribal organization's contract budget?

#### § § 900.127

      (a) The costs incurred will vary depending on which phase (see § 900.112) of the construction process the Indian tribe or tribal organization is conducting and the type of contract that will be used. The total amount awarded under a construction contract shall reflect an overall fair and reasonable price to the parties (see § 900.129).

      (b) Costs for activities under this subpart that have not been billed, allocated, or recovered under a contract issued under section 108 of the Act should be included.

      § 900.129   How do the Secretary and Indian tribe or tribal organization arrive at an overall fair and reasonable price for the performance of a construction contract?

#### § § 900.129

      (a) Throughout the contract award process, the Secretary and Indian tribe or tribal organization shall share all construction project cost information available to them in order to facilitate reaching agreement on an overall fair and reasonable price for the project or part thereof. In order to enhance this communication, the government's estimate of an overall fair and reasonable price shall:

      (1) Contain a level of detail appropriate to the nature and phase of the work and sufficient to allow comparisons to the Indian tribe or tribal organization's estimate;

      (2) Be prepared in a format coordinated with the Indian tribe or tribal organization; and

      (3) Include the cost elements contained in section 105(m)(4) of the Act.

      (b) The government's cost estimate shall be an independent cost estimate based on such information as the following:

      (1) Prior costs to the government for similar projects adjusted for comparison to the target location, typically in unit costs, such as dollars per pound, square meter cost of building, or other unit cost that can be used to make a comparison;

      (2) Actual costs previously incurred by the Indian tribe or tribal organization for similar projects;

      (3) Published price lists, to include regional adjustment factors, for materials, equipment, and labor; and

      (4) Projections of inflation and cost trends, including projected changes such as labor, material, and transportation costs.

      (5) Agreed-upon changes in project plans and specifications.

      (d) Considering all of the information available, the Secretary and the Indian tribe or tribal organization shall negotiate the amount of the construction contract. The objective of the negotiations is to arrive at an amount that is fair under current market conditions and reasonable to both the government and the Indian tribe or tribal organization. As a result, the agreement does not necessarily have to be in strict conformance with either party's cost estimate nor does agreement have to be reached on every element of cost, but only on the overall fair and reasonable price of each phase of the work included in the contract.

      (e) If the fair and reasonable price arrived at under paragraph (d) of this section would exceed the amount available to the Secretary, then:

      (1) If the Indian tribe or tribal organization elects to submit a final proposal, the Secretary may decline the proposal under section 105(m)(4)(C)(v) of the Act or if the contract has been awarded, dispute the matter under the Contract Disputes Act; or

      (a) If the Indian tribe or tribal organization is contracting solely to perform construction management services either under this subpart or section 108 of the Act, the Secretary has the following responsibilities:

      (1) The Secretary is responsible for the successful completion of the project in accordance with the approved contract documents. In fulfilling those responsibilities, the Secretary shall consult with the Indian tribe or tribal organization on a regular basis as agreed to by the parties to facilitate the exchange of information between the Indian tribe or tribal organization and Secretary;

      (2) The Secretary shall provide the Indian tribe or tribal organization with regular opportunities to review work produced to determine compliance with the following documents:

      (i) The POR, during the conduct of design phase activities. The Secretary shall provide the Indian tribe or tribal organization with an opportunity to review the project construction documents at the concept phase, the schematic phase, the design development phase, and the final construction documents phase, or as otherwise negotiated. Upon receipt of project construction documents for review, the Indian tribe or tribal organization shall not take more than 21 days to make available to the Secretary any comments or objections to the construction documents as submitted by the Secretary. Resolution of any comments or objections shall be in accordance with dispute resolution procedures as agreed to by the parties and contained in the contract; or

      (b) If the Indian tribe or tribal organization is contracting to perform design and/or construction phase activities, the Secretary shall have the following responsibilities:

      (1) In carrying out the responsibilities of this section, and specifically in carrying out review, comment, and approval functions under this section, the Secretary shall provide for full tribal participation in the decision making process and shall honor tribal preferences and recommendations to the greatest extent feasible. This includes promptly notifying the Indian tribe or tribal organization of any concerns or issues in writing that may lead to disapproval, meeting with the Indian tribe or tribal organization to discuss these concerns and issues and to share relevant information and documents, and making a good faith effort to resolve all issues and concerns of the Indian tribe or tribal organization. The time allowed for Secretarial review, comment, and approval shall be no more than 21 days per review unless a different time period is negotiated and specified in individual contracts. The 21-day time period may be extended if the Indian tribe or tribal organization agrees to the extension in writing. Disagreements over the Secretary's decisions in carrying out these responsibilities shall be handled under subpart N governing contract disputes under the Contract Disputes Act.

      (2) To the extent the construction project is subject to NEPA or other environmental laws, the appropriate Secretary shall make the final determination under such laws. All other environmentally related functions are contractible.

      (3) If the Indian tribe or tribal organization conducts planning activities under this subpart, the Secretary shall review and approve final planning documents for the project to ensure compliance with applicable planning standards.

      (4) When a contract or portion of a contract is for project construction activities, the Secretary may rely on the Indian tribe or tribal organization's cost estimate or the Secretary may obtain an independent government cost estimate that is derived from the final project plans and specifications. The Secretary shall obtain the cost estimate, if any, within 90 days or less of receiving the final plans and specifications from the Indian tribe or tribal organization and shall provide all supporting documentation of the independent cost estimate to the Indian tribe or tribal organization within the 90 day time limit.

      (5) If the contracted project involves design activities, the Secretary shall have the authority to review for general compliance with the contract requirements and provide written comments on the project plans and specifications only at the concept phase, the schematic phase, the design development phase and the final construction documents phase, and approve for general compliance with contract requirements the project plans and specifications only at the schematic phase and the final construction documents phase or as otherwise negotiated.

      (6) If the contracted project involves design activities, the Secretary reserves a royalty-free, nonexclusive, and irrevocable license to reproduce, publish or otherwise use, for Federal government purposes:

      (i) The copyright in any work developed under a contract or subcontract of this subpart; and

      (ii) Any rights of copyright to which an Indian tribe or tribal organization or a tribal subcontractor purchases ownership through this contract.

      (7) Changes that require an increase to the negotiated contract budget or an increase in the negotiated performance period or are a significant departure from the scope or objective of the project shall require approval of the Secretary.

      (8) Review and comment on specific shop drawings as negotiated and specified in individual contracts.

      (9) The Secretary may conduct monthly on-site monitoring visits, or alternatively if negotiated with the Indian tribe or tribal organization, critical milestone on-site monitoring visits.

      (10) The Secretary retains the right to conduct final project inspections jointly with the Indian tribe or tribal organization and to accept the building or facility. If the Secretary identifies problems during final project inspections the information shall be provide to the Indian tribe or tribal organization and shall be limited to items that are materially noncompliant.

      (11) The Secretary can require an Indian tribe or tribal organization to suspend work under a contract in accordance with this paragraph. The Secretary may suspend a contract for no more than 30 days unless the Indian tribe or tribal organization has failed to correct the reason(s) for the suspension or unless the cause of the suspension cannot be resolved through either the efforts of the Secretary or the Indian tribe or tribal organization.

      (i) The following are reasons the Secretary may suspend work under a self-determination contract for construction:

      (A) Differing site conditions encountered upon commencement of construction activities that impact health or safety concerns or shall require an increase in the negotiated project budget;

      (B) The Secretary discovers materially non-compliant work;

      (C) Funds allocated for the project that is the subject of this contract are rescinded by Congressional action; or

      (D) Other Congressional actions occur that materially affect the subject matter of the contract.

      (ii) If the Secretary wishes to suspend the work, the Secretary shall first provide written notice and an opportunity for the Indian tribe or tribal organization to correct the problem. The Secretary may direct the Indian tribe or tribal organization to suspend temporarily work under a contract only after providing a minimum of 5 working days' advance written notice to the Indian tribe or tribal organization describing the nature of the performance deficiencies or imminent safety, health or environmental issues which are the cause for suspending the work.

      (iii) The Indian tribe or tribal organization shall be compensated for reasonable costs, including but not limited to overhead costs, incurred due to any suspension of work that occurred through no fault of the Indian tribe or tribal organization.

      (iv) Disputes arising as a result of a suspension of the work by the Secretary shall be subject to the Contract Disputes Act or any other alternative dispute resolution mechanism as negotiated between and agreed to by the parties and contained in the contract.

      (12) The Secretary can terminate the project for cause in the event non-compliant work is not corrected through the suspension process specified in paragraph (11) of this section.

      (13) The Secretary retains authority to terminate the project for convenience for the following reasons:

      (i) Termination for convenience is requested by the Indian tribe or tribal organization;

      (ii) Termination for convenience is requested by the Secretary and agreed to by the Indian tribe or tribal organization;

      (iii) Funds allocated for the project that is the subject of the contract are rescinded by Congressional action;

      (iv) Other Congressional actions take place that affect the subject matter of the contract;

      (v) If the Secretary terminates a self-determination construction contract for convenience, the Secretary shall provide the Indian tribe or tribal organization 21 days advance written notice of intent to terminate a contract for convenience; or

      (vi) The Indian tribe or tribal organization shall be compensated for reasonable costs incurred due to termination of the contract.

      § 900.132   Once a contract and/or grant is awarded, how will the Indian tribe or tribal organization receive payments?

#### § § 900.132

      (a) A schedule for advance payments shall be developed based on progress, need, and other considerations in accordance with applicable law. The payment schedule shall be negotiated by the parties and included in the contract. The payment schedule may be adjusted as negotiated by the parties during the course of the project based on progress and need.

      (b) Payments shall be made to the Indian tribe or tribal organization according to the payment schedule contained in the contract. If the contract does not provide for the length of each allocation period, the Secretary shall make payments to the Indian tribe or tribal organization at least quarterly. Each allocation shall be adequate to provide funds for the contract activities anticipated to be conducted during the allocation period, except that:

      (1) The first allocation may be greater than subsequent allocations and include mobilization costs, and contingency funds described in § 900.128(e)(8); and

      (2) Any allocation may include funds for payment for materials that will be used during subsequent allocation periods.

      (c) The Indian tribe or tribal organization may propose a schedule of payment amounts measured by time or measured by phase of the project (e.g., planning, design, construction).

      (d) The amount of each payment allocation shall be stated in the Indian tribe or tribal organization's contract proposal. Upon award of the contract, the Secretary shall transfer the amount of the first allocation to the Indian tribe or tribal organization within 21 days after the date of contract award. The second allocation shall be made not later than 7 days before the end of the first allocation period.

      (e) Not later than 7 days before the end of each subsequent allocation period after the second allocation, the Secretary shall transfer to the Indian tribe or tribal organization the amount for the next allocation period, unless the Indian tribe or tribal organization is delinquent in submission of allocation period progress reports and financial reports or the Secretary takes action to suspend or terminate the contract in accordance with § 900.131(b)(11), § 900.131(b)(12), or § 900.131(b)(13).

      § 900.133   Does the declination process or the Contract Dispute Act apply to construction contract amendments proposed either by an Indian tribe or tribal organization or the Secretary?

#### § § 900.133

      The Contract Disputes Act generally applies to such amendments. However, the declination process and the procedures in §§ 900.122 and 900.123 apply to the proposal by an Indian tribe or tribal organization when the proposal is for a new project, a new phase or discreet stage of a phase of a project, or an expansion of a project resulting from an additional allocation of funds by the Secretary under § 900.120.

      § 900.134   At the end of a self-determination construction contract, what happens to savings on a cost-reimbursement contract?

#### § § 900.134

      The savings shall be used by the Indian tribe or tribal organization to provide additional services or benefits under the contract. Unexpended contingency funds obligated to the contract, and remaining at the end of the contract, are savings. No further approval or justifying documentation by the Indian tribe or tribal organization shall be required before expenditure of funds.

      § 900.135   May the time frames for action set out in this subpart be reduced?

#### § § 900.135

      Yes. The time frames in this subpart are intended to be maximum times and may be reduced based on urgency and need, by agreement of the parties. If the Indian tribe or tribal organization requests reduced time frames for action due to unusual or special conditions (such as limited construction periods), the Secretary shall make a good faith effort to accommodate the requested time frames.

      § 900.136   Do tribal employment rights ordinances apply to construction contracts and subcontracts?

#### § § 900.136

      Yes. Tribal employment rights ordinances do apply to construction contracts and subcontracts pursuant to section 7(b) and section 7(c) of the Act.

      § 900.137   Do all provisions of the other subparts apply to contracts awarded under this subpart?

#### § § 900.137

      Yes, except as otherwise provided in this subpart and unless excluded as follows: programmatic reports and data requirements, reassumption, contract review and approval process, contract proposal contents, and § 900.150 (d) and (e) of these regulations.

    Subpart K—Waiver Procedures

      § 900.140   Can any provision of the regulations under this part be waived?

#### § § 900.140

      Yes. Upon the request of an Indian tribe or tribal organization, the Secretary shall waive any provision of these regulations, including any cost principles adopted by the regulations under this part, if the Secretary finds that granting the waiver is either in the best interest of the Indians served by the contract, or is consistent with the policies of the Act and is not contrary to statutory law.

      § 900.141   How does an Indian tribe or tribal organization get a waiver?

#### § § 900.141

      To obtain a waiver, an Indian tribe or tribal organization shall submit a written request to the Secretary identifying the regulation to be waived and the basis for the request. The Indian tribe or tribal organization shall explain the intended effect of the waiver, the impact upon the Indian tribe or tribal organization if the waiver is not granted, and the specific contract(s) to which the waiver will apply.

      § 900.142   Does an Indian tribe or tribal organization's waiver request have to be included in an initial contract proposal?

#### § § 900.142

      No. Although a waiver request may be included in a contract proposal, it can also be submitted separately.

      § 900.143   How is a waiver request processed?

#### § § 900.143

      The Secretary shall approve or deny a waiver within 90 days after the Secretary receives a written waiver request. The Secretary's decision shall be in writing. If the requested waiver is denied, the Secretary shall include in the decision a full explanation of the basis for the decision.

      § 900.144   What happens if the Secretary makes no decision within the 90-day period?

#### § § 900.144

      The waiver request is deemed approved.

      § 900.145   On what basis may the Secretary deny a waiver request?

#### § § 900.145

      Consistent with section 107(e) of the Act, the Secretary may only deny a waiver request based on a specific written finding. The finding must clearly demonstrate (or be supported by controlling legal authority) that if the waiver is granted:

      (a) The service to be rendered to the Indian beneficiaries of the particular program or function to be contracted will not be satisfactory;

      (b) Adequate protection of trust resources is not assured;

      (c) The proposed project or function to be contracted for cannot be properly completed or maintained by the proposed contract;

      (d) The amount of funds proposed under the contract is in excess of the applicable funding level for the contract, as determined under section 106(a) of the Act; or

      (e) The program, function, service, or activity (or portion of it) that is the subject of the proposal is beyond the scope of programs, functions, services, or activities that are contractible under the Act because the proposal includes activities that cannot lawfully be carried out by the contractor.

      § 900.146   Is technical assistance available for waiver requests?

#### § § 900.146

      Yes. Technical assistance is available as provided in § 900.7 to prepare a waiver request or to overcome any stated objection which the Secretary might have to the request.

      § 900.147   What appeal rights are available?

#### § § 900.147

      If the Secretary denies a waiver request, the Indian tribe or tribal organization has the right to appeal the decision and request a hearing on the record under the procedures for hearings and appeals contained in subpart L of these regulations. Alternatively, the Indian tribe or tribal organization may sue in Federal district court to challenge the Secretary's action.

      § 900.148   How can an Indian tribe or tribal organization secure a determination that a law or regulation has been superseded by the Indian Self-Determination Act, as specified in section 107(b) of the Act?

#### § § 900.148

      Any Indian tribe or tribal organization may at any time submit a request to the Secretary for a determination that any law or regulation has been superseded by the Act and that the law has no applicability to any contract or proposed contract under the Act. The Secretary is required to provide an initial decision on such a request within 90 days after receipt. If such a request is denied, the Indian tribe or tribal organization may appeal under subpart L of these regulations. The Secretary shall provide notice of each determination made under this subpart to all Indian tribes and tribal organizations.

    Subpart L—Appeals

      Appeals Other Than Emergency Reassumption and Suspension, Withholding or Delay in Payment

#### § § 900.151

        This subpart does not cover:

        (a) Disputes which arise after a self-determination contract has been awarded, or emergency reassumption of self-determination contracts or suspension of payments under self-determination contracts, which are covered under § 900.170 through § 900.176 of these regulations.

        § 900.152   How does an Indian tribe or tribal organization know where and when to file its appeal from decisions made by agencies of DOI or DHHS?

#### § § 900.152

        Every decision in any of the ten areas listed above shall contain information which shall tell the Indian tribe or tribal organization where and when to file the Indian tribe or tribal organization's appeal. Each decision shall include the following statement:

        § 900.153   Does an Indian tribe or tribal organization have any options besides an appeal?

#### § § 900.153

        Yes. The Indian tribe or tribal organization may request an informal conference. An informal conference is a way to resolve issues as quickly as possible, without the need for a formal hearing. The Indian tribe or tribal organization may also choose to sue in U.S. District Court under section 102(b)(3) and section 110(a) of the Act.

        § 900.154   How does an Indian tribe or tribal organization request an informal conference?

#### § § 900.154

        The Indian tribe or tribal organization shall file its request for an informal conference with the office of the person whose decision it is appealing, within 30 days of the day it receives the decision. The Indian tribe or tribal organization may either hand-deliver the request for an informal conference to that person's office, or mail it by certified mail, return receipt requested. If the Indian tribe or tribal organization mails the request, it will be considered filed on the date the Indian tribe or tribal organization mailed it by certified mail.

        § 900.155   How is an informal conference held?

#### § § 900.155

        (a) The informal conference shall be held within 30 days of the date the request was received, unless the Indian tribe or tribal organization and the authorized representative of the Secretary agree on another date.

        (b) If possible, the informal conference will be held at the Indian tribe or tribal organization's office. If the meeting cannot be held at the Indian tribe or tribal organization's office and is held more than fifty miles from its office, the Secretary shall arrange to pay transportation costs and per diem for incidental expenses to allow for adequate representation of the Indian tribe or tribal organization.

        (c) The informal conference shall be conducted by a designated representative of the Secretary.

        (d) Only people who are the designated representatives of the Indian tribe or tribal organization, or authorized by the Secretary of Health and Human Services or by the appropriate agency of the Department of the Interior, are allowed to make presentations at the informal conference.

        § 900.156   What happens after the informal conference?

#### § § 900.156

#### § § 900.157

        No. If the Indian tribe or tribal organization is dissatisfied with the recommended decision, it may still appeal the initial decision within 30 days of receiving the recommended decision and the report of the informal conference. If the Indian tribe or tribal organization does not file a notice of appeal within 30 days, or before the expiration of the extension it has received under § 900.159, the recommended decision becomes final.

        § 900.158   How does an Indian tribe or tribal organization appeal the initial decision, if it does not request an informal conference or if it does not agree with the recommended decision resulting from the informal conference?

#### § § 900.158

        (a) If the Indian tribe or tribal organization decides to appeal, it shall file a notice of appeal with the IBIA within 30 days of receiving either the initial decision or the recommended decision.

        (b) The Indian tribe or tribal organization may either hand-deliver the notice of appeal to the IBIA, or mail it by certified mail, return receipt requested.

        Yes. If the Indian tribe or tribal organization needs more time, it can request an extension of time to file its Notice of Appeal within 60 days of receiving either the initial decision or the recommended decision resulting from the informal conference. The request of the Indian tribe or tribal organization shall be in writing, and shall give a reason for not filing its notice of appeal within the 30-day time period. If the Indian tribe or tribal organization has a valid reason for not filing its notice of appeal on time, it may receive an extension from the IBIA.

        § 900.160   What happens after an Indian tribe or tribal organization files an appeal?

#### § § 900.160

        (a) Within 5 days of receiving the Indian tribe or tribal organization's notice of appeal, the IBIA will decide whether the appeal falls under § 900.150(a) through § 900.150(g). If so, the Indian tribe or tribal organization is entitled to a hearing.

        (1) If the IBIA determines that the appeal of the Indian tribe or tribal organization falls under § 900.150(h), § 900.150(i), or § 900.150(j), and the Indian tribe or tribal organization has requested a hearing, the IBIA will grant the request for a hearing unless the IBIA determines that there are no genuine issues of material fact to be resolved.

        (2) If the IBIA cannot make that decision based on the information included in the notice of appeal, the IBIA may ask for additional statements from the Indian tribe or tribal organization, or from the appropriate Federal agency. If the IBIA asks for more statements, it will make its decision within 5 days of receiving those statements.

        (b) If the IBIA decides that the Indian tribe or tribal organization is not entitled to a hearing or if the Indian tribe or tribal organization has waived its right to a hearing on the record, the IBIA will ask for the administrative record under 43 CFR 4.335. The IBIA shall tell the parties that the appeal will be considered under the regulations at 43 CFR 4, subpart D, except the case shall be docketed immediately, without waiting for the 20-day period described in 43 CFR 4.336.

        § 900.161   How is a hearing arranged?

#### § § 900.161

        (a) If a hearing is to be held, the IBIA will refer the Indian tribe or tribal organization's case to the Hearings Division of the Office of Hearings and Appeals of the U.S. Department of the Interior. The case will then be assigned to an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ), appointed under 5 U.S.C. 3105.

        (b) Within 15 days of the date of the referral, the ALJ will hold a pre-hearing conference, by telephone or in person, to decide whether an evidentiary hearing is necessary, or whether it is possible to decide the appeal based on the written record. At the pre-hearing conference the ALJ will provide for:

        (2) A schedule for the exchange of information, including, but not limited to witness and exhibit lists, if an evidentiary hearing is to be held;

        (3) The simplification or clarification of issues;

        (4) The limitation of the number of expert witnesses, or avoidance of similar cumulative evidence, if an evidentiary hearing is to be held;

        (5) The possibility of agreement disposing of all or any of the issues in dispute; and

        (6) Such other matters as may aid in the disposition of the appeal.

        (c) The ALJ shall order a written record to be made of any conference results that are not reflected in a transcript.

    Subpart M—Federal Tort Claims Act Coverage General Provisions

      Medical-Related Claims

        § 900.190   Is FTCA the exclusive remedy for a tort claim for personal injury or death resulting from the performance of a self-determination contract?

#### § § 900.190

        Yes, except as explained in § 900.183(b). No claim may be filed against a self-determination contractor or employee for personal injury or death arising from the performance of medical, surgical, dental, or related functions by the contractor in carrying out self-determination contracts under the Act. Related functions include services such as those provided by nurses, laboratory and x-ray technicians, emergency medical technicians and other health care providers including psychologists and social workers. All such claims shall be filed against the United States and are subject to the limitations and restrictions of the FTCA.

        § 900.191   Are employees of self-determination contractors providing health services under the self-determination contract protected by FTCA?

#### § § 900.191

        Yes. For the purpose of Federal Tort Claims Act coverage, an Indian tribe or tribal organization and its employees performing medical-related functions under a self-determination contract are deemed a part of the Public Health Service if the employees are acting within the scope of their employment in carrying out the contract.

        § 900.192   What employees are covered by FTCA for medical-related claims?

        § 900.194   Does FTCA coverage extend to services provided under a staff privileges agreement with a non-IHS facility where the agreement requires a health care practitioner to provide reciprocal services to the general population?

#### § § 900.194

        Yes. Those services are covered, as long as the contractor's health care practitioners do not receive additional compensation from a third party for the performance of these services and they are acting within the scope of their employment under a self-determination contract. Reciprocal services include:

        (a) Cross-covering other medical personnel who temporarily cannot attend their patients;

        (b) Assisting other personnel with surgeries or other medical procedures;

        (c) Assisting with unstable patients or at deliveries; or

        No.

        § 900.196   Do covered services include the conduct of clinical studies and investigations and the provision of emergency services, including the operation of emergency motor vehicles?

#### § § 900.196

        Yes, if the services are provided in carrying out a self-determination contract. (An emergency motor vehicle is a vehicle, whether government, contractor, or employee-owned, used to transport passengers for medical services.)

        § 900.197   Does FTCA cover employees of the contractor who are paid by the contractor from funds other than those provided through the self-determination contract?

#### § § 900.197

        Yes, as long as the services out of which the claim arose were performed in carrying out the self-determination contract.

        § 900.198   Are Federal employees assigned to a self-determination contractor under the Intergovernmental Personnel Act or detailed under section 214 of the Public Health Service Act covered to the same extent that they would be if working directly for a Federal agency?

#### § § 900.198

        Yes.

        § 900.199   Does FTCA coverage extend to health care practitioners to whom staff privileges have been extended in contractor health care facilities operated under a self-determination contract on the condition that such practitioner provide health services to IHS beneficiaries covered by FTCA?

#### § § 900.199

        Yes, health care practitioners with staff privileges in a facility operated by a contractor are covered when they perform services to IHS beneficiaries. Such personnel are not covered when providing services to non-IHS beneficiaries.

        § 900.200   May persons who are not Indians or Alaska Natives assert claims under FTCA?

#### § § 900.200

        Yes. Non-Indian individuals served under the contract whether or not on a fee-for-service basis, may assert claims under this subpart.

#### § § 900.216

      (a) The Contract Disputes Act of 1978 (CDA), Public Law 95-563 (41 U.S.C. 601 as amended);

      (b) If the matter is submitted to the CBCA, 48 CFR part 6101; and

      (c) The Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA), 5 U.S.C. 504 and 28 U.S.C. 2412, and regulations at 48 CFR 6101.30, 6101.31 (CBCA), 43 CFR 4.602, 4.604 through 4.628 (DOI), and 45 CFR 13.4 through 13.7 (HHS).

> [61 FR 32501, June 24, 1996, as amended at 75 FR 31701, June 4, 2010]

      § 900.217   Is filing a claim under the CDA our only option for resolving post-award contract disputes?

#### § § 900.217

      No. The Federal government attempts to resolve all contract disputes by agreement at the awarding official's level. These are alternatives to filing a claim under the CDA:

      (a) Before issuing a decision on a claim, the awarding official should consider using informal discussions between the parties, assisted by individuals who have not substantially participated in the matter, to aid in resolving differences.

      (b) In addition to filing a CDA claim, or instead of filing a CDA claim, the parties may choose to use an alternative dispute resolution mechanism, pursuant to the provisions of the Administrative Dispute Resolution Act, Public Law 101-552, as amended, 5 U.S.C. 581  or the options listed in section 108(1)(b)(12) of the Indian Self-Determination Act, as applicable.

      § 900.218   What is a claim under the CDA?

#### § § 900.218

      (a) A claim is a written demand by one of the contracting parties, asking for one or more of the following:

      (1) Payment of a specific sum of money under the contract;

      (2) Adjustment or interpretation of contract terms; or

      (3) Any other claim relating to the contract.

      (b) However, an undisputed voucher, invoice, or other routing request for payment is not a claim under the CDA. A voucher, invoice, or routing request for payment may be converted into a CDA claim if:

      (1) It is disputed as to liability or amount; or

      (2) It is not acted upon in a reasonable time and written notice of the claim is given to the awarding official by the senior official designated in the contract.

      § 900.219   How does an Indian tribe, tribal organization, or Federal agency submit a claim?

#### § § 900.219

      (a) An Indian tribe or tribal organization shall submit its claim in writing to the awarding official. The awarding official shall document the contract file with evidence of the date the claim was received.

      (b) A Federal agency shall submit its claim in writing to the contractor's senior official, as designated in the contract.

      § 900.220   Does it make a difference whether the claim is large or small?

#### § § 900.220

      Yes. The Contract Disputes Act requires that an Indian tribe or tribal organization making a claim for more than $100,000 shall certify that:

      (a) The claim is made in good faith,

      (b) Supporting documents or data are accurate and complete to the best of the Indian tribe or tribal organization's knowledge and belief;

      (c) The amount claimed accurately reflects the amount believed to be owed by the Federal government; and

      (d) The person making the certification is authorized to do so on behalf of the Indian tribe or tribal organization.

      § 900.221   What happens next?

#### § § 900.221

      (a) If the parties do not agree on a settlement, the awarding official will issue a written decision on the claim.

      (b) The awarding official shall always give a copy of the decision to the Indian tribe or tribal organization by certified mail, return receipt requested, or by any other method which provides a receipt.

      § 900.222   What goes into a decision?

#### § § 900.222

      A decision shall:

      (a) Describe the claim or dispute;

      (b) Refer to the relevant terms of the contract;

      (c) Set out the factual areas of agreement and disagreement;

      (d) Set out the actual decision, based on the facts, and outline the reasoning which supports the decision; and

      (e) Contain the following language:

> [61 FR 32501, June 24, 1996, as amended at 71 FR 76601, Dec. 21, 2006; 75 FR 31701, June 4, 2010]

      § 900.223   When does an Indian tribe or tribal organization get the decision?

#### § § 900.223

      (a) If the claim is for more than $100,000, the awarding official shall issue the decision within 60 days of the day he or she receives the claim. If the awarding official cannot issue a decision that quickly, he or she shall tell you when the decision will be issued.

      (b) If the claim is for $100,000 or less, and you want a decision within 60 days, you shall advise the awarding official in writing that you want a decision within that period. If you advise the awarding official in writing that you do want a decision within 60 days, the awarding official shall issue the decision within 60 days of the day he or she receives your written notice.

      (c) If your claim is for $100,000 or less and you do not advise the awarding official that you want a decision within 60 days, or if your claim exceeds $100,000 and the awarding official has notified you of the time within which a decision will be issued, the awarding official shall issue a decision within a reasonable time. What is “reasonable” depends upon the size and complexity of your claim, and upon the adequacy of the information you have given to the awarding official in support of your claim.

      § 900.224   What happens if the decision does not come within that time?

#### § § 900.224

      If the awarding official does not issue a decision within the time required under § 900.223, the Indian tribe or tribal organization may treat the delay as though the awarding official has denied the claim, and proceed according to § 900.222(e),

      § 900.225   Does an Indian tribe or tribal organization get paid immediately if the awarding official decides in its favor?

#### § § 900.225

      Yes. Once the awarding official decides that money should be paid under the contract, the amount due, minus any portion already paid, should be paid as promptly as possible, without waiting for either party to file an appeal. Any payment which is made under this subsection will not affect any other rights either party might have. In addition, it will not create a binding legal precedent as to any future payments.

      § 900.226   What rules govern appeals of cost disallowances?

#### § § 900.226

      In any appeal involving a disallowance of costs, the Board of Contract Appeals will give due consideration to the factual circumstances giving rise to the disallowed costs, and shall seek to determine a fair result without rigid adherence to strict accounting principles. The determination of allowability shall assure fair compensation for the work or service performed, using cost and accounting data as guides, but not rigid measures, for ascertaining fair compensation.

      § 900.227   Can the awarding official change the decision after it has been made?

#### § § 900.227

      (a) The decision of the awarding official is final and conclusive, and not subject to review by any forum, tribunal or government agency, unless an appeal or suit is timely commenced as authorized by the Contract Disputes Act. Once the decision has been made, the awarding official may not change it, except by agreement of the parties, or under the following limited circumstances:

      (1) If evidence is discovered which could not have been discovered through due diligence before the awarding official issued the decision;

      (2) If the awarding official learns that there has been fraud, misrepresentation, or other misconduct by a party;

      (3) If the decision is beyond the scope of the awarding official's authority;

      (4) If the claim has been satisfied, released or discharged; or

      (5) For any other reason justifying relief from the decision.

      (b) Nothing in this subpart shall be interpreted to discourage settlement discussions or prevent settlement of the dispute at any time.

      (c) If a decision is withdrawn and a new decision is issued that is not acceptable to the contractor, the contractor may proceed with the appeal based on the new decision. If no new decision is issued, the contractor may proceed under § 900.224.

      (d) If an appeal or suit is filed, the awarding official may modify or withdraw his or her final decision.

      § 900.228   Is an Indian tribe or tribal organization entitled to interest if it wins its claim?

#### § § 900.228

      Yes. If an Indian tribe or tribal organization wins the claim, it will be entitled to interest on the amount of the award. The interest will be calculated from the date the awarding official receives the claim until the day it is paid. The interest rate will be the rate which the Secretary of the Treasury sets for the Renegotiation Board under the Renegotiation Act of 1951, Public Law 92-41, 26 U.S.C. 1212 and 26 U.S.C. 7447.

      § 900.229   What role will the awarding official play during an appeal?

#### § § 900.229

      (a) The awarding official shall provide any data, documentation, information or support required by the CBCA for use in deciding a pending appeal.

      (b) Within 30 days of receiving an appeal or learning that an appeal has been filed, the awarding official shall assemble a file which contains all the documents which are pertinent to the appeal, including:

      (1) The decision and findings of fact from which the appeal is taken;

      (2) The contract, including specifications and pertinent modifications, plans and drawings;

      (3) All correspondence between the parties which relates to the appeal, including the letter or letters of claims in response to which the decision was issued;

      (4) Transcripts of any testimony taken during the course of the proceedings, and affidavits or statements of any witnesses on the matter in dispute, which were made before the filing of the notice of appeal with the CBCA; and

      (5) Any additional information which may be relevant.

> [61 FR 32501, June 24, 1996, as amended at 71 FR 76601, Dec. 21, 2006]

      § 900.230   What is the effect of a pending appeal?

#### § § 900.230

      (a) Indian tribes and tribal organizations shall continue performance of a contract during the appeal of any claims to the same extent they would had there been no dispute.

      (b) A pending dispute will not affect or bar the negotiation or award of any subsequent contract or negotiation between the parties.

    Subpart O—Conflicts of Interest

      § 900.231   What is an organizational conflict of interest?

#### § § 900.231

      An organizational conflict of interest arises when there is a direct conflict between the financial interests of the contracting Indian tribe or tribal organization and:

      (a) The financial interests of beneficial owners of Indian trust resources;

      (b) The financial interests of the United States relating to trust resources, trust acquisitions, or lands conveyed or to be conveyed pursuant to the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act 43 U.S.C. 1601  or

      (c) An express statutory obligation of the United States to third parties. This section only applies if the conflict was not addressed when the contract was first negotiated. This section only applies where the financial interests of the Indian tribe or tribal organization are significant enough to impair the Indian tribe or tribal organization's objectivity in carrying out the contract, or a portion of the contract.

      § 900.232   What must an Indian tribe or tribal organization do if an organizational conflict of interest arises under a contract?

#### § § 900.232

      This section only applies if the conflict was not addressed when the contract was first negotiated. When an Indian tribe or tribal organization becomes aware of an organizational conflict of interest, the Indian tribe or tribal organization must immediately disclose the conflict to the Secretary.

      § 900.233   When must an Indian tribe or tribal organization regulate its employees or subcontractors to avoid a personal conflict of interest?

#### § § 900.233

      An Indian tribe or tribal organization must maintain written standards of conduct to govern officers, employees, and agents (including subcontractors) engaged in functions related to the management of trust assets.

      § 900.234   What types of personal conflicts of interest involving tribal officers, employees or subcontractors would have to be regulated by an Indian tribe?

#### § § 900.234

      The Indian tribe or tribal organization would need a tribally-approved mechanism to ensure that no officer, employee, or agent (including a subcontractor) of the Indian tribe or tribal organization reviews a trust transaction in which that person has a financial or employment interest that conflicts with that of the trust beneficiary, whether the tribe or an allottee. Interests arising from membership in, or employment by, an Indian tribe or rights to share in a tribal claim need not be regulated.

      § 900.235   What personal conflicts of interest must the standards of conduct regulate?

#### § § 900.235

      The standards must prohibit an officer, employee, or agent (including a subcontractor) from participating in the review, analysis, or inspection of trust transactions involving an entity in which such persons have a direct financial interest or an employment relationship. It must also prohibit such officers, employees, or agents from accepting any gratuity, favor, or anything of more than nominal value, from a party (other than the Indian tribe) with an interest in the trust transactions under review. Such standards must also provide for sanctions or remedies for violation of the standards.

      § 900.236   May an Indian tribe elect to negotiate contract provisions on conflict of interest to take the place of this regulation?

#### § § 900.236

      Yes. An Indian tribe and the Secretary may agree to contract provisions, concerning either personal or organizational conflicts, that address the issues specific to the program and activities contracted in a manner that provides equivalent protection against conflicts of interest to these regulations. Agreed-upon contract provisions shall be followed, rather than the related provisions of this regulation. For example, the Indian tribe and the Secretary may agree that using the Indian tribe's own written code of ethics satisfies the objectives of the personal conflicts provisions of this regulation, in whole or in part.

    Subpart P—Retrocession and Reassumption Procedures

      § 900.240   What does retrocession mean?

#### § § 900.240

      (a) Any other contract to which it is a party;

      (b) Any other contracts it may request; and

      (c) Any future request by the Indian tribe or tribal organization to contract for the same program.

      § 900.244   Will an Indian tribe or tribal organization's retrocession adversely affect funding available for the retroceded program?

#### § § 900.244

      No. The Secretary shall provide not less than the same level of funding that would have been available if there had been no retrocession.

      § 900.245   What obligation does the Indian tribe or tribal organization have with respect to returning property that was used in the operation of the retroceded program?

      § 900.246   What does reassumption mean?

#### § § 900.246

      Reassumption means rescission, in whole or in part, of a contract and assuming or resuming control or operation of the contracted program by the Secretary without consent of the Indian tribe or tribal organization. There are two types of reassumption: emergency and non-emergency.

      § 900.249   What happens if the contractor fails to take corrective action to remedy the contract deficiencies identified in the notice?

#### § § 900.249

      The Secretary shall provide a second written notice by certified mail to the Indian tribes or tribal organizations served by the contract and the contractor that the contract will be rescinded, in whole or in part.
