    § 51-1.1   Policy.

#### § § 51-1.1

    (a) It is the policy of the Government to increase employment and training opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through the purchase of commodities and services from qualified nonprofit agencies employing persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities. The Committee for Purchase from People who are Blind or Severely Disabled (hereinafter the Committee) was established by the Javits-Wagner—O'Day Act, Public Law 92-28, 85 Stat. 77 (1971), as amended, 41 U.S.C. 46-48c (hereinafter the JWOD Act). The Committee is responsible for implementation of a comprehensive program designed to enforce this policy.

    (b) It is the policy of the Committee to encourage all Federal entities and employees to provide the necessary support to ensure that the JWOD Act is implemented in an effective manner. This support includes purchase of products and services published on the Committee's Procurement List through appropriate channels from nonprofit agencies employing persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities designated by the Committee; recommendations to the Committee of new commodities and services suitable for addition to the Procurement List; and cooperation with the Committee and the central nonprofit agencies in the provision of such data as the Committee may decide is necessary to determine suitability for addition to the Procurement List.

    § 51-1.2   Mandatory source priorities.

#### § § 51-1.2

    (a) The JWOD Act mandates that commodities or services on the Procurement List required by Government entities be procured, as prescribed in this regulation, from a nonprofit agency employing persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities, at a price established by the Committee, if that commodity or service is available within the normal period required by that Government entity. Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the JWOD Act has priority, under the provisions of 41 U.S.C. 48, over any other supplier of the Government's requirements for commodities and services on the Committee's Procurement List.

    (b) Federal Prison Industries, Inc. has priority, under the provisions of 18 U.S.C. 4124, over nonprofit agencies employing persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities in furnishing commodities for sale to the Government. All or a portion of the Government's requirement for a commodity for which Federal Prison Industries, Inc. has exercised its priority may be added to the Procurement List. However, such addition is made with the understanding that procurement under the JWOD Act shall be limited to that portion of the Government's requirement for the commodity which is not available or not required to be procured from Federal Prison Industries, Inc.

    (c) The JWOD Act requires the Committee to prescribe regulations providing that, in the purchase by the Government of commodities produced and offered for sale by qualified nonprofit agencies employing persons who are blind and nonprofit agencies employing persons who have other severe disabilities, priority shall be accorded to commodities produced and offered for sale by qualified nonprofit agencies for the blind. In approving the addition of commodities, to the Procurement List, the Committee accords priority to nonprofit agencies for the blind. Nonprofit agencies for the blind and nonprofit agencies employing persons with severe disabilities have equal priority for services.

#### § § 51-2.3

    At least 30 days prior to the Committee's consideration of the addition or deletion of a commodity or service to or from the Procurement List, the Committee publishes a notice in the  announcing the proposed addition or deletion and providing interested persons an opportunity to submit written data or comments on the proposal.

> [59 FR 59341, Nov. 16, 1994]

    § 51-2.4   Determination of suitability.

#### § § 51-2.4

    (a) For a commodity or service to be suitable for addition to the Procurement List, each of the following criteria must be satisfied:

    (1)  The proposed addition must demonstrate a potential to generate employment for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities.

    (2)  The nonprofit agency (or agencies) proposing to furnish the item must qualify as a nonprofit agency serving persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities, as set forth in part 51-4 of this chapter.

    (3)  The nonprofit agency (or agencies) desiring to furnish a commodity or service under the JWOD Program must satisfy the Committee as to the extent of the labor operations to be performed and that it will have the capability to meet Government quality standards and delivery schedules by the time it assumes responsibility for supplying the Government.

    (4)  (i) In deciding whether or not a proposed addition to the Procurement List is likely to have a severe adverse impact on the current contractor for the specific commodity or service, the Committee gives particular attention to:

    (A) The possible impact on the contractor's total sales, including the sales of affiliated companies and parent corporations. In addition, the Committee considers the effects of previous Committee actions.

    (B) Whether that contractor has been a continuous supplier to the Government of the specific commodity or service proposed for addition and is, therefore, more dependent on the income from such sales to the Government.

    (ii) If there is not a current contract for the commodity or service being proposed for addition to the Procurement List, the Committee may consider the most recent contractor to furnish the item to the Government as the current contractor for the purpose of determining the level of impact.

    (b) In determining the suitability of a commodity or service for addition to the Procurement List, the Committee also considers other information it deems pertinent, including comments on a proposal published in the  to add the commodity or service to the Procurement List and information submitted by Government personnel and interested persons. Because the Committee's authority to establish fair market prices is separate from its authority to determine the suitability of a commodity or service for addition to the Procurement List, the Committee does not consider comments on proposed fair market prices for commodities and services proposed for addition to the Procurement List to be pertinent to a suitability determination.

    § 51-2.5   Committee decision.

#### § § 51-2.5

    The Committee considers the particular facts and circumstances in each case in determining if a commodity or service is suitable for addition to the Procurement List. When the Committee determines that a proposed addition is likely to have a severe adverse impact on a current contractor, it takes this fact into consideration in deciding not to add the commodity or service to the Procurement List, or to add only a portion of the Government requirement for the item. If the Committee decides to add a commodity or service in whole or in part to the Procurement List, that decision is announced in the  with a notice that includes information on the effective date of the addition.

    § 51-2.6   Reconsideration of Committee decision.

#### § § 51-2.6

    (a) The Committee may reconsider its decision to add items to the Procurement List if it receives pertinent information which was not before it when it initially made the decision. Unless otherwise provided by the Committee, requests for reconsideration from interested persons must be received by the Committee within 60 days following the effective date of the addition in question. A request for reconsideration must include the specific facts believed by the interested person to justify a decision by the Committee to modify or reverse its earlier action.

    (b) In reconsidering its decision, the Committee will balance the harm to the party requesting reconsideration if the item remains on the Procurement List against the harm which the nonprofit agency or its employees who are blind or have other severe disabilities would suffer if the item were deleted from the Procurement List. The Committee may also consider information bringing into question its conclusions on the suitability criteria on which it based its original decision as factors weighing toward a decision to delete the item, and information concerning possible harm to the Government and the JWOD Program as factors weighing toward confirmation of the original decision.

    § 51-2.7   Fair market price.

#### § § 51-2.7

    (a) The Committee is responsible for determining fair market prices, and changes thereto, for commodities and services on the Procurement List. The Committee is responsible for determining fair market prices, and changes thereto, for commodities and services on the Procurement List. The initial fair market price may be based on, where applicable, bilateral negotiations between contracting activities and authorized nonprofit agencies, market research, comparing the previous price paid, price competition, or any other methodology specified in Committee policies and procedures.

    (b) The initial fair market price may be revised in accordance with the methodologies established by the Committee, which include, where applicable, bilateral negotiations between contracting activities and authorized nonprofit agencies assisted by central nonprofit agencies, the use of economic indices, price competition, or any other methodology permitted under the Committee's policies and procedures.

    (c) After review and analysis, the central nonprofit agency shall submit to the Committee the recommended fair market price and, where a change to the fair market price is recommended, the methods by which prices shall be changed to the Committee, along with the information required by Committee pricing procedures to support each recommendation. The Committee will review the recommendations, revise the recommended prices where appropriate, and establish a fair market price, or change thereto, for each commodity or service which is the subject of a recommendation.

    § 51-3.4   Distribution of orders.

#### § § 51-3.4

    (a) Central nonprofit agencies shall distribute orders from the Government only to nonprofit agencies which the Committee has authorized to furnish the specific commodity or service. When the Committee has authorized two or more nonprofit agencies to furnish a specific commodity or service, the central nonprofit agency shall distribute orders in a manner that is fair and equitable to each authorized nonprofit agency, and that provides the best value for the requiring Federal agency and best meets the mission of the Program.

    (d) After notification, the responsible central nonprofit agency shall select the authorized nonprofit agency that it determines provides the best value for the ordering Federal agency and meets the mission of the Program in accordance with the Committee's policies and procedures. The selection decision shall be based on criteria approved by the Committee, such as technical capability, past performance, and price. The selection decision may also consider any other criteria or subcriteria specific to the service requirement. In addition, each selection decision shall consider criteria or subcriteria that address the nonprofit agency's capability to provide opportunities related to training and placements, as well as employment, for individuals who are blind or have significant disabilities. Criteria may be weighted, but price shall not have greater weight than the non-price factors when combined, except for competitive distributions directed by the Committee in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section.

    (e) The Committee may also direct a competitive distribution in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section for any service requirement already on the Procurement List that exceeds a total project value of $1 million, if bilateral negotiations described at § 51-2.7(b) of this chapter are attempted in good faith but fail to produce a recommendation to the Committee for revising the fair market price. A Federal agency may not request, and the Committee shall not direct a competitive distribution based solely on failed price negotiations, until the parties have exhausted all available remedies established within the Committee's pricing policies and procedures.

    (f) Any dispute arising out of a competitive distribution decision described at paragraph (d) of this section shall be submitted to the appropriate central nonprofit agency for resolution. If the affected nonprofit agency disagrees with the central nonprofit agency's resolution, it may appeal that decision to the Committee for final resolution. Appeals must be filed with the Committee within five business days of the nonprofit agency's notification of the central nonprofit agency's resolution decision, and only a nonprofit agency that participated in the competitive distribution process described at paragraph (c) of this section may file an appeal.

    § 51-5.1   General.

#### § § 51-5.1

    (a) Contracting activities are encouraged to assist the Committee and the central nonprofit agencies in identifying suitable commodities and services to be furnished by nonprofit agencies employing persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities so that the Committee can attain its objective of increasing employment and training opportunities for individuals who are blind or have other severe disabilities. For items which appear to be suitable to be furnished by nonprofit agencies, the contracting activity should refer the candidate commodities and services to the Committee or a central nonprofit agency. If a contracting activity decides to procure one or more commodities which are similar to a commodity or commodities on the Procurement List, the contracting activity should refer the commodities it intends to procure to the Committee or a central nonprofit agency.

    (b) Contracting activities shall provide the Committee and designated central nonprofit agencies with information needed to enable the Committee to determine whether a commodity or service is suitable to be furnished by a nonprofit agency. For commodities, information such as the latest solicitation and amendments, bid abstracts, procurement history, estimated annual usage quantities, and anticipated date of next solicitation issuance and opening may be needed. For services, similar information including the statement of work and applicable wage determination may be required. In order to assist in evaluating the suitability of an Office of Management and Budget Circular No. A-76 conversion, contracting activities should provide a copy of the draft statement of work and applicable wage determination to the central nonprofit agency upon its request.

    § 51-5.2   Authorization/deauthorization as a mandatory source.

#### § § 51-5.2

    (a) The Committee may authorize one or more nonprofit agencies to provide a commodity or service on the Procurement List. Nonprofit agencies that have been authorized as mandatory sources for a commodity or service on the Procurement List are the only authorized sources for providing that commodity or service until the nonprofit agency has been deauthorized by the Committee in accordance with the Committee's policies and procedures. To meet the needs of the ordering Federal agency, the central nonprofit agencies may distribute the commodity or service to one or more nonprofit agencies in accordance with § 51-3.4(a) of this chapter.

    (b) After a determination of suitability for approving items on the Procurement List, the Committee will authorize the most capable nonprofit agencies as the mandatory source(s) for commodities or services. Commodities and services may be purchased from nonprofit agencies; central nonprofit agencies; Government central supply agencies, such as the Defense Logistics Agency, Department of Veterans Affairs, and General Services Administration; and certain commercial distributors. (Identification of the authorized sources for a particular commodity may be obtained from the central nonprofit agencies indicated by the Procurement List which is found at )

    (c) Contracting activities shall require that their contracts with other organizations or individuals, such as prime vendors providing commodities that are already on the Procurement List to Federal agencies, require that the vendor orders these commodities from the sources authorized by the Committee.

    (d) Procedures for obtaining military resale commodities are contained in § 51-6.4 of this chapter.

    (e) Contracting activities procuring services, which have included within them services on the Procurement List, shall require their contractors for the larger service requirement to procure the included Procurement List services from nonprofit agencies authorized by the Committee.

    (f) If the Committee deauthorizes a nonprofit agency as the mandatory source, the deauthorized nonprofit agency shall ensure as many of its employees who are blind or have other significant disabilities as practicable remain on the job with the new authorized successor nonprofit agency. The successor nonprofit agency is required to offer a right of first refusal of employment under the successor contract to current employees of the deauthorized nonprofit agency who are blind or have other significant disabilities for positions for which they are qualified. The deauthorized nonprofit agency shall disclose necessary personnel records in accordance with all applicable laws protecting the privacy of the employee to allow the successor nonprofit agency to conduct interviews with those identified employees. If selected employees agree, the deauthorized nonprofit agency shall release them at a mutually agreeable date and negotiate transfer of their earned fringe benefits and other relevant employment and Program eligibility information to the successor nonprofit agency. The requirement for a successor nonprofit agency to offer the right of first refusal also applies to an authorized nonprofit agency that is no longer serving as the mandatory source because of a competitive distribution under § 51-3.4(d) of this chapter.

    § 51-5.3   Scope of requirement.

#### § § 51-5.3

    (a) When a commodity is included on the Procurement List, the mandatory source requirement covers the National Stock Number or item designation listed and commodities that are essentially the same as the listed item. In some instances, only a portion of the Government requirement for a National Stock Number or item designation is specified by the Procurement List. Where geographic areas, quantities, percentages or specific supply locations for a commodity are listed, the mandatory  provisions of the JWOD act apply only to the portion or portions of the  commodity indicated by the Procurement List.

    (b) For services, where an agency and location or geographic area are listed on the Procurement List, only the service for the location or geographic area listed must be procured from the nonprofit agency, except as provided in § 51-6.14 of this chapter. Where no location or geographic area is indicated by the Procurement List, it is mandatory that the total Government requirement for that service be procured from a nonprofit agency.

    (c) When a commodity or service is added to the Procurement List, the addition does not affect contracts for the commodity or service awarded prior to the effective date of the Procurement List addition or options exercised under those contracts.

> [56 FR 48981, Sept. 26, 1991; 56 FR 64002, Dec. 6, 1991, as amended at 59 FR 59343, Nov. 16, 1994; 63 FR 16439, Apr. 3, 1998]

    § 51-5.4   Purchase exceptions.

#### § § 51-5.4

    (a) A central nonprofit agency will normally grant a purchase exception for a contracting activity to procure from commercial sources commodities or services on the Procurement List when both of the following conditions are met:

    (1) The central nonprofit agency or its nonprofit agency(ies) cannot furnish a commodity or service within the period specified, and

    (2) The commodity or service is available from commercial sources in the quantities needed and significantly sooner than it will be available from the nonprofit agency(ies).

    (b) The central nonprofit agency may grant a purchase exception when the quantity involved is not sufficient to be furnished economically by the nonprofit agency(ies).

    (c) The Committee may also grant a purchase exception for the reasons set forth in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.

    (d) The central nonprofit agency shall obtain the approval of the Committee before granting a purchase exception when the value of the procurement exceeds the simplified acquisition threshold set forth in the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994 or any subsequent amendments thereto.

    (e) When the central nonprofit agency grants a purchase exception under the above conditions, it shall do so promptly and shall specify the quantities and delivery period covered by the exception.

    (f) When a purchase exception is granted under paragraph (a) of this section:

    (1) Contracting activities shall initiate purchase actions within 15 days following the date of the purchase exception. The deadline may be extended by the central nonprofit agency with, in cases of procurements exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, the concurrence of the Committee.

    (2) Contracting activities shall furnish a copy to the solicitation to the appropriate central nonprofit agency at the time it is issued, and a copy of the annotated bid abstract upon awarding of the commercial contract.

    (g) Any decision by a central nonprofit agency regarding a purchase exception may be appealed to the Committee by the contracting activity.

    § 51-5.5   Prices.

#### § § 51-5.5

    (a) The prices for items on the Procurement List are fair market prices established by the Committee under authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act (41 U.S.C. 47(b)).

    (b) Prices for commodities include applicable packaging, packing, and marking. Prices include transportation to point of delivery as specified in § 51-5.6.

    (c) Price changes for commodities and services shall usually apply to orders received by the nonprofit agency on or after the effective date of the change. In special cases, after considering the views of the contracting activity, the Committee may make price changes applicable to orders received by the nonprofit agency prior to the effective date of the change.

    (d) To assist the Committee in revising the fair market prices for services on the Procurement List, upon request from the central nonprofit agency, the contracting activity should take the following actions:

    (1) Submit to the Department of Labor in a timely fashion a request for wage determination rate.

    (2) Provide a copy of the new wage determination rate or the Department of Labor document stating that the wage determination rate is unchanged to the central nonprofit agency at least 60 days before the beginning of the new service period.

    (3) Provide to the central nonprofit agency at least 90 days before the beginning of the new service period a copy of the statement of work applicable to the new service period.

    (e) If a contracting activity desires packing, packaging, or marking of products other than the standard pack or as provided in the Procurement List, any difference in cost shall be negotiated with the nonprofit agency.

    § 51-5.6   Shipping.

#### § § 51-5.6

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, commodities are sold to the Government on an “F.O.B. destination” basis, with delivery being accomplished when the shipment reaches the facility designated by the contracting activity. Time of delivery is when the shipment is released by the carrier and accepted by the contracting activity or its agent. In this delivery method, the nonprofit agency will normally use commercial bills of lading and will be responsible for any loss or damage to the goods occurring before the commodities reach the designated delivery point. The nonprofit agency will prepare and distribute commercial bills of lading, furnish delivery schedules, designate the carriers, and pay all shipping charges to specified delivery points.

    (b) The Committee may determine that certain commodities are to be sold to the Government on an “F.O.B. origin” basis, with delivery being accomplished when a shipment is placed aboard the vehicle of the initial carrier. Time of delivery is when the shipment is released to and accepted by the initial carrier. In this delivery method, the nonprofit agency will normally use Government bills of lading, and responsibility for loss or damage to the goods while in transit passes to the Government at the time the initial carrier accepts a shipment. If the contracting activity fails to furnish a Government bill of lading promptly, such failure shall be considered an excusable delay in delivery.

    § 51-5.7   Payments.

#### § § 51-5.7

    Payments for products or services of persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities shall be made within 30 days after shipment or receipt of a proper invoice or voucher.

    § 51-5.8   Violations by entities of the Government.

#### § § 51-5.8

    Any alleged violations of the JWOD Act or these regulations by entities of the Government shall be investigated by the Committee, which shall notify the entity and afford it an opportunity to submit a statement.

**Source:** Source: 56 FR 48983, Sept. 26, 1991, unless otherwise noted.

    § 51-6.1   Direct order process.

#### § § 51-6.1

    (a) Once a commodity or service is added to the Procurement List, the central nonprofit agency may authorize the contracting activity to issue orders directly to a nonprofit agency without requesting an allocation for each order. This procedure is known as the direct order process.

    (b) In these cases, the central nonprofit agency shall specify the normal leadtime required for orders transmitted directly to the nonprofit agencies. This method shall be used whenever possible since it eliminates double handling and decreases the time required for processing orders.

    (c) An order for commodities or services shall provide leadtime sufficient for purchase of materials, production or preparation, and delivery or completion.

    (d) The central nonprofit agency shall keep the contracting activity informed of any changes in leadtime experienced by its nonprofit agencies in order to keep to a minimum requests for extensions once an order is placed. Where, due to unusual conditions, an order does not provide sufficient leadtime, the central nonprofit agency or the individual nonprofit agency may request an extension of delivery or completion date which should be granted, if feasible. If extension of delivery or completion date is not feasible, the contracting activity shall:

    (1) Notify the central nonprofit agency and the individual nonprofit agency(ies) as appropriate.

    (2) Request the central nonprofit agency to reallocate or to issue a purchase exception authorizing procurement from commercial sources as provided in § 51-5.4 of this chapter.

    (e) The contracting activity shall promptly provide to the central nonprofit agency concerned a copy of all orders issued to nonprofit agencies.

    (f) The written direct order authorization remains valid until it is revoked by the central nonprofit agency.

    § 51-6.2   Allocation process.

#### § § 51-6.2

    (a) In those cases where a direct order authorization has not been issued as described in § 51-6.1, the contracting activity shall submit written requests for allocation to the appropriate central nonprofit agency indicated by the Procurement List at the address listed below:

    (b) Requests for allocations shall contain, as a minimum:

    (1) For commodities. Name, stock number, latest specification, quantity, unit price, and place and time of delivery.

    (2) For services. Type and location of service required, latest specification, work to be performed, estimated volume, and time for completion.

    (c) Contracting activities shall request allocations in sufficient time for the central nonprofit agency to reply, for the order(s) to be placed, and for the nonprofit agencies to furnish the commodity or service (see paragraph (i) of this section).

    (d) When a commodity on the Procurement List also appears on the Federal Prison Industries' “Schedule of Products,” the contracting activity shall obtain clearance from the Federal Prison Industries prior to requesting an allocation or placing an order directly to the nonprofit agency(ies).

    (e) The central nonprofit agency shall make allocations to the appropriate nonprofit agency(ies) upon receipt of a request from the contracting activity and instruct that the orders be forwarded to the central nonprofit agency or direct to the nonprofit agency(ies) with a copy provided promptly to the central nonprofit agency.

    (f) Central nonprofit agencies shall reply promptly to requests for allocation. When a request for allocation provides a delivery schedule (based on established lead times and time required for processing the allocation request) which cannot be met, the central nonprofit agency shall request a revision, which the contracting activity shall grant, if feasible, or the central nonprofit agency shall issue a purchase exception authorizing procurement from commercial sources as provided in § 51-5.4 of this chapter.

    (g) An allocation is not an obligation to supply a commodity or service, or an obligation for the contracting activity to issue an order. Nonprofit agencies are not authorized to commence production until receipt of an order.

    (h) Upon receipt of an allocation, the contracting activity shall promptly submit an order to the appropriate central nonprofit agency or designated nonprofit agency(ies). Where this cannot be done promptly, the contracting activity shall advise the central nonprofit agency and the nonprofit agency(ies) immediately.

    (i) An order for commodities or services shall provide leadtime sufficient for purchase of materials, production or preparation, and delivery or completion.

    (j) The Central nonprofit agency shall keep the contracting activity informed of any changes in leadtime experienced by its nonprofit agency(ies) in order to keep to a minimum requests for extensions once an order is placed. Where, due to unusual conditions, an order does not provide sufficient leadtime, the central nonprofit agency or nonprofit agency may request an extension of delivery or completion date which should be granted, if feasible. If extension of delivery or completion date is not feasible, the contracting activity shall:

    (1) Notify the central nonprofit agency and nonprofit agency(ies) as appropriate.

    (2) Request the central nonprofit agency to reallocate or to issue a purchase exception authorizing procurement from commercial sources as provided in § 51-5.4 of this chapter.

    (k) In those instances where the central nonprofit agency is the prime contractor rather than the nonprofit agency, the central nonprofit agency will designate the nonprofit agency(ies) authorized by the Committee to furnish definite quantities of commodities or specific services upon receipt of an order from the contracting activity.

    § 51-6.3   Long-term procurements.

#### § § 51-6.3

    (a) Contracting activities are encouraged to investigate long-term ordering agreements for commodities listed on the Procurement List to level off demand, thereby helping ensure stability of employment and development of job skills for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities.

    (b) Contracting activities are encouraged to use the longest contract term available by law to their agencies for contracts for commodities and services under the AbilityOne Program, in order to minimize the time and expense devoted to formation and renewal of these contracts.

    § 51-6.4   Military resale commodities.

#### § § 51-6.4

    (a) Purchase procedures for ordering military resale commodities are available from the central nonprofit agencies. Authorized resale outlets (military commissary stores, Armed Forces exchanges and like activities of other Government departments and agencies) shall request the central nonprofit agency responsible for the military resale commodity being ordered to designate the nonprofit agency or its agent to which the outlets shall forward orders.

    (b) Authorized resale outlets shall stock military resale commodities in as broad a range as practicable. Authorized resale outlets may stock commercial items comparable to military resale commodities they stock, except that military commissary stores shall stock military resale commodities in the 300-800-, 900-, 1000-, 1100-, 10000- (10000-10999); 13000 (13000-13999); 14000 (14000-14999); 15000 (15000-15999); and 16000 (16000-16999) series exclusively, unless an exception has been granted on an individual store basis for the stocking of comparable commercial items for which there is a significant customer demand.

    § 51-6.5   Adjustment and cancellation of orders.

#### § § 51-6.5

    When the central nonprofit agency or an individual nonprofit agency fails to comply with the terms of a Government order, the contracting activity shall make every effort to negotiate an adjustment before taking action to cancel the order. When a Government order is canceled for failure to comply with its terms, the central nonprofit agency shall be notified, and, if practicable, requested to reallocate the order. The central nonprofit agency shall notify the Committee of any cancellation of an order and the reasons for that cancellation.

    § 51-6.6   Request for waiver of specification requirement.

#### § § 51-6.6

    (a) Nonprofit agencies and central nonprofit agencies are encouraged to recommend changes to specification requirements or request waivers where there are opportunities to provide equal or improved products at a lower cost to the Government.

    (b) A nonprofit agency shall not request a waiver of a specification requirement except when it is not possible to obtain the material meeting the specification or when other requirements contained in the specification cannot be met.

    (c) Requests for waiver of specification shall be transmitted by the nonprofit agency to its central nonprofit agency.

    (d) The central nonprofit agency shall review the request and the specification to determine if the request is valid and shall submit to the contracting activity only those requests which it has determined are necessary to enable the nonprofit agency to furnish the item.

    (e) The central nonprofit agency request for waiver shall be transmitted in writing to the contracting activity. In addition, a copy of the request shall be transmitted to the Committee, annotated to include a statement concerning the impact on the cost of producing the item if the waiver is approved.

    § 51-6.7   Orders in excess of nonprofit agency capability.

#### § § 51-6.7

    (a) Nonprofit agencies are expected to furnish commodities on the Procurement List within the time frames specified by the Government. The nonprofit agency must have the necessary production facilities to meet normal fluctuations in demand.

    (b) Nonprofit agencies shall take those actions necessary to ensure that they can ship commodities within the time frames specified by the Government. In instances where the nonprofit agency determines that it cannot ship the commodity in the quantities specified by the required shipping date, it shall notify the central nonprofit agency and the contracting activity. The central nonprofit agency shall request a revision of the shipping schedule which the contracting activity should grant, if feasible, or the central nonprofit agency shall issue a purchase exception authorizing procurement from commercial sources as provided in § 51-5.4 of this chapter.

    § 51-6.8   Deletion of items from the Procurement List.

#### § § 51-6.8

    (a) When a central nonprofit agency decides to request that the Committee delete a commodity or service from the Procurement List, it shall notify the Committee staff immediately. Before reaching a decision to request a deletion of an item from the Procurement List, the central nonprofit agency shall determine that none of its nonprofit agencies is capable and desirous of furnishing the commodity or service involved.

    (b) Except in cases where the Government is no longer procuring the item in question, the Committee shall, prior to deleting an item from the Procurement List, determine that none of the nonprofit agencies of the other central nonprofit agency is desirous and capable of furnishing the commodity or service involved.

    (c) Nonprofit agencies will normally be required to complete production of any orders for commodities on hand regardless of the decision to delete the item. Nonprofit agencies shall obtain concurrence of the contracting activity and the Committee prior to returning a purchase order to the contracting activity.

    (d) For services, a nonprofit agency shall notify the contracting activity of its intent to discontinue performance of the service 90 days in advance of the termination date to enable the contracting activity to assure continuity of the service after the nonprofit agency's discontinuance.

    (e) The Committee may delete an item from the Procurement List without a request from a central nonprofit agency if the Committee determines that none of the nonprofit agencies participating in the AbilityOne Program are capable and desirous of furnishing the commodity or service to the Government, or if the Committee decides that the commodity or service is no longer suitable for procurement from nonprofit agencies employing people who are blind or have other severe disabilities. In considering such an action, the Committee will consult with the appropriate central nonprofit agency, the nonprofit agency or agencies involved, and the contracting activity.

    Routine contracting activity correspondence or inquiries concerning deliveries of commodities being shipped from or performance of services by nonprofit agencies employing persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities shall be with the nonprofit agency involved. Major problems shall be referred to the appropriate central nonprofit agency. In those instances where the problem cannot be resolved by the central nonprofit agency and the contracting activity involved, the contracting activity or central nonprofit agency shall notify the Committee of the problem so that action can be taken by the Committee to resolve it.

    § 51-6.10   Quality of merchandise.

#### § § 51-6.10

    (a) Commodities furnished under Government specification by nonprofit agencies employing persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities shall be manufactured in strict compliance with such specifications. Where no specifications exist, commodities furnished shall be of a quality equal to or higher than similar items available on the commercial market. Commodities shall be inspected utilizing nationally recognized test methods and procedures for sampling and inspection.

    (b) Services furnished by nonprofit agencies employing persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities shall be performed in accordance with Government specifications and standards. Where no Government specifications and standards exist, the services shall be performed in accordance with commercial practices.

    § 51-6.11   Quality complaints.

#### § § 51-6.11

    (a) When the quality of a commodity received is not considered satisfactory by the using activity, the activity shall take the following actions as appropriate:

    (1) For commodities received from Defense Logistics Agency supply centers, General Services Administration supply distribution facilities, Department of Veterans Affairs distribution division or other central stockage depots, or specifically authorized supply source, notify the supplying agency in writing in accordance with that agency's procedures. The supplying agency shall, in turn, provide copies of the notice to the nonprofit agency involved and its central nonprofit agency.

    (2) For commodities received directly from nonprofit agencies employing persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities, address complaints to the nonprofit agency involved with a copy to the central nonprofit agency with which it is affiliated.

    (b) When the quality of a service is not considered satisfactory by the contracting activity, it shall address complaints to the nonprofit agency involved with a copy to the central nonprofit agency with which it is affiliated.

    § 51-6.12   Specification changes and similar actions.

#### § § 51-6.12

    (a) Contracting activities shall notify the nonprofit agency or agencies authorized to furnish a commodity on the Procurement List and the central nonprofit agency concerned of any changes to the specification or other description of the commodity.

    (b) When a Government entity is changing the specification or description of a commodity on the Procurement List, including a change that involves the assignment of a new national stock number or item designation, the office assigned responsibility for the action shall obtain the comments of the Committee and the central nonprofit agency concerned on the proposed change and shall notify the nonprofit agency and the central nonprofit agency concerned at least 90 days prior to placing an order for a commodity covered by the new specification or description.

    (c) For services on the Procurement List, the contracting activity shall notify the nonprofit agency furnishing the service and the central nonprofit agency concerned at least 90 days prior to the date that any changes in the statement of work or other conditions of performance will be required, including assumption of performance of the service by the contracting activity.

    (d) If an emergency makes it impossible for a contracting activity to give the 90-day notice required by paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, the contracting activity shall inform the nonprofit agency and the central nonprofit agency concerned of the reasons it cannot meet the 90-day notice requirement when it places the order or change notice.

    (e) Nonprofit agencies shall recommend changes in specifications, item descriptions, and statements of work that will improve the commodity or service being provided, reduce costs, or improve overall value to the Government. Contracting activities shall respond promptly to these recommendations and work with the nonprofit agencies to implement them when appropriate.

    § 51-6.13   Replacement and similar commodities.

#### § § 51-6.13

    (a) When a commodity on the Procurement List is replaced by another commodity which has not been recently procured, and a nonprofit agency can furnish the replacement commodity in accordance with the Government's quality standards and delivery schedules, the replacement commodity is automatically considered to be on the Procurement List and shall be procured from the nonprofit agency designated by the Committee at the fair market price the Committee has set for the replacement commodity. The commodity being replaced shall continue to be included on the Procurement List until there is no longer a Government requirement for that commodity.

    (b) If contracting activities desire to procure additional sizes, colors, or other variations of a commodity after the commodity is added to the Procurement List, and these similar commodities have not recently been procured, these commodities are also automatically considered to be on the Procurement List.

    (c) In accordance with § 51-5.3 of this chapter, contracting activities are not permitted to purchase commercial items that are essentially the same as commodities on the Procurement List.

> [59 FR 59344, Nov. 16, 1994]

    § 51-6.14   Replacement services.

#### § § 51-6.14

    If a service is on the Procurement List to meet the needs of a Government entity at a specific location and the entity moves to another location, the service at the new location is automatically considered to be on the Procurement List if a qualified nonprofit agency is available to provide the service at the new location, unless the service at that location is already being provided by another contractor. If the service at the new location is being provided by another contractor, the service will not be on the Procurement List unless the Committee adds it as prescribed in part 51-2 of this chapter. If another Government entity moves into the old location, the service at that location will remain on the Procurement List to meet the needs of the new Government entity.

#### § § 51-6.15

    Disputes between a nonprofit agency and a contracting activity arising out of matters covered by parts 51-5 and 51-6 of this chapter shall be resolved, where possible, by the contracting activity and the nonprofit agency, with assistance from the appropriate central nonprofit agency. Disputes which cannot be resolved by these parties shall be referred to the Committee for resolution.

**Source:** Source: 56 FR 48986, Sept. 26, 1991, unless otherwise noted.

    § 51-7.1   Purpose and scope.

#### § § 51-7.1

    (a)  This part implements the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) and provides for the implementation of those provisions identified in 40 CFR 1507.3(b) of the regulations issued by the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) (40 CFR parts 1500-1508) published pursuant to NEPA.

    (b)  This part applies to all actions of the Committee for Purchase from Persons who are Blind or Severely Disabled which may affect environmental quality in the United States.

> [56 FR 48986, Sept. 26, 1991, as amended at 59 FR 16777, Apr. 8, 1994]

    § 51-7.2   Early involvement in private, State, and local activities requiring Federal approval.

#### § § 51-7.2

    (a) 40 CFR 1501.2(d) requires agencies to provide for early involvement in actions which, while planned by private applicants or other non-Federal entities, require some sort of Federal approval. Pursuant to the JWOD Act (41 U.S.C. 46-48c), the Committee for Purchase from People who are Blind or Severely Disabled makes the determination as to which qualified nonprofit agency serving persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities will furnish designated products and services to the Government.

    (b) To implement the requirements of 40 CFR 1501.2(d) with respect to these actions, the Committee staff shall consult as required with other appropriate parties to initiate and coordinate the necessary environmental analysis. The Executive Director shall determine on the basis of information submitted by private agencies and other non-Federal entities or generated by the Committee whether the proposed action is one that normally does not require an environmental assessment or environmental impact statement (EIS) as set forth in § 51-7.4, or is one that requires an environmental assessment as set forth in 40 CFR 1501.4.

    (c) To facilitate compliance with these requirements, private agencies and other non-Federal entities are expected to:

    (1) Contact the Committee staff as early as possible in the planning process for guidance on the scope and level of environmental information required to be submitted in support of their request;

    (2) Conduct any studies which are deemed necessary and appropriate by the Committee to determine the impact of the proposed action on the human environment;

    (3) Consult with appropriate Federal, regional, State and local agencies and other potentially interested parties during preliminary planning stages to ensure that all environmental factors are identified;

    (4) Submit applications for all Federal, regional, State and local approvals as early as possible in the planning process;

    (5) Notify the Committee as early as possible of all other Federal, regional, State, local and Indian tribe actions required for project completion so that the Committee may coordinate all Federal environmental reviews; and

    (6) Notify the Committee of all known parties potentially affected by or interested in the proposed action.

    § 51-7.3   Ensuring environmental documents are actually considered in agency determinations.

#### § § 51-7.3

    (a) 40 CFR 1505.1 of the NEPA regulations contains requirements to ensure adequate consideration of environmental documents in agency decision-making. To implement these requirements, the Committee staff shall:

    (1) Consider all relevant environmental documents in evaluating proposals for agency action;

    (2) Ensure that all relevant environmental documents, comments and responses accompany the proposal through the agency review processes;

    (3) Consider only those alternatives discussed in the relevant environmental documents when evaluating proposals for agency action; and

    (4) Where an EIS has been prepared, consider the specific alternative analysis in the EIS when evaluating the proposal which is the subject of the EIS.

    (b) For each of the Committee's actions authorized by the JWOD Act, the following list identifies the point at which the NEPA process begins, the point at which it ends, and the key agency official or office required to consider the relevant environmental documents as a part of their decision-making:

    (1) Action: Request.

    (2) Start of NEPA process: Upon receipt of request.

    (3) Completion of NEPA process: When the deciding official reviews the proposal and makes a determination.

    (4) Key official or office required to consider environmental document: When a positive determination is made under § 51-7.2(b), the applicant in conjunction with the Committee staff will prepare the necessary papers.

    § 51-7.4   Typical classes of action.

#### § § 51-7.4

    (a) 40 CFR 1507.3(b)(2) in conjunction with 40 CFR 1508.4 requires agencies to establish three typical classes of action for similar treatment under NEPA. These typical classes of action are set forth below:

    (1) Actions normally requiring EIS: None.

    (2) Actions normally requiring assessments but not necessarily EISs: Requests for actions for which determinations under § 51-7.2(b) are found to be affirmative.

    (3) Actions normally not requiring assessments or EISs: Request for actions by nonprofit agencies through the central nonprofit agencies to add a commodity or service to the Committee's Procurement List.

    (b) The Committee shall independently determine, by referring to 40 CFR 1508.27, whether an EIS or an environmental assessment is required where:

    (1) A proposal for agency action is not covered by one of the typical classes of action above; or

    (2) For actions which are covered, but where the presence of extraordinary circumstances indicates that some other level of environmental review may be appropriate.

    § 51-7.5   Environmental information.

#### § § 51-7.5

    Interested parties may contact the Executive Director at (703) 603-7740 for information regarding the Committee's compliance with NEPA.

  PART 51-8—PUBLIC AVAILABILTY OF AGENCY MATERIALS

### Part 51

**Authority:** Authority: 5 U.S.C. 552.

**Source:** Source: 85 FR 37778, June 24, 2020, unless otherwise noted.

    § 51-8.1   General.

#### § § 51-8.1

    (a) This part contains the rules that the Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled (Committee) follows in processing requests for records under the Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA”), 5 U.S.C. 552. The rules in this part should be read in conjunction with the text of the FOIA and the Uniform Freedom of Information Fee Schedule and Guidelines published by the Office of Management and Budget (“OMB Guidelines”). Requests made by individuals for records about themselves under the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a, are processed under part 51-9 as well as under this part. As a matter of policy, the Committee makes discretionary disclosures of records or information exempt from disclosure under the FOIA whenever disclosure would not foreseeably harm an interest protected by a FOIA exemption, but this policy does not create any right enforceable in court.

    (b) The Committee has a centralized system for processing requests, all requests are handled by the FOIA Officer.

    § 51-8.2   Proactive Disclosures.

#### § § 51-8.2

    Records that the Committee is required to make available for public inspection in an electronic format may be accessed through the Committee's public website: . The Committee is responsible for determining which of its records must be made publicly available, for identifying additional records of interest to the public that are appropriate for public disclosure, and for posting and indexing such records. The Committee shall ensure that its website of posted records and indices is reviewed and updated on an ongoing basis. The Committee's FOIA Public Liaison contact information is available at .

    § 51-8.3   Requirements for Making Requests.

#### § § 51-8.3

    (a)  (1) The Committee has designated a FOIA office to process and respond to all FOIA requests. All Committee departments have the capability to receive requests electronically either through email or a web portal. A request will receive the quickest possible response if it is addressed to the FOIA office. To make a request for records, a requester should write directly to the FOIA office.

    (2) A requester may submit a request for records to the Executive Director at the Committee's offices, 1401 S Clark Street, Suite 715, Arlington, Virginia 22202-3259, or via email to  or via facsimile to (703) 603-0655. The request must be in writing and should indicate that it is being made under the FOIA. Failure to submit a request in accordance with these procedures may delay the processing of the request.

    (3) A requester who is making a request for records about himself or herself must comply with the verification of identity provision set forth in part 51-9.

    (4) Where a request for records pertains to a third party, a requester may receive greater access by submitting either a notarized authorization signed by that individual or a declaration made in compliance with the requirements set forth in 28 U.S.C. 1746 by that individual authorizing disclosure of the records to the requester, or by submitting proof that the individual has deceased ( a copy of a death certificate or an obituary). As an exercise of administrative discretion, the Committee can require a requester to supply additional information if necessary in order to verify that a particular individual has consented to disclosure.

    (b)  Requesters must describe records sought in sufficient detail to enable Committee personnel to locate them with a reasonable amount of effort. To the extent possible, requesters should include specific information that may assist in identifying the requested records, such as the date, title or name, author, recipient, subject matter of the record, case number, file designation, or reference number. In general, requesters should include as much detail as possible about the specific records or the types of records that they are seeking. Before submitting their requests, requesters may contact the FOIA office or FOIA Public Liaison to discuss the records they are seeking and to receive assistance in describing the records. If after receiving a request the FOIA office determines that it does not reasonably describe the records sought, the FOIA office shall inform the requester what additional information is needed or why the request is otherwise insufficient. Requesters who are attempting to reformulate or modify such a request may discuss their request with the FOIA office or FOIA Public Liaison, each of whom is available to assist the requester in reasonably describing the records sought. If a request does not reasonably describe the records sought, the agency's response to the request may be delayed.

    (c) If the Committee determines that a request does not reasonably describe the records, it shall inform the requester of this fact and extend to the requester an opportunity to clarify the request or to confer promptly with knowledgeable Committee personnel to attempt to identify the records being sought or to reformulate a request. The Committee may offer assistance in identifying records and reformulating a request where: The description is deemed insufficient, the production of voluminous records is required, or a considerable number of work hours would be required to complete the request that would interfere with the business of the Committee.

    § 51-8.4   Responsibility for Responding to Requests.

#### § § 51-8.4

    (a)  Except in the instances described in paragraphs (c) of this section, the Committee is responsible for responding to a record request it received. In determining which records are responsive to a request, the Committee ordinarily will include only records in its possession as of the date that it begins its search. If any other date is used, the Committee shall inform the requester of that date. A record that is excluded from the requirements of the FOIA pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552(c) is not considered responsive to a request. The Committee has no obligation to create a record solely for the purpose of making it available under the FOIA.

    (b)  The Executive Director, or designee, is authorized to grant or deny any request for records that are maintained by the Committee.

    (c)  When reviewing records located by the Committee in response to a request, the Committee shall determine whether another agency of the Federal Government is better able to determine whether the record is exempt from disclosure under the FOIA. As to any such record, the Committee shall proceed in one of the following ways:

    (1)  When records originated with the Committee processing the request, but contain information of interest to another agency, or other Federal Government office, the Committee should typically consult with that other agency prior to making a release determination.

    (2)  (i) When upon the receipt of the request the Committee determines that a different agency, or other Federal Government office is best able to determine whether to disclose the record, the Committee should refer the responsibility for responding to the request to the other agency, as long as that agency is subject to the FOIA. Ordinarily, the agency that originated the record will be presumed to be best able to make the disclosure determination. However, if the Committee processing the request and the originating agency jointly agree that the former is in the best position to respond regarding the record, then the record may be handled as a consultation.

    (ii) Whenever the Committee refers any part of the responsibility for responding to a request to another agency, it shall document the referral, maintain a copy of the record that it refers, and notify the requester of the referral and inform the requester of the name(s) of the agency to which the record was referred, including that agency's FOIA contact information.

    (3)  The standard referral procedure is not appropriate where disclosure of the identity of the agency to which the referral would be made could harm an interest protected by an applicable exemption, such as the exemptions that protect personal privacy or national security interests. For example, if the Committee responding to a request for records on a living third party locates within its files records originating with a law enforcement agency, and if the existence of that law enforcement interest in the third party was not publically known, then to disclose that law enforcement interest could cause an unwarranted invasion of the personal privacy of the third party. Similarly, if the Committee locates within its files material originating with an Intelligence Community agency, and the involvement of that agency in the matter is classified and not publicly acknowledged, then to disclose or give attribution to the involvement of that Intelligence Community agency could cause national security harms. In such instances, in order to avoid harm to an interest protected by an applicable exemption, the Committee, upon receipt of the request, should coordinate with the originating component or agency to seek its views on the disclosability of the record. The release determination for the record that is the subject of the coordination should then be conveyed to the requester by the Committee.

    (d)  Whenever a request involves a record containing information that has been classified or may be appropriate for classification by another agency under any applicable executive order concerning the classification of records, the Committee shall refer the responsibility for responding to the request regarding that information to the agency that classified the information, or that should consider the information for classification. Whenever a component's record contains information that has been derivatively classified ( when it contains information classified by another agency), the Committee shall refer the responsibility for responding to that portion of the request to the agency that classified the underlying information.

    (e)  All consultations and referrals received by the Committee will be handled according to the date that the FOIA request was received by the first agency.

    (f)  The Committee may establish agreements with other agencies to eliminate the need for consultations or referrals with respect to particular types of records.

    § 51-8.5   Timing of Responses to Requests.

#### § § 51-8.5

    (a)  (1) The Committee ordinarily will respond to requests according to their order of receipt. The time limits prescribed in the FOIA will begin only after the Committee identifies a request as being made under the FOIA and deemed received by the Committee.

    (2) An initial determination whether, and to what extent, to grant each request for records or a fee waiver shall be made within 10 business days after receipt of that request. The requester shall be notified as soon as the determination is made.

    (3) When a requester complies with the procedures established in this part for obtaining records under the FOIA, the request shall receive prompt attention, and a response will be made within 20 business days.

    (b)  Whenever the Committee cannot meet the statutory time limit for processing a request because of “unusual circumstances,” as defined in the FOIA, and the Committee extends the time limit on that basis, the Committee shall, before expiration of the 20-day period to respond, notify the requester in writing of the unusual circumstances involved and of the date by which processing of the request can be expected to be completed. Where the extension exceeds 10 working days, the Committee will, as described by the FOIA, provide the requester with an opportunity to modify the request or arrange an alternative time period for processing the original or modified request. The Committee shall make available its FOIA office and its FOIA Public Liaison for this purpose. The agency must also alert requesters to the availability of the Office of Government Information Services to provide dispute resolution services.

    (c)  For the purposes of satisfying unusual circumstances under the FOIA, the Committee may aggregate requests in cases where it reasonably appears that multiple requests, submitted either by a requester or by a group of requesters acting in concert, constitute a single request that would otherwise involve unusual circumstances. The Committee shall not aggregate multiple requests that involve unrelated matters.

    (d)  (1) The Committee may use two or more processing tracks by distinguishing between simple, complex, and expedited requests based on the amount of work and/or time needed to process a request or the number of pages involved. Expedited processing shall be in accordance with the standards set forth in paragraph (g) of this section. Among the factors a component may consider are the number of pages involved in processing the request and the need for consultations or referrals. The Committee shall advise requesters of the track into which their request falls and, when appropriate, shall offer the requesters an opportunity to narrow their request so that it can be placed in a different processing track.

    (e)  (1) Requests and appeals may be taken out of order and given expedited treatment whenever it is determined that they involve:

    (i) Circumstances in which the lack of expedited processing could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual;

    (ii) An urgency to inform the public about an actual or alleged Federal Government activity, if made by a person who is primarily engaged in disseminating information;

    (iii) The loss of substantial due process rights; or

    (iv) A matter of widespread and exceptional media interest in which there exist possible questions about the government's integrity that affect public confidence.

    (2) A request for expedited processing may be made at any time. Requests based on paragraphs (e)(1)(i) through (iv) of this section must be submitted to the Committee's FOIA office.

    (3) A requester who seeks expedited processing must submit a statement, certified to be true and correct, explaining in detail the basis for making the request for expedited processing. For example, under paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section, a requester who is not a full-time member of the news media must establish that the requester is a person whose primary professional activity or occupation is information dissemination, though it need not be the requester's sole occupation. Such a requester also must establish a particular urgency to inform the public about the government activity involved in the request—one that extends beyond the public's right to know about government activity generally. The existence of numerous articles published on a given subject can be helpful in establishing the requirement that there be an “urgency to inform” the public on the topic. As a matter of administrative discretion, the Committee may waive the formal certification requirement.

    (4) The Committee shall notify the requester within 10 calendar days of the receipt of a request for expedited processing of its decision whether to grant or deny expedited processing. If expedited processing is granted, the request will be given priority and processed as soon as practicable. If a request for expedited processing is denied, any appeal of that decision shall be acted on expeditiously.

    § 51-8.6   Responses to Requests.

#### § § 51-8.6

    (a)  The Committee should, to the extent practicable, communicate with requesters having access to the internet using electronic means, such as email or web portal.

    (b)  The Committee shall acknowledge the request and assign it an individualized tracking number if it will take longer than 10 working days to process. The Committee shall include in the acknowledgement a brief description of the records sought to allow requesters to more easily keep track of their requests.

    (c)  When the Committee makes a determination to grant a request in full or in part, it shall notify the requester in writing. The Committee shall inform the requester of any fees charged under subpart 51-8.10 of this part and shall disclose the requested records to the requester promptly upon payment of any applicable fees. The Committee must inform the requester of the availability of the FOIA Public Liaison to offer assistance.

    (d)  If the Committee makes an adverse determination denying a request in any respect, the requester will be notified in writing. Adverse determinations, or denials of requests, include decisions that: The requested record is exempt, in whole or in part; the request does not reasonably describe the records sought; the information requested is not a record subject to the FOIA; the requested record does not exist, cannot be located, or has been destroyed; or the requested record is not readily reproducible in the form or format sought by the requester. Adverse determinations also include denials involving fees or fee waiver matters or denials of requests for expedited processing.

    (e)  The denial will be signed by the Executive Director or designee and include:

    (1) The name and title or position of the person responsible for the denial;

    (2) A brief statement of the reasons for the denial, including any FOIA exemption applied in denying the request;

    (3) An estimate of the volume of any records or information withheld, such as the number of pages or some other reasonable form of estimation, although such an estimate is not required if the volume is otherwise indicated by deletions marked on records that are disclosed in part or if providing an estimate would harm an interest protected by an applicable exemption;

    (4) A statement that the denial may be appealed under subpart 51-8.8 of this part, and a description of the appeal requirements set forth therein; and

    (5) A statement notifying the requester of the assistance available from the Committee's FOIA Public Liaison and the dispute resolution services offered by Office of Government Information Services (OGIS).

    § 51-8.7   Confidential Commercial Information.

#### § § 51-8.7

    (a)

    (1)  means commercial or financial information obtained by the Committee from a submitter that may be protected from disclosure under Exemption 4 of the FOIA, 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4).

    (2)  means any person or entity, including a corporation, State, or foreign government, but not including another Federal Government entity, that provides confidential commercial information, either directly or indirectly to the Federal Government.

    (b)  A submitter of confidential commercial information must use good faith efforts to designate by appropriate markings, either at the time of submission or within a reasonable time thereafter, any portion of its submission that it considers to be protected from disclosure under Exemption 4. These designations expire 10 years after the date of the submission unless the submitter requests and provides justification for a longer designation period.

    (c)  (1) The Committee will promptly provide written notice to the submitter of confidential commercial information whenever records containing such information are requested under the FOIA if, after reviewing the request, the responsive records, and any appeal by the requester, the Committee determines that it may be required to disclose the records, provided:

    (i) The requested information has been designated in good faith by the submitter as information considered protected from disclosure under Exemption 4; or

    (ii) The Committee has a reason to believe that the requested information may be protected from disclosure under Exemption 4, but has not yet determined whether the information is protected from disclosure under that exemption or any other applicable exemption.

    (2) The notice must either describe the commercial information requested or include a copy of the requested records or portions of records containing the information. In cases involving a voluminous number of submitters, notice may be made by posting or publishing the notice in a place or manner reasonably likely to accomplish notification.

    (d)  The notice requirements of this section do not apply if:

    (1) The Committee determines that the information is exempt under the FOIA;

    (2) The information has been lawfully published or has been officially made available to the public;

    (3) Disclosure of the information is required by a statute other than the FOIA or by a regulation issued in accordance with the requirements of Executive Order 12600 of June 23, 1987; or

    (4) The designation made by the submitter under paragraph (b) of this section appears obviously frivolous, except that, in such a case, the Committee shall give the submitter written notice of any final decision to disclose the information and shall provide that notice within a reasonable number of days prior to a specified disclosure date.

    (e)  (1) The Committee will specify a reasonable time period within which the submitter must respond to the notice referenced above. If a submitter has any objections to disclosure, it should provide the Committee a detailed written statement that specifies all grounds for withholding the particular information under any exemption of the FOIA. In order to rely on Exemption 4 as basis for nondisclosure, the submitter must explain why the information constitutes a trade secret or commercial or financial information that is privileged or confidential.

    (2) A submitter who fails to respond within the time period specified in the notice shall be considered to have no objection to disclosure of the information. Information received by the Committee after the date of any disclosure decision shall not be considered by the Committee. Any information provided by a submitter under this subpart may itself be subject to disclosure under the FOIA.

    (f)  The Committee will consider a submitter's objections and specific grounds for nondisclosure in deciding whether to disclose the requested information.

    (g)  (1) Whenever the Committee decides to disclose information over the objection of a submitter, the Committee will provide the submitter written notice, which will include:

    (i) A statement of the reasons why each of the submitter's disclosure objections was not sustained;

    (ii) A description of the information to be disclosed; and

    (iii) A specified disclosure date, which must be a reasonable time after the notice, and not less than 10 business days after the date of the notice submission.

    (iv) A statement that the submitter must notify the Committee immediately if the submitter intends to seek injunctive relief.

    (2) Notwithstanding paragraph (e)(2) of this section, even if the submitter fails to respond to Committee's notice specified in paragraph (c) of this section, whenever the Committee decides to disclose the commercial information, the Committee will provide the submitter written notice of disclosure, as specified in paragraph (g)(1) of this section.

    (h)  Whenever a requester files a lawsuit seeking to compel the disclosure of confidential commercial information, the Committee will promptly notify the submitter.

    (i)  The Committee will notify the requester whenever it provides the submitter with notice and an opportunity to object to disclosure; whenever it notifies the submitter of its intent to disclose the requested information; and whenever a submitter files a lawsuit to prevent the disclosure of the information.

    § 51-8.8   Administrative Appeals.

#### § § 51-8.8

    (a)  A requester may appeal any adverse determinations to the Committee's Chief FOIA Officer. The contact information for the FOIA Officer is available at the Committee's website, at . Appeals can be submitted through email or the web portal accessible on the FOIA web page. Examples of adverse determinations are provided in § 51-8.6(d). The requester must make the appeal in writing and to be considered timely it must be postmarked, or in the case of electronic submissions, transmitted, within 90 calendar days after the date of the response. The appeal should clearly identify the Committee's determination that is being appealed and the assigned request number. To facilitate handling, the requester should mark both the appeal letter and envelope, or subject line of the electronic transmission, “Freedom of Information Act Appeal.”

    (b)  (1) The Committee Executive Director or designee will act on behalf of the Committee on all appeals under this section.

    (2) An appeal ordinarily will not be adjudicated if the request becomes a matter of FOIA litigation.

    (3) On receipt of any appeal involving classified information, the Committee's Chief FOIA Officer shall take appropriate action to ensure compliance with

    (c)  A decision on an appeal must be made in writing. A decision that upholds a Committee determination will contain a statement that identifies the reasons for the affirmance, including any FOIA exemptions applied. The decision will provide the requester with notification of the statutory right to file a lawsuit and will inform the requester of the mediation services offered by the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) of the National Archives and Records Administration as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation. If a Committee's decision is remanded or modified on appeal, the requester will be notified of that determination in writing. The Committee will thereafter further process the request in accordance with that appeal determination and respond directly to the requester.

    (d)  Mediation is a voluntary process. If the Committee agrees to participate in the mediation services provided by the Office of Government Information Services, it will actively engage as a partner to the process in an attempt to resolve the dispute.

    (e)  Before seeking review by a court of a Committee's adverse determination, a requester generally must first submit a timely administrative appeal.

    § 51-8.9   Preservation of Records.

#### § § 51-8.9

    The Committee will preserve all correspondence pertaining to the requests it receives under this subpart, as well as copies of all requested records, until disposition or destruction is authorized pursuant to Title 44 of the United States Code or the General Records Schedule 4.2 of the National Archives and Records Administration. Records will not be destroyed while they are the subject of a pending request, appeal, or lawsuit under the Act.

    § 51-8.10   Fees.

#### § § 51-8.10

    (a)  The Committee will charge for processing requests under the FOIA in accordance with the provisions of this section and with the OMB Guidelines. In order to resolve any fee issues that arise under this section, the Committee may contact a requester for additional information. The Committee shall ensure that searches, review, and duplication are conducted in the most efficient and the least expensive manner. The Committee will ordinarily collect all applicable fees before sending copies of records to a requester. Requesters must pay fees by check or money order payable to the United States Department of Treasury.

    (b)  For purposes of this section:

    (1)  is a request that asks for information for a use or a purpose that furthers a commercial, trade, or profit interest, which can include furthering those interests through litigation. The Committee's decision to place a requester in the commercial use category will be made on a case-by-case basis based on the requester's intended use of the information.

    (2)  are those expenses that an agency incurs in searching for and duplicating (and, in the case of commercial use requests, reviewing) records in order to respond to a FOIA request. For example, direct costs include the salary of the employee performing the work ( the basic rate of pay for the employee, plus 16 percent of that rate to cover benefits) and the cost of operating computers and other electronic equipment, such as photocopiers and scanners. _Direct costs_ do not include overhead expenses such as the costs of space, and of heating or lighting a facility.

    (3)  is reproducing a copy of a record, or of the information contained in it, necessary to respond to a FOIA request. Copies can take the form of paper, audiovisual materials, or electronic records, among others.

    (4)  is any school that operates a program of scholarly research. A requester in this fee category must show that the request is made in connection with the requester's role at the educational institution. The Committee may seek assurance from the requester that the request is in furtherance of scholarly research and agencies will advise requesters of their placement in this category.

    (5)  is an institution that is not operated on a “commercial” basis, as defined in paragraph (b)(1) of this section and that is operated solely for the purpose of conducting scientific research the results of which are not intended to promote any particular product or industry. A requester in this category must show that the request is authorized by and is made under the auspices of a qualifying institution and that the records are sought to further scientific research and are not for a commercial use.

    (6)  is any person or entity that gathers information of potential interest to a segment of the public, uses its editorial skills to turn the raw materials into a distinct work, and distributes that work to an audience. The term “news” means information that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the public. Examples of news media entities include television or radio stations that broadcast “news” to the public at large and publishers of periodicals that disseminate “news” and make their products available through a variety of means to the general public, including news organizations that disseminate solely on the internet. A request for records supporting the news-dissemination function of the requester shall not be considered to be for a commercial use. “Freelance” journalists who demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication through a news media entity shall be considered as a representative of the news media. A publishing contract would provide the clearest evidence that publication is expected; however, the Committee shall also consider a requester's past publication record in making this determination.

    (7)  is the examination of a record located in response to a request in order to determine whether any portion of it is exempt from disclosure. _Review_ time includes processing any record for disclosure, such as doing all that is necessary to prepare the record for disclosure, including the process of redacting the record and marking the appropriate exemptions. Review costs are properly charged even if a record ultimately is not disclosed. Review time also includes time spent both obtaining and considering any formal objection to disclosure made by a confidential commercial information submitter under § 51-8.7, but it does not include time spent resolving general legal or policy issues regarding the application of exemptions.

    (8)  is the process of looking for and retrieving records or information responsive to a request. _Search_ time includes page-by-page or line-by-line identification of information within records and the reasonable efforts expended to locate and retrieve information from electronic records.

    (c)  In responding to FOIA requests, the Committee will charge the following fees unless a waiver or reduction of fees has been granted under paragraph (k) of this section. Because the fee amounts provided below already account for the direct costs associated with a given fee type, the Committee should not add any additional costs to charges calculated under this section.

    (1)  (i) Requests made by educational institutions, noncommercial scientific institutions, or representatives of the news media are not subject to search fees. The Committee will charge search fees for all other requesters, subject to the restrictions of paragraph (d) of this section. The Committee may properly charge for time spent searching even if responsive records are not located or if the Committee determines that the records are entirely exempt from disclosure.

    (ii) For each quarter hour spent by personnel searching for requested records, including electronic searches that do not require new programming, the fees shall be as follows: Professional—$10.00; and clerical/administrative—$4.75.

    (iii) Requesters shall be charged the direct costs associated with conducting any search that requires the creation of a new computer program to locate the requested records. Requesters shall be notified of the costs associated with creating such a program and must agree to pay the associated costs before the costs may be incurred.

    (iv) For requests that require the retrieval of records stored by an agency at a Federal records center operated by the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), additional costs shall be charged in accordance with the Transactional Billing Rate Schedule established by NARA.

    (2)  Duplication fees shall be charged to all requesters, subject to the restrictions of paragraph (d) of this section. The Committee shall honor a requester's preference for receiving a record in a particular form or format where it is readily reproducible by the Committee in the form or format requested. Where photocopies are supplied, agencies will provide one copy per request at the cost of 25¢ per page. For copies of records produced on tapes, disks, or other media, the Committee will charge the direct costs of producing the copy, including operator time. Where paper documents must be scanned in order to comply with a requester's preference to receive the records in an electronic format, the requester shall also pay the direct costs associated with scanning those materials. For other forms of duplication, agencies will charge the direct costs.

    (3)  The Committee will charge review fees to requesters who make commercial use requests. Review fees will be assessed in connection with the initial review of the record,  the review conducted by the Committee to determine whether an exemption applies to a particular record or portion of a record. No charge will be made for review at the administrative appeal stage of exemptions applied at the initial review stage. However, if a particular exemption is deemed to no longer apply, any costs associated with the Committee's re-review of the records in order to consider the use of other exemptions may be assessed as review fees. Review fees will be charged at the same rates as those charged for a search under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section.

    (d)  (1) No search fees will be charged for requests by educational institutions (unless the records are sought for a commercial use), noncommercial scientific institutions, or representatives of the news media.

    (2)(i) If the Committee fails to comply with the FOIA's time limits in which to respond to a request, it may not charge search fees, or, in the instances of requests from requesters described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, may not charge duplication fees, except as described in paragraphs (d)(2)(ii) through (iv) of this section.

    (ii) If the Committee has determined that unusual circumstances, as defined by the FOIA, apply and the Committee provided timely written notice to the requester in accordance with the FOIA, a failure to comply with the time limit shall be excused for an additional 10 days.

    (iii) If the Committee has determined that unusual circumstances, as defined by the FOIA, apply and more than 5,000 pages are necessary to respond to the request, the Committee may charge search fees, or, in the case of requesters described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, may charge duplication fees if the following steps are taken. The Committee must have provided timely written notice of unusual circumstances to the requester in accordance with the FOIA and the Committee must have discussed with the requester via written mail, email, or telephone (or made not less than three good-faith attempts to do so) how the requester could effectively limit the scope of the request in accordance with 5. U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(B)(ii). If this exception is satisfied, the Committee may charge all applicable fees incurred in the processing of the request.

    (iv) If a court has determined that exceptional circumstances exist, as defined by the FOIA, a failure to comply with the time limits shall be excused for the length of time provided by the court order.

    (3) No search or review fees will be charged for a quarter-hour period unless more than half of that period is required for search or review.

    (4) Except for requesters seeking records for a commercial use, Committee shall provide without charge:

    (i) The first 100 pages of duplication (or the cost equivalent for other media); and

    (ii) The first two hours of search.

    (5) No fee will be charged when the total fee, after deducting the 100 free pages (or its cost equivalent) and the first two hours of search, is equal to or less than $25.

    (e)  (1) When the Committee determines or estimates that the fees to be assessed in accordance with this section will exceed $25.00, the requesting party will be notified of the actual or estimated amount of the fees, including a breakdown of the fees for search, review or duplication, unless a written statement from the requester has been received indicating a willingness to pay fees as high as those anticipated. If only a portion of the fee can be readily estimated, the Committee shall advise the requester accordingly. If the requester is a noncommercial use requester, the notice shall specify that the requester is entitled to the statutory entitlements of 100 pages of duplication at no charge and, if the requester is charged search fees, two hours of search time at no charge, and shall advise the requester whether those entitlements have been provided.

    (2) If the Committee notifies the requester that the actual or estimated fees are in excess of $25.00, the request will not be considered received and further work will not be completed until the requester commits in writing to pay the actual or estimated total fee, or designates some amount of fees the requester is willing to pay, or, in the case of a noncommercial use, requester who has not yet been provided with the requester's statutory entitlements, designates that the requester seeks only that which can be provided by the statutory entitlements. The requester must provide the commitment or designation in writing, and must, when applicable, designate an exact dollar amount the requester is willing to pay. The Committee is not required to accept payments in installments.

    (3) If the requester has indicated a willingness to pay some designated amount of fees, but the Committee estimates that the total fee will exceed that amount, the Committee will toll the processing of the request when it notifies the requester of the estimated fees in excess of the amount the requester has indicated a willingness to pay. The Committee will inquire whether the requester wishes to revise the amount of fees the requester is willing to pay or modify the request. Once the requester responds, the time to respond will resume from where it was at the date of the notification.

    (4) The Committee will make available the FOIA Public Liaison or other personnel to assist any requester in reformulating a request to meet the requester's needs at a lower cost.

    (f)  Although not required to provide special services, if the Committee chooses to do so as a matter of administrative discretion, the direct costs of providing the service will be charged. Examples of such services include certifying that records are true copies, providing multiple copies of the same document, or sending records by means other than first class mail.

    (g)  The Committee may charge interest on any unpaid bill for processing FOIA requests starting on the 31st day following the date of billing the requester. Interest rates will be assessed at the rate provided in 31 U.S.C. 3717 and will accrue from the billing date until payment is received by the Committee.

    (h)  When the Committee reasonably believes that a requester or a group of requesters acting in concert is attempting to divide a single request into a series of requests for the purpose of avoiding fees, the Committee may aggregate those requests and charge accordingly. The Committee may presume that multiple requests of this type made within a 30-day period have been made in order to avoid fees. For requests separated by a longer period, the Committee will aggregate them only where there is a reasonable basis for determining that aggregating the requests is warranted in view of all the circumstances involved. Multiple requests involving unrelated matters shall not be aggregated.

    (i)  (1) For requests other than those described in paragraphs (i)(2) or (i)(3) of this section, the Committee shall not require the requester to make an advance payment before work is commenced or continued on a request. Payment owed for work already completed ( payment before copies are sent to a requester) is not an advance payment.

    (2) When the Committee determines or estimates that a total fee to be charged under this section will exceed $250.00, it may require that the requester make an advance payment up to the amount of the entire anticipated fee before beginning to process the request. The Committee may elect to process the request prior to collecting fees when it receives a satisfactory assurance of full payment from a requester with a history of prompt payment.

    (3) Where a requester has previously failed to pay a properly charged FOIA fee within 30 calendar days of the billing date, the Committee may require that the requester pay the full amount due, plus any applicable interest on that prior request, and the Committee may require that the requester make an advance payment of the full amount of any anticipated fee before the Committee begins to process a new request or continues to process a pending request or any pending appeal. Where the Committee has a reasonable basis to believe that a requester has misrepresented the requester's identity in order to avoid paying outstanding fees, it may require that the requester provide proof of identity.

    (4) In cases in which the Committee requires advance payment, the request will not be considered received and further work will not be completed until the required payment is received. If the requester does not pay the advance payment within 30 calendar days after the date of the Committee's fee determination, the request will be closed.

    (j)  The fee schedule of this section does not apply to fees charged under any statute that specifically requires an agency to set and collect fees for particular types of records. In instances where records responsive to a request are subject to a statutorily-based fee schedule program, the Committee shall inform the requester of the contact information for that program.

    (k)  (1) Requesters may seek a waiver of fees by submitting a written application demonstrating how disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.

    (2) The Committee will furnish records responsive to a request without charge or at a reduced rate when it determines, based on all available information, that the factors described in paragraphs (k)(2)(i) through (ii) of this section are satisfied:

    (i) Disclosure of the requested information would shed light on the operations or activities of the government. The subject of the request must concern identifiable operations or activities of the Federal Government with a connection that is direct and clear, not remote or attenuated.

    (ii) Disclosure of the requested information is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of those operations or activities. This factor is satisfied when the following criteria are met:

    (A) Disclosure of the requested records must be meaningfully informative about the Committee operations or activities. The disclosure of information that already is in the public domain, in either the same or a substantially identical form, would not be meaningfully informative if nothing new would be added to the public's understanding.

    (B) The disclosure must contribute to the understanding of a reasonably broad audience of persons interested in the subject, as opposed to the individual understanding of the requester. A requester's expertise in the subject area as well as the requester's ability and intention to effectively convey information to the public must be considered. The Committee ordinarily will presume that a representative of the news media will satisfy this consideration.

    (iii) The disclosure must not be primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. To determine whether disclosure of the requested information is primarily in the commercial interest of the requester, the Committee will consider the following criteria:

    (A) The Committee must identify whether the requester has any commercial interest that would be furthered by the requested disclosure. A commercial interest includes any commercial, trade, or for profit interest. Requesters must be given an opportunity to provide explanatory information regarding this consideration.

    (B) If there is an identified commercial interest, the Committee must determine whether that is the primary interest furthered by the request. A waiver or reduction of fees is justified when the requirements of paragraphs (k)(2)(i) through (ii) of this section are satisfied and any commercial interest is not the primary interest furthered by the request. The Committee ordinarily will presume that when a news media requester has satisfied the requirements of paragraphs (k)(2)(i) through (ii) of this section, the request is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. Disclosure to data brokers or others who merely compile and market government information for direct economic return will not be presumed to primarily serve the public interest.

    (3) Where only some of the records to be released satisfy the requirements for a waiver of fees, a waiver shall be granted for those records.

    (4) Requests for a waiver or reduction of fees should be made when the request is first submitted to the Committee and should address the criteria referenced above. A requester may submit a fee waiver request at a later time as long as the underlying record request is pending or on administrative appeal. When a requester who has committed to pay fees subsequently asks for a waiver of those fees and that waiver is denied, the requester must pay any costs incurred up to the date the fee waiver request was received.

    Subpart 51-9.6—Exemptions

      § 51-9.601   Office of Inspector General exemptions.

#### § § 51-9.601

      (a) Pursuant to section (j) of the Privacy Act of 1974, the Committee has deemed it necessary to adopt the following exemptions to specified provisions of the Privacy Act:

      (1) Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2), the AbilityOne/OIG-001 Case Management System, System of Records is exempt from the following provisions of the Privacy Act: 5 U.S.C. 552a (c)(3)-(4); (d); (e)(1)-(3); (e)(4)(G)-(I); (e)(5); (e)(8); and (f)-(g) and from 41 CFR 51-9.1, 51-9.2, 51-9.3, 51-9.4, and 51-9.7.

      (2) [Reserved]

      (b) Pursuant to section (k) of the Privacy Act of 1974, the Committee has deemed it necessary to adopt the following exemptions to specified provisions of the Privacy Act:

      (1) Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2), AbilityOne/OIG-001 Case Management System, System of Records is exempt from the following provisions of the Privacy Act, subject to the limitations set forth in those subsections: 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3), (d), (e)(4)(G)-(I), and (f) and from 41 CFR 51-9.1, 51-9.2, 51-9.3, 51-9.4, and 51-9.7.

      (2) [Reserved]

      (c) Exemptions from the subsections are justified because application of these provisions would present a serious impediment to law enforcement. Access to the records contained in this system of records could inform the subject of an investigation of an actual or potential criminal, civil, or regulatory violation, of the existence of that investigation; of the nature and scope of the information and evidence obtained as to his activities; of the identity of confidential sources, witnesses, and law enforcement personnel, and of information that may enable the subject to avoid detection or apprehension. These factors would present a serious impediment to effective law enforcement where they prevent the successful completion of the investigation, endanger the physical safety of confidential sources, witnesses, and law enforcement personnel, and/or lead to the improper influencing of witnesses, the destruction of evidence, or the fabrication of testimony. In addition, granting access to such information could disclose security-sensitive or confidential business information or information that would constitute an unwarranted invasion of the personal privacy of third parties. Finally, access to the records could result in the release of properly classified information which would compromise the national defense or disrupt foreign policy. Amendment of the records would interfere with ongoing investigations and law enforcement activities and impose an impossible administrative burden by requiring investigations to be continuously reinvestigated. It is not possible to detect relevance or necessity of specific information in the early stages of a civil, criminal or other law enforcement investigation, case, or matter, including investigations in which use is made of properly classified information. Relevance and necessity are questions of judgment and timing, and it is only after the information is evaluated that the relevance and necessity of such information can be established.

#### § § 51-10.140

    No qualified handicapped person shall, on the basis of handicap, be subjected to discrimination in employment under any program or activity conducted by the agency. The definitions, requirements, and procedures of section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 791), as established by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 29 CFR part 1613, shall apply to employment in federally conducted programs or activities.

    § 51-10.149   Program accessibility: Discrimination prohibited.

#### § § 51-10.149

    Except as otherwise provided in § 51-10.150, no qualified handicapped person shall, because the agency's facilities are inaccessible to or unusable by handicapped persons, be denied the benefits of, be excluded from participation in, or otherwise be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity conducted by the agency.

    § 51-10.150   Program accessibility: Existing facilities.

#### § § 51-10.150

    (a)  The agency shall operate each program or activity so that the program or activity, when viewed in its entirety, is readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. This paragraph does not—

    (1) Necessarily require the agency to make each of its existing facilities accessible to and usable by handicapped persons;

    (2) In the case of historic preservation programs, require the agency to take any action that would result in a substantial impairment of significant historic features of an historic property; or

    (3) Require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with § 51-10.150(a) would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that handicapped persons receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.

    (b) —(1)  The agency may comply with the requirements of this section through such means as redesign of equipment, reassignment of the services to accessible buildings, assignment of aides to beneficiaries, home visits, delivery of services at alternate accessible sites, alteration of existing facilities and construction of new facilities, use of accessible rolling stock, or any other methods that result in making its programs or activities readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. The agency is not required to make structural changes in existing facilities where other methods are effective in achieving compliance with this section. The agency, in making alterations to existing buildings, shall meet accessibility requirements to the extent compelled by the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), and any regulations implementing it. In choosing among available methods for meeting the requirements of this section, the agency shall give priority to those methods that offer programs and activities to qualified handicapped persons in the most integrated setting appropriate.

    (2)  In meeting the requirements of § 51-10.150(a) in historic preservation programs, the agency shall give priority to methods that provide physical access to handicapped persons. In cases where a physical alteration to an historic property is not required because of § 51-10.150(a)(2) or (a)(3), alternative methods of achieving program accessibility include—

    (i) Using audio-visual materials and devices to depict those portions of an historic property that cannot otherwise be made accessible;

    (ii) Assigning persons to guide handicapped persons into or through portions of historic properties that cannot otherwise be made accessible; or

    (iii) Adopting other innovative methods.

    (c)  The agency shall comply with the obligations established under this section by October 21, 1986, except that where structural changes in facilities are undertaken, such changes shall be made by August 22, 1989, but in any event as expeditiously as possible.

    (d)  In the event that structural changes to facilities will be undertaken to achieve program accessibility, the agency shall develop, by February 23, 1987 months after the effective date], a transition plan setting forth the steps necessary to complete such changes. The agency shall provide an opportunity to interested persons, including handicapped persons or organizations representing handicapped persons, to participate in the development of the transition plan by submitting comments (both oral and written). A copy of the transition plan shall be made available for public inspection. The plan shall, at a minimum—

    (1) Identify physical obstacles in the agency's facilities that limit the accessibility of its programs or activities to handicapped persons;

    (2) Describe in detail the methods that will be used to make the facilities accessible;

    (3) Specify the schedule for taking the steps necessary to achieve compliance with this section and, if the time period of the transition plan is longer than one year, identify steps that will be taken during each year of the transition period; and

    (4) Indicate the official responsible for implementation of the plan.

    § 51-10.151   Program accessibility: New construction and alterations.

#### § § 51-10.151

    Each building or part of a building that is constructed or altered by, on behalf of, or for the use of the agency shall be designed, constructed, or altered so as to be readily accessible to and usable by handicapped persons. The definitions, requirements, and standards of the Architectural Barriers Act (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157), as established in 41 CFR 101-19.600 to 101-19.607, apply to buildings covered by this section.

    (1) The agency shall furnish appropriate auxiliary aids where necessary to afford a handicapped person an equal opportunity to participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, a program or activity conducted by the agency.

    (i) In determining what type of auxiliary aid is necessary, the agency shall give primary consideration to the requests of the handicapped person.

    (ii) The agency need not provide individually prescribed devices, readers for personal use or study, or other devices of a personal nature.

    (2) Where the agency communicates with applicants and beneficiaries by telephone, telecommunication devices for deaf person (TDD's) or equally effective telecommunication systems shall be used.

    (b) The agency shall ensure that interested persons, including persons with impaired vision or hearing, can obtain information as to the existence and location of accessible services, activities, and facilities.

    (c) The agency shall provide signage at a primary entrance to each of its inaccessible facilities, directing users to a location at which they can obtain information about accessible facilities. The international symbol for accessibility shall be used at each primary entrance of an accessible facility.

    (d) This section does not require the agency to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and adminstrative burdens. In those circumstances where agency personnel believe that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the agency has the burden of proving that compliance with § 51-10.160 would result in such alteration or burdens. The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the agency head or his or her designee after considering all agency resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action required to comply with this section would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the agency shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that, to the maximum extent possible, handicapped persons receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.

    (a) Written demands directed to the Committee or requests for official records, information or testimony shall be served in accordance with the requirements of the Federal Rules of Civil or Criminal Procedure, or applicable State procedures, as appropriate. If the demand is served by U.S. mail, it should be addressed to the General Counsel, Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled, 1401 S. Clark Street, Suite 715, Arlington, VA 22202. The Committee's acceptance of service of a demand shall not constitute an admission or waiver of any objection with respect to the propriety of jurisdiction, service of process, venue or any other defense in law or equity available under applicable law.

    (b) If any doubt exists, whether a demand relates to purely personal matters or arises out of the performance of official duties, copies of the demand may be delivered to the General Counsel for such determination.

    § 51-11.6   Filing requirements for demands for documents or testimony.

#### § § 51-11.6

    Compliance with the following requirements is required when issuing demands or requests for official records, information or testimony.

    (a) Requests must be in writing and must be submitted to the General Counsel. If a subpoena is served on the Committee or a Committee employee before submitting a written request and receiving a final determination, the Committee will object to the subpoena on grounds that it was not submitted in accordance with this part.

    (b) Written requests must contain the following information:

    (1) The caption of the legal proceeding, docket number, and name and address of the court or other authority involved;

    (2) A copy of the complaint or equivalent document setting forth the assertions in the case and any other pleading or document necessary to show the relevance of the information sought;

    (3) A detailed description of how the information sought is relevant to the issues in the legal proceeding, and a specific description of the substance of the testimony or records sought;

    (4) A statement as to how the need for the information outweighs the need to maintain any confidentiality of the information and outweighs the burden on the Committee to produce the records or provide testimony;

    (5) A statement indicating that the information sought is not available from another source, from other persons or entities, or from the testimony of someone other than a Committee employee, such as a retained expert;

    (6) If testimony is requested, the intended use of the testimony, a general summary of the desired testimony, and a showing that no document could be provided and used in lieu of testimony;

    (7) A description of all prior decisions, orders, or pending motions in the case that bear upon the relevance of the requested records or testimony;

    (8) The name, address, and telephone number of counsel to each party in the case; and

    (9) An estimate of the amount of time that the requester and other parties will require with each Committee employee for time spent by the employee to prepare for testimony, in travel, and for attendance at the legal proceeding.

    (c) The Committee reserves the right to require additional information to complete any request where appropriate.

    (d) Requests should be submitted at least 45 calendar days before the date that records or testimony is required. Requests submitted in less than 45 calendar days before records or testimony is required must be accompanied by a written explanation stating the reasons for the late request and the reasons for expedited processing.

    (e) Failure to cooperate in good faith to enable the General Counsel to make an informed decision may serve as the basis for a determination not to comply with the request.

    § 51-11.7   Factors the Committee will consider.

#### § § 51-11.7

    The General Counsel in his or her sole discretion, may grant an employee permission to testify on matters relating to official information, or produce official records and information, in response to an appropriate demand or request. Among the relevant factors that the General Counsel may consider in making this decision are whether:

    (b) Allowing such testimony or production of records would be necessary to prevent a miscarriage of justice;

    (c) The Committee has an interest in the decision that may be rendered in the legal proceeding;

    (e) Allowing such testimony or production of records would be in the best interest of the Committee or the United States;

    (f) The records or testimony can be obtained from other sources;

    (g) The demand or request is unduly burdensome or otherwise inappropriate under the applicable rules of discovery or the rules of procedure governing the case or matter in which the demand or request arose;

    (h) Disclosure would violate a statute, Executive order or regulation;

    (i) Disclosure would reveal confidential, sensitive, or privileged information, trade secrets or similar, confidential commercial or financial information, otherwise protected information, or would otherwise be inappropriate for release;

    (j) Disclosure would impede or interfere with an ongoing law enforcement investigation or proceedings, or compromise constitutional rights;

    (k) Disclosure would result in the Committee appearing to favor one private litigant over another private litigant;

    (l) Disclosure relates to documents that originate from another agency;

    (m) A substantial Government interest is implicated;

    (n) The demand or request is within the authority of the party making it;

    (o) The demand improperly seeks to compel a Committee employee to serve as an expert witness for a private interest;

    (p) The demand improperly seeks to compel a Committee employee to testify as to a matter of law; and/or

    (q) The demand or request is sufficiently specific to be answered.

    § 51-11.8   Processing demands or requests.

#### § § 51-11.8

    (a) After service of a demand or request, the General Counsel will review the demand or request and, in accordance with the provisions of this part, determine whether, or under what conditions, to authorize an employee to testify on matters relating to Committee records and/or produce records.

    (c) The General Counsel may grant a waiver of any procedure described by this part where a waiver is considered necessary to promote a significant interest of the Committee or the United States or for other good cause.

    § 51-11.9   Final determination.

#### § § 51-11.9

    The General Counsel makes the final determination on demands and requests for production of official records and information or testimony. All final determinations are within the sole discretion of the General Counsel. The General Counsel will notify the requester and the court or other authority of the final determination, the reasons for the grant or denial of the demand or request, and any conditions that the General Counsel may impose on the release of records or information, or on the testimony of a Committee employee.

    § 51-11.10   Restrictions that apply to testimony.

#### § § 51-11.10

    (a) Conditions or restrictions may be imposed on the testimony of the Committee employees including, for example, limiting the areas of testimony or requiring the requester and other parties to the legal proceeding to agree that they will seek to file the transcript of the testimony under seal and that it will be used or made available only in the particular legal proceeding for which testimony was requested. The General Counsel may also require a copy of the transcript or testimony be provided to the Committee at the requester's expense.

    (b) The Committee may offer the employee's written declaration in lieu of testimony.

    (c) If authorized to testify pursuant to this part, an employee may testify as to facts within his or her personal knowledge, but, unless specifically authorized to do so by the General Counsel, the employee shall not:

    (1) Disclose confidential or privileged information;

    (2) Testify as to any information outside the scope of the General Counsel's authorization ( § 51-11.7); or

    (3) For a current Committee employee, testify as an expert or opinion witness with regard to any matter arising out of the employee's official duties or the functions of the Committee unless testimony is being given on behalf of the United States whether or not the United States is a party.

    § 51-11.11   Restrictions that apply to released records.

#### § § 51-11.11

    (a) The General Counsel may impose conditions or restrictions on the release of official records and information, including the requirement that parties to the proceeding obtain a protective order or execute a confidentiality agreement to limit access and any further disclosure. The terms of the protective order or of a confidentiality agreement must be acceptable to the General Counsel. In cases where protective orders or confidentiality agreements have already been executed, the Committee may condition the release of official records and information on an amendment to the existing protective order or confidentiality agreement.

    (b) If the General Counsel so determines, original Committee records may be presented for examination in response to a demand or request, but they are not to be presented as evidence or otherwise used in a manner by which they could lose their identity as official Committee records, and they are not to be marked or altered. In lieu of the original records, certified copies will be presented for evidentiary purposes.

    § 51-11.12   Procedure when a decision is not made prior to the time a response is required.

#### § § 51-11.12

    If a response to a demand or request is required before the General Counsel can make the determination previously referred to, the General Counsel when necessary, will provide the court or other competent authority with a copy of this part, inform the court or other competent authority that the demand or request is being reviewed, and seek a stay of the demand or request pending a final determination.

    § 51-11.13   Procedure in the event of an adverse ruling.

#### § § 51-11.13

    If the court or other competent authority fails to stay the demand, the employee upon whom the demand or request is made, unless otherwise advised by the General Counsel, will appear at the stated time and place, produce a copy of this part, state that the employee has not been authorized to provide the requested testimony or produce documents, and respectfully decline to comply with the demand, citing  v.  340 U.S. 462 (1951). A written response may be offered to a request, or to a demand, if permitted by the court or other competent authority.

    § 51-11.14   Fees.

#### § § 51-11.14

    (a)  The General Counsel may condition the production of records or appearance for testimony upon advance payment of a reasonable estimate of the costs to the Committee.

    (b)  Fees for producing records will include fees for searching, reviewing, and duplicating records, costs of attorney time spent in reviewing the demand or request, and expenses generated by materials and equipment used to search for, produce, and copy the responsive information. Costs for employee time will be calculated on the basis of the hourly pay of the employee (including all pay, allowance, and benefits). Fees for duplication will be the same as those charged by the Committee in its Freedom of Information Act regulations at 41 CFR part 51-8.

    (c)  Fees for attendance by a witness will include fees, expenses, and allowances prescribed by the court's rules. If no such fees are prescribed, witness fees will be determined based upon the rule of the Federal district court closest to the location where the witness will appear. Such fees will include cost of time spent by the witness to prepare for testimony, travel time and expenses, and for attendance in the legal proceeding.

    (d)  Witness fees for current Committee employees and any records certification fees shall be paid by check or money order presented to the Committee made payable to the United States Department of Treasury. Applicable fees for former Committee employees' testimony must be paid directly to the former employee in accordance with 28 U.S.C. 1821 or other applicable statutes.

    (e)  The Committee Records Manager may certify that records are true copies in order to facilitate their use as evidence. Certification requests require 45 calendar days for processing and a fee of $15.00 for each document certified.

    (f)  The General Counsel, in his or her sole discretion, may, upon a showing of reasonable cause, waive or reduce any fees in connection with the testimony, production, or certification of records.

    (g)  Fees will not be assessed if the total charge would be $10.00 or less.

    § 51-11.15   Penalties.

#### § § 51-11.15

    (a) An employee who discloses official records or information or gives testimony relating to official information, except as expressly authorized by the Committee, or as ordered by a Federal court after the Committee has had the opportunity to be heard, may face the penalties provided in 18 U.S.C. 641 and other applicable laws. Additionally, former Committee employees are subject to the restrictions and penalties of 18 U.S.C. 207 and 216.

    (b) A current Committee employee who testifies or produces official records and information in violation of this part may be subject to disciplinary action.
