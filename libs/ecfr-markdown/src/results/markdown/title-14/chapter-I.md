        § 120.107   Substances for which testing must be conducted.

#### § § 120.107

        Each employer shall test each employee who performs a safety-sensitive function for evidence of a prohibited drug during each test required by § 120.109.

> [84 FR 16773, Apr. 23, 2019]

        § 120.109   Types of drug testing required.

#### § § 120.109

        Each employer shall conduct the types of testing described in this section in accordance with the procedures set forth in this subpart and the DOT “Procedures for Transportation Workplace Drug Testing Programs” (49 CFR part 40).

        (a)  (1) No employer may hire any individual for a safety-sensitive function listed in § 120.105 unless the employer first conducts a pre-employment test and receives a verified negative drug test result for that individual.

        (2) No employer may allow an individual to transfer from a nonsafety-sensitive to a safety-sensitive function unless the employer first conducts a pre-employment test and receives a verified negative drug test result for the individual.

        (3) Employers must conduct another pre-employment test and receive a verified negative drug test result before hiring or transferring an individual into a safety-sensitive function if more than 180 days elapse between conducting the pre-employment test required by paragraphs (a)(1) or (2) of this section and hiring or transferring the individual into a safety-sensitive function, resulting in that individual being brought under an FAA drug testing program.

        (4) If the following criteria are met, an employer is permitted to conduct a pre-employment test, and if such a test is conducted, the employer must receive a negative test result before putting the individual into a safety-sensitive function:

        (i) The individual previously performed a safety-sensitive function for the employer and the employer is not required to pre-employment test the individual under paragraphs (a)(1) or (2) of this section before putting the individual to work in a safety-sensitive function;

        (ii) The employer removed the individual from the employer's random testing program conducted under this subpart for reasons other than a verified positive test result on an FAA-mandated drug test or a refusal to submit to such testing; and

        (iii) The individual will be returning to the performance of a safety-sensitive function.

        (5) Before hiring or transferring an individual to a safety-sensitive function, the employer must advise each individual that the individual will be required to undergo pre-employment testing in accordance with this subpart, to determine the presence of a prohibited drug in the individual's system. The employer shall provide this same notification to each individual required by the employer to undergo pre-employment testing under paragraph (a)(4) of this section.

        (b)  (1) Except as provided in paragraphs (b)(2) through (b)(4) of this section, the minimum annual percentage rate for random drug testing shall be 50 percent of covered employees.

        (2) The Administrator's decision to increase or decrease the minimum annual percentage rate for random drug testing is based on the reported positive rate for the entire industry. All information used for this determination is drawn from the statistical reports required by § 120.119. In order to ensure reliability of the data, the Administrator considers the quality and completeness of the reported data, may obtain additional information or reports from employers, and may make appropriate modifications in calculating the industry positive rate. Each year, the Administrator will publish in the  the minimum annual percentage rate for random drug testing of covered employees. The new minimum annual percentage rate for random drug testing will be applicable starting January 1 of the calendar year following publication.

        (3) When the minimum annual percentage rate for random drug testing is 50 percent, the Administrator may lower this rate to 25 percent of all covered employees if the Administrator determines that the data received under the reporting requirements of this subpart for two consecutive calendar years indicate that the reported positive rate is less than 1.0 percent.

        (4) When the minimum annual percentage rate for random drug testing is 25 percent, and the data received under the reporting requirements of this subpart for any calendar year indicate that the reported positive rate is equal to or greater than 1.0 percent, the Administrator will increase the minimum annual percentage rate for random drug testing to 50 percent of all covered employees.

        (5) The selection of employees for random drug testing shall be made by a scientifically valid method, such as a random-number table or a computer-based random number generator that is matched with employees' Social Security numbers, payroll identification numbers, or other comparable identifying numbers. Under the selection process used, each covered employee shall have an equal chance of being tested each time selections are made.

        (6) As an employer, you must select and test a percentage of employees at least equal to the minimum annual percentage rate each year.

        (i) As an employer, to determine whether you have met the minimum annual percentage rate, you must divide the number of random testing results for safety-sensitive employees by the average number of safety-sensitive employees eligible for random testing.

        (A) To calculate whether you have met the annual minimum percentage rate, count all random positives, random negatives, and random refusals as your “random testing results.”

        (B) To calculate the average number of safety-sensitive employees eligible for random testing throughout the year, add the total number of safety-sensitive employees eligible for testing during each random testing period for the year and divide that total by the number of random testing periods. Only safety-sensitive employees are to be in an employer's random testing pool, and all safety-sensitive employees must be in the random pool. If you are an employer conducting random testing more often than once per month (e.g., you select daily, weekly, bi-weekly) you do not need to compute this total number of safety-sensitive employees more than on a once per month basis.

        (ii) As an employer, you may use a service agent to perform random selections for you, and your safety-sensitive employees may be part of a larger random testing pool of safety-sensitive employees. However, you must ensure that the service agent you use is testing at the appropriate percentage established for your industry and that only safety-sensitive employees are in the random testing pool. For example:

        (A) If the service agent has your employees in a random testing pool for your company alone, you must ensure that the testing is conducted at least at the minimum annual percentage rate under this part.

        (B) If the service agent has your employees in a random testing pool combined with other FAA-regulated companies, you must ensure that the testing is conducted at least at the minimum annual percentage rate under this part.

        (C) If the service agent has your employees in a random testing pool combined with other DOT-regulated companies, you must ensure that the testing is conducted at least at the highest rate required for any DOT-regulated company in the pool.

        (7) Each employer shall ensure that random drug tests conducted under this subpart are unannounced and that the dates for administering random tests are spread reasonably throughout the calendar year.

        (8) Each employer shall require that each safety-sensitive employee who is notified of selection for random drug testing proceeds to the collection site immediately; provided, however, that if the employee is performing a safety-sensitive function at the time of the notification, the employer shall instead ensure that the employee ceases to perform the safety-sensitive function and proceeds to the collection site as soon as possible.

        (9) If a given covered employee is subject to random drug testing under the drug testing rules of more than one DOT agency, the employee shall be subject to random drug testing at the percentage rate established for the calendar year by the DOT agency regulating more than 50 percent of the employee's function.

        (10) If an employer is required to conduct random drug testing under the drug testing rules of more than one DOT agency, the employer may—

        (i) Establish separate pools for random selection, with each pool containing the covered employees who are subject to testing at the same required rate; or

        (ii) Randomly select covered employees for testing at the highest percentage rate established for the calendar year by any DOT agency to which the employer is subject.

        (11) An employer required to conduct random drug testing under the anti-drug rules of more than one DOT agency shall provide each such agency access to the employer's records of random drug testing, as determined to be necessary by the agency to ensure the employer's compliance with the rule.

        (c)  Each employer shall test each employee who performs a safety-sensitive function for the presence of a prohibited drug in the employee's system if that employee's performance either contributed to an accident or cannot be completely discounted as a contributing factor to the accident. The employee shall be tested as soon as possible but not later than 32 hours after the accident. The decision not to administer a test under this section must be based on a determination, using the best information available at the time of the determination, that the employee's performance could not have contributed to the accident. The employee shall submit to post-accident testing under this section.

        (d)  Each employer must test each employee who performs a safety-sensitive function and who is reasonably suspected of having used a prohibited drug. The decision to test must be based on a reasonable and articulable belief that the employee is using a prohibited drug on the basis of specific contemporaneous physical, behavioral, or performance indicators of probable drug use. At least two of the employee's supervisors, one of whom is trained in detection of the symptoms of possible drug use, must substantiate and concur in the decision to test an employee who is reasonably suspected of drug use; except that in the case of an employer, other than a part 121 certificate holder, who employs 50 or fewer employees who perform safety-sensitive functions, one supervisor who is trained in detection of symptoms of possible drug use must substantiate the decision to test an employee who is reasonably suspected of drug use.

        (e)  Each employer shall ensure that before an individual is returned to duty to perform a safety-sensitive function after refusing to submit to a drug test required by this subpart or receiving a verified positive drug test result on a test conducted under this subpart the individual shall undergo a return-to-duty drug test. No employer shall allow an individual required to undergo return-to-duty testing to perform a safety-sensitive function unless the employer has received a verified negative drug test result for the individual. The test cannot occur until after the SAP has determined that the employee has successfully complied with the prescribed education and/or treatment.

        (f)  (1) Each employer shall implement a reasonable program of unannounced testing of each individual who has been hired to perform or who has been returned to the performance of a safety-sensitive function after refusing to submit to a drug test required by this subpart or receiving a verified positive drug test result on a test conducted under this subpart.

        (2) The number and frequency of such testing shall be determined by the employer's Substance Abuse Professional conducted in accordance with the provisions of 49 CFR part 40, but shall consist of at least six tests in the first 12 months following the employee's return to duty.

        (a) The employer shall designate or appoint a Medical Review Officer (MRO) who shall be qualified in accordance with 49 CFR part 40 and shall perform the functions set forth in 49 CFR part 40 and this subpart. If the employer does not have a qualified individual on staff to serve as MRO, the employer may contract for the provision of MRO services as part of its drug testing program.

        (b)  The MRO must perform the functions set forth in subpart G of 49 CFR part 40, and subpart E of this part. The MRO shall not delay verification of the primary test result following a request for a split specimen test unless such delay is based on reasons other than the fact that the split specimen test result is pending. If the primary test result is verified as positive, actions required under this rule (e.g., notification to the Federal Air Surgeon, removal from safety-sensitive position) are not stayed during the 72-hour request period or pending receipt of the split specimen test result.

        (c)  The SAP must perform the functions set forth in 49 CFR part 40, subpart O.

        (d)  (1) As part of verifying a confirmed positive test result or refusal to submit to a test, the MRO must ask and the individual must answer whether he or she holds an airman medical certificate issued under 14 CFR part 67 or would be required to hold an airman medical certificate to perform a safety-sensitive function for the employer. If the individual answers in the affirmative to either question, in addition to notifying the employer in accordance with 49 CFR part 40, the MRO must forward to the Federal Air Surgeon, at the address listed in paragraph (d)(5) of this section, the name of the individual, along with identifying information and supporting documentation, within 2 working days after verifying a positive drug test result or refusal to submit to a test.

If the individual answers in the affirmative, the individual must obtain an airman medical certificate issued by the Federal Air Surgeon dated after the verified positive drug test result date or refusal to test date. After the individual obtains this airman medical certificate, the SAP may recommend to the employer that the individual may be returned to a safety-sensitive position. The receipt of an airman medical certificate does not alter any obligations otherwise required by 49 CFR part 40 or this subpart.

        (3) An employer must forward to the Federal Air Surgeon within 2 working days of receipt, copies of all reports provided to the employer by a SAP regarding the following:

        (i) An individual who the MRO has reported to the Federal Air Surgeon under § 120.113 (d)(1); or

        (ii) An individual who the employer has reported to the Federal Air Surgeon under § 120.111(d).

        (4) The employer must not permit an employee who is required to hold an airman medical certificate under 14 CFR part 67 to perform a safety-sensitive duty to resume that duty until the employee has:

        (i) Been issued an airman medical certificate from the Federal Air Surgeon after the date of the verified positive drug test result or refusal to test; and

        (ii) Met the return to duty requirements in accordance with 49 CFR part 40.

        (5) Reports required under this section shall be forwarded to the Federal Air Surgeon, Federal Aviation Administration, Office of Aerospace Medicine, Attn: Drug Abatement Division (AAM-800), 800 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20591.

        (6) MROs, SAPs, and employers who send reports to the Federal Air Surgeon must keep a copy of each report for 5 years.

        § 120.217   Tests required.

#### § § 120.217

        (a)  As an employer, you may, but are not required to, conduct pre-employment alcohol testing under this subpart. If you choose to conduct pre-employment alcohol testing, you must comply with the following requirements:

        (1) You must conduct a pre-employment alcohol test before the first performance of safety-sensitive functions by every covered employee (whether a new employee or someone who has transferred to a position involving the performance of safety-sensitive functions).

        (2) You must treat all safety-sensitive employees performing safety-sensitive functions the same for the purpose of pre-employment alcohol testing (, you must not test some covered employees and not others).

        (3) You must conduct the pre-employment tests after making a contingent offer of employment or transfer, subject to the employee passing the pre-employment alcohol test.

        (4) You must conduct all pre-employment alcohol tests using the alcohol testing procedures of 49 CFR part 40.

        (5) You must not allow a covered employee to begin performing safety-sensitive functions unless the result of the employee's test indicates an alcohol concentration of less than 0.04. If a pre-employment test result under this paragraph indicates an alcohol concentration of 0.02 or greater but less than 0.04, the provisions of § 120.221(f) apply.

        (b)  (1) As soon as practicable following an accident, each employer shall test each surviving covered employee for alcohol if that employee's performance of a safety-sensitive function either contributed to the accident or cannot be completely discounted as a contributing factor to the accident. The decision not to administer a test under this section shall be based on the employer's determination, using the best available information at the time of the determination, that the covered employee's performance could not have contributed to the accident.

        (2) If a test required by this section is not administered within 2 hours following the accident, the employer shall prepare and maintain on file a record stating the reasons the test was not promptly administered. If a test required by this section is not administered within 8 hours following the accident, the employer shall cease attempts to administer an alcohol test and shall prepare and maintain the same record. Records shall be submitted to the FAA upon request of the Administrator or his or her designee.

        (3) A covered employee who is subject to post-accident testing shall remain readily available for such testing or may be deemed by the employer to have refused to submit to testing. Nothing in this section shall be construed to require the delay of necessary medical attention for injured people following an accident or to prohibit a covered employee from leaving the scene of an accident for the period necessary to obtain assistance in responding to the accident or to obtain necessary emergency medical care.

        (c)  (1) Except as provided in paragraphs (c)(2) through (c)(4) of this section, the minimum annual percentage rate for random alcohol testing will be 25 percent of the covered employees.

        (2) The Administrator's decision to increase or decrease the minimum annual percentage rate for random alcohol testing is based on the violation rate for the entire industry. All information used for this determination is drawn from MIS reports required by this subpart. In order to ensure reliability of the data, the Administrator considers the quality and completeness of the reported data, may obtain additional information or reports from employers, and may make appropriate modifications in calculating the industry violation rate. Each year, the Administrator will publish in the  the minimum annual percentage rate for random alcohol testing of covered employees. The new minimum annual percentage rate for random alcohol testing will be applicable starting January 1 of the calendar year following publication.

        (3)(i) When the minimum annual percentage rate for random alcohol testing is 25 percent or more, the Administrator may lower this rate to 10 percent of all covered employees if the Administrator determines that the data received under the reporting requirements of this subpart for two consecutive calendar years indicate that the violation rate is less than 0.5 percent.

        (ii) When the minimum annual percentage rate for random alcohol testing is 50 percent, the Administrator may lower this rate to 25 percent of all covered employees if the Administrator determines that the data received under the reporting requirements of this subpart for two consecutive calendar years indicate that the violation rate is less than 1.0 percent but equal to or greater than 0.5 percent.

        (4)(i) When the minimum annual percentage rate for random alcohol testing is 10 percent, and the data received under the reporting requirements of this subpart for that calendar year indicate that the violation rate is equal to or greater than 0.5 percent but less than 1.0 percent, the Administrator will increase the minimum annual percentage rate for random alcohol testing to 25 percent of all covered employees.

        (ii) When the minimum annual percentage rate for random alcohol testing is 25 percent or less, and the data received under the reporting requirements of this subpart for that calendar year indicate that the violation rate is equal to or greater than 1.0 percent, the Administrator will increase the minimum annual percentage rate for random alcohol testing to 50 percent of all covered employees.

        (5) The selection of employees for random alcohol testing shall be made by a scientifically valid method, such as a random-number table or a computer-based random number generator that is matched with employees' Social Security numbers, payroll identification numbers, or other comparable identifying numbers. Under the selection process used, each covered employee shall have an equal chance of being tested each time selections are made.

        (6) As an employer, you must select and test a percentage of employees at least equal to the minimum annual percentage rate each year.

        (i) As an employer, to determine whether you have met the minimum annual percentage rate, you must divide the number of random alcohol screening test results for safety-sensitive employees by the average number of safety-sensitive employees eligible for random testing.

        (A) To calculate whether you have met the annual minimum percentage rate, count all random screening test results below 0.02 breath alcohol concentration, random screening test results of 0.02 or greater breath alcohol concentration, and random refusals as your “random alcohol screening test results.”

        (B) To calculate the average number of safety-sensitive employees eligible for random testing throughout the year, add the total number of safety-sensitive employees eligible for testing during each random testing period for the year and divide that total by the number of random testing periods. Only safety-sensitive employees are to be in an employer's random testing pool, and all safety-sensitive employees must be in the random pool. If you are an employer conducting random testing more often than once per month (e.g., you select daily, weekly, bi-weekly) you do not need to compute this total number of safety-sensitive employees more than on a once per month basis.

        (ii) As an employer, you may use a service agent to perform random selections for you, and your safety-sensitive employees may be part of a larger random testing pool of safety-sensitive employees. However, you must ensure that the service agent you use is testing at the appropriate percentage established for your industry and that only safety-sensitive employees are in the random testing pool. For example:

        (A) If the service agent has your employees in a random testing pool for your company alone, you must ensure that the testing is conducted at least at the minimum annual percentage rate under this part.

        (B) If the service agent has your employees in a random testing pool combined with other FAA-regulated companies, you must ensure that the testing is conducted at least at the minimum annual percentage rate under this part.

        (C) If the service agent has your employees in a random testing pool combined with other DOT-regulated companies, you must ensure that the testing is conducted at least at the highest rate required for any DOT-regulated company in the pool.

        (7) Each employer shall ensure that random alcohol tests conducted under this subpart are unannounced and that the dates for administering random tests are spread reasonably throughout the calendar year.

        (8) Each employer shall require that each covered employee who is notified of selection for random testing proceeds to the testing site immediately; provided, however, that if the employee is performing a safety-sensitive function at the time of the notification, the employer shall instead ensure that the employee ceases to perform the safety-sensitive function and proceeds to the testing site as soon as possible.

        (9) A covered employee shall only be randomly tested while the employee is performing safety-sensitive functions; just before the employee is to perform safety-sensitive functions; or just after the employee has ceased performing such functions.

        (10) If a given covered employee is subject to random alcohol testing under the alcohol testing rules of more than one DOT agency, the employee shall be subject to random alcohol testing at the percentage rate established for the calendar year by the DOT agency regulating more than 50 percent of the employee's functions.

        (11) If an employer is required to conduct random alcohol testing under the alcohol testing rules of more than one DOT agency, the employer may—

        (i) Establish separate pools for random selection, with each pool containing the covered employees who are subject to testing at the same required rate; or

        (ii) Randomly select such employees for testing at the highest percentage rate established for the calendar year by any DOT agency to which the employer is subject.

        (d)  (1) An employer shall require a covered employee to submit to an alcohol test when the employer has reasonable suspicion to believe that the employee has violated the alcohol misuse prohibitions in §§ 120.19 or 120.37.

        (2) The employer's determination that reasonable suspicion exists to require the covered employee to undergo an alcohol test shall be based on specific, contemporaneous, articulable observations concerning the appearance, behavior, speech or body odors of the employee. The required observations shall be made by a supervisor who is trained in detecting the symptoms of alcohol misuse. The supervisor who makes the determination that reasonable suspicion exists shall not conduct the breath alcohol test on that employee.

        (3) Alcohol testing is authorized by this section only if the observations required by paragraph (d)(2) of this section are made during, just preceding, or just after the period of the work day that the covered employee is required to be in compliance with this rule. An employee may be directed by the employer to undergo reasonable suspicion testing for alcohol only while the employee is performing safety-sensitive functions; just before the employee is to perform safety-sensitive functions; or just after the employee has ceased performing such functions.

        (4)(i) If a test required by this section is not administered within 2 hours following the determination made under paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the employer shall prepare and maintain on file a record stating the reasons the test was not promptly administered. If a test required by this section is not administered within 8 hours following the determination made under paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the employer shall cease attempts to administer an alcohol test and shall state in the record the reasons for not administering the test.

        (ii) Notwithstanding the absence of a reasonable suspicion alcohol test under this section, no covered employee shall report for duty or remain on duty requiring the performance of safety-sensitive functions while the employee is under the influence of, or impaired by, alcohol, as shown by the behavioral, speech, or performance indicators of alcohol misuse, nor shall an employer permit the covered employee to perform or continue to perform safety-sensitive functions until:

        (A) An alcohol test is administered and the employee's alcohol concentration measures less than 0.02; or

        (B) The start of the employee's next regularly scheduled duty period, but not less than 8 hours following the determination made under paragraph (d)(2) of this section that there is reasonable suspicion that the employee has violated the alcohol misuse provisions in §§ 120.19 or 120.37.

        (iii) No employer shall take any action under this subpart against a covered employee based solely on the employee's behavior and appearance in the absence of an alcohol test. This does not prohibit an employer with authority independent of this subpart from taking any action otherwise consistent with law.

        (e)  Each employer shall ensure that before a covered employee returns to duty requiring the performance of a safety-sensitive function after engaging in conduct prohibited in §§ 120.19 or 120.37 the employee shall undergo a return-to-duty alcohol test with a result indicating an alcohol concentration of less than 0.02. The test cannot occur until after the SAP has determined that the employee has successfully complied with the prescribed education and/or treatment.

        (f)  (1) Each employer shall ensure that the employee who engages in conduct prohibited by §§ 120.19 or 120.37, is subject to unannounced follow-up alcohol testing as directed by a SAP.

        (2) The number and frequency of such testing shall be determined by the employer's SAP, but must consist of at least six tests in the first 12 months following the employee's return to duty.

        (3) The employer must direct the employee to undergo testing for drugs in accordance with subpart E of this part, in addition to alcohol, if the SAP determines that drug testing is necessary for the particular employee. Any such drug testing shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of 49 CFR part 40.

        (4) Follow-up testing shall not exceed 60 months after the date the individual begins to perform, or returns to the performance of, a safety-sensitive function. The SAP may terminate the requirement for follow-up testing at any time after the first six tests have been conducted, if the SAP determines that such testing is no longer necessary.

        (5) A covered employee shall be tested for alcohol under this section only while the employee is performing safety-sensitive functions, just before the employee is to perform safety-sensitive functions, or just after the employee has ceased performing such functions.

        (g)  Each employer shall retest a covered employee to ensure compliance with the provisions of § 120.221(f) if the employer chooses to permit the employee to perform a safety-sensitive function within 8 hours following the administration of an alcohol test indicating an alcohol concentration of 0.02 or greater but less than 0.04.

        § 120.219   Handling of test results, record retention, and confidentiality.

        § 120.221   Consequences for employees engaging in alcohol-related conduct.

#### § § 120.221

        (a)  (1) Except as provided in 49 CFR part 40, no covered employee shall perform safety-sensitive functions if the employee has engaged in conduct prohibited by §§ 120.19 or 120.37, or an alcohol misuse rule of another DOT agency.

        (2) No employer shall permit any covered employee to perform safety-sensitive functions if the employer has determined that the employee has violated this section.

        (b)  (1) An employee who violates §§ 120.19(c) or 120.37(c) is permanently precluded from performing for an employer the safety-sensitive duties the employee performed before such violation.

        (2) An employee who engages in alcohol use that violates another alcohol misuse provision of §§ 120.19 or 120.37, and who had previously engaged in alcohol use that violated the provisions of §§ 120.19 or 120.37 after becoming subject to such prohibitions, is permanently precluded from performing for an employer the safety-sensitive duties the employee performed before such violation.

        (c)  (1) An employer who determines that a covered employee who holds an airman medical certificate issued under part 67 of this chapter has engaged in alcohol use that violated the alcohol misuse provisions of §§ 120.19 or 120.37 shall notify the Federal Air Surgeon within 2 working days.

        (2) Each such employer shall forward to the Federal Air Surgeon a copy of the report of any evaluation performed under the provisions of § 120.223(c) within 2 working days of the employer's receipt of the report.

        (3) All documents must be sent to the Federal Air Surgeon, Federal Aviation Administration, Office of Aerospace Medicine, Attn: Drug Abatement Division (AAM-800), 800 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20591.

        (4) No covered employee who is required to hold an airman medical certificate in order to perform a safety-sensitive duty may perform that duty following a violation of this subpart until the covered employee obtains an airman medical certificate issued by the Federal Air Surgeon dated after the alcohol test result or refusal to test date. After the covered employee obtains this airman medical certificate, the SAP may recommend to the employer that the covered employee may be returned to a safety-sensitive position. The receipt of an airman medical certificate does not alter any obligations otherwise required by 49 CFR part 40 or this subpart.

        (5) Once the Federal Air Surgeon has recommended under paragraph (c)(4) of this section that the employee be permitted to perform safety-sensitive duties, the employer cannot permit the employee to perform those safety-sensitive duties until the employer has ensured that the employee meets the return to duty requirements in accordance with 49 CFR part 40.

        (d)  Each covered employer must notify the FAA within 2 working days of any covered employee who holds a certificate issued under part 61, part 63, or part 65 of this chapter who has refused to submit to an alcohol test required under this subpart. Notification must be sent to: Federal Aviation Administration, Office of Aerospace Medicine, Drug Abatement Division (AAM-800), 800 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20591, or by fax to (202) 267-5200.

        (e)  No covered employee who has engaged in conduct prohibited by §§ 120.19 or 120.37 shall perform safety-sensitive functions unless the employee has met the requirements of 49 CFR part 40. No employer shall permit a covered employee who has engaged in such conduct to perform safety-sensitive functions unless the employee has met the requirements of 49 CFR part 40.

        (f)  (1) No covered employee tested under this subpart who is found to have an alcohol concentration of 0.02 or greater but less than 0.04 shall perform or continue to perform safety-sensitive functions for an employer, nor shall an employer permit the employee to perform or continue to perform safety-sensitive functions, until:

        (i) The employee's alcohol concentration measures less than 0.02; or

        (ii) The start of the employee's next regularly scheduled duty period, but not less than 8 hours following administration of the test.

        (2) Except as provided in paragraph (f)(1) of this section, no employer shall take any action under this rule against an employee based solely on test results showing an alcohol concentration less than 0.04. This does not prohibit an employer with authority independent of this rule from taking any action otherwise consistent with law.

        (i) The employer shall ensure that a copy of these materials is distributed to each covered employee prior to the start of alcohol testing under the employer's FAA-mandated alcohol testing program and to each individual subsequently hired for or transferred to a covered position.

        (ii) Each employer shall provide written notice to representatives of employee organizations of the availability of this information.

        (2)  The materials to be made available to employees shall include detailed discussion of at least the following:

        (i) The identity of the individual designated by the employer to answer employee questions about the materials.

        (ii) The categories of employees who are subject to the provisions of these alcohol testing requirements.

        (iii) Sufficient information about the safety-sensitive functions performed by those employees to make clear what period of the work day the covered employee is required to be in compliance with these alcohol testing requirements.

        (iv) Specific information concerning employee conduct that is prohibited by this chapter.

        (v) The circumstances under which a covered employee will be tested for alcohol under this subpart.

        (vi) The procedures that will be used to test for the presence of alcohol, protect the employee and the integrity of the breath testing process, safeguard the validity of the test results, and ensure that those results are attributed to the correct employee.

        (vii) The requirement that a covered employee submit to alcohol tests administered in accordance with this subpart.

        (viii) An explanation of what constitutes a refusal to submit to an alcohol test and the attendant consequences.

        (ix) The consequences for covered employees found to have violated the prohibitions in this chapter, including the requirement that the employee be removed immediately from performing safety-sensitive functions, and the process in 49 CFR part 40, subpart O.

        (x) The consequences for covered employees found to have an alcohol concentration of 0.02 or greater but less than 0.04.

        (xi) Information concerning the effects of alcohol misuse on an individual's health, work, and personal life; signs and symptoms of an alcohol problem; available methods of evaluating and resolving problems associated with the misuse of alcohol; and intervening when an alcohol problem is suspected, including confrontation, referral to any available employee assistance program, and/or referral to management.

        (xii) Optional provisions. The materials supplied to covered employees may also include information on additional employer policies with respect to the use or possession of alcohol, including any consequences for an employee found to have a specified alcohol level, that are based on the employer's authority independent of this subpart. Any such additional policies or consequences must be clearly and obviously described as being based on independent authority.

        (b)  Each employer shall ensure that persons designated to determine whether reasonable suspicion exists to require a covered employee to undergo alcohol testing under § 120.217(d) of this subpart receive at least 60 minutes of training on the physical, behavioral, speech, and performance indicators of probable alcohol misuse.

        (c)  The SAP must perform the functions set forth in 49 CFR part 40, subpart O, and this subpart.

        § 121.171   Applicability.

#### § § 121.171

        (a) This subpart prescribes airplane performance operating limitations for all certificate holders.

        (b) For purposes of this part,  for landing means the distance from the point at which the obstruction clearance plane associated with the approach end of the runway intersects the centerline of the runway to the far end thereof.

        (c) For the purposes of this subpart,  means a plane sloping upward from the runway at a slope of 1:20 to the horizontal, and tangent to or clearing all obstructions within a specified area surrounding the runway as shown in a profile view of that area. In the plan view, the centerline of the specified area coincides with the centerline of the runway, beginning at the point where the _obstruction clearance plane_ intersects the centerline of the runway and proceeding to a point at least 1,500 feet from the beginning point. Thereafter the centerline coincides with the takeoff path over the ground for the runway (in the case of takeoffs) or with the instrument approach counterpart (for landings), or, where the applicable one of these paths has not been established, it proceeds consistent with turns of at least 4,000 foot radius until a point is reached beyond which the obstruction clearance plane clears all obstructions. This area extends laterally 200 feet on each side of the centerline at the point where the obstruction clearance plane intersects the runway and continues at this width to the end of the runway; then it increases uniformly to 500 feet on each side of the centerline at a point 1,500 feet from the intersection of the obstruction clearance plane with the runway; thereafter it extends laterally 500 feet on each side of the centerline.

#### § § 121.173

        (a) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, each certificate holder operating a reciprocating-engine-powered airplane shall comply with §§ 121.175 through 121.187.

        (b) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, each certificate holder operating a turbine-engine-powered airplane shall comply with the applicable provisions of §§ 121.189 through 121.197, except that when it operates—

        (1) A turbo-propeller-powered airplane type certificated after August 29, 1959, but previously type certificated with the same number of reciprocating engines, the certificate holder may comply with §§ 121.175 through 121.187; or

        (2) Until December 20, 2010, a turbo-propeller-powered airplane described in § 121.157(f), the certificate holder may comply with the applicable performance requirements of appendix K of this part.

        (c) Each certificate holder operating a large nontransport category airplane type certificated before January 1, 1965, shall comply with §§ 121.199 through 121.205 and any determination of compliance must be based only on approved performance data.

        (d) The performance data in the Airplane Flight Manual applies in determining compliance with §§ 121.175 through 121.197. Where conditions are different from those on which the performance data is based, compliance is determined by interpolation or by computing the effects of changes in the specific variables if the results of the interpolation or computations are substantially as accurate as the results of direct tests.

        (e) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, no person may take off a reciprocating-engine-powered airplane at a weight that is more than the allowable weight for the runway being used (determined under the runway takeoff limitations of the operating rules of 14 CFR part 121, subpart I) after taking into account the temperature operating correction factors in the applicable Airplane Flight Manual.

        (f) The Administrator may authorize in the operations specifications deviations from the requirements in the subpart if special circumstances make a literal observance of a requirement unnecessary for safety.

        (g) The ten-mile width specified in §§ 121.179 through 121.183 may be reduced to five miles, for not more than 20 miles, when operating VFR or where navigation facilities furnish reliable and accurate identification of high ground and obstructions located outside of five miles, but within ten miles, on each side of the intended track.

        (1) To stop the airplane safely on the runway, as shown by the accelerate stop distance data, at any time during takeoff until reaching critical-engine failure speed;

        (2) If the critical engine fails at any time after the airplane reaches critical-engine failure speed , to continue the takeoff and reach a height of 50 feet, as indicated by the takeoff path data, before passing over the end of the runway; and

        (3) To clear all obstacles either by at least 50 feet vertically (as shown by the takeoff path data) or 200 feet horizontally within the airport boundaries and 300 feet horizontally beyond the boundaries, without banking before reaching a height of 50 feet (as shown by the takeoff path data) and thereafter without banking more than 15 degrees.

        (b) In applying this section, corrections must be made for the effective runway gradient. To allow for wind effect, takeoff data based on still air may be corrected by taking into account not more than 50 percent of any reported headwind component and not less than 150 percent of any reported tailwind component.

        § 121.181   Airplanes: Reciprocating engine-powered: En route limitations: One engine inoperative.

#### § § 121.181

        (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, no person operating a reciprocating engine powered airplane may take off that airplane at a weight, allowing for normal consumption of fuel and oil, that does not allow a rate of climb (in feet per minute), with one engine inoperative, of at least

        (b) In place of the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section, a person may, under an approved procedure, operate a reciprocating engine powered airplane, at an all-engines-operating altitude that allows the airplane to continue, after an engine failure, to an alternate airport where a landing can be made in accordance with § 121.187, allowing for normal consumption of fuel and oil. After the assumed failure, the flight path must clear the ground and any obstruction within five miles on each side of the intended track by at least 2,000 feet.

        (c) If an approved procedure under paragraph (b) of this section is used, the certificate holder shall comply with the following:

        (1) The rate of climb (as prescribed in the Airplane Flight Manual for the appropriate weight and altitude) used in calculating the airplane's flight path shall be diminished by an amount, in feet per minute, equal to

        (2) The all-engines-operating altitude shall be sufficient so that in the event the critical engine becomes inoperative at any point along the route, the flight will be able to proceed to a predetermined alternate airport by use of this procedure. In determining the takeoff weight, the airplane is assumed to pass over the critical obstruction following engine failure at a point no closer to the critical obstruction than the nearest approved radio navigational fix, unless the Administrator approves a procedure established on a different basis upon finding that adequate operational safeguards exist.

        (3) The airplane must meet the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section at 1,000 feet above the airport used as an alternate in this procedure.

        (4) The procedure must include an approved method of accounting for winds and temperatures that would otherwise adversely affect the flight path.

        (5) In complying with this procedure fuel jettisoning is allowed if the certificate holder shows that it has an adequate training program, that proper instructions are given to the flight crew, and all other precautions are taken to insure a safe procedure.

        (6) The certificate holder shall specify in the dispatch or flight release an alternate airport that meets the requirements of § 121.625.

        (d) This section does not apply to large nontransport category airplanes operated under § 121.173(c).

        § 121.183   Part 25 airplanes with four or more engines: Reciprocating engine powered: En route limitations: Two engines inoperative.

#### § § 121.183

        (a) No person may operate an airplane certificated under part 25 and having four or more engines unless—

        (1) There is no place along the intended track that is more than 90 minutes (with all engines operating at cruising power) from an airport that meets the requirements of § 121.187; or

        (2) It is operated at a weight allowing the airplane, with the two critical engines inoperative, to climb at 0.013 V2 feet per minute (that is, the number of feet per minute is obtained by multiplying the number of knots squared by 0.013) at an altitude of 1,000 feet above the highest ground or obstruction within 10 miles on each side of the intended track, or at an altitude of 5,000 feet, whichever is higher.

        (b) For the purposes of paragraph (a)(2) of this section, it is assumed that—

        (1) The two engines fail at the point that is most critical with respect to the takeoff weight:

        (2) Consumption of fuel and oil is normal with all engines operating up to the point where the two engines fail and with two engines operating beyond that point;

        (3) Where the engines are assumed to fail at an altitude above the prescribed minimum altitude, compliance with the prescribed rate of climb at the prescribed minimum altitude need not be shown during the descent from the cruising altitude to the prescribed minimum altitude, if those requirements can be met once the prescribed minimum altitude is reached, and assuming descent to be along a net flight path and the rate of descent to be 0.013 V2 greater than the rate in the approved performance data; and

        (4) If fuel jettisoning is provided, the airplane's weight at the point where the two engines fail is considered to be not less than that which would include enough fuel to proceed to an airport meeting the requirements of § 121.187 and to arrive at an altitude of at least 1,000 feet directly over that airport.

        § 121.185   Airplanes: Reciprocating engine-powered: Landing limitations: Destination airport.

#### § § 121.185

        (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section no person operating a reciprocating engine powered airplane may take off that airplane, unless its weight on arrival, allowing for normal consumption of fuel and oil in flight, would allow a full stop landing at the intended destination within 60 percent of the effective length of each runway described below from a point 50 feet directly above the intersection of the obstruction clearance plane and the runway. For the purposes of determining the allowable landing weight at the destination airport the following is assumed:

        (1) The airplane is landed on the most favorable runway and in the most favorable direction in still air.

        (2) The airplane is landed on the most suitable runway considering the probable wind velocity and direction (forecast for the expected time of arrival), the ground handling characteristics of the type of airplane, and other conditions such as landing aids and terrain, and allowing for the effect of the landing path and roll of not more than 50 percent of the headwind component or not less than 150 percent of the tailwind component.

        (b) An airplane that would be prohibited from being taken off because it could not meet the requirements of paragraph (a)(2) of this section may be taken off if an alternate airport is specified that meets all of the requirements of this section except that the airplane can accomplish a full stop landing within 70 percent of the effective length of the runway.

        (c) This section does not apply to large nontransport category airplanes operated under § 121.173(c).

#### § § 121.187

        (a) No person may list an airport as an alternate airport in a dispatch or flight release unless the airplane (at the weight anticipated at the time of arrival at the airport), based on the assumptions in § 121.185, can be brought to a full stop landing, within 70 percent of the effective length of the runway.

        § 121.189   Airplanes: Turbine engine powered: Takeoff limitations.

#### § § 121.189

        (a) No person operating a turbine engine powered airplane may take off that airplane at a weight greater than that listed in the Airplane Flight Manual for the elevation of the airport and for the ambient temperature existing at takeoff.

        (b) No person operating a turbine engine powered airplane certificated after August 26, 1957, but before August 30, 1959 (SR422, 422A), may take off that airplane at a weight greater than that listed in the Airplane Flight Manual for the minimum distances required for takeoff. In the case of an airplane certificated after September 30, 1958 (SR422A, 422B), the takeoff distance may include a clearway distance but the clearway distance included may not be greater than   of the takeoff run.

        (c) No person operating a turbine engine powered airplane certificated after August 29, 1959 (SR422B), may take off that airplane at a weight greater than that listed in the Airplane Flight Manual at which compliance with the following may be shown:

        (1) The accelerate-stop distance must not exceed the length of the runway plus the length of any stopway.

        (2) The takeoff distance must not exceed the length of the runway plus the length of any clearway except that the length of any clearway included must not be greater than one-half the length of the runway.

        (3) The takeoff run must not be greater than the length of the runway.

        (d) No person operating a turbine engine powered airplane may take off that airplane at a weight greater than that listed in the Airplane Flight Manual—

        (1) In the case of an airplane certificated after August 26, 1957, but before October 1, 1958 (SR422), that allows a takeoff path that clears all obstacles either by at least (35 + 0.01D) feet vertically (D is the distance along the intended flight path from the end of the runway in feet), or by at least 200 feet horizontally within the airport boundaries and by at least 300 feet horizontally after passing the boundaries; or

        (2) In the case of an airplane certificated after September 30, 1958 (SR 422A, 422B), that allows a net takeoff flight path that clears all obstacles either by a height of at least 35 feet vertically, or by at least 200 feet horizontally within the airport boundaries and by at least 300 feet horizontally after passing the boundaries.

        (e) In determining maximum weights, minimum distances, and flight paths under paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section, correction must be made for the runway to be used, the elevation of the airport, the effective runway gradient, the ambient temperature and wind component at the time of takeoff, and, if operating limitations exist for the minimum distances required for takeoff from wet runways, the runway surface condition (dry or wet). Wet runway distances associated with grooved or porous friction course runways, if provided in the Airplane Flight Manual, may be used only for runways that are grooved or treated with a porous friction course (PFC) overlay, and that the operator determines are designed, constructed, and maintained in a manner acceptable to the Administrator.

        (f) For the purposes of this section, it is assumed that the airplane is not banked before reaching a height of 50 feet, as shown by the takeoff path or net takeoff flight path data (as appropriate) in the Airplane Flight Manual, and thereafter that the maximum bank is not more than 15 degrees.

        (g) For the purposes of this section the terms,  and  have the same meanings as set forth in the rules under which the airplane was certificated.

        § 121.191   Airplanes: Turbine engine powered: En route limitations: One engine inoperative.

#### § § 121.191

        (a) No person operating a turbine engine powered airplane may take off that airplane at a weight, allowing for normal consumption of fuel and oil, that is greater than that which (under the approved, one engine inoperative, en route net flight path data in the Airplane Flight Manual for that airplane) will allow compliance with paragraph (a) (1) or (2) of this section, based on the ambient temperatures expected en route:

        (1) There is a positive slope at an altitude of at least 1,000 feet above all terrain and obstructions within five statute miles on each side of the intended track, and, in addition, if that airplane was certificated after August 29, 1959 (SR 422B) there is a positive slope at 1,500 feet above the airport where the airplane is assumed to land after an engine fails.

        (2) The net flight path allows the airplane to continue flight from the cruising altitude to an airport where a landing can be made under § 121.197, clearing all terrain and obstructions within five statute miles of the intended track by at least 2,000 feet vertically and with a positive slope at 1,000 feet above the airport where the airplane lands after an engine fails, or, if that airplane was certificated after September 30, 1958 (SR 422A, 422B), with a positive slope at 1,500 feet above the airport where the airplane lands after an engine fails.

        (b) For the purposes of paragraph (a)(2) of this section, it is assumed that—

        (1) The engine fails at the most critical point en route;

        (2) The airplane passes over the critical obstruction, after engine failure at a point that is no closer to the obstruction than the nearest approved radio navigation fix, unless the Administrator authorizes a different procedure based on adequate operational safeguards;

        (3) An approved method is used to allow for adverse winds:

        (4) Fuel jettisoning will be allowed if the certificate holder shows that the crew is properly instructed, that the training program is adequate, and that all other precautions are taken to insure a safe procedure;

        (5) The alternate airport is specified in the dispatch or flight release and meets the prescribed weather minimums; and

        (6) The consumption of fuel and oil after engine failure is the same as the consumption that is allowed for in the approved net flight path data in the Airplane Flight Manual.

#### § § 121.195

        (a) No person operating a turbine engine powered airplane may take off that airplane at such a weight that (allowing for normal consumption of fuel and oil in flight to the destination or alternate airport) the weight of the airplane on arrival would exceed the landing weight set forth in the Airplane Flight Manual for the elevation of the destination or alternate airport and the ambient temperature anticipated at the time of landing.

        (b) Except as provided in paragraph (c), (d), or (e) of this section, no person operating a turbine engine powered airplane may take off that airplane unless its weight on arrival, allowing for normal consumption of fuel and oil in flight (in accordance with the landing distance set forth in the Airplane Flight Manual for the elevation of the destination airport and the wind conditions anticipated there at the time of landing), would allow a full stop landing at the intended destination airport within 60 percent of the effective length of each runway described below from a point 50 feet above the intersection of the obstruction clearance plane and the runway. For the purpose of determining the allowable landing weight at the destination airport the following is assumed:

        (1) The airplane is landed on the most favorable runway and in the most favorable direction, in still air.

        (2) The airplane is landed on the most suitable runway considering the probable wind velocity and direction and the ground handling characteristics of the airplane, and considering other conditions such as landing aids and terrain.

#### § § 121.201

        (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, no person operating a nontransport category airplane may take off that airplane at a weight that does not allow a rate of climb of at least 50 feet a minute, with the critical engine inoperative, at an altitude of at least 1,000 feet above the highest obstruction within five miles on each side of the intended track, or 5,000 feet, whichever is higher.

        (b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, if the Administrator finds that safe operations are not impaired, a person may operate the airplane at an altitude that allows the airplane, in case of engine failure, to clear all obstructions within 5 miles on each side of the intended track by 1,000 feet. If this procedure is used, the rate of descent for the appropriate weight and altitude is assumed to be 50 feet a minute greater than the rate in the approved performance data. Before approving such a procedure, the Administrator considers the following for the route, route segment, or area concerned:

        (1) The reliability of wind and weather forecasting.

        (2) The location and kinds of navigation aids.

        (3) The prevailing weather conditions, particularly the frequency and amount of turbulence normally encountered.

        (5) Air traffic control problems.

        (6) Any other operational factors that affect the operation.

        (c) For the purposes of this section, it is assumed that—

        (1) The critical engine is inoperative;

        (2) The propeller of the inoperative engine is in the minimum drag position;

        (3) The wing flaps and landing gear are in the most favorable position;

        (4) The operating engines are operating at the maximum continuous power available;

        (5) The airplane is operating in standard atmosphere; and

        (6) The weight of the airplane is progressively reduced by the anticipated consumption of fuel and oil.

#### § § 121.203

        (a) No person operating a nontransport category airplane may take off that airplane at a weight that—

        (1) Allowing for anticipated consumption of fuel and oil, is greater than the weight that would allow a full stop landing within 60 percent of the effective length of the most suitable runway at the destination airport; and

        (2) Is greater than the weight allowable if the landing is to be made on the runway—

        (i) With the greatest effective length in still air; and

        (ii) Required by the probable wind, taking into account not more than 50 percent of the headwind component or not less than 150 percent of the tailwind component.

        (b) For the purposes of this section, it is assumed that—

        (1) The airplane passes directly *o*ver the intersection of the obstruction clearance plane and the runway at a height of 50 feet in a steady gliding approach at a true indicated airspeed of at least 1.3 ;

        § 121.310   Additional emergency equipment.

#### § § 121.310

        (a)  Each passenger-carrying landplane emergency exit (other than over-the-wing) that is more than 6 feet from the ground with the airplane on the ground and the landing gear extended, must have an approved means to assist the occupants in descending to the ground. The assisting means for a floor-level emergency exit must meet the requirements of § 25.809(f)(1) of this chapter in effect on April 30, 1972, except that, for any airplane for which the application for the type certificate was filed after that date, it must meet the requirements under which the airplane was type certificated. An assisting means that deploys automatically must be armed during taxiing, takeoffs, and landings. However, if the Administrator finds that the design of the exit makes compliance impractical, he may grant a deviation from the requirement of automatic deployment if the assisting means automatically erects upon deployment and, with respect to required emergency exits, if an emergency evacuation demonstration is conducted in accordance with § 121.291(a). This paragraph does not apply to the rear window emergency exit of DC-3 airplanes operated with less than 36 occupants, including crewmembers and less than five exits authorized for passenger use.

        (b)  The following must be complied with for each passenger-carrying airplane:

        (1) Each passenger emergency exit, its means of access, and its means of opening must be conspicuously marked. The identity and location of each passenger emergency exit must be recognizable from a distance equal to the width of the cabin. The location of each passenger emergency exit must be indicated by a sign visible to occupants approaching along the main passenger aisle. There must be a locating sign—

        (i) Above the aisle near each over-the-wing passenger emergency exit, or at another ceiling location if it is more practical because of low headroom;

        (ii) Next to each floor level passenger emergency exit, except that one sign may serve two such exits if they both can be seen readily from that sign; and

        (iii) On each bulkhead or divider that prevents fore and aft vision along the passenger cabin, to indicate emergency exits beyond and obscured by it, except that if this is not possible the sign may be placed at another appropriate location.

        (2) Each passenger emergency exit marking and each locating sign must meet the following:

        (i) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section, for an airplane for which the application for the type certificate was filed prior to May 1, 1972, each passenger emergency exit marking and each locating sign must be manufactured to meet the requirements of § 25.812(b) of this chapter in effect on April 30, 1972. On these airplanes, no sign may continue to be used if its luminescence (brightness) decreases to below 100 microlamberts. The colors may be reversed if it increases the emergency illumination of the passenger compartment. However, the Administrator may authorize deviation from the 2-inch background requirements if he finds that special circumstances exist that make compliance impractical and that the proposed deviation provides an equivalent level of safety.

        (ii) For a transport category airplane for which the application for the type certificate was filed on or after May 1, 1972, each passenger emergency exit marking and each locating sign must be manufactured to meet the interior emergency exit marking requirements under which the airplane was type certificated. On these airplanes, no sign may continue to be used if its luminescence (brightness) decreases to below 250 microlamberts.

        (iii) For a nontransport category turbopropellerpowered airplane type certificated after December 31, 1964, each passenger emergency exit marking and each locating sign must be manufactured to have white letters 1 inch high on a red background 2 inches high, be self-illuminated or independently, internally electrically illuminated, and have a minimum brightness of at least 160 microlamberts. The color may be reversed if the passenger compartment illumination is essentially the same. On these airplanes, no sign may continue to be used if its luminescence (brightness) decreases to below 100 microlamberts.

        (c)  Except for nontransport category airplanes type certificated after December 31, 1964, each passenger-carrying airplane must have an emergency lighting system, independent of the main lighting system. However, sources of general cabin illumination may be common to both the emergency and the main lighting systems if the power supply to the emergency lighting system is independent of the power supply to the main lighting system.

        The emergency lighting system must—

        (1) Illuminate each passenger exit marking and locating sign;

        (2) Provide enough general lighting in the passenger cabin so that the average illumination when measured at 40-inch intervals at seat armrest height, on the centerline of the main passenger aisle, is at least 0.05 foot-candles; and

        (3) For airplanes type certificated after January 1, 1958, after November 26, 1986, include floor proximity emergency escape path marking which meets the requirements of § 25.812(e) of this chapter in effect on November 26, 1984.

        (d)  Except for lights forming part of emergency lighting subsystems provided in compliance with § 25.812(h) of this chapter (as prescribed in paragraph (h) of this section) that serve no more than one assist means, are independent of the airplane's main emergency lighting systems, and are automatically activated when the assist means is deployed, each light required by paragraphs (c) and (h) of this section must comply with the following:

        (1) Each light must—

        (i) Be operable manually both from the flightcrew station and, for airplanes on which a flight attendant is required, from a point in the passenger compartment that is readily accessible to a normal flight attendant seat;

        (ii) Have a means to prevent inadvertent operation of the manual controls; and

        (iii) When armed or turned on at either station, remain lighted or become lighted upon interruption of the airplane's normal electric power.

        (2) Each light must be armed or turned on during taxiing, takeoff, and landing. In showing compliance with this paragraph a transverse vertical separation of the fuselage need not be considered.

        (3) Each light must provide the required level of illumination for at least 10 minutes at the critical ambient conditions after emergency landing.

        (4) Each light must have a cockpit control device that has an “on,” “off,” and “armed” position.

        (e)  (1) For a passenger-carrying airplane for which the application for the type certificate was filed prior to May 1, 1972, the location of each passenger emergency exit operating handle, and instructions for opening the exit, must be shown by a marking on or near the exit that is readable from a distance of 30 inches. In addition, for each Type I and Type II emergency exit with a locking mechanism released by rotary motion of the handle, the instructions for opening must be shown by—

        (i) A red arrow with a shaft at least three-fourths inch wide and a head twice the width of the shaft, extending along at least 70° of arc at a radius approximately equal to three-fourths of the handle length; and

        (ii) The word “open” in red letters 1 inch high placed horizontally near the head of the arrow.

        (2) For a passenger-carrying airplane for which the application for the type certificate was filed on or after May 1, 1972, the location of each passenger emergency exit operating handle and instructions for opening the exit must be shown in accordance with the requirements under which the airplane was type certificated. On these airplanes, no operating handle or operating handle cover may continue to be used if its luminescence (brightness) decreases to below 100 microlamberts.

        (f)  Access to emergency exits must be provided as follows for each passenger-carrying transport category airplane:

        (1) Each passage way between individual passenger areas, or leading to a Type I or Type II emergency exit, must be unobstructed and at least 20 inches wide.

        (2) For each Type I or Type II emergency exit equipped with an assist means, there must be enough space next to the exit to allow a crewmember to assist in the evacuation of passengers without reducing the unobstructed width of the passageway below that required in paragraph (f)(1) of this section. In addition, all airplanes manufactured on or after November 26, 2008 must comply with the provisions of §§ 25.813(b)(1), (b)(2), (b)(3) and (b)(4) in effect on November 26, 2004. However, a deviation from this requirement may be authorized for an airplane certificated under the provisions of part 4b of the Civil Air Regulations in effect before December 20, 1951, if the Administrator finds that special circumstances exist that provide an equivalent level of safety.

        (3) There must be access from the main aisle to each Type III and Type IV exit. The access from the aisle to these exits must not be obstructed by seats, berths, or other protrusions in a manner that would reduce the effectiveness of the exit. In addition—

        (i) For an airplane for which the application for the type certificate was filed prior to May 1, 1972, the access must meet the requirements of § 25.813(c) of this chapter in effect on April 30, 1972; and

        (ii) For an airplane for which the application for the type certificate was filed on or after May 1, 1972, the access must meet the emergency exit access requirements under which the airplane was type certificated; except that,

        (iii) After December 3, 1992, the access for an airplane type certificated after January 1, 1958, must meet the requirements of § 25.813(c) of this chapter, effective June 3, 1992.

        (iv) Contrary provisions of this section notwithstanding, the Director of the division of the Aircraft Certification Service responsible for the airworthiness rules may authorize deviation from the requirements of paragraph (f)(3)(iii) of this section if it is determined that special circumstances make compliance impractical. Such special circumstances include, but are not limited to, the following conditions when they preclude achieving compliance with § 25.813(c)(1)(i) or (ii) without a reduction in the total number of passenger seats: emergency exits located in close proximity to each other; fixed installations such as lavatories, galleys, etc.; permanently mounted bulkheads; an insufficient number of rows ahead of or behind the exit to enable compliance without a reduction in the seat row pitch of more than one inch; or an insufficient number of such rows to enable compliance without a reduction in the seat row pitch to less than 30 inches. A request for such grant of deviation must include credible reasons as to why literal compliance with § 25.813(c)(1)(i) or (ii) is impractical and a description of the steps taken to achieve a level of safety as close to that intended by § 25.813(c)(1)(i) or (ii) as is practical.

        (v) The Director of the division of the Aircraft Certification Service responsible for the airworthiness rules may also authorize a compliance date later than December 3, 1992, if it is determined that special circumstances make compliance by that date impractical. A request for such grant of deviation must outline the airplanes for which compliance will be achieved by December 3, 1992, and include a proposed schedule for incremental compliance of the remaining airplanes in the operator's fleet. In addition, the request must include credible reasons why compliance cannot be achieved earlier.

        (4) If it is necessary to pass through a passageway between passenger compartments to reach any required emergency exit from any seat in the passenger cabin, the passageway must not be obstructed. However, curtains may be used if they allow free entry through the passageway.

        (5) No door may be installed in any partition between passenger compartments.

        (6) No person may operate an airplane manufactured after November 27, 2006, that incorporates a door installed between any passenger seat occupiable for takeoff and landing and any passenger emergency exit, such that the door crosses any egress path (including aisles, crossaisles and passageways).

        (7) If it is necessary to pass through a doorway separating the passenger cabin from other areas to reach required emergency exit from any passenger seat, the door must have a means to latch it in open position, and the door must be latched open during each takeoff and landing. The latching means must be able to withstand the loads imposed upon it when the door is subjected to the ultimate inertia forces, relative to the surrounding structure, listed in § 25.561(b) of this chapter.

        (g)  Each passenger emergency exit and the means of opening that exit from the outside must be marked on the outside of the airplane. There must be a 2-inch colored band outlining each passenger emergency exit on the side of the fuselage. Each outside marking, including the band, must be readily distinguishable from the surrounding fuselage area by contrast in color. The markings must comply with the following:

        (1) If the reflectance of the darker color is 15 percent or less, the reflectance of the lighter color must be at least 45 percent.

        (2) If the reflectance of the darker color is greater than 15 percent, at least a 30 percent difference between its reflectance and the reflectance of the lighter color must be provided.

        (3) Exits that are not in the side of the fuselage must have the external means of opening and applicable instructions marked conspicuously in red or, if red is inconspicuous against the background color, in bright chrome yellow and, when the opening means for such an exit is located on only one side of the fuselage, a conspicuous marking to that effect must be provided on the other side.  is the ratio of the luminous flux reflected by a body to the luminous flux it receives.

        (h)  (1) Except for nontransport category airplanes certificated after December 31, 1964, each passenger-carrying airplane must be equipped with exterior lighting that meets the following requirements:

        (i) For an airplane for which the application for the type certificate was filed prior to May 1, 1972, the requirements of § 25.812 (f) and (g) of this chapter in effect on April 30, 1972.

        (ii) For an airplane for which the application for the type certificate was filed on or after May 1, 1972, the exterior emergency lighting requirements under which the airplane was type certificated.

        (2) Each passenger-carrying airplane must be equipped with a slip-resistant escape route that meets the following requirements:

        (i) For an airplane for which the application for the type certificate was filed prior to May 1, 1972, the requirements of § 25.803(e) of this chapter in effect on April 30, 1972.

        (ii) For an airplane for which the application for the type certificate was filed on or after May 1, 1972, the slip-resistant escape route requirements under which the airplane was type certificated.

        (i)  Each floor level door or exit in the side of the fuselage (other than those leading into a cargo or baggage compartment that is not accessible from the passenger cabin) that is 44 or more inches high and 20 or more inches wide, but not wider than 46 inches, each passenger ventral exit (except the ventral exits on M-404 and CV-240 airplanes), and each tail cone exit, must meet the requirements of this section for floor level emergency exits. However, the Administrator may grant a deviation from this paragraph if he finds that circumstances make full compliance impractical and that an acceptable level of safety has been achieved.

        (j)  Approved emergency exits in the passenger compartments that are in excess of the minimum number of required emergency exits must meet all of the applicable provisions of this section except paragraphs (f)(1), (2), and (3) of this section and must be readily accessible.

        (k) On each large passenger-carrying turbojet-powered airplane, each ventral exit and tailcone exit must be—

        (1) Designed and constructed so that it cannot be opened during flight; and

        (2) Marked with a placard readable from a distance of 30 inches and installed at a conspicuous location near the means of opening the exit, stating that the exit has been designed and constructed so that it cannot be opened during flight.

        (l)  (1) Each transport category airplane manufactured after  must comply with the provisions of § 25.809(i) and

        (2) After November 26, 2007 each transport category airplane must comply with the provisions of § 25.813(b)(6)(ii) in effect on November 26, 2007.

        (m) Except for an airplane used in operations under this part on October 16, 1987, and having an emergency exit configuration installed and authorized for operation prior to October 16, 1987, for an airplane that is required to have more than one passenger emergency exit for each side of the fuselage, no passenger emergency exit shall be more than 60 feet from any adjacent passenger emergency exit on the same side of the same deck of the fuselage, as measured parallel to the airplane's longitudinal axis between the nearest exit edges.

        (n)  No person may operate a passenger-carrying airplane unless it is equipped with flashlight stowage provisions accessible from each flight attendant seat.

        § 121.327   Supplemental oxygen: Reciprocating engine powered airplanes.

#### § § 121.327

        (a)  Except where supplemental oxygen is provided in accordance with § 121.331, no person may operate an airplane unless supplemental oxygen is furnished and used as set forth in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section. The amount of supplemental oxygen required for a particular operation is determined on the basis of flight altitudes and flight duration, consistent with the operation procedures established for each operation and route.

        (b)  (1) At cabin pressure altitudes above 10,000 feet up to and including 12,000 feet, oxygen must be provided for, and used by, each member of the flight crew on flight deck duty, and must be provided for other crewmembers, for that part of the flight at those altitudes that is of more than 30 minutes duration.

        (2) At cabin pressure altitudes above 12,000 feet, oxygen must be provided for, and used by, each member of the flight crew on flight deck duty, and must be provided for other crewmembers, during the entire flight time at those altitudes.

        (3) When a flight crewmember is required to use oxygen, he must use it continuously, except when necessary to remove the oxygen mask or other dispenser in connection with his regular duties. Standby crewmembers who are on call or are definitely going to have flight deck duty before completing the flight must be provided with an amount of supplemental oxygen equal to that provided for crewmembers on duty other than on flight deck duty. If a standby crewmember is not on call and will not be on flight deck duty during the remainder of the flight, he is considered to be a passenger for the purposes of supplemental oxygen requirements.

        (c)  Each certificate holder shall provide a supply of oxygen, approved for passenger safety, in accordance with the following:

        (1) For flights of more than 30 minutes duration at cabin pressure altitudes above 8,000 feet up to and including 14,000 feet, enough oxygen for 30 minutes for 10 percent of the passengers.

        (2) For flights at cabin pressure altitudes above 14,000 feet up to and including 15,000 feet, enough oxygen for that part of the flight at those altitudes for 30 percent of the passengers.

        (3) For flights at cabin pressure altitudes above 15,000 feet, enough oxygen for each passenger carried during the entire flight at those altitudes.

        (d) For the purposes of this subpart  means the pressure altitude corresponding with the pressure in the cabin of the airplane, and  means the altitude above sea level at which the airplane is operated. For airplanes without pressurized cabins, “_cabin pressure altitude_” and “_flight altitude_” mean the same thing.

        § 121.329   Supplemental oxygen for sustenance: Turbine engine powered airplanes.

#### § § 121.329

        (a)  When operating a turbine engine powered airplane, each certificate holder shall equip the airplane with sustaining oxygen and dispensing equipment for use as set forth in this section:

        (1) The amount of oxygen provided must be at least the quantity necessary to comply with paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.

        (2) The amount of sustaining and first-aid oxygen required for a particular operation to comply with the rules in this part is determined on the basis of cabin pressure altitudes and flight duration, consistent with the operating procedures established for each operation and route.

        (3) The requirements for airplanes with pressurized cabins are determined on the basis of cabin pressure altitude and the assumption that a cabin pressurization failure will occur at the altitude or point of flight that is most critical from the standpoint of oxygen need, and that after the failure the airplane will descend in accordance with the emergency procedures specified in the Airplane Flight Manual, without exceeding its operating limitations, to a flight altitude that will allow successful termination of the flight.

        (4) Following the failure, the cabin pressure altitude is considered to be the same as the flight altitude unless it is shown that no probable failure of the cabin or pressurization equipment will result in a cabin pressure altitude equal to the flight altitude. Under those circumstances, the maximum cabin pressure altitude attained may be used as a basis for certification or determination of oxygen supply, or both.

        (b)  Each certificate holder shall provide a supply of oxygen for crewmembers in accordance with the following:

        (1) At cabin pressure altitudes above 10,000 feet, up to and including 12,000 feet, oxygen must be provided for and used by each member of the flight crew on flight deck duty and must be provided for other crewmembers for that part of the flight at those altitudes that is of more than 30 minutes duration.

        (2) At cabin pressure altitudes above 12,000 feet, oxygen must be provided for, and used by, each member of the flight crew on flight deck duty, and must be provided for other crewmembers during the entire flight at those altitudes.

        § 121.434   Operating experience, operating cycles, and consolidation of knowledge and skills.

#### § § 121.434

        (a) No certificate holder may use a person nor may any person serve as a required crewmember of an airplane unless the person has satisfactorily completed, on that type airplane and in that crewmember position, the operating experience, operating cycles, and the line operating flight time for consolidation of knowledge and skills, required by this section, except as follows:

        (1) Crewmembers other than pilots in command may serve as provided herein for the purpose of meeting the requirements of this section.

        (2) Pilots who are meeting the pilot in command requirements may serve as second in command.

        (3) Separate operating experience, operating cycles, and line operating flight time for consolidation of knowledge and skills are not required for variations within the same type airplane.

        (4) Deviation based upon designation of related aircraft in accordance with § 121.418(b).

        (i) The Administrator may authorize a deviation from the operating experience, operating cycles, and line operating flight time for consolidation of knowledge and skills required by this section based upon a designation of related aircraft in accordance with § 121.418(b) of this part and a determination that the certificate holder can demonstrate an equivalent level of safety.

        (ii) A request for deviation from the operating experience, operating cycles, and line operating flight time for consolidation of knowledge and skills required by this section based upon a designation of related aircraft must be submitted to the Administrator. The request must include the following:

        (A) Identification of aircraft operated by the certificate holder designated as related aircraft.

        (B) Hours of operating experience and number of operating cycles necessary based on review of the related aircraft, the operation, and the duty position.

        (C) Consolidation hours necessary based on review of the related aircraft, the operation, and the duty position.

        (iii) The administrator may, at any time, terminate a grant of deviation authority issued under this paragraph (a)(4).

        (b) In acquiring the operating experience, operating cycles, and line operating flight time for consolidation of knowledge and skills, crewmembers must comply with the following:

        (1) In the case of a flight crewmember, the person must hold the appropriate certificates and ratings for the crewmember position and the airplane, except that a pilot who is meeting the pilot in command requirements must hold the appropriate certificates and ratings for a pilot in command in the airplane.

        (2) The operating experience, operating cycles, and line operating flight time for consolidation of knowledge and skills must be acquired after satisfactory completion of the appropriate ground and flight training for the particular airplane type and crewmember position.

        (3) In the case of a pilot who satisfactorily completed the preflight visual inspection of an aircraft by approved pictorial means during an initial, transition, conversion, or upgrade proficiency check, the pilot must also demonstrate proficiency to a check pilot on at least one complete preflight visual inspection of the interior and exterior of a static airplane. This demonstration of proficiency must be completed by the pilot and certified by the check pilot before the completion of operating experience.

        (4) The experience must be acquired inflight during operations under this part. However, in the case of an aircraft not previously used by the certificate holder in operations under this part, operating experience acquired in the aircraft during proving flights or ferry flights may be used to meet this requirement.

        (c) Pilot crewmembers must acquire operating experience and operating cycles as follows:

        (1) A pilot in command must—

        (i) Perform the duties of a pilot in command under the supervision of a check pilot; and

        (ii) For a qualifying pilot in command completing initial or upgrade training specified in § 121.424 or § 121.426, be observed in the performance of prescribed duties by an FAA inspector during at least one flight leg which includes a takeoff and landing. During the time that a qualifying pilot in command is acquiring the operating experience in paragraphs (c)(l)(i) and (ii) of this section, a check pilot who is also serving as the pilot in command must occupy a pilot station. However, in the case of a transitioning pilot in command the check pilot serving as pilot in command may occupy the observer's seat, if the transitioning pilot has made at least two takeoffs and landings in the type airplane used, and has satisfactorily demonstrated to the check pilot that he is qualified to perform the duties of a pilot in command of that type of airplane.

        (2) A second in command pilot must perform the duties of a second in command under the supervision of an appropriately qualified check pilot.

        (3) The hours of operating experience and operating cycles for all pilots are as follows:

        (i) For initial training, 15 hours in Group I reciprocating powered airplanes, 20 hours in Group I turbopropeller powered airplanes, and 25 hours in Group II airplanes. Operating experience in both airplane groups must include at least 4 operating cycles (at least 2 as the pilot flying the airplane).

        (ii) For transition training, except as provided in paragraph (c)(3)(iii) of this section, 10 hours in Group I reciprocating powered airplanes, 12 hours in Group I turbopropeller powered airplanes, 25 hours for pilots in command in Group II airplanes, and 15 hours for second in command pilots in Group II airplanes. Operating experience in both airplane groups must include at least 4 operating cycles (at least 2 as the pilot flying the airplane).

        (iii) In the case of transition training where the certificate holder's approved training program includes a course of training in an FFS under § 121.409(c), each pilot in command must comply with the requirements prescribed in paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section for initial training.

        (d) A flight engineer must perform the duties of a flight engineer under the supervision of a check flight engineer or a qualified flight engineer for at least the following number of hours:

        (1) Group I reciprocating powered airplanes, 8 hours.

        (2) Group I turbopropeller powered airplanes, 10 hours.

        (3) Group II airplanes, 12 hours.

        (e) A flight attendant must, for at least 5 hours, perform the assigned duties of a flight attendant under the supervision of a flight attendant supervisor qualified under this part who personally observes the performance of these duties. However, operating experience is not required for a flight attendant who has previously acquired such experience on any large passenger carrying airplane of the same group, if the certificate holder shows that the flight attendant has received sufficient ground training for the airplane in which the flight attendant is to serve. Flight attendants receiving operating experience may not be assigned as a required crewmember. Flight attendants who have satisfactorily completed training time acquired in an approved training program conducted in a full-scale (except for length) cabin training device of the type airplane in which they are to serve may substitute this time for 50 percent of the hours required by this paragraph.

        (f) Flight crewmembers may substitute one additional takeoff and landing for each hour of flight to meet the operating experience requirements of this section, up to a maximum reduction of 50% of flight hours, except those in Group II initial training, and second in command pilots in Group II transition training.

        (g) Except as provided in paragraph (h) of this section, pilot in command and second in command crewmembers must each acquire at least 100 hours of line operating flight time for consolidation of knowledge and skills (including operating experience required under paragraph (c) of this section) within 120 days after the satisfactory completion of:

        (1) Any part of the flight maneuvers and procedures portion of either an airline transport pilot certificate with type rating practical test or an additional type rating practical test, or

        (2) A § 121.441 proficiency check.

        (h) The following exceptions apply to the consolidation requirement of paragraph (g) of this section:

        (1) Pilots who have qualified and served as pilot in command or second in command on a particular type airplane in operations under this part before August 25, 1995 are not required to complete line operating flight time for consolidation of knowledge and skills.

        (2) Pilots who have completed the line operating flight time requirement for consolidation of knowledge and skills while serving as second in command on a particular type airplane in operations under this part after August 25, 1995 are not required to repeat the line operating flight time before serving as pilot in command on the same type airplane.

        (3) If, before completing the required 100 hours of line operating flight time, a pilot serves as a pilot in another airplane type operated by the certificate holder, the pilot may not serve as a pilot in the airplane for which the pilot has newly qualified unless the pilot satifactorily completes refresher training as provided in the certificate holder's approved training program and that training is conducted by an appropriately qualified instructor or check pilot.

        (4) If the required 100 hours of line operating flight time are not completed within 120 days, the certificate holder may extend the 120-day period to no more than 150 days if—

        (i) The pilot continues to meet all other applicable requirements of subpart O of this part; and

        (ii) On or before the 120th day the pilot satisfactorily completes refresher training conducted by an appropriately qualified instructor or check pilot as provided in the certificate holder's approved training program, or a check pilot determines that the pilot has retained an adequate level of proficiency after observing that pilot in a supervised line operating flight.

        (5) The Administrator, upon application by the certificate holder, may authorize deviations from the requirements of paragraph (g) of this section, by an appropriate amendment to the operations specifications, to the extent warranted by any of the following circumstances:

        (i) A newly certificated certificate holder does not employ any pilots who meet the minimum requirements of paragraph (g) of this section.

        (ii) An existing certificate holder adds to its fleet an airplane type not before proven for use in its operations.

        (iii) A certificate holder establishes a new domicile to which it assigns pilots who will be required to become qualified on the airplanes operated from that domicile.

        (i) Notwithstanding the reductions in programmed hours permitted under §§ 121.405 and 121.409 of subpart N of this part, the hours of operating experience for crewmembers are not subject to reduction other than as provided in accordance with a deviation authorized under paragraph (a) of this section or as provided in paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section.

          § 121.463   Aircraft dispatcher qualifications.

#### § § 121.463

          (a) No certificate holder conducting domestic or flag operations may use any person, nor may any person serve, as an aircraft dispatcher for a particular airplane group unless that person has, with respect to an airplane of that group, satisfactorily completed the following:

          (1) Initial dispatcher training, except that a person who has satisfactorily completed such training for another type airplane of the same group need only complete the appropriate transition training.

          (2) Operating familiarization consisting of at least 5 hours observing operations under this part from the flight deck or, for airplanes without an observer seat on the flight deck, from a forward passenger seat with headset or speaker. This requirement may be reduced to a minimum of 2  hours by the substitution of one additional takeoff and landing for an hour of flight. A person may serve as an aircraft dispatcher without meeting the requirement of this paragraph (a) for 90 days after initial introduction of the airplane into operations under this part.

          (b) No certificate holder conducting domestic or flag operations may use any person, nor may any person serve, as an aircraft dispatcher for a particular type airplane unless that person has, with respect to that airplane, satisfactorily completed differences training, if applicable.

          (c) No certificate holder conducting domestic or flag operations may use any person, nor may any person serve, as an aircraft dispatcher unless within the preceding 12 calendar months the aircraft dispatcher has satisfactorily completed operating familiarization consisting of at least 5 hours observing operations under this part, in one of the types of airplanes in each group to be dispatched. This observation shall be made from the flight deck or, for airplanes without an observer seat on the flight deck, from a forward passenger seat with headset or speaker. The requirement of paragraph (a) of this section may be reduced to a minimum of 2  hours by the substitution of one additional takeoff and landing for an hour of flight. The requirement of this paragraph may be satisfied by observation of 5 hours of simulator training for each airplane group in one of the simulators approved under § 121.407 for the group. However, if the requirement of paragraph (a) is met by the use of a simulator, no reduction in hours is permitted.

          (d) No certificate holder conducting domestic or flag operations may use any person, nor may any person serve as an aircraft dispatcher to dispatch airplanes in operations under this part unless the certificate holder has determined that he is familiar with all essential operating procedures for that segment of the operation over which he exercises dispatch jurisdiction. However, a dispatcher who is qualified to dispatch airplanes through one segment of an operation may dispatch airplanes through other segments of the operation after coordinating with dispatchers who are qualified to dispatch airplanes through those other segments.

          (e) For the purposes of this section, the airplane groups, terms, and definitions in § 121.400 apply.

          § 121.465   Aircraft dispatcher duty time limitations: Domestic and flag operations.

#### § § 121.465

          (a) Each certificate holder conducting domestic or flag operations shall establish the daily duty period for a dispatcher so that it begins at a time that allows him or her to become thoroughly familiar with existing and anticipated weather conditions along the route before he or she dispatches any airplane. He or she shall remain on duty until each airplane dispatched by him or her has completed its flight, or has gone beyond his or her jurisdiction, or until he or she is relieved by another qualified dispatcher.

          (b) Except in cases where circumstances or emergency conditions beyond the control of the certificate holder require otherwise—

          (1) No certificate holder conducting domestic or flag operations may schedule a dispatcher for more than 10 consecutive hours of duty;

          (2) If a dispatcher is scheduled for more than 10 hours of duty in 24 consecutive hours, the certificate holder shall provide him or her a rest period of at least eight hours at or before the end of 10 hours of duty.

          (3) Each dispatcher must be relieved of all duty with the certificate holder for at least 24 consecutive hours during any seven consecutive days or the equivalent thereof within any calendar month.

          (c) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, a certificate holder conducting flag operations may, if authorized by the Administrator, schedule an aircraft dispatcher at a duty station outside of the 48 contiguous States and the District of Columbia, for more than 10 consecutive hours of duty in a 24-hour period if that aircraft dispatcher is relieved of all duty with the certificate holder for at least eight hours during each 24-hour period.

          § 121.467   Flight attendant duty period limitations and rest requirements: Domestic, flag, and supplemental operations.

#### § § 121.467

          (a) For purposes of this section—

          means the period of elapsed time, using Coordinated Universal Time or local time, that begins at midnight and ends 24 hours later at the next midnight.

          means the period of elapsed time between reporting for an assignment involving flight time and release from that assignment by the certificate holder conducting domestic, flag, or supplemental operations. The time is calculated using either Coordinated Universal Time or local time to reflect the total elapsed time.

          means an individual, other than a flight crewmember, who is assigned by a certificate holder conducting domestic, flag, or supplemental operations, in accordance with the required minimum crew complement under the certificate holder's operations specifications or in addition to that minimum complement, to duty in an aircraft during flight time and whose duties include but are not necessarily limited to cabin-safety-related responsibilities.

          means the period free of all restraint or duty for a certificate holder conducting domestic, flag, or supplemental operations and free of all responsibility for work or duty should the occasion arise.

          (b) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, a certificate holder conducting domestic, flag, or supplemental operations may assign a duty period to a flight attendant only when the applicable duty period limitations and rest requirements of this paragraph are met.

          (1) Except as provided in paragraphs (b)(4), (b)(5), and (b)(6) of this section, no certificate holder conducting domestic, flag, or supplemental operations may assign a flight attendant to a scheduled duty period of more than 14 hours.

          (2) A flight attendant scheduled to a duty period of 14 hours or less as provided under paragraph (b)(1) of this section must be given a scheduled rest period of at least 10 consecutive hours. This rest period must occur between the completion of the scheduled duty period and the commencement of the subsequent duty period.

          (3) The rest period required under paragraph (b)(2) of this section may not be reduced to less than 10 consecutive hours.

          (4) A certificate holder conducting domestic, flag, or supplemental operations may assign a flight attendant to a scheduled duty period of more than 14 hours, but no more than 16 hours, if the certificate holder has assigned to the flight or flights in that duty period at least one flight attendant in addition to the minimum flight attendant complement required for the flight or flights in that duty period under the certificate holder's operations specifications.

          (5) A certificate holder conducting domestic, flag, or supplemental operations may assign a flight attendant to a scheduled duty period of more than 16 hours, but no more than 18 hours, if the certificate holder has assigned to the flight or flights in that duty period at least two flight attendants in addition to the minimum flight attendant complement required for the flight or flights in that duty period under the certificate holder's operations specifications.

          (6) A certificate holder conducting domestic, flag, or supplemental operations may assign a flight attendant to a scheduled duty period of more than 18 hours, but no more than 20 hours, if the scheduled duty period includes one or more flights that land or take off outside the 48 contiguous states and the District of Columbia, and if the certificate holder has assigned to the flight or flights in that duty period at least three flight attendants in addition to the minimum flight attendant complement required for the flight or flights in that duty period under the domestic certificate holder's operations specifications.

          (7) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(8) of this section, a flight attendant scheduled to a duty period of more than 14 hours but no more than 20 hours, as provided in paragraphs (b)(4), (b)(5), and (b)(6) of this section, must be given a scheduled rest period of at least 12 consecutive hours. This rest period must occur between the completion of the scheduled duty period and the commencement of the subsequent duty period.

          (8) The rest period required under paragraph (b)(7) of this section may be scheduled or reduced to 10 consecutive hours if the flight attendant is provided a subsequent rest period of at least 14 consecutive hours; this subsequent rest period must be scheduled to begin no later than 24 hours after the beginning of the reduced rest period and must occur between the completion of the scheduled duty period and the commencement of the subsequent duty period.

          (9) Notwithstanding paragraphs (b)(4), (b)(5), and (b)(6) of this section, if a certificate holder conducting domestic, flag, or supplemental operations elects to reduce the rest period to 10 hours as authorized by paragraph (b)(8) of this section, the certificate holder may not schedule a flight attendant for a duty period of more than 14 hours during the 24-hour period commencing after the beginning of the reduced rest period.

          (10) No certificate holder conducting domestic, flag, or supplemental operations may assign a flight attendant any duty period with the certificate holder unless the flight attendant has had at least the minimum rest required under this section.

          (11) No certificate holder conducting domestic, flag, or supplemental operations may assign a flight attendant to perform any duty with the certificate holder during any required rest period.

          (12) Time spent in transportation, not local in character, that a certificate holder conducting domestic, flag, or supplemental operations requires of a flight attendant and provides to transport the flight attendant to an airport at which that flight attendant is to serve on a flight as a crewmember, or from an airport at which the flight attendant was relieved from duty to return to the flight attendant's home station, is not considered part of a rest period.

          (13) Each certificate holder conducting domestic, flag, or supplemental operations must relieve each flight attendant engaged in air transportation and each commercial operator must relieve each flight attendant engaged in air commerce from all further duty for at least 24 consecutive hours during any 7 consecutive calendar days.

          (14) A flight attendant is not considered to be scheduled for duty in excess of duty period limitations if the flights to which the flight attendant is assigned are scheduled and normally terminate within the limitations but due to circumstances beyond the control of the certificate holder conducting domestic, flag, or supplemental operations (such as adverse weather conditions) are not at the time of departure expected to reach their destination within the scheduled time.

          (c) Notwithstanding paragraph (b) of this section, a certificate holder conducting domestic, flag, or supplemental operations may apply the flightcrew member flight time and duty limitations and rest requirements of part 117 of this chapter to flight attendants for all operations conducted under this part provided that—

          (1) The certificate holder establishes written procedures that—

          (i) Apply to all flight attendants used in the certificate holder's operation;

          (ii) Include the flightcrew member requirements contained in part 117, as appropriate to the operation being conducted, except that rest facilities on board the aircraft are not required;

          (iii) Include provisions to add one flight attendant to the minimum flight attendant complement for each flightcrew member who is in excess of the minimum number required in the aircraft type certificate data sheet and who is assigned to the aircraft under the provisions of part 117, as applicable, of this part;

          (iv) Are approved by the Administrator and are described or referenced in the certificate holder's operations specifications; and

          (2) Whenever the Administrator finds that revisions are necessary for the continued adequacy of the written procedures that are required by paragraph (c)(1) of this section and that had been granted final approval, the certificate holder must, after notification by the Administrator, make any changes in the procedures that are found necessary by the Administrator. Within 30 days after the certificate holder receives such notice, it may file a petition to reconsider the notice with the responsible Flight Standards office. The filing of a petition to reconsider stays the notice, pending decision by the Administrator. However, if the Administrator finds that an emergency requires immediate action in the interest of safety, the Administrator may, upon a statement of the reasons, require a change effective without stay.

        § 121.628   Inoperable instruments and equipment.

#### § § 121.628

        (a) No person may take off an airplane with inoperable instruments or equipment installed unless the following conditions are met:

        (1) An approved Minimum Equipment List exists for that airplane.

        (2) The responsible Flight Standards office has issued the certificate holder operations specifications authorizing operations in accordance with an approved Minimum Equipment List. The flight crew shall have direct access at all times prior to flight to all of the information contained in the approved Minimum Equipment List through printed or other means approved by the Administrator in the certificate holders operations specifications. An approved Minimum Equipment List, as authorized by the operations specifications, constitutes an approved change to the type design without requiring recertification.

        (3) The approved Minimum Equipment List must:

        (i) Be prepared in accordance with the limitations specified in paragraph (b) of this section.

        § 121.629   Operation in icing conditions.

#### § § 121.629

        (a) No person may dispatch or release an aircraft, continue to operate an aircraft en route, or land an aircraft when in the opinion of the pilot in command or aircraft dispatcher (domestic and flag operations only), icing conditions are expected or met that might adversely affect the safety of the flight.

        (b) No person may take off an aircraft when frost, ice, or snow is adhering to the wings, control surfaces, propellers, engine inlets, or other critical surfaces of the aircraft or when the takeoff would not be in compliance with paragraph (c) of this section. Takeoffs with frost under the wing in the area of the fuel tanks may be authorized by the Administrator.

        (c) Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, no person may dispatch, release, or take off an aircraft any time conditions are such that frost, ice, or snow may reasonably be expected to adhere to the aircraft, unless the certificate holder has an approved ground deicing/anti-icing program in its operations specifications and unless the dispatch, release, and takeoff comply with that program. The approved ground deicing/anti-icing program must include at least the following items:

        (1) A detailed description of—

        (i) How the certificate holder determines that conditions are such that frost, ice, or snow may reasonably be expected to adhere to the aircraft and that ground deicing/anti-icing operational procedures must be in effect;

        (ii) Who is responsible for deciding that ground deicing/anti-icing operational procedures must be in effect;

        (iii) The procedures for implementing ground deicing/anti-icing operational procedures;

        (iv) The specific duties and responsibilities of each operational position or group responsible for getting the aircraft safely airborne while ground deicing/anti-icing operational procedures are in effect.

        (2) Initial and annual recurrent ground training and testing for flight crewmembers and qualification for all other affected personnel (e.g., aircraft dispatchers, ground crews, contract personnel) concerning the specific requirements of the approved program and each person's responsibilities and duties under the approved program, specifically covering the following areas:

        (i) The use of holdover times.

        (ii) Aircraft deicing/anti-icing procedures, including inspection and check procedures and responsibilities.

        (iii) Communications procedures.

        (iv) Aircraft surface contamination (, adherence of frost, ice, or snow) and critical area identification, and how contamination adversely affects aircraft performance and flight characteristics.

        (v) Types and characteristics of deicing/anti-icing fluids.

        (vi) Cold weather preflight inspection procedures;

        (vii) Techniques for recognizing contamination on the aircraft.

        (3) The certificate holder's holdover timetables and the procedures for the use of these tables by the certificate holder's personnel. Holdover time is the estimated time deicing/anti-icing fluid will prevent the formation of frost or ice and the accumulation of snow on the protected surfaces of an aircraft. Holdover time begins when the final application of deicing/anti-icing fluid commences and expires when the deicing/anti-icing fluid applied to the aircraft loses its effectiveness. The holdover times must be supported by data acceptable to the Administrator. The certificate holder's program must include procedures for flight crewmembers to increase or decrease the determined holdover time in changing conditions. The program must provide that takeoff after exceeding any maximum holdover time in the certificate holder's holdover timetable is permitted only when at least one of the following conditions exists:

        (i) A pretakeoff contamination check, as defined in paragraph (c)(4) of this section, determines that the wings, control surfaces, and other critical surfaces, as defined in the certificate holder's program, are free of frost, ice, or snow.

        (ii) It is otherwise determined by an alternate procedure approved by the Administrator in accordance with the certificate holder's approved program that the wings, control surfaces, and other critical surfaces, as defined in the certificate holder's program, are free of frost, ice, or snow.

        (iii) The wings, control surfaces, and other critical surfaces are redeiced and a new holdover time is determined.

        (4) Aircraft deicing/anti-icing procedures and responsibilities, pretakeoff check procedures and responsibilities, and pretakeoff contamination check procedures and responsibilities. A pretakeoff check is a check of the aircraft's wings or representative aircraft surfaces for frost, ice, or snow within the aircraft's holdover time. A pretakeoff contamination check is a check to make sure the wings, control surfaces, and other critical surfaces, as defined in the certificate holder's program, are free of frost, ice, and snow. It must be conducted within five minutes prior to beginning take off. This check must be accomplished from outside the aircraft unless the program specifies otherwise.

        (d) A certificate holder may continue to operate under this section without a program as required in paragraph (c) of this section, if it includes in its operations specifications a requirement that, any time conditions are such that frost, ice, or snow may reasonably be expected to adhere to the aircraft, no aircraft will take off unless it has been checked to ensure that the wings, control surfaces, and other critical surfaces are free of frost, ice, and snow. The check must occur within five minutes prior to beginning takeoff. This check must be accomplished from outside the aircraft.

        (b) No person may allow a flight to continue to an airport to which it has been dispatched or released unless the weather conditions at an alternate airport that was specified in the dispatch or flight release are forecast to be at or above the alternate minimums specified in the operations specifications for that airport at the time the aircraft would arrive at the alternate airport. However, the dispatch or flight release may be amended en route to include any alternate airport that is within the fuel range of the aircraft as specified in §§ 121.639 through 121.647.

        (c) No person may allow a flight to continue beyond the ETOPS Entry Point unless—

        (1) Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, the weather conditions at each ETOPS Alternate Airport required by § 121.624 are forecast to be at or above the operating minima for that airport in the certificate holder's operations specifications when it might be used (from the earliest to the latest possible landing time); and

        (2) All ETOPS Alternate Airports within the authorized ETOPS maximum diversion time are reviewed and the flight crew advised of any changes in conditions that have occurred since dispatch.

        (d) If paragraph (c)(1) of this section cannot be met for a specific airport, the dispatch or flight release may be amended to add an ETOPS Alternate Airport within the maximum ETOPS diversion time that could be authorized for that flight with weather conditions at or above operating minima.

        (e) Before the ETOPS Entry Point, the pilot in command for a supplemental operator or a dispatcher for a flag operator must use company communications to update the flight plan if needed because of a re-evaluation of aircraft system capabilities.

        (f) No person may change an original destination or alternate airport that is specified in the original dispatch or flight release to another airport while the aircraft is en route unless the other airport is authorized for that type of aircraft and the appropriate requirements of §§ 121.593 through 121.661 and 121.173 are met at the time of redispatch or amendment of the flight release.

        (g) Each person who amends a dispatch or flight release en route shall record that amendment.

        § 121.645   Fuel supply: Turbine-engine powered airplanes, other than turbo propeller: Flag and supplemental operations.

#### § § 121.645

        (a) Any flag operation within the 48 contiguous United States and the District of Columbia may use the fuel requirements of § 121.639.

        (b) For any certificate holder conducting flag or supplemental operations outside the 48 contiguous United States and the District of Columbia, unless authorized by the Administrator in the operations specifications, no person may release for flight or takeoff a turbine-engine powered airplane (other than a turbo-propeller powered airplane) unless, considering wind and other weather conditions expected, it has enough fuel—

        (1) To fly to and land at the airport to which it is released;

        (2) After that, to fly for a period of 10 percent of the total time required to fly from the airport of departure to, and land at, the airport to which it was released;

        (3) After that, to fly to and land at the most distant alternate airport specified in the flight release, if an alternate is required; and

        (4) After that, to fly for 30 minutes at holding speed at 1,500 feet above the alternate airport (or the destination airport if no alternate is required) under standard temperature conditions.

        (c) No person may release a turbine-engine powered airplane (other than a turbo-propeller airplane) to an airport for which an alternate is not specified under § 121.621(a)(2) or § 121.623(b) unless it has enough fuel, considering wind and other weather conditions expected, to fly to that airport and thereafter to fly for at least two hours at normal cruising fuel consumption.

        (d) The Administrator may amend the operations specifications of a certificate holder conducting flag or supplemental operations to require more fuel than any of the minimums stated in paragraph (a) or (b) of this section if he finds that additional fuel is necessary on a particular route in the interest of safety.

        (e) For a supplemental operation within the 48 contiguous States and the District of Columbia with a turbine engine powered airplane the fuel requirements of § 121.643 apply.

        § 121.646   En-route fuel supply: flag and supplemental operations.

#### § § 121.646

        (a) No person may dispatch or release for flight a turbine-engine powered airplane with more than two engines for a flight more than 90 minutes (with all engines operating at cruise power) from an Adequate Airport unless the following fuel supply requirements are met:

        (1) The airplane has enough fuel to meet the requirements of § 121.645(b);

        (2) The airplane has enough fuel to fly to the Adequate Airport—

        (i) Assuming a rapid decompression at the most critical point;

        (ii) Assuming a descent to a safe altitude in compliance with the oxygen supply requirements of § 121.333; and

        (iii) Considering expected wind and other weather conditions.

        (3) The airplane has enough fuel to hold for 15 minutes at 1500 feet above field elevation and conduct a normal approach and landing.

        (b) No person may dispatch or release for flight an ETOPS flight unless, considering wind and other weather conditions expected, it has the fuel otherwise required by this part and enough fuel to satisfy each of the following requirements:

        (1) Fuel to fly to an ETOPS Alternate Airport.

        (i) Fuel to account for rapid decompression and engine failure. The airplane must carry the greater of the following amounts of fuel:

        (A) Fuel sufficient to fly to an ETOPS Alternate Airport assuming a rapid decompression at the most critical point followed by descent to a safe altitude in compliance with the oxygen supply requirements of § 121.333 of this chapter;

        (B) Fuel sufficient to fly to an ETOPS Alternate Airport (at the one-engine-inoperative cruise speed) assuming a rapid decompression and a simultaneous engine failure at the most critical point followed by descent to a safe altitude in compliance with the oxygen requirements of § 121.333 of this chapter; or

        (C) Fuel sufficient to fly to an ETOPS Alternate Airport (at the one engine inoperative cruise speed) assuming an engine failure at the most critical point followed by descent to the one engine inoperative cruise altitude.

        (ii) Fuel to account for errors in wind forecasting. In calculating the amount of fuel required by paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, the certificate holder must increase the actual forecast wind speed by 5% (resulting in an increase in headwind or a decrease in tailwind) to account for any potential errors in wind forecasting. If a certificate holder is not using the actual forecast wind based on a wind model accepted by the FAA, the airplane must carry additional fuel equal to 5% of the fuel required for paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, as reserve fuel to allow for errors in wind data.

        (iii) Fuel to account for icing. In calculating the amount of fuel required by paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section (after completing the wind calculation in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section), the certificate holder must ensure that the airplane carries the greater of the following amounts of fuel in anticipation of possible icing during the diversion:

        (A) Fuel that would be burned as a result of airframe icing during 10 percent of the time icing is forecast (including the fuel used by engine and wing anti-ice during this period).

        (B) Fuel that would be used for engine anti-ice, and if appropriate wing anti-ice, for the entire time during which icing is forecast.

        (iv) Fuel to account for engine deterioration. In calculating the amount of fuel required by paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section (after completing the wind calculation in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section), the airplane also carries fuel equal to 5% of the fuel specified above, to account for deterioration in cruise fuel burn performance unless the certificate holder has a program to monitor airplane in-service deterioration to cruise fuel burn performance.

        (2) Fuel to account for holding, approach, and landing. In addition to the fuel required by paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the airplane must carry fuel sufficient to hold at 1500 feet above field elevation for 15 minutes upon reaching an ETOPS Alternate Airport and then conduct an instrument approach and land.

        (3) Fuel to account for APU use. If an APU is a required power source, the certificate holder must account for its fuel consumption during the appropriate phases of flight.

        § 121.647   Factors for computing fuel required.

#### § § 121.647

        Each person computing fuel required for the purposes of this subpart shall consider the following:

        (a) Wind and other weather conditions forecast.

        (b) Anticipated traffic delays.

        (c) One instrument approach and possible missed approach at destination.

        (d) Any other conditions that may delay landing of the aircraft.

        § 121.649   Takeoff and landing weather minimums: VFR: Domestic operations.

#### § § 121.649

        (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, regardless of any clearance from ATC, no pilot may takeoff or land an airplane under VFR when the reported ceiling or visibility is less than the following:

        (1) For day operations—1,000-foot ceiling and one-mile visibility.

        (2) For night operations—1,000-foot ceiling and two-mile visibility.

        (b) Where a local surface restriction to visibility exists (e.g., smoke, dust, blowing snow or sand) the visibility for day and night operations may be reduced to   mile, if all turns after takeoff and prior to landing, and all flight beyond one mile from the airport boundary can be accomplished above or outside the area of local surface visibility restriction.

        (c) The weather minimums in this section do not apply to the VFR operation of fixed-wing aircraft at any of the locations where the special weather minimums of § 91.157 of this chapter are not applicable (See part 91, appendix D, section 3 of this chapter). The basic VFR weather minimums of § 91.155 of this chapter apply at those locations.

        § 121.651   Takeoff and landing weather minimums: IFR: All certificate holders.

#### § § 121.651

        (a) Notwithstanding any clearance from ATC, no pilot may begin a takeoff in an airplane under IFR when the weather conditions reported by the U.S. National Weather Service, a source approved by that Service, or a source approved by the Administrator, are less than those specified in—

        (1) The certificate holder's operations specifications; or

        (2) Parts 91 and 97 of this chapter, if the certificate holder's operations specifications do not specify takeoff minimums for the airport.

        (b) Except as provided in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section, no pilot may continue an approach past the final approach fix, or where a final approach fix is not used, begin the final approach segment of an instrument approach procedure—

        (1) At any airport, unless the U.S. National Weather Service, a source approved by that Service, or a source approved by the Administrator, issues a weather report for that airport; and

        (2) At airports within the United States and its territories or at U.S. military airports, unless the latest weather report for that airport issued by the U.S. National Weather Service, a source approved by that Service, or a source approved by the Administrator, reports the visibility to be equal to or more than the visibility minimums prescribed for that procedure. For the purpose of this section, the term “U.S. military airports” means airports in foreign countries where flight operations are under the control of U.S. military authority.

        (c) A pilot who has begun the final approach segment of an instrument approach procedure in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, and after that receives a later weather report indicating below-minimum conditions, may continue the approach to DA/DH or MDA. Upon reaching DA/DH or at MDA, and at any time before the missed approach point, the pilot may continue the approach below DA/DH or MDA if either the requirements of § 91.176 of this chapter, or the following requirements are met:

        (1) The aircraft is continuously in a position from which a descent to a landing on the intended runway can be made at a normal rate of descent using normal maneuvers, and where that descent rate will allow touchdown to occur within the touchdown zone of the runway of intended landing;

        (2) The flight visibility is not less than the visibility prescribed in the standard instrument approach procedure being used;

        (3) Except for Category II or Category III approaches where any necessary visual reference requirements are specified by authorization of the Administrator, at least one of the following visual references for the intended runway is distinctly visible and identifiable to the pilot:

        (i) The approach light system, except that the pilot may not descend below 100 feet above the touchdown zone elevation using the approach lights as a reference unless the red terminating bars or the red side row bars are also distinctly visible and identifiable.

        (ii) The threshold.

        (iii) The threshold markings.

        (iv) The threshold lights.

        (v) The runway end identifier lights.

        (vi) The visual approach slope indicator.

        (vii) The touchdown zone or touchdown zone markings.

        (viii) The touchdown zone lights.

        (ix) The runway or runway markings.

        (x) The runway lights; and

        (4) When the aircraft is on a straight-in nonprecision approach procedure which incorporates a visual descent point, the aircraft has reached the visual descent point, except where the aircraft is not equipped for or capable of establishing that point, or a descent to the runway cannot be made using normal procedures or rates of descent if descent is delayed until reaching that point.

        (d) A pilot may begin the final approach segment of an instrument approach procedure other than a Category II or Category III procedure at an airport when the visibility is less than the visibility minimums prescribed for that procedure if the airport is served by an operative ILS and an operative PAR, and both are used by the pilot. However, no pilot may continue an approach below the authorized DA/DH unless the requirements of § 91.176 of this chapter, or the following requirements are met:

        (1) The aircraft is continuously in a position from which a descent to a landing on the intended runway can be made at a normal rate of descent using normal maneuvers and where such a descent rate will allow touchdown to occur within the touchdown zone of the runway of intended landing;

        (2) The flight visibility is not less than the visibility prescribed in the standard instrument approach procedure being used; and

        (3) Except for Category II or Category III approaches where any necessary visual reference requirements are specified by the authorization of the Administrator, at least one of the following visual references for the intended runway is distinctly visible and identifiable to the pilot:

        (i) The approach light system, except that the pilot may not descend below 100 feet above the touchdown zone elevation using the approach lights as a reference unless the red terminating bars or the red side row bars are also distinctly visible and identifiable.

        (ii) The threshold.

        (iii) The threshold markings.

        (iv) The threshold lights.

        (v) The runway end identifier lights.

        (vi) The visual approach slope indicator.

        (vii) The touchdown zone or touchdown zone markings.

        (viii) The touchdown zone lights.

        (ix) The runway or runway markings.

        (x) The runway lights.

        (e) A pilot may begin the final approach segment of an instrument approach procedure, or continue that approach procedure, at an airport when the visibility is reported to be less than the visibility minimums prescribed for that procedure if the pilot uses an operable EFVS in accordance with § 91.176 of this chapter and the certificate holder's operations specifications for EFVS operations.

        (f) For the purpose of this section, the final approach segment begins at the final approach fix or facility prescribed in the instrument approach procedure. When a final approach fix is not prescribed for a procedure that includes a procedure turn, the final approach segment begins at the point where the procedure turn is completed and the aircraft is established inbound toward the airport on the final approach course within the distance prescribed in the procedure.

        (g) Unless otherwise authorized in the certificate holder's operations specifications, each pilot making an IFR takeoff, approach, or landing at a foreign airport shall comply with the applicable instrument approach procedures and weather minimums prescribed by the authority having jurisdiction over the airport.

        § 121.652   Landing weather minimums: IFR: All certificate holders.

#### § § 121.652

        (a) If the pilot in command of an airplane has not served 100 hours as pilot in command in operations under this part in the type of airplane he is operating, the MDA or DA/DH and visibility landing minimums in the certificate holder's operations specification for regular, provisional, or refueling airports are increased by 100 feet and one-half mile (or the RVR equivalent). The MDA or DA/DH and visibility minimums need not be increased above those applicable to the airport when used as an alternate airport, but in no event may the landing minimums be less than 300 and 1. However, a Pilot in command employed by a certificate holder conducting operations in large aircraft under part 135 of this chapter, may credit flight time acquired in operations conducted for that operator under part 91 in the same type airplane for up to 50 percent of the 100 hours of pilot in command experience required by this paragraph.

        (b) The 100 hours of pilot in command experience required by paragraph (a) of this section may be reduced (not to exceed 50 percent) by substituting one landing in operations under this part in the type of airplane for 1 required hour of pilot in command experience, if the pilot has at least 100 hours as pilot in command of another type airplane in operations under this part.

        (c) Category II minimums and the sliding scale when authorized in the certificate holder's operations specifications do not apply until the pilot in command subject to paragraph (a) of this section meets the requirements of that paragraph in the type of airplane he is operating.

        § 121.655   Applicability of reported weather minimums.

#### § § 121.655

        In conducting operations under §§ 121.649 through 121.653, the ceiling and visibility values in the main body of the latest weather report control for VFR and IFR takeoffs and landings and for instrument approach procedures on all runways of an airport. However, if the latest weather report, including an oral report from the control tower, contains a visibility value specified as runway visibility or runway visual range for a particular runway of an airport, that specified value controls for VFR and IFR landings and takeoffs and straight-in instrument approaches for that runway.

        § 121.657   Flight altitude rules.

#### § § 121.657

        (a)  Notwithstanding § 91.119 or any rule applicable outside the United States, no person may operate an aircraft below the minimums set forth in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, except when necessary for takeoff or landing, or except when, after considering the character of the terrain, the quality and quantity of meteorological services, the navigational facilities available, and other flight conditions, the Administrator prescribes other minimums for any route or part of a route where he finds that the safe conduct of the flight requires other altitudes. Outside of the United States the minimums prescribed in this section are controlling unless higher minimums are prescribed in the certificate holder's operations specifications or by the foreign country over which the aircraft is operating.

        (b)  No certificate holder conducting domestic operations may operate a passenger-carrying aircraft and no certificate holder conducting flag or supplemental operations may operate any aircraft under VFR during the day at an altitude less than 1,000 feet above the surface or less than 1,000 feet from any mountain, hill, or other obstruction to flight.

        (c)  No person may operate an aircraft under IFR including over-the-top or at night under VFR at an altitude less than 1,000 feet above the highest obstacle within a horizontal distance of five miles from the center of the intended course, or, in designated mountainous areas, less than 2,000 feet above the highest obstacle within a horizontal distance of five miles from the center of the intended course.

        (d)  A person may conduct day over-the-top operations in an airplane at flight altitudes lower than the minimum en route IFR altitudes if—

        (1) The operation is conducted at least 1,000 feet above the top of lower broken or overcast cloud cover;

        (2) The top of the lower cloud cover is generally uniform and level;

        (3) Flight visibility is at least five miles; and

        (4) The base of any higher broken or overcast cloud cover is generally uniform and level and is at least 1,000 feet above the minimum en route IFR altitude for that route segment.

        § 125.228   Flight data recorders: filtered data.

#### § § 125.228

        (a) A flight data signal is filtered when an original sensor signal has been changed in any way, other than changes necessary to:

        (1) Accomplish analog to digital conversion of the signal;

        (2) Format a digital signal to be DFDR compatible; or

        (3) Eliminate a high frequency component of a signal that is outside the operational bandwidth of the sensor.

        (b) An original sensor signal for any flight recorder parameter required to be recorded under § 125.226 may be filtered only if the recorded signal value continues to meet the requirements of Appendix D or E of this part, as applicable.

        (c) For a parameter described in § 125.226(a) (12) through (17), (42), or (88), or the corresponding parameter in Appendix D of this part, if the recorded signal value is filtered and does not meet the requirements of Appendix D or E of this part, as applicable, the certificate holder must:

        (1) Remove the filtering and ensure that the recorded signal value meets the requirements of Appendix D or E of this part, as applicable; or

        (2) Demonstrate by test and analysis that the original sensor signal value can be reconstructed from the recorded data. This demonstration requires that:

        (i) The FAA determine that the procedure and the test results submitted by the certificate holder as its compliance with paragraph (c)(2) of this section are repeatable; and

        (ii) The certificate holder maintains documentation of the procedure required to reconstruct the original sensor signal value. This documentation is also subject to the requirements of § 125.226(i).

        (d)  Compliance is required as follows:

        (1) No later than October 20, 2011, each operator must determine, for each airplane it operates, whether the airplane's DFDR system is filtering any of the parameters listed in paragraph (c) of this section. The operator must create a record of this determination for each airplane it operates, and maintain it as part of the correlation documentation required by § 125.226(j)(3) of this part.

        (2) For airplanes that are not filtering any listed parameter, no further action is required unless the airplane's DFDR system is modified in a manner that would cause it to meet the definition of filtering on any listed parameter.

        (3) For airplanes found to be filtering a parameter listed in paragraph (c) of this section, the operator must either:

        (i) No later than April 21, 2014, remove the filtering; or

        (ii) No later than April 22, 2013, submit the necessary procedure and test results required by paragraph (c)(2) of this section.

        (4) After April 21, 2014, no aircraft flight data recording system may filter any parameter listed in paragraph (c) of this section that does not meet the requirements of Appendix D or E of this part, unless the certificate holder possesses test and analysis procedures and the test results that have been approved by the FAA. All records of tests, analysis and procedures used to comply with this section must be maintained as part of the correlation documentation required by § 125.226(j)(3) of this part.

        § 135.163   Equipment requirements: Aircraft carrying passengers under IFR.

#### § § 135.163

        No person may operate an aircraft under IFR, carrying passengers, unless it has—

        (a) A vertical speed indicator;

        (b) A free-air temperature indicator;

        (c) A heated pitot tube for each airspeed indicator;

        (d) A power failure warning device or vacuum indicator to show the power available for gyroscopic instruments from each power source;

        (e) An alternate source of static pressure for the altimeter and the airspeed and vertical speed indicators;

        (f) For a single-engine aircraft:

        (1) Two independent electrical power generating sources each of which is able to supply all probable combinations of continuous inflight electrical loads for required instruments and equipment; or

        (2) In addition to the primary electrical power generating source, a standby battery or an alternate source of electric power that is capable of supplying 150% of the electrical loads of all required instruments and equipment necessary for safe emergency operation of the aircraft for at least one hour;

        (g) For multi-engine aircraft, at least two generators or alternators each of which is on a separate engine, of which any combination of one-half of the total number are rated sufficiently to supply the electrical loads of all required instruments and equipment necessary for safe emergency operation of the aircraft except that for multi-engine helicopters, the two required generators may be mounted on the main rotor drive train; and

        (h) Two independent sources of energy (with means of selecting either) of which at least one is an engine-driven pump or generator, each of which is able to drive all required gyroscopic instruments powered by, or to be powered by, that particular source and installed so that failure of one instrument or source, does not interfere with the energy supply to the remaining instruments or the other energy source unless, for single-engine aircraft in all cargo operations only, the rate of turn indicator has a source of energy separate from the bank and pitch and direction indicators. For the purpose of this paragraph, for multi-engine aircraft, each engine-driven source of energy must be on a different engine.

        (i) For the purpose of paragraph (f) of this section, a continuous inflight electrical load includes one that draws current continuously during flight, such as radio equipment, electrically driven instruments, and lights, but does not include occasional intermittent loads.

        § 135.178   Additional emergency equipment.

#### § § 135.178

        No person may operate an airplane having a passenger seating configuration of more than 19 seats, unless it has the additional emergency equipment specified in paragraphs (a) through (l) of this section.

        (a)  Each passenger-carrying landplane emergency exit (other than over-the-wing) that is more than 6 feet from the ground, with the airplane on the ground and the landing gear extended, must have an approved means to assist the occupants in descending to the ground. The assisting means for a floor-level emergency exit must meet the requirements of § 25.809(f)(1) of this chapter in effect on April 30, 1972, except that, for any airplane for which the application for the type certificate was filed after that date, it must meet the requirements under which the airplane was type certificated. An assisting means that deploys automatically must be armed during taxiing, takeoffs, and landings; however, the Administrator may grant a deviation from the requirement of automatic deployment if he finds that the design of the exit makes compliance impractical, if the assisting means automatically erects upon deployment and, with respect to required emergency exits, if an emergency evacuation demonstration is conducted in accordance with § 121.291(a) of this chapter. This paragraph does not apply to the rear window emergency exit of Douglas DC-3 airplanes operated with fewer than 36 occupants, including crewmembers, and fewer than five exits authorized for passenger use.

        (b)  The following must be complied with for each passenger-carrying airplane:

        (1) Each passenger emergency exit, its means of access, and its means of opening must be conspicuously marked. The identity and locating of each passenger emergency exit must be recognizable from a distance equal to the width of the cabin. The location of each passenger emergency exit must be indicated by a sign visible to occupants approaching along the main passenger aisle. There must be a locating sign—

        (i) Above the aisle near each over-the-wing passenger emergency exit, or at another ceiling location if it is more practical because of low headroom;

        (ii) Next to each floor level passenger emergency exit, except that one sign may serve two such exits if they both can be seen readily from that sign; and

        (iii) On each bulkhead or divider that prevents fore and aft vision along the passenger cabin, to indicate emergency exits beyond and obscured by it, except that if this is not possible, the sign may be placed at another appropriate location.

        (2) Each passenger emergency exit marking and each locating sign must meet the following:

        (i) For an airplane for which the application for the type certificate was filed prior to May 1, 1972, each passenger emergency exit marking and each locating sign must be manufactured to meet the requirements of § 25.812(b) of this chapter in effect on April 30, 1972. On these airplanes, no sign may continue to be used if its luminescence (brightness) decreases to below 100 microlamberts. The colors may be reversed if it increases the emergency illumination of the passenger compartment. However, the Administrator may authorize deviation from the 2-inch background requirements if he finds that special circumstances exist that make compliance impractical and that the proposed deviation provides an equivalent level of safety.

        (ii) For an airplane for which the application for the type certificate was filed on or after May 1, 1972, each passenger emergency exit marking and each locating sign must be manufactured to meet the interior emergency exit marking requirements under which the airplane was type certificated. On these airplanes, no sign may continue to be used if its luminescence (brightness) decreases to below 250 microlamberts.

        (c)  Each passenger-carrying airplane must have an emergency lighting system, independent of the main lighting system; however, sources of general cabin illumination may be common to both the emergency and the main lighting systems if the power supply to the emergency lighting system is independent of the power supply to the main lighting system. The emergency lighting system must—

        (1) Illuminate each passenger exit marking and locating sign;

        (2) Provide enough general lighting in the passenger cabin so that the average illumination when measured at 40-inch intervals at seat armrest height, on the centerline of the main passenger aisle, is at least 0.05 foot-candles; and

        (3) For airplanes type certificated after January 1, 1958, include floor proximity emergency escape path marking which meets the requirements of § 25.812(e) of this chapter in effect on November 26, 1984.

        (d)  Except for lights forming part of emergency lighting subsystems provided in compliance with § 25.812(h) of this chapter (as prescribed in paragraph (h) of this section) that serve no more than one assist means, are independent of the airplane's main emergency lighting systems, and are automatically activated when the assist means is deployed, each light required by paragraphs (c) and (h) of this section must:

        (1) Be operable manually both from the flightcrew station and from a point in the passenger compartment that is readily accessible to a normal flight attendant seat;

        (2) Have a means to prevent inadvertent operation of the manual controls;

        (3) When armed or turned on at either station, remain lighted or become lighted upon interruption of the airplane's normal electric power;

        (4) Be armed or turned on during taxiing, takeoff, and landing. In showing compliance with this paragraph, a transverse vertical separation of the fuselage need not be considered;

        (5) Provide the required level of illumination for at least 10 minutes at the critical ambient conditions after emergency landing; and

        (6) Have a cockpit control device that has an “on,” “off,” and “armed” position.

        (e)  (1) For a passenger-carrying airplane for which the application for the type certificate was filed prior to May 1, 1972, the location of each passenger emergency exit operating handle, and instructions for opening the exit, must be shown by a marking on or near the exit that is readable from a distance of 30 inches. In addition, for each Type I and Type II emergency exit with a locking mechanism released by rotary motion of the handle, the instructions for opening must be shown by—

        (i) A red arrow with a shaft at least three-fourths inch wide and a head twice the width of the shaft, extending along at least 70° of arc at a radius approximately equal to three-fourths of the handle length; and

        (ii) The word “open” in red letters 1 inch high placed horizontally near the head of the arrow.

        (2) For a passenger-carrying airplane for which the application for the type certificate was filed on or after May 1, 1972, the location of each passenger emergency exit operating handle and instructions for opening the exit must be shown in accordance with the requirements under which the airplane was type certificated. On these airplanes, no operating handle or operating handle cover may continue to be used if its luminescence (brightness) decreases to below 100 microlamberts.

        (f)  Access to emergency exits must be provided as follows for each passenger-carrying airplane:

        (1) Each passageway between individual passenger areas, or leading to a Type I or Type II emergency exit, must be unobstructed and at least 20 inches wide.

        (2) There must be enough space next to each Type I or Type II emergency exit to allow a crewmember to assist in the evacuation of passengers without reducing the unobstructed width of the passageway below that required in paragraph (f)(1) of this section; however, the Administrator may authorize deviation from this requirement for an airplane certificated under the provisions of part 4b of the Civil Air Regulations in effect before December 20, 1951, if he finds that special circumstances exist that provide an equivalent level of safety.

        (3) There must be access from the main aisle to each Type III and Type IV exit. The access from the aisle to these exits must not be obstructed by seats, berths, or other protrusions in a manner that would reduce the effectiveness of the exit. In addition, for a transport category airplane type certificated after January 1, 1958, there must be placards installed in accordance with § 25.813(c)(3) of this chapter for each Type III exit after December 3, 1992.

        (4) If it is necessary to pass through a passageway between passenger compartments to reach any required emergency exit from any seat in the passenger cabin, the passageway must not be obstructed. Curtains may, however, be used if they allow free entry through the passageway.

        (5) No door may be installed in any partition between passenger compartments.

        (6) If it is necessary to pass through a doorway separating the passenger cabin from other areas to reach a required emergency exit from any passenger seat, the door must have a means to latch it in the open position, and the door must be latched open during each takeoff and landing. The latching means must be able to withstand the loads imposed upon it when the door is subjected to the ultimate inertia forces, relative to the surrounding structure, listed in § 25.561(b) of this chapter.

        (g)  Each passenger emergency exit and the means of opening that exit from the outside must be marked on the outside of the airplane. There must be a 2-inch colored band outlining each passenger emergency exit on the side of the fuselage. Each outside marking, including the band, must be readily distinguishable from the surrounding fuselage area by contrast in color. The markings must comply with the following:

        (1) If the reflectance of the darker color is 15 percent or less, the reflectance of the lighter color must be at least 45 percent.

        (2) If the reflectance of the darker color is greater than 15 percent, at least a 30 percent difference between its reflectance and the reflectance of the lighter color must be provided.

        (3) Exits that are not in the side of the fuselage must have the external means of opening and applicable instructions marked conspicuously in red or, if red is inconspicuous against the background color, in bright chrome yellow and, when the opening means for such an exit is located on only one side of the fuselage, a conspicuous marking to that effect must be provided on the other side. “Reflectance” is the ratio of the luminous flux reflected by a body to the luminous flux it receives.

        (h)  (1) Each passenger-carrying airplane must be equipped with exterior lighting that meets the following requirements:

        (i) For an airplane for which the application for the type certificate was filed prior to May 1, 1972, the requirements of § 25.812 (f) and (g) of this chapter in effect on April 30, 1972.

        (ii) For an airplane for which the application for the type certificate was filed on or after May 1, 1972, the exterior emergency lighting requirements under which the airplane was type certificated.

        (2) Each passenger-carrying airplane must be equipped with a slip-resistant escape route that meets the following requirements:

        (i) For an airplane for which the application for the type certificate was filed prior to May 1, 1972, the requirements of § 25.803(e) of this chapter in effect on April 30, 1972.

        (ii) For an airplane for which the application for the type certificate was filed on or after May 1, 1972, the slip-resistant escape route requirements under which the airplane was type certificated.

        (i)  Each floor level door or exit in the side of the fuselage (other than those leading into a cargo or baggage compartment that is not accessible from the passenger cabin) that is 44 or more inches high and 20 or more inches wide, but not wider than 46 inches, each passenger ventral exit (except the ventral exits on Martin 404 and Convair 240 airplanes), and each tail cone exit, must meet the requirements of this section for floor level emergency exits. However, the Administrator may grant a deviation from this paragraph if he finds that circumstances make full compliance impractical and that an acceptable level of safety has been achieved.

        (j)  Approved emergency exits in the passenger compartments that are in excess of the minimum number of required emergency exits must meet all of the applicable provisions of this section, except paragraphs (f) (1), (2), and (3) of this section, and must be readily accessible.

        (k) On each large passenger-carrying turbojet-powered airplane, each ventral exit and tailcone exit must be—

        (1) Designed and constructed so that it cannot be opened during flight; and

        (2) Marked with a placard readable from a distance of 30 inches and installed at a conspicuous location near the means of opening the exit, stating that the exit has been designed and constructed so that it cannot be opened during flight.

        (l)  No person may operate a passenger-carrying airplane unless it is equipped with flashlight stowage provisions accessible from each flight attendant seat.

        (a) Whenever a person operating an aircraft under this part is required to use a weather report or forecast, that person shall use that of the U.S. National Weather Service, a source approved by the U.S. National Weather Service, or a source approved by the Administrator. However, for operations under VFR, the pilot in command may, if such a report is not available, use weather information based on that pilot's own observations or on those of other persons competent to supply appropriate observations.

        (b) For the purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, weather observations made and furnished to pilots to conduct IFR operations at an airport must be taken at the airport where those IFR operations are conducted, unless the Administrator issues operations specifications allowing the use of weather observations taken at a location not at the airport where the IFR operations are conducted. The Administrator issues such operations specifications when, after investigation by the U.S. National Weather Service and the responsible Flight Standards office, it is found that the standards of safety for that operation would allow the deviation from this paragraph for a particular operation for which an air carrier operating certificate or operating certificate has been issued.

#### § § 135.215

        (a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b), (c) and (d) of this section, no person may operate an aircraft under IFR outside of controlled airspace or at any airport that does not have an approved standard instrument approach procedure.

        (b) The Administrator may issue operations specifications to the certificate holder to allow it to operate under IFR over routes outside controlled airspace if—

        (1) The certificate holder shows the Administrator that the flight crew is able to navigate, without visual reference to the ground, over an intended track without deviating more than 5 degrees or 5 miles, whichever is less, from that track; and

        (2) The Administrator determines that the proposed operations can be conducted safely.

        (c) A person may operate an aircraft under IFR outside of controlled airspace if the certificate holder has been approved for the operations and that operation is necessary to—

        (1) Conduct an instrument approach to an airport for which there is in use a current approved standard or special instrument approach procedure; or

        (2) Climb into controlled airspace during an approved missed approach procedure; or

        (3) Make an IFR departure from an airport having an approved instrument approach procedure.

        (d) The Administrator may issue operations specifications to the certificate holder to allow it to depart at an airport that does not have an approved standard instrument approach procedure when the Administrator determines that it is necessary to make an IFR departure from that airport and that the proposed operations can be conducted safely. The approval to operate at that airport does not include an approval to make an IFR approach to that airport.

        § 135.217   IFR: Takeoff limitations.

#### § § 135.217

        No person may takeoff an aircraft under IFR from an airport where weather conditions are at or above takeoff minimums but are below authorized IFR landing minimums unless there is an alternate airport within 1 hour's flying time (at normal cruising speed, in still air) of the airport of departure.

        § 135.219   IFR: Destination airport weather minimums.

#### § § 135.219

        No person may take off an aircraft under IFR or begin an IFR or over-the-top operation unless the latest weather reports or forecasts, or any combination of them, indicate that weather conditions at the estimated time of arrival at the next airport of intended landing will be at or above authorized IFR landing minimums.

        § 135.221   IFR: Alternate airport weather minimums.

#### § § 135.221

        (a)  No person may designate an alternate airport unless the weather reports or forecasts, or any combination of them, indicate that the weather conditions will be at or above authorized alternate airport landing minimums for that airport at the estimated time of arrival.

        (b)  Unless otherwise authorized by the Administrator, no person may include an alternate airport in an IFR flight plan unless appropriate weather reports or weather forecasts, or a combination of them, indicate that, at the estimated time of arrival at the alternate airport, the ceiling and visibility at that airport will be at or above the following weather minimums—

        (1) If, for the alternate airport, an instrument approach procedure has been published in part 97 of this chapter or a special instrument approach procedure has been issued by the FAA to the certificate holder, the ceiling is 200 feet above the minimum for the approach to be flown, and visibility is at least 1 statute mile but never less than the minimum visibility for the approach to be flown.

        (2) If, for the alternate airport, no instrument approach procedure has been published in part 97 of this chapter and no special instrument approach procedure has been issued by the FAA to the certificate holder, the ceiling and visibility minimums are those allowing descent from the minimum enroute altitude (MEA), approach, and landing under basic VFR.

#### § § 135.225

        (a) Except to the extent permitted by paragraphs (b) and (j) of this section, no pilot may begin an instrument approach procedure to an airport unless—

        (1) That airport has a weather reporting facility operated by the U.S. National Weather Service, a source approved by U.S. National Weather Service, or a source approved by the Administrator; and

        (2) The latest weather report issued by that weather reporting facility indicates that weather conditions are at or above the authorized IFR landing minimums for that airport.

        (b) A pilot conducting an eligible on-demand operation may begin and conduct an instrument approach procedure to an airport that does not have a weather reporting facility operated by the U.S. National Weather Service, a source approved by the U.S. National Weather Service, or a source approved by the Administrator if—

        (1) The alternate airport has a weather reporting facility operated by the U.S. National Weather Service, a source approved by the U.S. National Weather Service, or a source approved by the Administrator; and

        (2) The latest weather report issued by the weather reporting facility includes a current local altimeter setting for the destination airport. If no local altimeter setting for the destination airport is available, the pilot may use the current altimeter setting provided by the facility designated on the approach chart for the destination airport.

        (c) Except as provided in paragraph (j) of this section, no pilot may begin the final approach segment of an instrument approach procedure to an airport unless the latest weather reported by the facility described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section indicates that weather conditions are at or above the authorized IFR landing minimums for that procedure.

        (d) Except as provided in paragraph (j) of this section, a pilot who has begun the final approach segment of an instrument approach to an airport under paragraph (c) of this section, and receives a later weather report indicating that conditions have worsened to below the minimum requirements, may continue the approach only if the following conditions are met—

        (1) The later weather report is received when the aircraft is in one of the following approach phases:

        (i) The aircraft is on an ILS final approach and has passed the final approach fix;

        (ii) The aircraft is on an ASR or PAR final approach and has been turned over to the final approach controller; or

        (iii) The aircraft is on a non-precision final approach and the aircraft—

        (A) Has passed the appropriate facility or final approach fix; or

        (B) Where a final approach fix is not specified, has completed the procedure turn and is established inbound toward the airport on the final approach course within the distance prescribed in the procedure; and

        (2) The pilot in command finds, on reaching the authorized MDA or DA/DH, that the actual weather conditions are at or above the minimums prescribed for the procedure being used.

        (e) The MDA or DA/DH and visibility landing minimums prescribed in part 97 of this chapter or in the operator's operations specifications are increased by 100 feet and   mile respectively, but not to exceed the ceiling and visibility minimums for that airport when used as an alternate airport, for each pilot in command of a turbine-powered airplane who has not served at least 100 hours as pilot in command in that type of airplane.

        (f) Each pilot making an IFR takeoff or approach and landing at a military or foreign airport shall comply with applicable instrument approach procedures and weather minimums prescribed by the authority having jurisdiction over that airport. In addition, unless authorized by the certificate holder's operations specifications, no pilot may, at that airport—

        (1) Take off under IFR when the visibility is less than 1 mile; or

        (2) Make an instrument approach when the visibility is less than   mile.

        (g) If takeoff minimums are specified in part 97 of this chapter for the take- off airport, no pilot may take off an aircraft under IFR when the weather conditions reported by the facility described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section are less than the takeoff minimums specified for the takeoff airport in part 97 or in the certificate holder's operations specifications.

        (h) Except as provided in paragraph (i) of this section, if takeoff minimums are not prescribed in part 97 of this chapter for the takeoff airport, no pilot may takeoff an aircraft under IFR when the weather conditions reported by the facility described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section are less than that prescribed in part 91 of this chapter or in the certificate holder's operations specifications.

        (i) At airports where straight-in instrument approach procedures are authorized, a pilot may takeoff an aircraft under IFR when the weather conditions reported by the facility described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section are equal to or better than the lowest straight-in landing minimums, unless otherwise restricted, if—

        (1) The wind direction and velocity at the time of takeoff are such that a straight-in instrument approach can be made to the runway served by the instrument approach;

        (2) The associated ground facilities upon which the landing minimums are predicated and the related airborne equipment are in normal operation; and

        (3) The certificate holder has been approved for such operations.

        (j) A pilot may begin an instrument approach procedure, or continue an approach, at an airport when the visibility is reported to be less than the visibility minimums prescribed for that procedure if the pilot uses an operable EFVS in accordance with § 91.176 of this chapter and the certificate holder's operations specifications for EFVS operations.

        (2) Whenever the Administrator finds that revisions are necessary for the continued adequacy of duty period limitation and rest requirement procedures that are required by paragraph (c)(1) of this section and that had been granted final approval, the certificate holder must, after notification by the Administrator, make any changes in the procedures that are found necessary by the Administrator. Within 30 days after the certificate holder receives such notice, it may file a petition to reconsider the notice with the responsible Flight Standards office. The filing of a petition to reconsider stays the notice, pending decision by the Administrator. However, if the Administrator finds that there is an emergency that requires immediate action in the interest of safety, the Administrator may, upon a statement of the reasons, require a change effective without stay.

For the purposes of this paragraph (b), type, as to an airplane means any one of a group of airplanes determined by the Administrator to have a similar means of propulsion, the same manufacturer, and no significantly different handling or flight characteristics. For the purposes of this paragraph (b), type, as to a helicopter, means a basic make and model.

        (c) Each competency check given in a rotorcraft or powered-lift must include a demonstration of the pilot's ability to maneuver the rotorcraft or powered-lift solely by reference to instruments. The check must determine the pilot's ability to safely maneuver the rotorcraft or powered-lift into visual meteorological conditions following an inadvertent encounter with instrument meteorological conditions. For competency checks in non-IFR-certified rotorcraft or powered-lift, the pilot must perform such maneuvers as are appropriate to the rotorcraft's or powered-lift's installed equipment, the certificate holder's operations specifications, and the operating environment.

        (d) The instrument proficiency check required by § 135.297 may be substituted for the competency check required by this section for the type of aircraft used in the check.

        (e) For the purpose of this part, competent performance of a procedure or maneuver by a person to be used as a pilot requires that the pilot be the obvious master of the aircraft, with the successful outcome of the maneuver never in doubt.

        (f) The Administrator or authorized check pilot certifies the competency of each pilot who passes the knowledge or flight check in the certificate holder's pilot records.

        (g) Portions of a required competency check may be given in an aircraft simulator or other appropriate training device, if approved by the Administrator.

        (h) Rotorcraft pilots must be tested on the subjects in paragraph (a)(9) of this section when taking a written or oral knowledge test after April 22, 2015. Rotorcraft pilots must be checked on the maneuvers and procedures in paragraph (c) of this section when taking a competency check after April 22, 2015.

        (i) If the certificate holder is authorized to conduct EFVS operations, the competency check in paragraph (b) of this section must include tasks appropriate to the EFVS operations the certificate holder is authorized to conduct.

        (a) This subpart prescribes airplane performance operating limitations applicable to the operation of the categories of airplanes listed in § 135.363 when operated under this part.

        (b) For the purpose of this subpart,  for landing means the distance from the point at which the obstruction clearance plane associated with the approach end of the runway intersects the centerline of the runway to the far end of the runway.

        (c) For the purpose of this subpart,  means a plane sloping upward from the runway at a slope of 1:20 to the horizontal, and tangent to or clearing all obstructions within a specified area surrounding the runway as shown in a profile view of that area. In the plan view, the centerline of the specified area coincides with the centerline of the runway, beginning at the point where the _obstruction clearance plane_ intersects the centerline of the runway and proceeding to a point at least 1,500 feet from the beginning point. After that the centerline coincides with the takeoff path over the ground for the runway (in the case of takeoffs) or with the instrument approach counterpart (for landings), or, where the applicable one of these paths has not been established, it proceeds consistent with turns of at least 4,000-foot radius until a point is reached beyond which the obstruction clearance plane clears all obstructions. This area extends laterally 200 feet on each side of the centerline at the point where the obstruction clearance plane intersects the runway and continues at this width to the end of the runway; then it increases uniformly to 500 feet on each side of the centerline at a point 1,500 feet from the intersection of the obstruction clearance plane with the runway; after that it extends laterally 500 feet on each side of the centerline.

#### § § 135.363

        (a) Each certificate holder operating a reciprocating engine powered large transport category airplane shall comply with §§ 135.365 through 135.377.

        (b) Each certificate holder operating a turbine engine powered large transport category airplane shall comply with §§ 135.379 through 135.387, except that when it operates a turbopropeller-powered large transport category airplane certificated after August 29, 1959, but previously type certificated with the same number of reciprocating engines, it may comply with §§ 135.365 through 135.377.

        (c) Each certificate holder operating a large nontransport category airplane shall comply with §§ 135.389 through 135.395 and any determination of compliance must be based only on approved performance data. For the purpose of this subpart, a large nontrans- port category airplane is an airplane that was type certificated before July 1, 1942.

        (d) Each certificate holder operating a small transport category airplane shall comply with § 135.397.

        (e) Each certificate holder operating a small nontransport category airplane shall comply with § 135.399.

        (f) The performance data in the Airplane Flight Manual applies in determining compliance with §§ 135.365 through 135.387. Where conditions are different from those on which the performance data is based, compliance is determined by interpolation or by computing the effects of change in the specific variables, if the results of the interpolation or computations are substantially as accurate as the results of direct tests.

        (g) No person may take off a reciprocating engine powered large transport category airplane at a weight that is more than the allowable weight for the runway being used (determined under the runway takeoff limitations of the transport category operating rules of this subpart) after taking into account the temperature operating correction factors in section 4a.749a-T or section 4b.117 of the Civil Air Regulations in effect on January 31, 1965, and in the applicable Airplane Flight Manual.

        (h) The Administrator may author- ize in the operations specifications deviations from this subpart if special circumstances make a literal observ- ance of a requirement unnecessary for safety.

        (i) The 10-mile width specified in §§ 135.369 through 135.373 may be reduced to 5 miles, for not more than 20 miles, when operating under VFR or where navigation facilities furnish reliable and accurate identification of high ground and obstructions located outside of 5 miles, but within 10 miles, on each side of the intended track.

        (j) Each certificate holder operating a commuter category airplane shall comply with § 135.398.

        § 135.365   Large transport category airplanes: Reciprocating engine powered: Weight limitations.

#### § § 135.365

        (a) No person may take off a reciprocating engine powered large transport category airplane from an airport located at an elevation outside of the range for which maximum takeoff weights have been determined for that airplane.

        (b) No person may take off a reciprocating engine powered large transport category airplane for an airport of intended destination that is located at an elevation outside of the range for which maximum landing weights have been determined for that airplane.

        (c) No person may specify, or have specified, an alternate airport that is located at an elevation outside of the range for which maximum landing weights have been determined for the reciprocating engine powered large transport category airplane concerned.

        (d) No person may take off a reciprocating engine powered large transport category airplane at a weight more than the maximum authorized takeoff weight for the elevation of the airport.

        (e) No person may take off a reciprocating engine powered large transport category airplane if its weight on arrival at the airport of destination will be more than the maximum authorized landing weight for the elevation of that airport, allowing for normal consumption of fuel and oil en route.

        § 135.367   Large transport category airplanes: Reciprocating engine powered: Takeoff limitations.

#### § § 135.367

        (a) No person operating a reciprocating engine powered large transport category airplane may take off that airplane unless it is possible—

        (1) To stop the airplane safely on the runway, as shown by the accelerate-stop distance data, at any time during takeoff until reaching critical-engine failure speed;

        (2) If the critical engine fails at any time after the airplane reaches critical-engine failure speed V, to continue the takeoff and reach a height of 50 feet, as indicated by the takeoff path data, before passing over the end of the runway; and

        (3) To clear all obstacles either by at least 50 feet vertically (as shown by the takeoff path data) or 200 feet horizontally within the airport boundaries and 300 feet horizontally beyond the boundaries, without banking before reaching a height of 50 feet (as shown by the takeoff path data) and after that without banking more than 15 degrees.

        (b) In applying this section, corrections must be made for any runway gradient. To allow for wind effect, takeoff data based on still air may be corrected by taking into account not more than 50 percent of any reported headwind component and not less than 150 percent of any reported tailwind component.

        § 135.369   Large transport category airplanes: Reciprocating engine powered: En route limitations: All engines operating.

#### § § 135.369

        (a) N*o* person operating a reciprocating engine powered large transport category airplane may take off that airplane at a weight, allowing for normal consumption of fuel and oil, that does not allow a rate of climb (in feet per minute), with all engines operating, of at least 6.90 Vs (that is, the number of feet per minute obtained by multiplying the number of knots by 6.90) at an altitude of a least 1,000 feet above the highest ground or obstruction within ten miles of each side of the intended track.

        (b) This section does not apply to large transport category airplanes certificated under part 4a of the Civil Air Regulations.

        § 135.371   Large transport category airplanes: Reciprocating engine powered: En route limitations: One engine inoperative.

#### § § 135.371

        (a) Except as pr***o***vided in paragraph (b) of this section, no person operating a reciprocating engine powered large transport category airplane may take off that airplane at a weight, allowing for normal consumption of fuel and oil, that does not allow a rate of climb (in feet per minute), with one engine inoperative, of at least (0.079−0.106/N) Vs2 (where N is the number of engines installed and Vs is expressed in knots) at an altitude of least 1,000 feet above the highest ground or obstruction within 10 miles of each side of the intended track. However, for the purposes of this paragraph the rate of climb for transport category airplanes certificated under part 4a of the Civil Air Regulations is 0.026 Vs2.

        (b) In place of the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section, a person may, under an approved procedure, operate a reciprocating engine powered large transport category airplane at an all-engines-operating altitude that allows the airplane to continue, after an engine failure, to an alternate airport where a landing can be made under § 135.377, allowing for normal consumption of fuel and oil. After the assumed failure, the flight path must clear the ground and any obstruction within five miles on each side of the intended track by at least 2,000 feet.

        (c) If an approved procedure under paragraph (b) of this section is used, the certificate holder shall comply with the following:

        (1) The rate ***o***f climb (as prescribed in the Airplane Flight Manual for the appropriate weight and altitude) used in calculating the airplane's flight path shall be diminished by an amount in feet per minute, equal to (0.079−0.106/N) Vs2 (when N is the number of engines installed and Vs is expressed in knots) for airplanes certificated under part 25 of this chapter and by 0.026 Vs2 for airplanes certificated under part 4a of the Civil Air Regulations.

        (2) The all-engines-operating altitude shall be sufficient so that in the event the critical engine becomes inoperative at any point along the route, the flight will be able to proceed to a predetermined alternate airport by use of this procedure. In determining the takeoff weight, the airplane is assumed to pass over the critical obstruction following engine failure at a point no closer to the critical obstruction than the nearest approved navigational fix, unless the Administrator approves a procedure established on a different basis upon finding that adequate operational safeguards exist.

        (3) The airplane must meet the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section at 1,000 feet above the airport used as an alternate in this procedure.

        (4) The procedure must include an approved method of accounting for winds and temperatures that would otherwise adversely affect the flight path.

        (5) In complying with this procedure, fuel jettisoning is allowed if the certificate holder shows that it has an adequate training program, that proper instructions are given to the flight crew, and all other precautions are taken to ensure a safe procedure.

        (6) The certificate holder and the pilot in command shall jointly elect an alternate airport for which the appropriate weather reports or forecasts, or any combination of them, indicate that weather conditions will be at or above the alternate weather minimum specified in the certificate holder's operations specifications for that airport when the flight arrives.

        § 135.373   Part 25 transport category airplanes with four or more engines: Reciprocating engine powered: En route limitations: Two engines inoperative.

#### § § 135.373

        (a) No person may operate an airplane certificated under part 25 and having four or more engines unless—

        (1) There is no place along the intended track that is more than 90 minutes (with all engines operating at cruising power) from an airport that meets § 135.377; or

        (2) It is *o*perated at a weight allowing the airplane, with the two critical engines inoperative, to climb at 0.013 Vs2 feet per minute (that is, the number of feet per minute obtained by multiplying the number of knots squared by 0.013) at an altitude of 1,000 feet above the highest ground or obstruction within 10 miles on each side of the intended track, or at an altitude of 5,000 feet, whichever is higher.

        (b) For the purposes of paragraph (a)(2) of this section, it is assumed that—

        (1) The two engines fail at the point that is most critical with respect to the takeoff weight;

        (2) Consumption of fuel and oil is normal with all engines operating up to the point where the two engines fail with two engines operating beyond that point;

        (3) Where the engines are assumed t*o* fail at an altitude above the prescribed minimum altitude, compliance with the prescribed rate of climb at the prescribed minimum altitude need not be shown during the descent from the cruising altitude to the prescribed minimum altitude, if those requirements can be met once the prescribed minimum altitude is reached, and assuming descent to be along a net flight path and the rate of descent to be 0.013 Vs2 greater than the rate in the approved performance data; and

        (4) If fuel jettisoning is provided, the airplane's weight at the point where the two engines fail is considered to be not less than that which would include enough fuel to proceed to an airport meeting § 135.377 and to arrive at an altitude of at least 1,000 feet directly over that airport.

        § 135.375   Large transport category airplanes: Reciprocating engine powered: Landing limitations: Destination airports.

#### § § 135.375

        (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, no person operating a reciprocating engine powered large transport category airplane may take off that airplane, unless its weight on arrival, allowing for normal consumption of fuel and oil in flight, would allow a full stop landing at the intended destination within 60 percent of the effective length of each runway described below from a point 50 feet directly above the intersection of the obstruction clearance plane and the runway. For the purposes of determining the allowable landing weight at the destination airport the following is assumed:

        (1) The airplane is landed on the most favorable runway and in the most favorable direction in still air.

        (2) The airplane is landed on the most suitable runway considering the probable wind velocity and direction (forecast for the expected time of arrival), the ground handling characteristics of the type of airplane, and other conditions such as landing aids and terrain, and allowing for the effect of the landing path and roll of not more than 50 percent of the headwind component or not less than 150 percent of the tailwind component.

        (b) An airplane that would be prohibited from being taken off because it could not meet paragraph (a)(2) of this section may be taken off if an alternate airport is selected that meets all of this section except that the airplane can accomplish a full stop landing within 70 percent of the effective length of the runway.

        § 135.377   Large transport category airplanes: Reciprocating engine powered: Landing limitations: Alternate airports.

#### § § 135.377

        No person may list an airport as an alternate airport in a flight plan unless the airplane (at the weight anticipated at the time of arrival at the airport), based on the assumptions in § 135.375(a) (1) and (2), can be brought to a full stop landing within 70 percent of the effective length of the runway.

        § 135.379   Large transport category airplanes: Turbine engine powered: Takeoff limitations.

#### § § 135.379

        (a) No person operating a turbine engine powered large transport category airplane may take off that airplane at a weight greater than that listed in the Airplane Flight Manual for the elevation of the airport and for the ambient temperature existing at take- off.

        (b) No person operating a turbine engine powered large transport category airplane certificated after August 26, 1957, but before August 30, 1959 (SR422, 422A), may take off that airplane at a weight greater than that listed in the Airplane Flight Manual for the minimum distance required for takeoff. In the case of an airplane certificated after September 30, 1958 (SR422A, 422B), the takeoff distance may include a clearway distance but the clearway distance included may not be greater than one-half of the takeoff run.

        (c) No person operating a turbine engine powered large transport category airplane certificated after August 29, 1959 (SR422B), may take off that airplane at a weight greater than that listed in the Airplane Flight Manual at which compliance with the following may be shown:

        (1) The accelerate-stop distance, as defined in § 25.109 of this chapter, must not exceed the length of the runway plus the length of any stopway.

        (2) The takeoff distance must not exceed the length of the runway plus the length of any clearway except that the length of any clearway included must not be greater than one-half the length of the runway.

        (3) The takeoff run must not be greater than the length of the runway.

        (d) No person operating a turbine engine powered large transport category airplane may take off that airplane at a weight greater than that listed in the Airplane Flight Manual—

        (1) For an airplane certificated after August 26, 1957, but before October 1, 1958 (SR422), that allows a takeoff path that clears all obstacles either by at least (35 + 0.01 D) feet vertically (D is the distance along the intended flight path from the end of the runway in feet), or by at least 200 feet horizontally within the airport boundaries and by at least 300 feet horizontally after passing the boundaries; or

        (2) For an airplane certificated after September 30, 1958 (SR422A, 422B), that allows a net takeoff flight path that clears all obstacles either by a height of at least 35 feet vertically, or by at least 200 feet horizontally within the airport boundaries and by at least 300 feet horizontally after passing the boundaries.

        (e) In determining maximum weights, minimum distances, and flight paths under paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section, correction must be made for the runway to be used, the elevation of the airport, the effective runway gradient, the ambient temperature and wind component at the time of takeoff, and, if operating limitations exist for the minimum distances required for takeoff from wet runways, the runway surface condition (dry or wet). Wet runway distances associated with grooved or porous friction course runways, if provided in the Airplane Flight Manual, may be used only for runways that are grooved or treated with a porous friction course (PFC) overlay, and that the operator determines are designed, constructed, and maintained in a manner acceptable to the Administrator.

        (f) For the purposes of this section, it is assumed that the airplane is not banked before reaching a height of 50 feet, as shown by the takeoff path or net takeoff flight path data (as appropriate) in the Airplane Flight Manual, and after that the maximum bank is not more than 15 degrees.

        (g) For the purposes of this section, the terms,  have the same meanings as set forth in the rules under which the airplane was certificated.

        § 135.381   Large transport category airplanes: Turbine engine powered: En route limitations: One engine inoperative.

#### § § 135.381

        (a) No person operating a turbine engine powered large transport category airplane may take off that airplane at a weight, allowing for normal consumption of fuel and oil, that is greater than that which (under the approved, one engine inoperative, en route net flight path data in the Airplane Flight Manual for that airplane) will allow compliance with paragraph (a) (1) or (2) of this section, based on the ambient temperatures expected en route.

        (2) The net flight path allows the airplane to continue flight from the cruising altitude to an airport where a landing can be made under § 135.387 clearing all terrain and obstructions within five statute miles of the intended track by at least 2,000 feet vertically and with a positive slope at 1,000 feet above the airport where the airplane lands after an engine fails, or, if that airplane was certificated after September 30, 1958 (SR422A, 422B), with a positive slope at 1,500 feet above the airport where the airplane lands after an engine fails.

        (b) For the purpose of paragraph (a)(2) of this section, it is assumed that—

        (1) The engine fails at the most critical point en route;

        (2) The airplane passes over the critical obstruction, after engine failure at a point that is no closer to the obstruction than the approved navigation fix, unless the Administrator authorizes a different procedure based on adequate operational safeguards;

        (3) An approved method is used to allow for adverse winds;

        (4) Fuel jettisoning will be allowed if the certificate holder shows that the crew is properly instructed, that the training program is adequate, and that all other precautions are taken to ensure a safe procedure;

        (5) The alternate airport is selected and meets the prescribed weather minimums; and

        (6) The consumption of fuel and oil after engine failure is the same as the consumption that is allowed for in the approved net flight path data in the Airplane Flight Manual.

        (2) Its weight, according to the two-engine-inoperative, en route, net flight path data in the Airplane Flight Manual, allows the airplane to fly from the point where the two engines are assumed to fail simultaneously to an airport that meets § 135.387, with a net flight path (considering the ambient temperature anticipated along the track) having a positive slope at an altitude of at least 1,000 feet above all terrain and obstructions within five statute miles on each side of the intended track, or at an altitude of 5,000 feet, whichever is higher.

        (b) Airplanes certificated after September 30, 1958, but before August 30, 1959 (SR422A). No person may operate a turbine engine powered large transport category airplane along an intended route unless that person complies with either of the following:

        (1) There is no place along the intended track that is more than 90 minutes (with all engines operating at cruising power) from an airport that meets § 135.387.

        (2) Its weight, according to the two-engine-inoperative, en route, net flight path data in the Airplane Flight Manual allows the airplane to fly from the point where the two engines are assumed to fail simultaneously to an airport that meets § 135.387 with a net flight path (considering the ambient temperatures anticipated along the track) having a positive slope at an altitude of at least 1,000 feet above all terrain and obstructions within five statute miles on each side of the intended track, or at an altitude of 2,000 feet, whichever is higher.

        (iii) Fuel jettisoning will be approved if the certificate holder shows that the crew is properly instructed, that the training program is adequate, and that all other precautions are taken to ensure a safe procedure;

        (iv) The airplane's weight at the point where the two engines are assumed to fail provides enough fuel to continue to the airport, to arrive at an altitude of at least 1,500 feet directly over the airport, and after that to fly for 15 minutes at cruise power or thrust, or both; and

        (v) The consumption of fuel and oil after the engines fail is the same as the consumption that is allowed for in the net flight path data in the Airplane Flight Manual.

        § 135.385   Large transport category airplanes: Turbine engine powered: Landing limitations: Destination airports.

#### § § 135.385

        (a) No person operating a turbine engine powered large transport category airplane may take off that airplane at a weight that (allowing for normal consumption of fuel and oil in flight to the destination or alternate airport) the weight of the airplane on arrival would exceed the landing weight in the Airplane Flight Manual for the elevation of the destination or alternate airport and the ambient temperature anticipated at the time of landing.

        (b) Except as provided in paragraph (c), (d), (e), or (f) of this section, no person operating a turbine engine powered large transport category airplane may take off that airplane unless its weight on arrival, allowing for normal consumption of fuel and oil in flight (in accordance with the landing distance in the Airplane Flight Manual for the elevation of the destination airport and the wind conditions expected there at the time of landing), would allow a full stop landing at the intended destination airport within 60 percent of the effective length of each runway described below from a point 50 feet above the intersection of the obstruction clearance plane and the runway. For the purpose of determining the allowable landing weight at the destination airport the following is assumed:

        (1) The airplane is landed on the most favorable runway and in the most favorable direction, in still air.

        (2) The airplane is landed on the most suitable runway considering the probable wind velocity and direction and the ground handling characteristics of the airplane, and considering other conditions such as landing aids and terrain.

        (d) Unless, based on a showing of actual operating landing techniques on wet runways, a shorter landing distance (but never less than that required by paragraph (b) of this section) has been approved for a specific type and model airplane and included in the Airplane Flight Manual, no person may take off a turbojet airplane when the appropriate weather reports or forecasts, or any combination of them, indicate that the runways at the destination airport may be wet or slippery at the estimated time of arrival unless the effective runway length at the destination airport is at least 115 percent of the runway length required under paragraph (b) of this section.

        (e) A turbojet airplane that would be prohibited from being taken off because it could not meet paragraph (b)(2) of this section may be taken off if an alternate airport is selected that meets all of paragraph (b) of this section.

        (f) An eligible on-demand operator may take off a turbine engine powered large transport category airplane on an on-demand flight if all of the following conditions exist:

        (1) The operation is permitted by an approved Destination Airport Analysis in that person's operations manual.

        (2) The airplane's weight on arrival, allowing for normal consumption of fuel and oil in flight (in accordance with the landing distance in the Airplane Flight Manual for the elevation of the destination airport and the wind conditions expected there at the time of landing), would allow a full stop landing at the intended destination airport within 80 percent of the effective length of each runway described below from a point 50 feet above the intersection of the obstruction clearance plane and the runway. For the purpose of determining the allowable landing weight at the destination airport, the following is assumed:

        § 135.389   Large nontransport category airplanes: Takeoff limitations.

#### § § 135.389

        (a) No person operating a large nontransport category airplane may take off that airplane at a weight greater than the weight that would allow the airplane to be brought to a safe stop within the effective length of the runway, from any point during the takeoff before reaching 105 percent of minimum control speed (the minimum speed at which an airplane can be safely controlled in flight after an engine becomes inoperative) or 115 percent of the power off stalling speed in the takeoff configuration, whichever is greater.

        (b) For the purposes of this section—

        (1) It may be assumed that takeoff power is used on all engines during the acceleration;

        (2) Not more than 50 percent of the reported headwind component, or not less than 150 percent of the reported tailwind component, may be taken into account;

        (3) The average runway gradient (the difference between the elevations of the endpoints of the runway divided by the total length) must be considered if it is more than one-half of one percent;

        (4) It is assumed that the airplane is operating in standard atmosphere; and

        (5) For takeoff,  means the distance from the end of the runway at which the takeoff is started to a point at which the obstruction clearance plane associated with the other end of the runway intersects the runway centerline.

        § 135.391   Large nontransport category airplanes: En route limitations: One engine inoperative.

#### § § 135.391

        (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, no person operating a large nontransport category airplane may take off that airplane at a weight that does not allow a rate of climb of at least 50 feet a minute, with the critical engine inoperative, at an altitude of at least 1,000 feet above the highest obstruction within five miles on each side of the intended track, or 5,000 feet, whichever is higher.

        (b) Without regard to paragraph (a) of this section, if the Administrator finds that safe operations are not impaired, a person may operate the airplane at an altitude that allows the airplane, in case of engine failure, to clear all obstructions within five miles on each side of the intended track by 1,000 feet. If this procedure is used, the rate of descent for the appropriate weight and altitude is assumed to be 50 feet a minute greater than the rate in the approved performance data. Before approving such a procedure, the Administrator considers the following for the route, route segement, or area concerned:

        (1) The reliability of wind and weather forecasting.

        (2) The location and kinds of navigation aids.

        (3) The prevailing weather conditions, particularly the frequency and amount of turbulence normally encountered.

        (4) Terrain features.

        (5) Air traffic problems.

        (6) Any other operational factors that affect the operations.

        (c) For the purposes of this section, it is assumed that—

        (1) The critical engine is inoperative;

        (2) The propeller of the inoperative engine is in the minimum drag position;

        (3) The wing flaps and landing gear are in the most favorable position;

        (4) The operating engines are operating at the maximum continuous power available;

        (5) The airplane is operating in standard atmosphere; and

        (6) The weight of the airplane is progressively reduced by the anticipated consumption of fuel and oil.

        § 135.393   Large nontransport category airplanes: Landing limitations: Destination airports.

#### § § 135.393

        (a) No person operating a large nontransport category airplane may take off that airplane at a weight that—

        (1) Allowing for anticipated consumption of fuel and oil, is greater than the weight that would allow a full stop landing within 60 percent of the effective length of the most suitable runway at the destination airport; and

        (2) Is greater than the weight allowable if the landing is to be made on the runway—

        (i) With the greatest effective length in still air; and

        (ii) Required by the probable wind, taking into account not more than 50 percent of the headwind component or not less than 150 percent of the tailwind component.

        (b) For the purpose of this section, it is assumed that—

        (1) The airplane passes directly over the intersection of the obstruction clearance plane and the runway at a height of 50 feet in a steady gliding approach at a true indicated airspeed of at least 1.3 V;

        (2) The landing does not require exceptional pilot skill; and

        (3) The airplane is operating in standard atmosphere.

        § 135.395   Large nontransport category airplanes: Landing limitations: Alternate airports.

#### § § 135.395

        No person may select an airport as an alternate airport for a large nontransport category airplane unless that airplane (at the weight anticipated at the time of arrival), based on the assumptions in § 135.393(b), can be brought to a full stop landing within 70 percent of the effective length of the runway.

        § 135.397   Small transport category airplane performance operating limitations.

#### § § 135.397

        (a) No person may operate a reciprocating engine powered small transport category airplane unless that person complies with the weight limitations in § 135.365, the takeoff limitations in § 135.367 (except paragraph (a)(3)), and the landing limitations in §§ 135.375 and 135.377.

        (b) No person may operate a turbine engine powered small transport category airplane unless that person complies with the takeoff limitations in § 135.379 (except paragraphs (d) and (f)) and the landing limitations in §§ 135.385 and 135.387.

        § 135.398   Commuter category airplanes performance operating limitations.

#### § § 135.398

        (a) No person may operate a commuter category airplane unless that person complies with the takeoff weight limitations in the approved Airplane Flight Manual.

        (b) No person may take off an airplane type certificated in the commuter category at a weight greater than that listed in the Airplane Flight Manual that allows a net takeoff flight path that clears all obstacles either by a height of at least 35 feet vertically, or at least 200 feet horizontally within the airport boundaries and by at least 300 feet horizontally after passing the boundaries.

        (c) No person may operate a commuter category airplane unless that person complies with the landing limitations prescribed in §§ 135.385 and 135.387 of this part. For purposes of this paragraph, §§ 135.385 and 135.387 are applicable to all commuter category airplanes notwithstanding their stated applicability to turbine-engine-powered large transport category airplanes.

        (d) In determining maximum weights, minimum distances and flight paths under paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section, correction must be made for the runway to be used, the elevation of the airport, the effective runway gradient, and ambient temperature, and wind component at the time of takeoff.

        (e) For the purposes of this section, the assumption is that the airplane is not banked before reaching a height of 50 feet as shown by the net takeoff flight path data in the Airplane Flight Manual and thereafter the maximum bank is not more than 15 degrees.

        § 136.1   Applicability and definitions.

#### § § 136.1

        (a) This subpart applies to each person operating or intending to operate a commercial air tour in an airplane, powered-lift, or rotorcraft and, when applicable, to all occupants of those aircraft engaged in a commercial air tour. When any requirement of this subpart is more stringent than any other requirement of this chapter, the person operating the commercial air tour must comply with the requirement in this subpart.

        (b) This subpart applies to:

        (1) Part 121 or 135 operators conducting a commercial air tour and holding a part 119 certificate;

        (2) Part 91 operators conducting flights as described in § 119.1(e)(2); and

        (3) Part 91 operators conducting flights as described in 14 CFR 91.146

        (c) This subpart does not apply to operations conducted in balloons, gliders (powered and un-powered), parachutes (powered and un-powered), gyroplanes, or airships.

        (d) For the purposes of this subpart the following definitions apply:

        means a flight conducted for compensation or hire in an airplane, powered-lift, or rotorcraft where a purpose of the flight is sightseeing. The FAA may consider the following factors in determining whether a flight is a commercial air tour for purposes of this subpart:

        (i) Whether there was a holding out to the public of willingness to conduct a sightseeing flight for compensation or hire;

        (ii) Whether the person offering the flight provided a narrative that referred to areas or points of interest on the surface below the route of the flight;

        (iii) The area of operation;

        (iv) How often the person offering the flight conducts such flights;

        (v) The route of the flight;

        (vi) The inclusion of sightseeing flights as part of any travel arrangement package;

        (vii) Whether the flight in question would have been canceled based on poor visibility of the surface below the route of the flight; and

        (viii) Any other factors that the FAA considers appropriate.

        means any person who conducts a commercial air tour.

        means a flotation device used by an aircraft occupant if the aircraft ditches in water. If an inflatable device, it must be un-inflated and ready for its intended use once inflated. In evaluating whether a non-inflatable life preserver is acceptable to the FAA, the operator must demonstrate to the FAA that such a preserver can be used during an evacuation and will allow all passengers to exit the aircraft without blocking the exit. Each occupant must have the physical capacity to wear and inflate the type of device used once briefed by the commercial air tour operator. Seat cushions do not meet this definition.

        means any area on the surface, including water, devoid of any person, structure, vehicle, or vessel.

        means that area of the land adjacent to the water of an ocean, sea, lake, pond, river or tidal basin that is above the high water mark and excludes land areas unsuitable for landing such as vertical cliffs or land intermittently under water during the particular flight.

        means an area that provides the operator reasonable capability to land in an emergency without causing serious injury to persons. These suitable landing areas must be site specific, designated by the operator, and accepted by the FAA.

        (e) In an in-flight emergency requiring immediate action, the pilot in command may deviate from any rule of this subpart to the extent required to meet that emergency.

        (f) Additional requirements for powered-lift operations are set forth in part 194 of this chapter.

#### § § 137.51

        (a) Notwithstanding part 91 of this chapter, an aircraft may be operated over a congested area at altitudes required for the proper accomplishment of the agricultural aircraft operation if the operation is conducted—

        (1) With the maximum safety to persons and property on the surface, consistent with the operation; and

        (2) In accordance with the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section.

        (b) No person may operate an aircraft over a congested area except in accordance with the requirements of this paragraph.

        (1) Prior written approval must be obtained from the appropriate official or governing body of the political subdivision over which the operations are conducted.

        (2) Notice of the intended operation must be given to the public by some effective means, such as daily newspapers, radio, television, or door-to-door notice.

        (3) A plan for each complete operation must be submitted to, and approved by appropriate personnel of the responsible Flight Standards office for the area where the operation is to be conducted. The plan must include consideration of obstructions to flight; the emergency landing capabilities of the aircraft to be used; and any necessary coordination with air traffic control.

        (4) Single engine aircraft must be operated as follows:

        (i) Except for helicopters, no person may take off a loaded aircraft, or make a turnaround over a congested area.

        (ii) No person may operate an aircraft over a congested area below the altitudes prescribed in part 91 of this chapter except during the actual dispensing operation, including the approaches and departures necessary for that operation.

        (iii) No person may operate an aircraft over a congested area during the actual dispensing operation, including the approaches and departures for that operation, unless it is operated in a pattern and at such an altitude that the aircraft can land, in an emergency, without endangering persons or property on the surface.

        (5) Multiengine aircraft must be operated as follows:

        (i) No person may take off a multiengine airplane over a congested area except under conditions that will allow the airplane to be brought to a safe stop within the effective length of the runway from any point on takeoff up to the time of attaining, with all engines operating at normal takeoff power, 105 percent of the minimum control speed with the critical engine inoperative in the takeoff configuration or 115 percent of the power-off stall speed in the takeoff configuration, whichever is greater, as shown by the accelerate stop distance data. In applying this requirement, takeoff data is based upon still-air conditions, and no correction is made for any uphill gradient of 1 percent or less when the percentage is measured as the difference between elevation at the end points of the runway divided by the total length. For uphill gradients greater than 1 percent, the effective takeoff length of the runway is reduced 20 percent for each 1-percent grade.

        (ii) No person may operate a multiengine airplane at a weight greater than the weight that, with the critical engine inoperative, would permit a rate of climb of at least 50 feet per minute at an altitude of at least 1,000 feet above the elevation of the highest ground or obstruction within the area to be worked or at an altitude of 5,000 feet, whichever is higher. For the purposes of this subdivision, it is assumed that the propeller of the inoperative engine is in the minimum drag position; that the wing flaps and landing gear are in the most favorable positions; and that the remaining engine or engines are operating at the maximum continuous power available.

        (iii) No person may operate any multiengine aircraft over a congested area below the altitudes prescribed in part 91 of this chapter except during the actual dispensing operation, including the approaches, departures, and turnarounds necessary for that operation.

### Part 150

**Authority:** Authority: 49 U.S.C. 106(g), 40113, 44715, 47101, 47501-47504.

**Source:** Source: Docket No. 18691, 49 FR 49269, Dec. 18, 1984, unless otherwise noted.

      Subpart A—General Provisions

        § 150.1   Scope and purpose.

#### § § 150.1

        This part prescribes the procedures, standards, and methodology governing the development, submission, and review of airport noise exposure maps and airport noise compatibility programs, including the process for evaluating and approving or disapproving those programs. It prescribes single systems for—(a) measuring noise at airports and surrounding areas that generally provides a highly reliable relationship between projected noise exposure and surveyed reaction of people to noise; and (b) determining exposure of individuals to noise that results from the operations of an airport. This part also identifies those land uses which are normally compatible with various levels of exposure to noise by individuals. It provides technical assistance to airport operators, in conjunction with other local, State, and Federal authorities, to prepare and execute appropriate noise compatibility planning and implementation programs.

        § 150.3   Applicability.

#### § § 150.3

        This part applies to the airport noise compatibility planning activities of the operators of “public use airports,” including heliports, as that term is used in section 47501(2) as amended (49 U.S.C. 47501 ) and as defined in section 47102(17) of 49 U.S.C.

> [Doc. No. FAA-2004-19158, 69 FR 57625, Sept. 24, 2004]

        § 150.5   Limitations of this part.

#### § § 150.5

        (a) Pursuant to 49 U.S.C. 47501  this part provides for airport noise compatibility planning and land use programs necessary to the purposes of those provisions. No submittal of a map, or approval or disapproval, in whole or part, of any map or program submitted under this part is a determination concerning the acceptability or unacceptability of that land use under Federal, State, or local law.

        (b) Approval of a noise compatibility program under this part is neither a commitment by the FAA to financially assist in the implementation of the program, nor a determination that all measures covered by the program are eligible for grant-in-aid funding from the FAA.

        (c) Approval of a noise compatibility program under this part does not by itself constitute an FAA implementing action. A request for Federal action or approval to implement specific noise compatibility measures may be required, and an FAA decision on the request may require an environmental assessment of the proposed action, pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 4332 ) and guidelines.

        (d) Acceptance of a noise exposure map does not constitute an FAA determination that any specific parcel of land lies within a particular noise contour. Responsibility for interpretation of the effects of noise contours upon subjacent land uses, including the relationship between noise contours and specific properties, rests with the sponsor or with other state or local government.

> [Doc. No. 18691, 49 FR 49269, Dec. 18, 1984, as amended by Amdt. 150-4, 69 FR 57625, Sept. 24, 2004]

      Subpart B—Development of Noise Exposure Maps and Noise Compatibility Programs

        § 150.21   Noise exposure maps and related descriptions.

#### § § 150.21

        (a) Each airport operator may after completion of the consultations and public procedure specified under paragraph (b) of this section submit to the Regional Airports Division Manager five copies of the noise exposure map (or revised map) which identifies each noncompatible land use in each area depicted on the map, as of the date of submission, and five copies of a map each with accompanying documentation setting forth—

        (1) The noise exposure based on forecast aircraft operations at the airport for a forecast period that is at least 5 years in the future, beginning after the date of submission (based on reasonable assumptions concerning future type and frequency of aircraft operations, number of nighttime operations, flight patterns, airport layout including any planned airport development, planned land use changes, and demographic changes in the surrounding areas); and

        (2) The nature and extent, if any, to which those forecast operations will affect the compatibility and land uses depicted on the map.

        (b) Each map, and related documentation submitted under this section must be developed and prepared in accordance with appendix A of this part, or an FAA approved equivalent, and in consultation with states, and public agencies and planning agencies whose area, or any portion of whose area, of jurisdiction is within the L 65 dB contour depicted on the map, FAA regional officials, and other Federal officials having local responsibility for land uses depicted on the map. This consultation must include regular aeronautical users of the airport. The airport operator shall certify that it has afforded interested persons adequate opportunity to submit their views, data, and comments concerning the correctness and adequacy of the draft noise exposure map and descriptions of forecast aircraft operations. Each map and revised map must be accompanied by documentation describing the consultation accomplished under this paragraph and the opportunities afforded the public to review and comment during the development of the map. One copy of all written comments received during consultation shall also be filed with the Regional Airports Division Manager.

        (c) The Regional Airports Division Manager acknowledges receipt of noise exposure maps and descriptions and indicates whether they are in compliance with the applicable requirements. The Regional Airports Division Manager publishes in the  a notice of compliance for each such noise exposure map and description, identifying the airport involved. Such notice includes information as to when and where the map and related documentation are available for public inspection.

        (d) The airport operator shall, in accordance with this section, promptly prepare and submit a revised noise exposure map.

        (1) If, after submission of a noise exposure map under paragraph (a) of this section, any change in the operation of the airport would create any “substantial, new noncompatible use” in any area depicted on the map beyond that which is forecast for a period of at least five years after the date of submission, the airport operator shall, in accordance with this section, promptly prepare and submit a revised noise exposure map. A change in the operation of an airport creates a substantial new noncompatible use if that change results in an increase in the yearly day-night average sound level of 1.5 dB or greater in either a land area which was formerly compatible but is thereby made noncompatible under Appendix A (Table 1), or in a land area which was previously determined to be noncompatible under that Table and whose noncompatibility is now significantly increased.

        (2) If, after submission of a noise exposure map under paragraph (a) of this section, any change in the operation of the airport would significantly reduce noise over existing noncompatible uses that is not reflected in either the existing conditions or forecast noise exposure map on file with the FAA, the airport operator shall, in accordance with this section, promptly prepare and submit a revised noise exposure map. A change in the operation of the airport creates a significant reduction in noise over existing noncompatible uses if that change results in a decrease in the yearly day-night average sound level of 1.5 dB or greater in a land area which was formerly noncompatible but is thereby made compatible under Appendix A (Table 1).

        (3) Such updating of the map shall include a reassessment of those areas excluded under section A150.101(e)(5) of Appendix A because of high ambient noise levels.

        (4) If the forecast map is based on assumptions involving recommendations in a noise compatibility program which are subsequently disapproved by the FAA, a revised map must be submitted if revised assumptions would create a substantial, new noncompatible use not indicated on the forecast map. Revised noise exposure maps are subject to the same requirements and procedures as initial submissions of noise exposure maps under this part.

        (e) Each map, or revised map, and description of consultation and opportunity for public comment, submitted to the FAA, must be certified as true and complete under penalty of 18 U.S.C. 1001.

        (f)(1) Title 49, section 47506 provides that no person who acquires property or an interest therein after the date of enactment of the Act in an area surrounding an airport with respect to which a noise exposure map has been submitted under section 47503 of the Act shall be entitled to recover damages with respect to the noise attributable to such airport if such person had actual or constructive knowledge of the existence of such noise exposure map unless, in addition to any other elements for recovery of damages, such person can show that—

        (f)(2) Title 49 section 47506(b) further provides:

        (g) For this purpose, the term  in paragraph (f) of this section means that change or increase in one or more of the four factors which results in a “substantial new noncompatible use” as defined in § 150.21(d), affecting the property in issue. Responsibility for applying or interpreting this provision with respect to specific properties rests with local government.

        § 150.23   Noise compatibility programs.

#### § § 150.23

        (a) Any airport operator who has submitted an acceptable noise exposure map under § 150.21 may, after FAA notice of acceptability and other consultation and public procedure specified under paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, as applicable, submit to the Regional Airports Division Manager five copies of a noise compatibility program.

        (b) An airport operator may submit the noise compatibility program at the same time as the noise exposure map. In this case, the Regional Airports Division Manager will not begin the statutory 180-day review period (for the program) until after FAA reviews the noise exposure map and finds that it and its supporting documentation are in compliance with the applicable requirements.

        (c) Each noise compatibility program must be developed and prepared in accordance with appendix B of this part, or an FAA approved equivalent, and in consultation with FAA regional officials, the officials of the state and of any public agencies and planning agencies whose area, or any portion or whose area, of jurisdiction within the L 65 dB noise contours is depicted on the noise exposure map, and other Federal officials having local responsibility of land uses depicted on the map. Consultation with FAA regional officials shall include, to the extent practicable, informal agreement from FAA on proposed new or modified flight procedures. For air carrier airports, consultation must include any air carriers and, to the extent practicable, other aircraft operators using the airport. For other airports, consultation must include, to the extent practicable, aircraft operators using the airport.

        (d) Prior to and during the development of a program, and prior to submission of the resulting draft program to the FAA, the airport operator shall afford adequate opportunity for the active and direct participation of the States, public agencies and planning agencies in the areas surrounding the airport, aeronautical users of the airport, the airport operator, and the general public to submit their views, data, and comments on the formulation and adequacy of that program. Prior to submitting the program to the FAA, the airport operator shall also provide notice and the opportunity for a public hearing.

        (e) Each noise compatibility program submitted to the FAA must consist of at least the following:

        (1) A copy of the noise exposure map and its supporting documentation as found in compliance with the applicable requirements by the FAA, per § 150.21(c).

        (2) A description and analysis of the alternative measures considered by the airport operator in developing the program, together with a discussion of why each rejected measure was not included in the program.

        (3) Program measures proposed to reduce or eliminate present and future noncompatible land uses and a description of the relative contribution of each of the proposed measures to the overall effectiveness of the program.

        (4) A description of public participation and the consultation with officials of public agencies and planning agencies in areas surrounding the airport, FAA regional officials and other Federal officials having local responsibility for land uses depicted on the map, any air carriers and other users of the airport.

        (5) The actual or anticipated effect of the program on reducing noise exposure to individuals and noncompatible land uses and preventing the introduction of additional noncompatible uses within the area covered by the noise exposure map. The effects must be based on expressed assumptions concerning the type and frequency of aircraft operations, number of nighttime operations, flight patterns, airport layout including planned airport development, planned land use changes, and demographic changes within the L 65 dB noise contours.

        (6) A description of how the proposed future actions may change any noise control or compatibility plans or actions previously adopted by the airport proprietor.

        (7) A summary of the comments at any public hearing on the program and a copy of all written material submitted to the operator under paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, together with the operator's response and disposition of those comments and materials to demonstrate the program is feasible and reasonably consistent with obtaining the objectives of airport noise compatibility planning under this part.

        (8) The period covered by the program, the schedule for implementation of the program, the persons responsible for implementation of each measure in the program, and, for each measure, documentation supporting the feasibility of implementation, including any essential governmental actions, costs, and anticipated sources of funding, that will demonstrate that the program is reasonably consistent with achieving the goals of airport noise compatibility planning under this part.

        (9) Provision for revising the program if made necessary by revision of the noise exposure map.

      Subpart C—Evaluations and Determinations of Effects of Noise Compatibility Programs

        § 150.31   Preliminary review: Acknowledgments.

#### § § 150.31

        (a) Upon receipt of a noise compatibility program submitted under § 150.23, the Regional Airports Division Manager acknowledges to the airport operator receipt of the program and conducts a preliminary review of the submission.

        (b) If, based on the preliminary review, the Regional Airports Division Manager finds that the submission does not conform to the requirements of this part, he disapproves and returns the unacceptable program to the airport operator for reconsideration and development of a program in accordance with this part.

        (c) If, based on the preliminary review, the Regional Airports Division Manager finds that the program conforms to the requirements of this part, the Regional Airports Division Manager publishes in the  a notice of receipt of the program for comment which indicates the following:

        (1) The airport covered by the program, and the date of receipt.

        (2) The availability of the program for examination in the offices of the Regional Airports Division Manager and the airport operator.

        (3) That comments on the program are invited and, will be considered by the FAA.

        (d) The date of signature of the published notice of receipt starts the 180-day approval period for the program.

> [Doc. No. 18691, 49 FR 49269, Dec. 18, 1984, as amended by Amdt. 150-2, 54 FR 39295, Sept. 25, 1989]

        § 150.33   Evaluation of programs.

#### § § 150.33

        (a) The FAA conducts an evaluation of each noise compatibility program and, based on that evaluation, either approves or disapproves the program. The evaluation includes consideration of proposed measures to determine whether they—

        (1) May create an undue burden on interstate or foreign commerce (including unjust discrimination);

        (2) Are reasonably consistent with obtaining the goal of reducing existing noncompatible land uses and preventing the introduction of additional noncompatible land uses; and

        (3) Include the use of new or modified flight procedures to control the operation of aircraft for purposes of noise control, or affect flight procedures in any way.

        (b) The evaluation may also include an evaluation of those proposed measures to determine whether they may adversely affect the exercise of the authority and responsibilities of the Administrator under the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, as amended.

        (c) To the extent considered necessary, the FAA may—

        (1) Confer with the airport operator and other persons known to have information and views material to the evaluation;

        (2) Explore the objectives of the program and the measures, and any alternative measures, for achieving the objectives.

        (3) Examine the program for developing a range of alternatives that would eliminate the reasons, if any, for disapproving the program.

        (4) Convene an informal meeting with the airport operator and other persons involved in developing or implementing the program for the purposes of gathering all facts relevant to the determination of approval or disapproval of the program and of discussing any needs to accommodate or modify the program as submitted.

        (d) If requested by the FAA, the airport operator shall furnish all information needed to complete FAA's review under (c).

        (e) An airport operator may, at any time before approval or disapproval of a program, withdraw or revise the program. If the airport operator withdraws or revises the program or indicates to the Regional Airports Division Manager, in writing, the intention to revise the program, the Regional Airports Division Manager terminates the evaluation and notifies the airport operator of that action. That termination cancels the 180-day review period. The FAA does not evaluate a second program for any airport until any previously submitted program has been withdrawn or a determination on it is issued. A new evaluation is commenced upon receipt of a revised program, and a new 180-day approval period is begun, unless the Regional Airports Division Manager finds that the modification made, in light of the overall revised program, can be integrated into the unmodified portions of the revised program without exceeding the original 180-day approval period or causing undue expense to the government.

> [Doc. No. 18691, 49 FR 49269, Dec. 18, 1984, as amended by Amdt. 150-2, 54 FR 39295, Sept. 25, 1989]

        § 150.35   Determinations; publications; effectivity.

#### § § 150.35

        (a) The FAA issues a determination approving or disapproving each airport noise compatibility program (and revised program). Portions of a program may be individually approved or disapproved. No conditional approvals will be issued. A determination on a program acceptable under this part is issued within 180 days after the program is received under § 150.23 of this part or it may be considered approved, except that this time period may be exceeded for any portion of a program relating to the use of flight procedures for noise control purposes. A determination on portions of a program covered by the exceptions to the 180-day review period for approval will be issued within a reasonable time after receipt of the program. Determinations relating to the use of any flight procedure for noise control purposes may be issued either in connection with the determination on other portions of the program or separately. Except as provided by this paragraph, no approval of any noise compatibility program, or any portion of a program, may be implied in the absence of the FAA's express approval.

        (b) The Administrator approves programs under this part, if—

        (1) It is found that the program measures to be implemented would not create an undue burden on interstate or foreign commerce (including any unjust discrimination) and are reasonably consistent with achieving the goals of reducing existing noncompatible land uses around the airport and of preventing the introduction of additional noncompatible land uses;

        (2) The program provides for revision if made necessary by the revision of the noise map; and

        (3) Those aspects of programs relating to the use of flight procedures for noise control can be implemented within the period covered by the program and without—

        (i) Reducing the level of aviation safety provided;

        (ii) Derogating the requisite level of protection for aircraft, their occupants and persons and property on the ground;

        (iii) Adversely affecting the efficient use and management of the Navigable Airspace and Air Traffic Control Systems; or

        (iv) Adversely affecting any other powers and responsibilities of the Administrator prescribed by law or any other program, standard, or requirement established in accordance with law.

        (c) When a determination is issued, the Regional Airports Division Manager notifies the airport operator and publishes a notice of approval or disapproval in the  identifying the nature and extent of the determination.

        (d) Approvals issued under this part for a program or portion thereof become effective as specified therein and may be withdrawn when one of the following occurs:

        (1) The program or portion thereof is required to be revised under this part or under its own terms, and is not so revised;

        (2) If a revision has been submitted for approval, a determination is issued on the revised program or portion thereof, that is inconsistent with the prior approval.

        (3) A term or condition of the program, or portion thereof, or its approval is violated by the responsible government body.

        (4) A flight procedure or other FAA action upon which the approved program or portion thereof is dependent is subsequently disapproved, significantly altered, or rescinded by the FAA.

        (5) The airport operator requests rescission of the approval.

        (6) Impacts on flight procedures, air traffic management, or air commerce occur which could not be foreseen at the time of approval.

        (e) Determinations may contain conditions which must be satisfied prior to implementation of any portion of the program relating to flight procedures affecting airport or aircraft operations.

        (f) Noise exposure maps for current and forecast year map conditions that are submitted and approved with noise compatibility programs are considered to be the new FAA accepted noise exposure maps for purposes of part 150.

    PART 151—FEDERAL AID TO AIRPORTS

### Part 151

      Subpart A—General Requirements

**Authority:** Authority: 49 U.S.C. 106(g), 40113, 47151, 47153.

        § 151.1   Applicability.

#### § § 151.1

        This part prescribes the policies and procedures for administering the Federal-aid Airport Program under the Federal Airport Act, as amended (49 U.S.C. 1101 ).

> [Doc. No. 1329, 27 FR 12349, Dec. 13, 1962]

        § 151.3   National Airport Plan.

#### § § 151.3

        (a) Under the Federal Airport Act, the FAA prepares each year a “National Airport Plan” for developing public airports in the United States, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and Guam. In terms of general location and type of development, the National Airport Plan specifies the maximum limits of airport development that is necessary to provide a system of public airports adequate to anticipate and meet the needs of civil aeronautics.

        (b) If, within the forecast period, an airport will have a substantial aeronautical necessity, it may be included in the National Airport Plan. Only work on an airport included in the current Plan is eligible for inclusion in the Federal-aid Airport Program to be undertaken within currently available appropriations and authorizations. However, the inclusion of an airport in the National Airport Plan does not commit the United States to include it in the Federal-aid Airport Program. In addition, the local community concerned is not required to proceed with planning or development of an airport included in the National Airport Plan.

> [Amdt. 151-8, 30 FR 8039, June 23, 1965]

        § 151.5   General policies.

#### § § 151.5

        (a)  As used in this part, “airport layout plan” means the basic plan for the layout of an eligible airport that shows, as a minimum—

        (1) The present boundaries of the airport and of the offsite areas that the sponsor owns or controls for airport purposes, and of their proposed additions;

        (2) The location and nature of existing and proposed airport facilities (such as runways, taxiways, aprons, terminal buildings, hangars, and roads) and of their proposed modifications and extensions; and

        (3) The location of existing and proposed non-aviation areas, and of their existing improvements.

        (b)  Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, each advance planning and engineering proposal or airport development project must provide for the planning or development of—

        (1) An airport or unit of an airport that is safe, useful, and usable; or

        (2) An additional facility that increases the safety, usefulness, or usability of an airport.

        (c)  The needs of national defense are fully considered in administering the Federal-aid Airport Program. However, approval of an advance planning and engineering proposal or a project application is limited to planning or airport development necessary for civil aviation.

        (d)  In any case in which airport development can be accomplished more economically under stage construction, federal funds may be programmed in advance for the development over two or more years under two or more grant agreements. In such a case, the FAA makes a tentative allocation of funds for both the current and future fiscal years, rather than allocating the entire federal share in one fiscal year. A grant agreement is made only during the fiscal year in which funds are authorized to be obligated. Advance planning and engineering grants are not made under this paragraph.

> [Amdt. 151-8, 30 FR 8039, June 23, 1965]

        § 151.7   Grants of funds: General policies.

#### § § 151.7

        (a)  The FAA authorizes the expenditure of funds under the Federal-aid Airport Program for airport planning and engineering or for airport development only if the Administrator is satisfied that the sponsor has met or will meet the requirements established by existing and proposed agreements with the United States with respect to any airport that the sponsor owns or controls.

        (1) Agreements with the United States to which this requirement of compliance applies include—

        (i) Any grant agreement made under the Federal-aid Airport Program;

        (ii) Any covenant in a conveyance under section 16 of the Federal Airport Act;

        (iii) Any covenant in a conveyance of surplus airport property either under section 13(g) of the Surplus Property Act (50 U.S.C. App. 1622(g)) or under Regulation 16 of the War Assets Administration; and

        (iv) Any AP-4 agreement made under the terminated Development Landing Areas National Defense Program and the Development Civil Landing Areas Program.

        (2) If it appears that a sponsor has failed to comply with a requirement of an agreement with the United States with respect to an airport, the FAA notifies him of this fact and affords him an opportunity to submit materials to refute the allegation of noncompliance or to achieve compliance.

        (3) If a project is otherwise eligible under the Federal-aid Airport Program, a grant may be made to a sponsor who has not complied with an agreement if the sponsor shows—

        (i) That the noncompliance is caused by factors beyond his control; or

        (ii) That the following circumstances exist:

        () The noncompli_a_nce consisted of a failure, through mistake or ignorance, to perform minor conditions in old agreements with the Federal Government; and

        () The sponsor is taking reasona_b_le action promptly to correct the deficiency or the deficiency relates to an obligation that is no longer required for the safe and efficient use of the airport under existing law and policy.

        (b)  Unless there is otherwise a special need for U.S. participation, the FAA includes an advance planning and engineering proposal or an airport development project in the Federal-aid Airport Program only if—

        (1) The advance planning and engineering proposal involves more than $1,000 in United States funds; and

        (2) The project application involves more than $5,000 in U.S. funds.

        (c)  Unless the Administrator specifically authorizes it, no advance planning and engineering proposal or project application may include any planning, engineering, or construction work included in a prior agreement with the United States obligating the sponsor or any other non-U.S. public agency to do the work, and entitling the sponsor or any other non-United States public agency to payment of U.S. funds for all or part of the work.

        § 151.9   Runway clear zones: General.

#### § § 151.9

        (a) Whenever funds are allocated for developing new runways or landing strips, or to improve or repair existing runways, the sponsor must own, acquire, or agree to acquire, runway clear zones. Exceptions are considered (on the basis of a full statement of facts by the sponsor) upon a showing of uneconomical acquisition costs, or lack of necessity for the acquisition.

        (b) For the purpose of this part, a runway clear zone is an area at ground level which begins at the end of each primary surface defined in § 77.27(a) and extends with the width of each approach surface defined in § 77.27 (b) and (c), to terminate directly below each approach surface slope at the point, or points, where the slope reaches a height of 50 feet above the elevation of the runway or 50 feet above the terrain at the outer extremity of the clear zone, whichever distance is shorter.

        (c) For the purposes of this section, an airport operator or owner is considered to have an adequate property interest if it has an easement (or a covenant running with the land) giving it enough control to rid the clear zone of all obstructions (objects so far as they project above the approach surfaces established by § 77.27 (b) and (c) of part 77 of this chapter), and to prevent the creation of future obstructions; together with the right of entrance and exit for those purposes, to ensure the safe and unrestricted passage of aircraft in and over the area.

> [Doc. No. 1329, 27 FR 12349, Dec. 13, 1962, as amended by Amdt. 151-7, 30 FR 7484, June 8, 1965; Amdt. 151-21, 33 FR 258, Jan. 9, 1968]

        § 151.11   Runway clear zones; requirements.

#### § § 151.11

        (a) In projects involving grants-in-aid under the Federal-aid Airport Program, a sponsor must own, acquire, or agree to acquire an adequate property interest in runway clear zone areas as prescribed in paragraph (b), (c), (d), or (e) of this section, as applicable. Property interests that a sponsor acquires to meet the requirements of this section are eligible for inclusion in the Program.

        (b) On new airports, the sponsor must own, acquire, or agree to acquire adequate property interests in runway clear zone areas (in connection with initial land acquisition) for all eligible runways or landing strips, without substantial deviation from standard configuration and length.

        (c) On existing airports where new runways or landing strips are developed, the sponsor must own, acquire, or agree to acquire adequate property interests in runway clear zone areas for each runway and landing strip to be developed or extended, to the extent that the Administrator determines practical and feasible considering all facts presented by the airport owner or operator, preferably without substantial deviation from standard configuration and length.

        (d) On existing airports where improvements are made to runways or landing strips, the sponsor must own, acquire, or agree to acquire adequate property interests in runway clear zone areas for each runway or landing strip that is to be improved to the extent that the Administrator determines is practical and feasible with regard to standard configuration, length, and property interests, considering all facts presented by the airport owner or operator. Any development that improves a specific runway or landing strip is considered to be a runway improvement, including runway lighting and the developing or lighting of taxiways serving a runway.

        (e) On existing airports where substantial improvements are made that do not benefit a specific runway or landing strip, such as overall grading or drainage, terminal area or building developments, the sponsor must own, acquire, or agree to acquire adequate property interests in runway clear zone areas for the dominant runway or landing strip to the extent that the Administrator determines is practical and feasible, with regard to standard configuration, length, and property interests, considering all facts presented by the airport owner or operator.

        (f) If a sponsor or other public agency shows that it is legally able to prevent the future erection or creation of obstructions in the runway clear zone area, and adopts protective measures to prohibit their future erection or creation, that showing is acceptable for the purposes of paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section in place of an adequate property interest (except for rights required for removing existing obstructions). In such a case, there must be an agreement between the FAA and the sponsor for removing or marking or lighting (to be determined in each case) any existing obstruction to air navigation In each case, the sponsor must furnish information as to the specific height limitations established and as to the current and foreseeable future use of the property to which they apply. The information must include an acceptable legal opinion of the validity of the measures adopted, including a conclusion that the height limitations are not unreasonable in view of current and foreseeable future use of the property, and are a reasonable exercise of the police power, together with the reasons or basis supporting the opinion.

        (g) The authority exercised by the Administrator under paragraphs (b), (c), (d), and (e) of this section to allow a deviation from, or the extent of conformity to, standard configuration or length of runway clear zones, or to determine the adequacy of property interests therein, is also exercised by Regional Directors.

        § 151.13   Federal-aid Airport Program: Policy affecting landing aid requirements.

#### § § 151.13

        (a)  No project for developing or improving an airport may be approved for the Program unless it provides for acquiring or installing such of the following landing aids as the Administrator determines are needed for the safe and efficient use of the airport by aircraft, considering the category of the airport and the type and volume of traffic using it:

        (1) Land needed for installing approach lighting systems (ALS).

        (2) In-runway lighting.

        (3) High intensity runway lighting.

        (4) Runway distance markers.

        (b)  The landing aids set forth in paragraphs (a) (1) through (4) of this section are required for the safe and efficient use of airports by aircraft in the following cases:

        (1) Lands for installing approach lighting systems are required as part of a project if the installing of the components of the system on the airport is in an approved FAA budget, unless the sponsor has already acquired the land necessary for the system or is otherwise undertaking to acquire that land. If the sponsor is otherwise undertaking to acquire the land, the grant agreement for the project must obligate the sponsor to complete the acquisition within a time limit prescribed by the Administrator. The Administrator immediately notifies a sponsor when a budget is approved providing for installing an approach lighting system at the airport concerned.

        (2) In-runway lighting is required as part of a project:

        (i) If the project includes:

        () Construction of _a_ new runway designated by the FAA as an instrument landing runway for which the installation of an IFR precision approach system including ALS and ILS, has been programmed by the FAA with funds then available therefor;

        () An extension of 3,000 feet or more (usa_b_le for landing purposes) of the approach end of a designated instrument landing runway equipped, or programed by the FAA, with funds then available therefor, to be equipped, with an IFR precision approach system including ALS and ILS;

        () Re_c_onstruction of a designated instrument landing runway equipped, or programed by the FAA, with funds then available therefor, to be equipped with an IFR precision approach system including ALS and ILS, if the reconstruction requires the closing of the runway; or

        () Any other airport _d_evelopment on an airport whose designated instrument landing runway is equipped, or programed by the FAA, with funds then available therefor, to be equipped with an IFR precision approach system including ALS and ILS; and

        (ii) Only if a study of the airport shows that in-runway lighting is required for the safe and efficient use of the airport by aircraft, after the Administrator considers the following:

        () The type _a_nd volume of flight activity;

        () Other existing or planned navigational aids;

        () Airport environmental fa_c_tors such as local weather conditions and adjacent geographic profiles;

        () Approach an_d_ departure paths;

        () Eff_e_ct on landing and takeoff minima; and

        () In the case o_f_ projects un_d_er paragraph (b)(2)(i)() of this section, whether installing in-runway lighting requires closing the runway for so long a time that the adverse effect on safety of its closing would outweigh the contribution to safety that would be gained by the in-runway lights or whether it would unduly interfere with the efficiency of aircraft operations.

        (3) High intensity runway edge lighting on the designated instrument landing runway is required as a part of a project whenever that runway is equipped or programmed for the installation of an ILS and high intensity runway edge lights are not then installed on the runway or included in another project. A project for extending a runway that has high intensity runway edge lights on the existing runway requires, as a part of the project, the extension of the high intensity runway edge lights.

        (4) Runway distance markers whose design standards have been approved and published by the FAA are required as a part of a project on a case-by-case basis if, after reviewing the pertinent facts and circumstances of the case, the Administrator determines that they are needed for the safe and efficient use of the airport by aircraft.

        § 151.21   Procedures: Application; general information.

#### § § 151.21

        (a) An eligible sponsor that desires to obtain Federal aid for eligible airport development must submit to the Area Manager of the area in which the sponsor is located (hereinafter in this part referred to as the “Area Manager”), a request on FAA Form 5100-3, accompanied by—

        (1) The sponsor's written statement as to whether the proposed project involves the displacement and relocation of persons residing on land physically acquired or to be acquired for the project development; and

        (2) The sponsor's written assurance, if the project involves displacement and relocation of such persons, that adequate replacement housing will be available or provided for (built, if necessary), without regard to their race, color, religion, sex, or national origin, before the execution of a grant agreement for the project.

        (b) A proposed project is selected for inclusion in a program only if the sponsor has submitted a written assurance when required by paragraph (a)(2) of this section, or if the Administrator has determined that the project does not involve the displacement and relocation of persons residing on land to be physically acquired or to be acquired for the project development. If the Administrator selects a proposed project for inclusion in a program, a tentative allocation of funds is made for it and the sponsor is notified of the allocation. The tentative allocation may be withdrawn if the sponsor fails to submit an acceptable project application as provided in paragraph (c) of this section or fails to proceed diligently with the project, or if adequate replacement housing is not available or provided for in accordance with a written assurance when required by paragraph (a)(2) of this section.

        (c) As soon as practicable after receiving notice of the tentative allocation, the sponsor must submit a project application on FAA Form 1624 to the Area Manager, without changing the language of the form, unless the change is approved in advance by the Administrator. In the case of a joint project, each sponsor executes only those provisions of the project application that apply to it. A sponsor who has executed a grant agreement for a project for the development of an airport under the Program, may, in the Administrator's discretion, submit additional project applications on FAA Form 1624 for further development of that airport.

        § 151.24   Procedures: Application; information on estimated project costs.

#### § § 151.24

        (a) If any part of the estimated project costs consists of the value of donated land, labor, materials, or equipment, or of the value of a property interest in land acquired at a cost that (as represented by the sponsor) is not the actual cost or the amount of an award in eminent domain proceedings, the sponsor must so state in the application, indicating the nature of the donation or other transaction and the value it places on it.

        (b) If, after the grant agreement is executed and before the final payment of the allowable project costs is made under § 151.63, it appears that the sponsor inadvertently or unknowingly failed to comply with paragraph (a) of this section as to any item, the Administrator—

        (1) Makes or obtains an appraisal of the item, and if the appraised value is less than the value placed on the item in the project application, notifies the sponsor that it may, within a stated time, ask in writing for reconsideration of the appraisal and submit statements of pertinent facts and opinion; and

        (2) Adjusts the U.S. share of the project costs to reflect any decrease in value of the item below that stated in the project application.

        § 151.25   Procedures: Application; information as to property interests.

#### § § 151.25

        (a) Each sponsor must state in its application all of the property interests that he holds in the lands to be developed or used as part of, or in connection with, the airport as it will be when the project is completed. Each project application contains a covenant on the part of the sponsor to acquire, before starting construction work, or within a reasonable time if not needed for the construction, property interests satisfactory to the Administrator in all the lands in which it does not hold those property interests at the time it submits the application. In the case of a joint project, any one or more of the sponsors may hold or acquire the necessary property interests. In such a case, each sponsor may show on its application only those property interests that it holds or is to acquire.

        (b) Each sponsor of a project must send with its application a property map (designated as Exhibit A) or incorporate such a map by reference to one in a previous application that was approved. The sponsor must clearly identify on the map all property interests required in paragraph (a) of this section, showing prior and proposed acquisitions for which United States aid is requested under the project.

        (c) For the purposes of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, the property interest that the sponsor must have or agree to obtain, is—

        (1) Title free and clear of any reversionary interest, lien, easement, lease, or other encumbrance that, in the opinion of the Administrator, would create an undue risk that it might deprive the sponsor of possession or control, interfere with its use for public airport purposes, or make it impossible for the sponsor to carry out the agreements and covenants in the application;

        (2) A lease of not less than 20 years granted to the sponsor by another public agency that has title as described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, on terms that the Administrator considers satisfactory; or

        (3) In the case of an offsite area an agreement, easement, leasehold, or other right or property interest that, in the Administrator's opinion, provides reasonable assurance that the sponsor will not be deprived of its right to use the land for the intended purpose during the period necessary to meet the requirements of the grant agreement.

        (d) For the purposes of this section, the word “land” includes landing areas, building areas, runway clear zones, clearways and approach zones, and areas required for offsite construction, entrance roads, drainage, protection of approaches, installation of air navigation facilities, or other airport purposes.

        § 151.26   Procedures: Applications; compatible land use information; consideration of local community interest; relocation of displaced persons.

#### § § 151.26

        (a) Each sponsor must state in its application the action that it has taken to restrict the use of land adjacent to or in the immediate vicinity of the airport to activities and purposes compatible with normal airport operations including landing and take-off of aircraft. The sponsor's statement must include information on—

        (1) Any property interests (such as airspace easements or title to airspace) acquired by the sponsor to assure compatible land use, or to protect or control aerial approaches;

        (2) Any zoning laws enacted or in force restricting the use of land adjacent to or in the vicinity of the airport, or assuring protection or control of aerial approaches, whether or not enacted by the sponsor; and

        (3) Any action taken by the sponsor to induce the appropriate government authority to enact zoning laws restricting the use of land adjacent to or in the vicinity of the airport, or assuring protection or control of aerial approaches, when the sponsor lacks the power to zone the land.

        (b) Each sponsor must submit with his application—

        (1) A written statement—

        (i) Specifying what consideration has been given to the interest of all communities in or near which the project is located; and

        (ii) Containing the substance of any objection to, or approval of, the proposed project made known to the sponsor by any local individual, group or community; and

        (2) A written statement showing that adequate replacement housing that is open to all persons, regardless of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin, is available and has been offered on the same nondiscriminatory basis to persons who have resided on land physically acquired or to be acquired for the project development and who will be displaced thereby.

        § 151.27   Procedures: Application, plans, specifications, and appraisals.

#### § § 151.27

        (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, each sponsor shall incorporate by reference in its project application the final plans and specifications, describing the items of airport development for which it requests United States aid. It must submit the plans and specifications with the application unless they were previously submitted or are submitted with that of another sponsor of the project.

        (b) In special cases, the Administrator authorizes the postponement of the submission of final plans and specifications until a later date to be specified in the grant agreement, if the sponsor has submitted—

        (1) An airport layout plan approved by the Administrator; and

        (2) Preliminary plans and specifications in enough detail to identify all items of development included in the project, and prepared so as to provide for accomplishing the project in accordance with the master plan layout, the rules in subparts B and C and applicable local laws and regulations.

        (c) If the project involves acquiring a property interest in land by donation, or at a cost that (as represented by the sponsor) is not the actual cost or the amount of an award in eminent domain proceedings, the Administrator, before passing on the eligibility of the project makes or obtains an appraisal of the interest. If the appraised value is less than the value placed on the interest by the sponsor (§ 151.23), the Administrator notifies the sponsor that he may within a stated time, ask in writing for reconsideration of the appraisal and submit statements of pertinent facts and opinion.

        § 151.29   Procedures: Offer, amendment, and acceptance.

#### § § 151.29

        (a) Upon approving a project, the Administrator makes an offer to the sponsor to pay the United States share of the allowable project costs. The offer states a definite amount as the maximum obligation of the United States, and is subject to change or withdrawal by the Administrator, in his discretion, at any time before it is accepted.

        (b) If, before the sponsor accepts the offer, it is determined that the maximum obligation of the United States stated in the offer is not enough to pay the United States share of the allowable project costs, the sponsor may request an increase in the amount in the offer, through the Area Manager.

        (c) An official of the sponsor must accept the offer for the sponsor within the time prescribed in the offer, and in the required number of counterparts, by signing it in the space provided. The signing official must have been authorized to sign the acceptance by a resolution or ordinance adopted by the sponsor's governing body. The resolution or ordinance must, as appropriate under the local law—

        (1) Set forth the terms of the offer at length; or

        (2) Have a copy of the offer attached to the resolution or ordinance and incorporated into it by reference.

        § 151.31   Procedures: Grant agreement.

#### § § 151.31

        (a) An offer by the Administrator, and acceptance by the sponsor, as set forth in § 151.29, constitute a grant agreement between the sponsor and the United States. Except as provided in § 151.41(c)(3), the United States does not pay, and is not obligated to pay, any part of the project costs that have been or may be incurred, before the grant agreement is executed.

        (b) The Administrator and the sponsor may agree to a change in a grant agreement if—

        (1) The change does not increase the maximum obligation of the United States under the grant agreement by more than 10 percent;

        (2) The change provides only for airport development that meets the requirements of subparts B and C; and

        (3) The change does not prejudice the interests of the United States.

        (c) When a change is agreed to, the Administrator issues a supplemental agreement incorporating the change. The sponsor must accept the supplemental agreement in the manner provided in § 151.29(c).

#### § § 151.33

        (a) Any two or more public agencies that desire to participate either in accomplishing development under a project or in maintaining or operating the airport, may cosponsor it if they meet the requirements of subparts B and C, including—

        (1) The eligibility requirements of § 151.37; and

        (2) The submission of a single project application, executed by each sponsor, clearly stating the certifications, representations, warranties, and obligations made or assumed by each, or a separate application by each that does not meet all the requirements of subparts B and C if in the Administrator's opinion, the applications collectively meet the requirements of subparts B and C as applied to a project with a single sponsor.

        (b) A public agency that desires to participate in a project only by contributing funds to a sponsor need not become a sponsor or an agent of the sponsor, as provided in this section. However, any funds that it contributes are considered as funds of the sponsor for the purposes of the Federal Airport Act and this part.

        (c) If the sponsors of a joint project are not each willing to assume, jointly and severally, the obligations that subparts B and C requires a sponsor to assume, they must send a true copy of an agreement between them, satisfactory to the Administrator, to be incorporated into the grant agreement. Each agreement must state—

        (1) The responsibilities of each sponsor to the others with respect to accomplishing the proposed development and operating and maintaining the airport;

        (2) The obligations that each will assume to the United States; and

        (3) The name of the sponsor or sponsors who will accept, receipt for, and disburse grant payments.

        (d) A public agency may, if it is authorized by local law, act as agent of the public agency that is to own and operate the airport, with or without participating financially and without becoming a sponsor. The terms and conditions of the agency and the agent's authority to act for the sponsor must be set forth in an agency agreement that is satisfactory to the Administrator. The sponsor must submit a true copy of the agreement with the project application. Such an agent may accept, on behalf of the sponsor, an offer made under § 151.29, only if that acceptance has been specifically and legally authorized by the sponsor's governing body and the authority is specifically set forth in the agency agreement.

        (e) When the cosponsors of an airport are not located in the same area, they must submit a joint request to the Area Manager of the area in which the airport development will be located.

        § 151.45   Performance of construction work: General requirements.

#### § § 151.45

        (a) All construction work under a project must be performed under contract, except in a case where the Administrator determines that the project, or a part of it, can be more effectively and economically accomplished on a force account basis by the sponsor or by another public agency acting for or as agent of the sponsor.

        (b) Each contract under a project must meet the requirements of local law.

        (c) No sponsor may issue any change order under any of its construction contracts or enter into a supplemental agreement unless three copies of that order or agreement have been sent to and approved by the Area Manager. §§ 151.47 and 151.49 apply to supplemental agreements as well as to original contracts.

        (d) This section and §§ 151.47 through 151.49 do not apply to contracts with the owners of airport hazards, (as described in § 151.39(b)), buildings, pipe lines, power lines, or other structures or facilities, for installing, extending, changing, removing, or relocating that structure or facility. However, the sponsor must obtain the approval of the Area Manager before entering into such a contract.

        (e) No sponsor may allow a contractor or subcontractor to begin work under a project until—

        (1) The sponsor has furnished three conformed copies of the contract to the Area Manager; and

        (2) The Area Manager agrees to the issuance of a notice to proceed with the work to the contractor. However, the Area Manager does not agree to the issuance of such a notice unless he is satisfied that adequate replacement housing is available and has been offered to affected persons, as required for project eligibility by § 151.39(a)(5).

        (f) Except when the Area Manager determines that the sponsor has previously demonstrated satisfactory engineering and construction supervision and inspection, no sponsor may allow a contractor or subcontractor to begin work, nor may the sponsor begin force account work, until the sponsor has notified the Area Manager in writing that engineering and construction supervision and inspection have been arranged to insure that construction will conform to FAA approved plans and specifications, and that the sponsor has caused a review to be made of the qualifications of personnel who will be performing such supervision and inspection and is satisfied that they are qualified to do so.

        § 151.47   Performance of construction work: Letting of contracts.

#### § § 151.47

        (a)  Unless the Administrator approves another method for use on a particular airport development project, each contract for construction work on a project in the amount of more than $2,000 must be awarded on the basis of public advertising and open competitive bidding under the local law applicable to the letting of public contracts. Any oral or written agreement or understanding between a sponsor and another public agency that is not a sponsor of the project, under which that public agency undertakes construction work for or as agent of the sponsor, is not considered to be a construction contract for the purposes of this section, or §§ 151.45, 151.49, and 151.51.

        (b)  There may be no advertisement for bids on, or negotiation of, a construction contract until the Administrator has approved the plans and specifications. The advertisement shall inform the bidders of the contract and reporting provisions required by § 151.54. Unless the estimated contract price or construction cost is $2,000 or less, there may be no advertisement for bids or negotiation until the Administrator has given the sponsor a copy of a decision of the Secretary of Labor establishing the minimum wage rates for skilled and unskilled labor under the proposed contract. In each case, a copy of the wage determination decision must be set forth in the initial invitation for bids or proposed contract or incorporated therein by reference to a copy set forth in the advertised or negotiated specifications.

        (c)  At least 60 days before the intended date of advertising or negotiating under paragraph (b) of this section, the sponsor shall send to the Area Manager, completed Department of Labor Form DB-11, with only the classifications needed in the performance of the work checked. General entries (such as “entire schedule” or “all applicable classifications”) may not be used. Additional necessary classifications not on the form may be typed in the blank spaces or on an attached separate list. A classification that can be fitted into classifications on the form, or a classification that is not generally recognized in the area or in the industry, may not be used. Except in areas where the wage patterns are clearly established, the Form must be accompanied by any available pertinent wage payment or locally prevailing fringe benefit information.

        (d)  (1) Wage determinations are effective only for 120 days from the date of the determinations. If it appears that a determination may expire between bid opening and award, the sponsor shall so advise the FAA as soon as possible. If he wishes a new request for wage determination to be made and if any pertinent circumstances have changed, he shall submit a new Form DB-11 and accompanying information. If he claims that the determination expires before award and after bid opening due to unavoidable circumstances, he shall submit proof of the facts which he claims support a finding to that effect.

        (2) The Secretary of Labor may modify any wage determination before the award of the contract or contracts for which it was sought. If the proposed contract is awarded on the basis of public advertisement and open competitive bidding, any modification that the FAA receives less than 10 days before the opening of bids is not effective, unless the Administrator finds that there is reasonable time to notify bidders. A modification may not continue in effect beyond the effective period of the wage determination to which it relates. The Administrator sends any modification to the sponsor as soon as possible. If the modification is effective, it must be incorporated in the invitation for bids, by issuing an addendum to the specifications or otherwise.

        (e)  A sponsor may not award a construction contract without the written concurrence of the Administrator (through the Area Manager) that the contract prices are reasonable and that the contract conforms to the sponsor's grant agreement with the United States. A sponsor that awards contracts on the basis of public advertising and open competitive bidding, shall, after the bids are opened, send a tabulation of the bids and its recommendations for award to the Area Manager. The allowable project costs of the work, on which the Federal participation is computed, may not be more than the bid of the lowest responsible bidder. The sponsor may not accept a bid by a contractor whose name appears on the current list of ineligible contractors published by the Comptroller General of the United States under § 5.6(b) of Title 29 of the regulations of the Secretary of Labor (29 CFR part 5), or a bid by any firm, corporation, partnership, or association in which that contractor has a substantial interest.

        (f)  Where applicable by their terms, the regulations of the Secretary of Labor (29 CFR 5.20-5.32) interpreting the fringe benefit provisions of the Davis-Bacon Act apply to this section.

#### § § 151.49

        (a)  In addition to any other provisions necessary to ensure completion of the work in accordance with the grant agreement, each sponsor entering into a construction contract for an airport development project shall insert in the contract the provisions required by the Secretary of Labor, as set forth in appendix H of this part. The Director, Airports Service, may amend any provision in appendix H from time to time to accord with rule-making action of the Secretary of Labor.

The United States is not a party to this contract and no reference in this contract to the FAA or any representative thereof, or to any rights granted to the FAA or any representative thereof, or the United States, by the contract, makes the United States a party to this contract.

        (2)  The contractor shall obtain the prior written consent of the [insert sponsor's name] to any proposed assignment of any interest in or part of this contract.

        (3)  No convict labor may be employed under this contract.

        (4)  In the employment of labor (except in executive, administrative, and supervisory positions), preference shall be given to qualified individuals who have served in the military service of the United States (as defined in section 101(1) of the Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act of 1940) and have been honorably discharged from that service, except that preference may be given only where that labor is available locally and is qualified to perform the work to which the employment relates.

        (5)  Whether or not payments or advances to the [insert sponsor's name] are withheld or suspended by the FAA, the [insert sponsor's name] may withhold or cause to be withheld from the contractor so much of the accrued payments or advances as may be considered necessary to pay laborers and mechanics employed by the contractor or any subcontractor on the work the full amount of wages required by this contract.

        (6)  If the contractor or subcontractor fails to pay any laborer or mechanic employed or working on the site of the work any of the wages required by this contract the [insert sponsor's name] may, after written notice to the contractor, take such action as may be necessary to cause the suspension of any further payment or advance of funds until the violations cease.

        (7)  The contractor shall allow any authorized representative of the FAA to inspect and review any work or materials used in the performance of this contract.

        (8)  The contractor shall insert in each of his subcontracts the provisions contained in paragraphs [insert designations of 6 paragraphs of contract corresponding to paragraphs (1), (3), (4), (5), (6) and (7) of this paragraph], and also a clause requiring the subcontractors to include these provisions in any lower tier subcontracts which they may enter into, together with a clause requiring this insertion in any further subcontracts that may in turn be made.

        (9)  A breach of paragraphs [insert designation of 3 paragraphs corresponding to paragraphs (6), (7) and (8) of this paragraph] may be grounds for termination of the contract.

        (b)  Appendix H to this part and paragraph (a)(5) of this section do not apply to prime contracts of $2,000 or less.

        (c)  A contractor or subcontractor who has become liable for liquidated damages under paragraph G of appendix H and who claims that the amount administratively determined as liquidated damages under section 104(a) of the Contract Work Hours Standards Act is incorrect or that he violated inadvertently the Contract Work Hours Standards Act notwithstanding the exercise of due care, may—

        (1) If the amount determined is more than $100, apply to the Administrator for a recommendation to the Secretary of Labor that an appropriate adjustment be made or that he be relieved of liability for such liquidated damages; or

        (2) If the amount determined is $100 or less, apply to the Administrator for an appropriate adjustment in liquidated damages or for release from liability for the liquidated damages.

        (d)  The Secretary of Labor corrects any wage determination included in any contract under this section whenever the wage determination contains clerical errors. A correction may be made at the Administrator's request or on the initiative of the Secretary of Labor.

        (e)  Where applicable by their terms, the regulations of the Secretary of Labor (29 CFR 5.20-5.32) interpreting the “fringe benefit provisions” of the Davis-Bacon Act apply to the contract provisions in appendix H, and to this section.

        § 151.51   Performance of construction work: Sponsor force account.

#### § § 151.51

        (a) Before undertaking any force account construction work, the sponsor (or any public agency acting as agent for the sponsor) must obtain the written consent of the Administrator through the Area Manager. In requesting that consent, the sponsor must submit—

        (1) Adequate plans and specifications showing the nature and extent of the construction work to be performed under that force account;

        (2) A schedule of the proposed construction and of the construction equipment that will be available for the project;

        (3) Assurance that adequate labor, material, equipment, engineering personnel, as well as supervisory and inspection personnel as required by § 151.45(f), will be provided; and

        (4) A detailed estimate of the cost of the work, broken down for each class of costs involved, such as labor, materials, rental of equipment, and other pertinent items of cost.

        (a) Keep, and preserve, for a three-year period beginning on the date the contract is completed, each affidavit and payroll copy furnished by the contractor, and make those affidavits and copies available to the FAA, upon request, during that period;

        (b) Have each of those affidavits and payrolls examined by its resident engineer (or any other of its employees or agents who are qualified to make the necessary determinations), as soon as possible after receiving it, to the extent necessary to determine whether the contractor is complying with the labor provisions required by § 151.49 and particularly with respect to whether the contractor's employees are correctly classified;

        (c) Have investigations made during the performance of work under the contract, to the extent necessary to determine whether the contractor is complying with those labor provisions, particularly with respect to whether the contractor's employees are correctly classified, including in the investigations, interviews with employees and examinations of payroll information at the work site by the sponsor's resident engineer (or any other of its employees or agents who are qualified to make the necessary determinations); and

        (d) Keep the Area Manager fully advised of all examinations and investigations made under this section, all determinations made on the basis of those examinations and investigations, and all efforts made to obtain compliance with the labor provisions of the contract.

        § 151.57   Grant payments: General.

#### § § 151.57

        (a) An application for a grant payment is made on FAA Form 5100-6, accompanied by—

        (1) A summary of project costs on Form FAA-1630;

        (2) A periodic cost estimate on Form FAA-1629 for each contract representing costs for which payment is requested; and

        (3) Any supporting information, including appraisals of property interests, that the FAA needs to determine the allowability of any costs for which payment is requested.

        (b) Contractor's certifications. Each application that involves work performed by a contractor must contain, in the contractor's certification in the periodic cost estimate, a statement that “there has been full compliance with all labor provisions included in the contract identified above and in all subcontracts made under that contract”, and, in the case of a substantial dispute as to the nature of the contractor's or a subcontractor's obligation under the labor provisions of the contract or a subcontract, and additional phrase “except insofar as a substantial dispute exists with respect to these provisions”.

        (c) If a contractor or subcontractor fails or refuses to comply with the labor provisions of the contract with the sponsor, further grant payments to the sponsor are suspended until the violations stop, until the Administrator determines the allowability of the project costs to which the violations related, or, to the extent that the violations consist of underpayments to labor, until the sponsor furnishes satisfactory assurances to the FAA that restitution has been or will be made to the affected employees.

        (d) If, upon final determination of the allowability of all project costs of a project, it is found that the total of grant payments to the sponsor was more than the total United States share of the allowable costs of the project, the sponsor shall promptly return the excess to the FAA.

        § 151.59   Grant payments: Land acquisition.

#### § § 151.59

        If an approved project includes land acquisition as an item of airport development, the sponsor may, at any time after executing the grant agreement and after title evidence has been approved by the Administrator for the property interest for which payment is requested, apply to the FAA, through the Area Manager, for payment of the United States share of the allowable project costs of the acquisition, including any acquisition that is completed before executing the grant agreement and is part of the airport development included in the project.

        § 151.61   Grant payments: Partial.

#### § § 151.61

        (a) Subject to the final determination of allowable project costs as provided in § 151.63 partial grant payments for project costs may be made to a sponsor upon application. Unless previously agreed otherwise, a sponsor may apply for partial payments on a monthly basis. The payments may be paid, upon application, on the basis of the costs of airport development that is accomplished or on the basis of the estimated cost of airport development expected to be accomplished.

        (b) Except as otherwise provided, partial grant payments are made in amounts large enough to bring the aggregate amount of all partial payments to the estimated United States share of the project costs of the airport development accomplished under the project as of the date of the sponsor's latest application for payment. In addition, if the sponsor applies, a partial grant payment is made as an advance payment in an amount large enough to bring the aggregate amount of all partial payments to the estimated United States share of the estimated project costs of the airport development expected to be accomplished within 30 days after the date of the sponsor's application for advance payment. However, no partial payment may be made in an amount that would bring the aggregate amount of all partial payments for the project to more than 90 percent of the estimated United States share of the total estimated cost of all airport development included in the project, but not including contingency items, or 90 percent of the maximum obligation of the United States as stated in the grant agreement, whichever amount is the lower. In determining the amount of a partial grant payment, those project costs that the Administrator considers to be of questionable allowability are deducted both from the amount of proj- ect costs incurred and from the amount of the estimated total project cost.

        § 151.63   Grant payments: Semifinal and final.

#### § § 151.63

        (a) Whenever airport development on a project is delayed or suspended for an appreciable period of time for reasons beyond the sponsor's control and the allowability of the project costs of all airport development completed has been determined on the basis of an audit and review of all costs, a semifinal grant payment may be made in an amount large enough to bring the aggregate amount of all partial grant payments for the project to the United States share of all allowable project costs incurred, even if the amount is more than the 90 percent limitation prescribed in § 151.61(b). However, it may not be more than the maximum obligation of the United States as stated in the grant agreement.

        (b) Whenever the project is completed in accordance with the grant agreement, the sponsor may apply for final payment. The final payment is made to the sponsor if—

        (1) A final inspection of all work at the airport site has been made jointly by the Area Manager and representatives of the sponsor and the contractor, unless the Area Manager agrees to a different procedure for final inspection.

        (2) A final audit of the project account has been completed by appropriate personnel of the FAA; and

        (3) The sponsor has furnished final “as constructed” plans, unless otherwise agreed to by the Administrator.

        (c) Based upon the final inspection, the final audit, the plans, and the documents and supporting information required by § 151.57(a), the Administrator determines the total amount of the allowable project costs and pays the sponsor the United States' share, less the total amount of all prior payments.

        § 151.65   Memoranda and hearings.

#### § § 151.65

        (a) At any time before the FAA issues a grant offer for a project, any public agency or person having a substantial interest in the disposition of the project application may file a memorandum supporting or opposing it with the Area Manager of the area in which the project is located. In addition, that public agency or person may request a public hearing on the location of the airport to be developed. If, in the Administrator's opinion, that public agency or person has a substantial interest in the matter, a public hearing is held.

        (b) The Administrator sets the time and place of each hearing under this section, to avoid undue delay in disposing of the application, to afford reasonable time for all parties concerned to prepare for it, and to hold it at a place convenient to the sponsor. Notice of the time and place is mailed to the public agency or person filing the memorandum, the sponsor, and any other necessary persons.

        (c) The purpose of the hearing is to help the Administrator discover facts relating to the location of the airport that is proposed to be developed under an application pending before him. There are no adverse parties or interests and no defendant or respondent. They are not hearings for the purposes of 5 U.S.C. 554, 556, and 557, and do not terminate in an adjudication as defined in that Act.

        (d) Each hearing under this section is conducted by a hearing officer designated by the Administrator. The hearing officer decides the length of the hearing, the kind of testimony to be heard, and all other matters respecting the conduct of the hearing. The hearing is recorded in a manner determined by the hearing officer and the record becomes a part of the record of the project application. The Administrator's decision is not made solely on the basis of the hearing, but on all relevant facts.

        § 151.75   Preparation of site.

#### § § 151.75

        (a) Grading, drainage, and associated items of site preparation are eligible for inclusion in a project, but only with respect to one landing strip at any airport, unless the airport qualifies for more than one runway, based on traffic volume or wind conditions (as outlined in § 151.77) and the overall site preparation required for development in accordance with the airport layout plan. The complete clearance of runway clear zone areas is desirable, but, as a minimum, all obstructions as determined by § 77.23 as applied to § 77.27 (b) and (c) of this chapter must be removed. Grading in runway clear zones is eligible only to remove terrain that is an obstruction. The clear zone is not a graded overrun area. Specific site preparation for an airport terminal building is eligible on the same basis as the building itself. The site preparation cost is prorated based on eligible and ineligible building space. Appendix B of this part sets forth typical eligible and ineligible items of site preparation as covered by this section.

        (b) For the purposes of this section, eligible drainage work off the airport site includes drainage outfalls, drainage disposal, and interception ditches. If there is damage to adjacent property, its correction is an eligible item for inclusion in the project.

        § 151.77   Runway paving: General rules.

#### § § 151.77

        (a) On any airport, paving of the designated instrument landing runway (or dominant runway if there is no designated instrument runway) is eligible for inclusion in a project, within the limits of the current National Airport Plan. Program participation in constructing, reconstructing or resurfacing is limited to a single runway at each airport, unless more than one runway is eligible under a standard in § 151.79 or § 151.80.

        (b) The kinds of runway paving that are eligible for inclusion in a project include pavement construction and reconstruction, and include runway grooving to improve skid resistance, and resurfacing to increase the load bearing capacity of the runway or to provide a leveling course to correct major irregularities in the pavement. Runway resealing or refilling joints as an ordinary maintenance matter are not eligible items, except for bituminous resurfacing consisting of at least 100 pounds of plant-mixed material for each square yard, and except for the application of a bituminous surface treatment (two applications of material and cover aggregate as prescribed in FAA Specification P-609) on a pavement the current surface of which consists of that kind of a bituminous surface treatment.

        (c) On new pavement construction, the applying of a bituminous seal coat on plant hot-mix bituminous surfaces only, is an eligible item only if initial engineering analysis and design indicate the need for a seal coat. However, any delay in applying it that is caused other than by construction difficulties, makes the application a maintenance item that is not eligible.

        (d) In any case in which the need for a seal coat is necessary for a new runway extension or partial reconstruction of a runway, the entire runway may be sealed.

        (e) Appendix C to this part sets forth typical eligible and ineligible items of runway paving.

        § 151.79   Runway paving: Second runway; wind conditions.

#### § § 151.79

        (a)  Paving a second runway on the basis of wind conditions is eligible for inclusion in a project only if the sponsor shows that—

        (1) The airport meets the applicable standards of paragraph (b), (c), or (d) of this section;

        (2) The operational experience, and the economic factors of air traffic at the location, justify an additional runway for the airport; and

        (3) The second runway is oriented with the existing paved runway to achieve the maximum wind coverage, with due consideration to the airport noise factor, topography, soil conditions, and other pertinent factors affecting the economy and efficiency of the runway development.

        (b)  The airport serves both large and small aircraft and the existing paved runway is subject to a crosswind component of more than 15 miles per hour (13 knots) more than 5 percent of the time.

        (c)  The airport serves small aircraft exclusively, and—

        (1) The airport has 10,000, or more, aircraft operations each year; and

        (2) The existing paved runway is subject to a crosswind component of more than 12 miles per hour (10.5 knots) more than 5 percent of the time.

        (d)  The airport serves small aircraft of less than 8,000 pounds maximum certificated takeoff weight exclusively and—

        (1) The airport has 5,000, or more, aircraft operations each year; and

        (2) The existing paved runway is subject to a crosswind component of more than 12 miles per hour (10.5 knots) more than 5 percent of the time.

        § 151.80   Runway paving: Additional runway; other conditions.

#### § § 151.80

        Paving an additional runway on an airport that does not qualify for a second runway under § 151.79 is eligible if the Administrator, upon consideration on a case-to-case basis, is satisfied that—

        (a) The volume of traffic justifies an additional paved runway and the layout and orientation of the additional runway will expedite traffic; or

        (b) A combination of traffic volume and aircraft noise problems justifies an additional paved runway for that airport.

        § 151.81   Taxiway paving.

#### § § 151.81

        (a) The construction, alteration, and repair of taxiways needed to expedite the flow of ground traffic between runways and aircraft parking areas available for general public use are eligible items under the program. Taxiways to serve an area or facility that is primarily for the exclusive or near exclusive use of a tenant or operator that does not furnish aircraft servicing to the public are not eligible. In addition, the policies on resealing or refilling joints, as set forth in § 151.77, apply also to taxiway paving.

        (b) Appendix D of this part sets forth typical eligible and ineligible items of taxiway paving.

        § 151.83   Aprons.

#### § § 151.83

        (a) The construction, alteration, and repair of aprons are eligible program items upon being shown that they are needed as public use facilities. An apron to serve an area that is primarily for the exclusive or near exclusive use of a tenant or operator who does not furnish aircraft servicing to the public is not eligible. In addition, the policies on resealing or refilling joints, as set forth in § 151.77 apply also to apron paving.

        (b) In determining public use for the purposes of this section, the current use being made of a hangar governs, unless there is definite information regarding its future use. In the case of an apron area being built for future hangars, it should be shown that early hangar development is assured and that the hangars will be public facilities.

        (c) Appendix E of this part sets forth typical eligible and ineligible items of apron paving.

        § 151.85   Special treatment areas.

#### § § 151.85

        The following special treatment for areas adjacent to pavement is eligible for inclusion in a project in cases where, due to the operation of turbojet powered aircraft, it may be necessary to treat those areas adjacent to runway ends, holding aprons, and taxiways to prevent erosion from the blast effects of the turbojet:

        (a) Runway ends—a stabilized area the width of the runway and extending 100 to 150 feet from the end of the runway.

        (b) Holding aprons—a stabilized area up to 50 feet from the edge of the pavement.

        (c) Taxiway intersections—a stabilized area 25 feet on each side of the taxiway and extending 300 feet from the intersection.

        (d) Taxiway (continuous movement of aircraft)—dense turf 25 feet on each side of the taxiway, or in a geographic area where dense turf cannot be established, stabilization.

        § 151.86   Lighting and electrical work: General.

#### § § 151.86

        (a) The installing of lighting facilities and related electrical work, as provided in § 151.87, is eligible for inclusion in a project only if the Administrator determines, for the particular airport involved, that they are needed to ensure—

        (1) Its safe and efficient use by aircraft under § 151.13; or

        (2) Its continued operation and adequate maintenance, and it has a large enough volume (actual or potential) of night operations.

        (b) Before the Administrator makes a grant offer to the sponsor of a project that includes installing lighting facilities and related electrical work under paragraph (a) of this section, the sponsor must—

        (1) Provide in the project for removing, relocating, or adequately marking and lighting, each obstruction in the approach and turning zones, as provided in § 151.91(a);

        (2) Acknowledge its awareness of the cost of operating and maintaining airport lighting; and

        (3) Agree to operate the airport lighting installed—

        (i) Throughout each night of the year; or

        (ii) According to a satisfactory plan of operation, submitted under paragraph (c) of this section.

        (c) The sponsor of a project that includes installing airport lighting and related electrical work, under paragraph (a) of this section, may—

        (1) Submit to the Administrator a proposed plan of operation of the airport lighting installed for periods less than throughout each night of the year;

        (2) Specify, in the proposed plan, the times when the airport lighting installed will be operated; and

        (3) Satisfy the Administrator that the proposed plan provides for safety in air commerce, and justifies the investment of Program funds.

        (d) Paragraph (b)(3) of this section also applies to each sponsor of a project that includes installing airport lighting and related electrical work if that sponsor has not entered into a grant agreement for the project before September 5, 1968.

        (e) If it agrees to comply with paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the sponsor of a project that includes installing airport lighting facilities and related electrical work that has entered into a grant agreement for that project before September 5, 1968, may—

        (1) Surrender its air navigation certificate authorizing operation of a “true light” issued before that date; or

        (2) Terminate its application for authority to operate a “true light” made before that date.

        § 151.87   Lighting and electrical work: Standards.

#### § § 151.87

        (a)-(b) [Reserved]

        (c) The number of runways that are eligible for lighting is the same as the number eligible for paving under § 151.77, § 151.79, or § 151.80.

        (d) The installing of high intensity runway edge lighting is eligible on a designated instrument landing runway and any other runway with approved straight-in approach procedures. A runway that is eligible for lighting, but does not meet the requirements for 75 percent U.S. participation under § 151.43(d), is eligible for 50 percent U.S. participation in the costs of high intensity runway edge lighting (or the allowable percentage in § 151.43(c) for public land States), if the airport is served by a navigational aid that will allow using instrument approach procedures. If a runway is not eligible for 75 or 50 percent Federal participation in high intensity runway edge lighting but is otherwise eligible for runway lighting, the U.S. share of the cost of runway edge lighting is 50 percent of the cost of the lighting installed but not more than 50 percent of the cost of medium intensity lighting.

        (e) In-runway lighting (touchdown zone lighting system, and centerline lighting system) is eligible on the designated instrument landing runway.

        (f) Taxiways to eligible runways on airports served by transport aircraft are eligible for lighting.

        (b) The construction, alteration, and repair of airport roads and streets that are entirely within the airport boundaries are eligible under the program, if needed for operating and maintaining the airport. In the case of an entrance road, a strip right-of-way joining the main body of the airport to the nearest public road may be considered a part of the normal boundary of the airport if—

        (1) Adequate title is obtained;

        (2) It was acquired to provide an airport entrance road and was not, before the existence of the airport, a public thoroughfare;

        (3) The entrance road is intended only as a way in and out of the airport; and

        (4) The entrance road extends only to the nearest public highway, road, or street.

        (c) An entrance road may be joined to an existing highway or street with a normal fillet connection. However, acceleration-deceleration strips or grade separations are not eligible.

        (d) Offsite road or street relocation needed to allow airport development or to remove an obstruction, and is not for entrance road purposes, is eligible.

        (e) Appendix G sets forth typical eligible and ineligible items of road construction covered by this section.

        § 151.91   Removal of obstructions.

#### § § 151.91

        (a) The removal or relocation, or both, of obstructions, as defined in Technical Standard Order N18 is eligible under the Program in cases where definite arrangements are made to prevent the obstruction from being recreated. In a case where removal is not feasible, the cost of marking or lighting it is eligible. The removal and relocation of structures necessary for essential airport development is eligible. The removal of structures that are not obstructions under § 77.23 of this chapter as applied to § 77.27 of this chapter are eligible when they are located within a runway clear zone.

        (b) The removal and relocation of an airport hangar that is an airport hazard (as described in § 151.39(b)) is eligible, if the reerected hangar will be substantially identical to the disassembled one.

        (c) Whenever a hangar must be relocated (either for clearance of the site for other airport development or to remove a hazard) and the existing structure is to be relocated with or without disassembly, the cost of the relocation is an eligible item of project costs, including costs incidental to the relocation such as necessary footings and floors. However, if the existing structure is to be demolished and a new hangar is to be built, only the cost of demolishing the existing hangar is an eligible item.

        § 152.409   Affirmative action plan standards.

#### § § 152.409

        (a) Each affirmative action plan required by this subpart shall be developed in accordance with the following:

        (1) An analysis of the employer's aviation workforce which groups employees into the following job categories:

        (i) Officials and managers.

        (ii) Professionals.

        (iii) Technicians.

        (iv) Sales workers.

        (v) Office and clerical workers.

        (vi) Craft workers (skilled).

        (vii) Operatives (semi-skilled).

        (ix) Service workers.

        (2) A comparison separately made of the percent of minorities and women in the employer's present aviation workforce (in each of the job categories listed in paragraph (a)(1) of this section) with the percent of minorities and women in each of those categories in the total workforce located in the SMSA, or, in the absence of an SMSA, in the counties contiguous to the employer's location or the location where the work is to be performed and in the areas from which persons may reasonably be expected to commute. This data on the total workforce of the applicable area will be supplied to grantees by the FAA. Grantees shall make this data available to the other organizations covered by this subpart. The comparison for minorities must be made only when minorities constitute at least 2 percent of the total workforce in the geographical area used for the comparison.

        (3) A comparison, for the aviation workforce, of the total number of applicants and persons hired with the total number of minority and female applicants, and minorities and females hired, for the past year. Where this data is unavailable, the employer shall establish and maintain a system to provide the data, and shall make the comparison 120 days after establishing the data system.

        (4) Where the percentage of minorities and women in the employer's aviation workforce, in each job category, is less than the minority and female percentage in any job category in the workforce of the geographical area used, an analysis, based on the comparison required by paragraph (a)(3) of this section, determining whether any of the following exists:

        (i) Insufficient flow of minority and female applicants.

        (ii) Disparate rejection of minority and female applicants. The FAA generally considers disparate rejection to exist whenever a selection rate for any race, sex, or ethnic group is less than 80 percent of the rate for the race, sex, or ethnic group with the highest selection rate.

        (b) Each affirmative action plan required by this part shall be implemented through an action-oriented program with goals and timetables designed to eliminate obstacles to equal opportunity for women and minorities in recruitment and hiring, which shall include, but not be limited to:

        (1) Where disparate rejection of minority and female applicants is indicated by the analysis required by paragraph (a)(4) of this section, validation of those portions of the testing or selection procedures which cause the disparity in accordance with the “Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection” (43 FR 38290; August 25, 1978), within 120 days of the analysis.

        (2) Where testing or selection procedures cannot be validated, discontinuation of their use.

        (3) Where an insufficient flow of minority and female applicants (less than the percentage available) is indicated by the analysis required by paragraph (a)(4) of this section, good faith efforts to increase the flow of minority and female applicants through the following steps, as appropriate:

        (i) Development or reaffirmation of an equal opportunity policy and dissemination of that policy internally and externally.

        (ii) Contact with minority and women's organizations, schools with predominant minority or female enrollments, and other recruitment sources for minorities and women.

        (iii) Encouragement of State and local employment agencies, unions, and other recruiting sources to ensure that minorities and women have ample information on, and opportunity to apply for, vacancies and to participate in examinations.

        (iv) Participation in special employment programs such as Co-operative Education Programs with predominantly minority and women's colleges, “After School” or Work Study programs, and Summer Employment.

        (v) Participation in “Job Fairs.”

        (vi) Participation of minority and female employees in Career Days, Youth Motivation Programs, and counseling and related activities in the community.

        (vii) Encouragement of minority and female employees to refer applicants.

        (viii) Motivation, training, and employment programs for minority and female hard-core unemployed.

      (b) Section 2 of the Act of October 1, 1949 (63 Stat. 700) provides that the restrictions against using structures for industrial purposes in any instrument of disposal issued under section 13(g)(2)(A) of the Surplus Property Act of 1944, as amended (61 Stat. 678) are considered to be extinguished. In addition, section 2 authorizes the Administrator to issue any instruments of release or conveyance necessary to remove, of record, such a restriction, without monetary consideration to the United States.

      (c) Section 68 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (42 U.S.C. 2098) releases, remises, and quitclaims, to persons entitled thereto, all reserved rights of the United States in radioactive minerals in instruments of disposal of public or acquired lands. In addition, section 3 of the Act of October 1, 1949 (50 U.S.C. App. 1622b) authorizes the Administrator to issue instruments that he considers necessary to correct any instrument of disposal by which surplus property was transferred to a non-Federal public agency for airport purposes or to conform the transfer to the requirements of applicable law. Based on the laws cited in this paragraph, the Administrator issues appropriate instruments of correction upon the written request of persons entitled to ownership, occupancy, or use of the lands concerned.

      § 155.5   Property and releases covered by this part.

#### § § 155.5

      This part applies to—

      (a) Any real or personal property that is subject to the terms, conditions, reservations, or restrictions in an instrument of disposal described in § 155.1; and

      (b) Any release from a term, condition, reservation, or restriction in such an instrument, including a release of—

      (1) Personal property, equipment, or structures from any term, condition, reservation, or restriction so far as necessary to allow it to be disposed of for salvage purposes;

      (2) Land, personal property, equipment or structures from any term, condition, reservation, or restriction requiring that it be used for airport purposes to allow its use, lease, or sale for nonairport use in place;

      (3) Land, personal property, equipment, or structures from any term, condition, reservation, or restriction requiring its maintenance for airport use;

      (4) Land, personal property, equipment, or structures from all terms, conditions, restrictions, or reservations to allow its use, lease, sale, or other disposal for nonairport purposes; and

      (5) Land, personal property, equipment, or structures from the reservation of right of use by the United States in time of war or national emergency, to facilitate financing the operation and maintenance or further development of a public airport.

      § 155.7   General policies.

#### § § 155.7

      (a) Upon a request under § 155.11, the Administrator issues any instrument that is necessary to remove, of record, any restriction against the use of property for industrial purposes that is in an instrument of disposal covered by this part.

      (b) The Administrator does not issue a release under this part if it would allow the sale of the property concerned to a third party, unless the public agency concerned has obligated itself to use the proceeds from the sale exclusively for developing, improving, operating, or maintaining a public airport.

      (c) Except for a release from a restriction against using property for industrial purposes, the Administrator does not issue a release under this part unless it is justified under § 155.3(a) (1) or (2).

      (d) The Administrator may issue a release from the terms, conditions, reservations, or restrictions of an instrument of disposal subject to any other terms or conditions that he considers necessary to protect or advance the interests of the United States in civil aviation. Such a term or condition, including one regarding the use of proceeds from the sale of property, is imposed as a personal covenant or obligation of the public agency concerned rather than as a term or condition to the release or as a covenant running with the land, unless the Administrator determines that the purpose of the term or condition would be better achieved as a condition or covenant running with the land.

      (e) A letter or other document issued by the Administrator that merely grants consent to or approval of a lease, or to the use of the property for other than the airport use contemplated by the instrument of disposal, does not otherwise release the property from the terms, conditions, reservations, or restrictions of the instrument of disposal.

      § 155.9   Release from war or national emergency restrictions.

#### § § 155.9

      (a) The primary purpose of each transfer of surplus airport property under section 13 of the Surplus Property Act of 1944 was to make the property available for public or civil airport needs. However, it was also intended to ensure the availability of the property transferred, and of the entire airport, for use by the United States during a war or national emergency, if needed. As evidence of this purpose, most instruments of disposal of surplus airport property reserved or granted to the United States a right of exclusive possession and control of the airport during a war or emergency, substantially the same as one of the following:

      (1) That during the existence of any emergency declared by the President or the Congress, the Government shall have the right without charge except as indicated below to the full, unrestricted possession, control, and use of the landing area, building areas, and airport facilities or any part thereof, including any additions or improvements thereto made subsequent to the declaration of the airport property as surplus:  That the Government shall be responsible during the period of such use for the entire cost of maintaining all such areas, facilities, and improvements, or the portions used, and shall pay a fair rental for the use of any installations or structures which have been added thereto without Federal aid.

      (2) During any national emergency declared by the President or by Congress, the United States shall have the right to make exclusive or nonexclusive use and have exclusive or nonexclusive control and possession, without charge, of the airport at which the surplus property is located or used or of such portion thereof as it may desire:  That the United States shall be responsible for the entire cost of maintaining such part of the airport as it may use exclusively, or over which it may have exclusive possession and control, during the period of such use, possession, or control and shall be obligated to contribute a reasonable share, commensurate with the use made by it, of the cost of maintenance of such property as it may use nonexclusively or over which it may have nonexclusive control and possession:  That the United States shall pay a fair rental for its use, control, or possession, exclusively or nonexclusively, of any improvements to the airport made without U.S. aid.

      (b) A release from the terms, conditions, reservations, or restrictions of an instrument of disposal that might prejudice the needs or interests of the armed forces, is granted only after consultation with the Department of Defense.

      § 155.11   Form and content of requests for release.

#### § § 155.11

      (a) A request for the release of surplus airport property from a term, condition, reservation, or restriction in an instrument of disposal need not be in any special form, but must be in writing and signed by an authorized official of the public agency that owns the airport.

      (b) A request for a release under this part must be submitted in triplicate to the District Airport Engineer in whose district the airport is located.

      (c) Each request for a release must include the following information, if applicable and available:

      (2) A description of the property concerned.

      (3) The condition of the property concerned.

      (4) The purpose for which the property was transferred, such as for use as a part of, or in connection with, operating the airport or for producing revenues from nonaviation business.

      (5) The kind of release requested.

      (6) The purpose of the release.

      (7) A statement of the circumstances justifying the release on the basis set forth in § 155.3(a) (1) or (2) with supporting documents.

      (8) Maps, photographs, plans, or similar material of the airport and the property concerned that are appropriate to determining whether the release is justified under § 155.9.

      (9) The proposed use or disposition of the property, including the terms and conditions of any proposed sale or lease and the status of negotiations therefor.

      (10) If the release would allow sale of any part of the property, a certified copy of a resolution or ordinance of the governing body of the public agency that owns the airport obligating itself to use the proceeds of the sale exclusively for developing, improving, operating, or maintaining a public airport.

      (11) A suggested letter or other instrument of release that would meet the requirements of State and local law for the release requested.

      (12) The sponsor's environmental assessment prepared in conformance with Appendix 6 of FAA Order 1050.1C, “Policies and Procedures for Considering Environmental Impacts” (45 FR 2244; Jan. 10, 1980), and FAA Order 5050.4, “Airport Environmental Handbook” (45 FR 56624; Aug. 25, 1980), if an assessment is required by Order 5050.4. Copies of these orders may be examined in the Rules Docket, Office of the Chief Counsel, FAA, Washington, D.C., and may be obtained on request at any FAA regional office headquarters or any airports district office.

      § 155.13   Determinations by FAA.

#### § § 155.13

      (a) An FAA office that receives a request for a release under this part, and supporting documents therefore, examines it to determine whether the request meets the requirements of the Act of October 1, 1949 (63 Stat. 700) so far as it concerns the interests of the United States in civil aviation and whether it might prejudice the needs and interests of the armed forces. Upon a determination that the release might prejudice those needs and interests, the Department of Defense is consulted as provided in § 155.9(b).

      (b) Upon completing the review, and receiving the advice of the Department of Defense if the case was referred to it, the FAA advises the airport owner as to whether the release or a modification of it, may be granted. If the release, or a modification of it acceptable to the owner, is granted, the FAA prepares the necessary instruments and delivers them to the airport owner.

        means an air carrier that files for bankruptcy protection or has an involuntary bankruptcy proceeding started against it after December 12, 2003. An air carrier that is currently in compliance with PFC remittance requirements and has an involuntary bankruptcy proceeding commenced against it has 90 days from the date such proceeding was filed to obtain dismissal of the involuntary petition before becoming a covered air carrier. An air carrier ceases to be a covered air carrier when it emerges from bankruptcy protection.

        means a medium or large hub airport at which one or two air carriers control more than 50 percent of passenger boardings.

        means payments for such items as principal and interest, sinking funds, call premiums, periodic credit enhancement fees, trustee and paying agent fees, coverage, and remarketing fees.

        means an exclusive lease or use agreement between a public agency and an air carrier or foreign air carrier with a term of 5 years or more.

        § 158.13   Use of PFC revenue.

#### § § 158.13

        PFC revenue, including any interest earned after such revenue has been remitted to a public agency, may be used only to finance the allowable costs of approved projects at any airport the public agency controls.

        (a)  PFC revenue may be used to pay all or part of the allowable cost of an approved project.

        (b)  Public agencies may use PFC revenue to pay for allowable administrative support costs. Public agencies must submit these costs as a separate project in each PFC application.

        (c)  If a project involves a vehicle or ground support equipment using low emission technology eligible under § 158.15(b), the FAA will determine the maximum cost that may be financed by PFC revenue. The maximum cost for a new vehicle is the incremental amount between the purchase price of a new low emission vehicle and the purchase price of a standard emission vehicle, or the cost of converting a standard emission vehicle to a low emission vehicle.

        (d)  (1) Public agencies may use PFC revenue to pay debt service and financing costs incurred for a bond issued to carry out approved projects.

        (2) If the public agency's bond documents require that PFC revenue be commingled in the general revenue stream of the airport and pledged for the benefit of holders of obligations, the FAA considers PFC revenue to have paid the costs covered in § 158.13(d)(1) if—

        (i) An amount equal to the part of the proceeds of the bond issued to carry out approved projects is used to pay allowable costs of such projects; and

        (ii) To the extent the PFC revenue collected in any year exceeds the debt service and financing costs on such bonds during that year, an amount equal to the excess is applied as required by § 158.39.

        (e)  The FAA may authorize a public agency under § 158.18 to impose a PFC for payments for debt service on indebtedness incurred to carry out an airport project that is not eligible if the FAA determines that such use is necessary because of the financial need of the airport.

        (f)  A public agency may combine PFC revenue and airport grant funds to carry out an approved project. These projects are subject to the record keeping and auditing requirements of this part, as well as the reporting, record keeping and auditing requirements imposed by the Airport and Airway Improvement Act of 1982 (AAIA).

        (g)  Public agencies may use PFC revenue to meet the non-Federal share of the cost of projects funded under the Federal airport grant program or the FAA “Program to Permit Cost-Sharing of Air Traffic Modernization Projects” under 49 U.S.C. 44517.

        (h)  The public agency may not use PFC revenue or interest earned thereon except on an approved project.

        (1) Airport development eligible under subchapter I of chapter 471 of 49 U.S.C.;

        (2) Airport planning eligible under subchapter I of chapter 471 of 49 U.S.C.;

        (3) Terminal development as described in 49 U.S.C. 47110(d);

        (4) Airport noise compatibility planning as described in 49 U.S.C. 47505;

        (5) Noise compatibility measures eligible for Federal assistance under 49 U.S.C. 47504, without regard to whether the measures are approved under 49 U.S.C. 47504;

        (6) Construction of gates and related areas at which passengers are enplaned or deplaned and other areas directly related to the movement of passengers and baggage in air commerce within the boundaries of the airport. These areas do not include restaurants, car rental and automobile parking facilities, or other concessions. Projects required to enable added air service by an air carrier with less than 50 percent of the annual passenger boardings at an airport have added eligibility. Such projects may include structural foundations and floor systems, exterior building walls and load-bearing interior columns or walls, windows, door and roof systems, building utilities (including heating, air conditioning, ventilation, plumbing, and electrical service), and aircraft fueling facilities next to the gate;

        (7) A project approved under the FAA's “Program to Permit Cost-Sharing of Air Traffic Modernization Projects” under 49 U.S.C. 44517; or

        (8) If the airport is in an air quality nonattainment area (as defined by section 171(2) of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7501(2)) or a maintenance area referred to in section 175A of such Act (42 U.S.C. 7505a), and the project will result in the airport receiving appropriate emission credits as described in 49 U.S.C. 47139, a project for:

        (i) Converting vehicles eligible under § 158.15(b)(1) and ground support equipment powered by a diesel or gasoline engine used at a commercial service airport to low-emission technology certified or verified by the Environmental Protection Agency to reduce emissions or to use cleaner burning conventional fuels; or

        (ii) Acquiring for use at a commercial service airport vehicles eligible under § 158.15(b)(1) and, subject to § 158.13(c), ground support equipment that include low-emission technology or use cleaner burning fuels.

        (c) An eligible project must be adequately justified to qualify for PFC funding.

        (6) A signed statement certifying that the public agency will comply with the assurances set forth in Appendix A to this part.

        (7) Any additional information the Administrator may require.

        (c)  A public agency may use PFC revenue only for projects included in notices filed under this paragraph or approved under § 158.29. This paragraph sets forth the information that a public agency must file, unless otherwise authorized by the Administrator, in its notice of intent to use PFC revenue to finance specific projects under this section.

        (1) A notice of intent to use PFC revenue filed concurrently with a notice of intent to impose a PFC must include:

        (i) The information required under paragraphs (b)(1) through (7) of this section;

        (ii) A completed FAA Form 5500-1, Attachment G, Airport Layout Plan, Airspace, and Environmental Findings (latest edition) for all projects not included in an existing Federal airport program grant.

        (2) A notice of intent to use PFC revenue where the FAA has previously acknowledged a notice of intent to impose a PFC must:

        (i) Be preceded by further consultation with air carriers and the opportunity for public comment under §§ 158.23 and 158.24 of this part. However, a meeting with the air carriers is optional if all information is the same as that provided with the impose authority notice;

        (ii) Include a copy of any comments received by the public agency during the air carrier consultation and public comment processes (§§ 158.23 and 158.24) and the public agency's response to any disagreements or negative comments; and

        (iii) Include any updated and changed information:

        (A) Required by paragraphs (b)(1), (2), (5), (6), and (7) of this section; and

        (B) Required by paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section.

        (d)  (1) The FAA will review the notice of intent to determine that:

        (A) The amount and duration of the PFC will not result in revenue that exceeds the amount necessary to finance the project(s);

        (B) Each proposed project meets the requirements of § 158.15;

        (C) Each project proposed at a PFC level above $3.00 meets the requirements of § 158.17(a)(2) and (3);

        (D) All applicable airport layout plan, airspace, and environmental requirements have been met for each project;

        (E) Any request by the public agency to exclude a class of carriers from the requirement to collect the PFC is reasonable, not arbitrary, nondiscriminatory, and otherwise complies with the law; and

        (F) The consultation and public comment processes complied with §§ 158.23 and 158.24.

        (2) The FAA will also make a determination regarding the public agency's compliance with 49 U.S.C. 47524 and 47526 governing airport noise and access restrictions and 49 U.S.C. 47107(b) governing the use of airport revenue. Finally, the FAA will review all comments filed during the air carrier consultation and public comment processes.

        (e)  Within 30 days of receipt of the public agency's notice of intent about its PFC program, the FAA will issue a written acknowledgment of the public agency's notice. The FAA's acknowledgment may concur with all proposed projects, may object to some or all proposed projects, or may object to the notice of intent in its entirety. The FAA's acknowledgment will include the reason(s) for any objection(s).

        (f) Public agency actions following issuance of FAA acknowledgment letter. If the FAA does not object to either a project or the notice of intent in its entirety, the public agency may implement its PFC program. The public agency's implementation must follow the information specified in its notice of intent. If the FAA objects to a project, the public agency may not collect or use PFC revenue on that project. If the FAA objects to the notice of intent in its entirety, the public agency may not implement the PFC program proposed in that notice. When implementing a PFC under this section, except for § 158.25, a public agency must comply with all sections of part 158.

        (g)  An FAA acknowledgment issued under this section is not considered an order issued by the Secretary for purposes of 49 U.S.C. 46110 (Judicial Review).

        (h)  This section will expire May 9, 2008.

        (a) If the PFC revenue remitted to the public agency, plus interest earned thereon, exceeds the allowable cost of the project, the public agency must use the excess funds for approved projects or to retire outstanding PFC-financed bonds.

        (b) For bond-financed projects, any excess PFC revenue collected under debt servicing requirements shall be retained by the public agency and used for approved projects or retirement of outstanding PFC-financed bonds.

        (c) When the authority to impose a PFC has expired or has been terminated, accumulated PFC revenue shall be used for approved projects or retirement of outstanding PFC-financed bonds.

        (d) Within 30 days after the authority to impose a PFC has expired or been terminated, the public agency must present a plan to the appropriate FAA Airports office to begin using accumulated PFC revenue. The plan must include a timetable for submitting any necessary application under this part. If the public agency fails to submit such a plan, or if the plan is not acceptable to the Administrator, the Administrator may reduce Federal airport grant program apportioned funds.

        § 158.43   Public agency notification to collect PFC's.

#### § § 158.43

        (a) Following approval of an application to impose a PFC under subpart B of this part, the public agency shall notify the air carriers and foreign air carriers required to collect PFC's at its airport of the Administrator's approval. Each notified carrier shall notify its agents, including other issuing carriers, of the collection requirement.

        (b) The notification shall be in writing and contain at a minimum the following information:

        (1) The level of PFC to be imposed.

        (2) The total revenue to be collected.

        (3) The charge effective date will always be the first day of the month; however, it must be at least 30 days after the date the public agency notified the air carriers of the FAA's approval to impose the PFC.

        (4) The proposed charge expiration date.

        (5) A copy of the Administrator's notice of approval.

        (6) The address where remittances and reports are to be filed by carriers.

        (c) The public agency must notify air carriers required to collect PFCs at its airport and the FAA of changes in the charge expiration date at least 30 days before the existing charge expiration date or new charge expiration date, whichever comes first. Each notified air carrier must notify its agents, including other issuing carriers, of such changes.

        (d) The public agency shall provide a copy of the notification to the appropriate FAA Airports office.

        § 158.45   Collection of PFC's on tickets issued in the U.S.

#### § § 158.45

        (a) On and after the charge effective date, tickets issued in the U.S. shall include the required PFC except as provided in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section.

        (1) Issuing carriers shall be responsible for all funds from time of collection to remittance.

        (2) The appropriate charge is the PFC in effect at the time the ticket is issued.

        (3) Issuing carriers and their agents shall collect PFCs based on the itinerary at the time of issuance.

        (i) Any change in itinerary initiated by a passenger that requires an adjustment to the amount paid by the passenger is subject to collection or refund of the PFC as appropriate.

        (ii) Failure to travel on a nonrefundable or expired ticket is not a change in itinerary. If the ticket purchaser is not permitted any fare refund on the unused ticket, the ticket purchaser is not permitted a refund of any PFC associated with that ticket.

        (b) Issuing carriers and their agents shall note as a separate item on each air travel ticket upon which a PFC is shown, the total amount of PFC's paid by the passenger and the airports for which the PFC's are collected.

        (c) For each one-way trip shown on the complete itinerary of an air travel ticket, issuing air carriers and their agents shall collect a PFC from a passenger only for the first two airports where PFC's are imposed. For each round trip, a PFC shall be collected only for enplanements at the first two enplaning airports and the last two enplaning airports where PFC's are imposed.

        (d) In addition to the restriction in paragraph (c) of this section, issuing carriers and their agents shall not collect PFC's from a passenger covered by any of the other limitations described in § 158.9(a).

        (e) Collected PFC's shall be distributed as noted on the air travel ticket.

        (f) Issuing carriers and their agents shall stop collecting the PFC's on the charge expiration date stated in a notice from the public agency, or as required by the Administrator.

        § 158.47   Collection of PFC's on tickets issued outside the U.S.

#### § § 158.47

        (a) For tickets issued outside the U.S., an air carrier or foreign air carrier may follow the requirements of either § 158.45 or this section, unless the itinerary is for travel wholly within the U.S. Air carriers and foreign air carriers must comply with § 158.45 where the itinerary is for travel wholly within the U.S. regardless of where the ticket is issued.

        (b) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this part, no foreign airline is required to collect a PFC on air travel tickets issued on its own ticket stock unless it serves a point or points in the U.S.

        (c) If an air carrier or foreign air carrier elects not to comply with § 158.45 for tickets issued outside the U.S.—

        (1) The carrier is required to collect PFC's on such tickets only for the public agency controlling the last airport at which the passenger is enplaned prior to departure from the U.S.

        (2) The carrier may collect the PFC either at the time the ticket is issued or at the time the passenger is last enplaned prior to departure from the U.S. The carrier may vary the method of collection among its flights.

        (3) The carrier shall provide a written record to the passenger that a PFC has been collected. Such a record shall appear on or with the air travel ticket and shall include the same information as required by § 158.45(b), but need not be preprinted on the ticket stock.

        (4) Issuing carriers and their agents shall collect PFCs based on the itinerary at the time of issuance.

        (i) Any change in itinerary initiated by a passenger that requires an adjustment to the amount paid by the passenger is subject to collection or refund of the PFC as appropriate.

        (ii) Failure to travel on a nonrefundable or expired ticket is not a change in itinerary. If the ticket purchaser is not permitted any fare refund on the unused ticket, the ticket purchaser is not permitted a refund of any PFC associated with that ticket.

        (d) With respect to a flight on which the air carrier or foreign air carrier chooses to collect the PFC at the time the air travel ticket is issued—

        (1) The carrier and its agents shall collect the required PFC on tickets issued on or after the charge effective date.

        (2) The carrier is not required to collect PFC's at the time of enplanement for tickets sold by other air carriers or foreign air carriers or their agents.

        (e) With respect to a flight on which the air carrier or foreign air carrier chooses to collect the PFC at the time of enplanement, the carrier shall examine the air travel ticket of each passenger enplaning at the airport on and after the charge effective date and shall collect the PFC from any passenger whose air travel ticket does not include a written record indicating that the PFC was collected at the time of issuance.

        (f) Collected PFC's shall be distributed as noted on the written record provided to the passenger.

        (g) Collecting carriers shall be responsible for all funds from time of collection to remittance.

        (h) Collecting carriers and their agents shall stop collecting the PFC on the charge expiration date stated in a notice from the public agency, or as required by the Administrator.

        § 158.49   Handling of PFC's.

#### § § 158.49

        (a) Collecting carriers shall establish and maintain a financial management system to account for PFC's in accordance with the Department of Transportation's Uniform System of Accounts and Reports (14 CFR part 241). For carriers not subject to 14 CFR part 241, such carriers shall establish and maintain an accounts payable system to handle PFC revenue with subaccounts for each public agency to which such carrier remits PFC revenue.

        (b) Collecting carriers must account for PFC revenue separately. PFC revenue may be commingled with the air carrier's other sources of revenue except for covered air carriers discussed in paragraph (c) of this section. PFC revenues held by an air carrier or an agent of the air carrier after collection are held in trust for the beneficial interest of the public agency imposing the PFC. Such air carrier or agent holds neither legal nor equitable interest in the PFC revenues except for any handling fee or interest collected on unremitted proceeds as authorized in § 158.53.

        (c)(1) A covered air carrier must segregate PFC revenue in a designated separate PFC account. Regardless of the amount of PFC revenue in the covered air carrier's account at the time the bankruptcy petition is filed, the covered air carrier must deposit into the separate PFC account an amount equal to the average monthly liability for PFCs collected under this section by such air carrier or any of its agents.

        (i) The covered air carrier is required to create one PFC account to cover all PFC revenue it collects. The designated PFC account is solely for PFC transactions and the covered air carrier must make all PFC transactions from that PFC account. The covered air carrier is not required to create separate PFC accounts for each airport where a PFC is imposed.

        (ii) The covered air carrier must transfer PFCs from its general accounts into the separate PFC account in an amount equal to the average monthly liability for PFCs as the “PFC reserve.” The PFC reserve must equal a one-month average of the sum of the total PFCs collected by the covered air carrier, net of any credits or handling fees allowed by law, during the past 12-month period of PFC collections immediately before entering bankruptcy.

        (iii) The minimum PFC reserve balance must never fall below the fixed amount defined in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section.

        (iv) A covered air carrier may continue to deposit the PFCs it collects into its general operating accounts combined with ticket sales revenue. However, at least once every business day, the covered air carrier must remove all PFC revenue (Daily PFC amount) from those accounts and transfer it to the new PFC account. An estimate based on   of the PFC reserve balance is permitted in substitution of the Daily PFC amount.

        (A) In the event a covered air carrier ceases operations while still owing PFC remittances, the PFC reserve fund may be used to make those remittances. If there is any balance in the PFC reserve fund after all PFC remittances are made, that balance will be returned to the covered air carrier's general account.

        (B) In the event a covered air carrier emerges from bankruptcy protection and ceases to be a covered air carrier, any balance remaining in the PFC reserve fund after any outstanding PFC obligations are met will be returned to the air carrier's general account.

        (v) If the covered air carrier uses an estimate rather than the daily PFC amount, the covered air carrier shall reconcile the estimated amount with the actual amount of PFCs collected for the prior month (Actual Monthly PFCs). This reconciliation must take place no later than the 20th day of the month (or the next business day if the date is not a business day). In the event the Actual Monthly PFCs are greater than the aggregate estimated PFC amount, the covered air carrier will, within one business day of the reconciliation, deposit the difference into the PFC account. If the Actual Monthly PFCs are less than the aggregate estimated PFC amount, the covered air carrier will be entitled to a credit in the amount of the difference to be applied to the daily PFC amount due.

        (vi) The covered air carrier is permitted to recalculate and reset the PFC reserve and daily PFC amount on each successive anniversary date of its bankruptcy petition using the methodology described above.

        (2) If a covered air carrier or its agent fails to segregate PFC revenue in violation of paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the trust fund status of such revenue shall not be defeated by an inability of any party to identify and trace the precise funds in the accounts of the air carrier.

        (3) A covered air carrier and its agents may not grant to any third party any security or other interest in PFC revenue.

        (4) A covered air carrier that fails to comply with any requirement of paragraph (c) of this section, or causes an eligible public agency to spend funds to recover or retain payment of PFC revenue, must compensate that public agency for those cost incurred to recover the PFCs owed.

        (5) The provisions of paragraph (b) of this section that allow the commingling of PFCs with other air carrier revenue do not apply to a covered air carrier.

        (d) All collecting air carriers must disclose the existence and amount of PFC funds regarded as trust funds in their financial statements.

        § 158.51   Remittance of PFC's.

#### § § 158.51

        Passenger facility charges collected by carriers shall be remitted to the public agency on a monthly basis. PFC revenue recorded in the accounting system of the carrier, as set forth in § 158.49 of this part, shall be remitted to the public agency no later than the last day of the following calendar month (or if that date falls on a weekend or holiday, the first business day thereafter).

        § 158.53   Collection compensation.

#### § § 158.53

        (a) As compensation for collecting, handling, and remitting the PFC revenue, the collecting air carrier is entitled to:

        (1) $0.11 of each PFC collected.

        (2) Any interest or other investment return earned on PFC revenue between the time of collection and remittance to the public agency.

        (b) A covered air carrier that fails to designate a separate PFC account is prohibited from collecting interest on the PFC revenue. Where a covered air carrier maintains a separate PFC account in compliance with § 158.49(c), it will receive the interest on PFC accounts as described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.

        (c)(1) Collecting air carriers may provide collection cost data periodically to the FAA after the agency issues a notice in the  that specifies the information and deadline for filing the information. Submission of the information is voluntary. The requested information must include data on interest earned by the air carriers on PFC revenue and air carrier collection, handling, and remittance costs in the following categories:

        (i) Credit card fees;

        (ii) Audit fees;

        (iii) PFC disclosure fees;

        (iv) Reservations costs;

        (v) Passenger service costs;

        (vi) Revenue accounting, data entry, accounts payable, tax, and legal fees;

        (vii) Corporate property department costs;

        (viii) Training for reservations agents, ticket agents, and other departments;

        (ix) Ongoing carrier information systems costs;

        (x) Ongoing computer reservations systems costs; and

        (xi) Airline Reporting Corporation fees.

        (2) The FAA may determine a new compensation level based on an analysis of the data provided under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, if the data is submitted by carriers representing at least 75 percent of PFCs collected nationwide.

        (3) Any new compensation level determined by the FAA under paragraph (c)(2) of this section will replace the level identified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.

        § 161.7   Limitations.

#### § § 161.7

        (a) Aircraft operational procedures that must be submitted for adoption by the FAA, such as preferential runway use, noise abatement approach and departure procedures and profiles, and flight tracks, are not subject to this part. Other noise abatement procedures, such as taxiing and engine runups, are not subject to this part unless the procedures imposed limit the total number of Stage 2 or Stage 3 aircraft operations, or limit the hours of Stage 2 or Stage 3 aircraft operations, at the airport.

        (b) The notice, review, and approval requirements set forth in this part do not apply to airports with restrictions as specified in 49 U.S.C. App. 2153(a)(2)(C):

        (1) A local action to enforce a negotiated or executed airport aircraft noise or access agreement between the airport operator and the aircraft operator in effect on November 5, 1990.

        (2) A local action to enforce a negotiated or executed airport aircraft noise or access restriction the airport operator and the aircraft operators agreed to before November 5, 1990.

        (3) An intergovernmental agreement including airport aircraft noise or access restriction in effect on November 5, 1990.

        (4) A subsequent amendment to an airport aircraft noise or access agreement or restriction in effect on November 5, 1990, where the amendment does not reduce or limit aircraft operations or affect aircraft safety.

        (5) A restriction that was adopted by an airport operator on or before October 1, 1990, and that was stayed as of October 1, 1990, by a court order or as a result of litigation, if such restriction, or a part thereof, is subsequently allowed by a court to take effect.

        (6) In any case in which a restriction described in paragraph (b)(5) of this section is either partially or totally disallowed by a court, any new restriction imposed by an airport operator to replace such disallowed restriction, if such new restriction would not prohibit aircraft operations in effect on November 5, 1990.

        (7) A local action that represents the adoption of the final portion of a program of a staged airport aircraft noise or access restriction, where the initial portion of such program was adopted during calendar year 1988 and was in effect on November 5, 1990.

        (c) The notice, review, and approval requirements of subpart D of this part with regard to Stage 3 aircraft restrictions do not apply if the FAA has, prior to November 5, 1990, formed a working group (outside of the process established by 14 CFR part 150) with a local airport operator to examine the noise impact of air traffic control procedure changes. In any case in which an agreement relating to noise reductions at such airport is then entered into between the airport proprietor and an air carrier or air carrier constituting a majority of the air carrier users of such airport, the requirements of subparts B and D of this part with respect to restrictions on Stage 3 aircraft operations do apply to local actions to enforce such agreements.

        § 161.305   Required analysis and conditions for approval of proposed restrictions.

#### § § 161.305

        Each applicant proposing a noise or access restriction on Stage 3 operations shall prepare and make available for public comment an analysis that supports, by substantial evidence, that the six statutory conditions for approval have been met for each restriction and any alternatives submitted. The statutory conditions are set forth in 49 U.S.C. App. 2153(d)(2) and paragraph (e) of this section. Any proposed restriction (including alternatives) on Stage 3 aircraft operations that also affects the operation of Stage 2 aircraft must include analysis of the proposals in a manner that permits the proposal to be understood in its entirety. (Nothing in this section is intended to add a requirement for the issuance of restrictions on Stage 2 aircraft to those of subpart C of this part.) The applicant shall provide:

        (a) The complete text of the proposed restriction and any submitted alternatives, including the proposed wording in a city ordinance, airport rule, lease, or other document, and any sanctions for noncompliance;

        (b) Maps denoting the airport geographic boundary, and the geographic boundaries and names of each jurisdiction that controls land use within the airport noise study area;

        (c) An adequate environmental assessment of the proposed restriction or adequate information supporting a categorical exclusion in accordance with FAA orders and procedures regarding compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321);

        (d) A summary of the evidence in the submission supporting the six statutory conditions for approval; and

        (e) An analysis of the restriction, demonstrating by substantial evidence that the statutory conditions are met. The analysis must:

        (1) Be sufficiently detailed to allow the FAA to evaluate the merits of the proposed restriction; and

        (2) Contain the following essential elements needed to provide substantial evidence supporting each condition for approval:

        (i)  (A) Essential information needed to demonstrate this condition includes the following:

        () Evidence that a current or projected noise or access problem exists, and that the proposed action(s) could relieve the problem, including:

        () A deta_i_led description of the problem precipitating the proposed restriction with relevant background information on factors contributing to the proposal and any court-ordered action or estimated liability concerns; a description of any noise agreements or noise or access restrictions currently in effect at the airport; and measures taken to achieve land-use compatibility, such as controls or restrictions on land use in the vicinity of the airport and measures carried out in response to 14 CFR part 150; and actions taken to comply with grant assurances requiring that:

        () _A_irport development projects be reasonably consistent with plans of public agencies that are authorized to plan for the development of the area around the airport; and

        () The sponsor give fair consideration to the interests of communities in or near where the project may be located; take appropriate action, including the adoption of zoning laws, to the extent reasonable, to restrict the use of land near the airport to activities and purposes compatible with normal airport operations; and not cause or permit any change in land use, within its jurisdiction, that will reduce the compatibility (with respect to the airport) of any noise compatibility program measures upon which federal funds have been expended.

        () An analysis of the estimated noise impact of aircraft operations with and without the proposed restriction for the year the restriction is expected to be implemented, for a forecast timeframe after implementation, and for any other years critical to understanding the noise impact of the proposed restriction. The analysis of noise impact with and without the proposed restriction including:

        () Maps of the airport noise study area overlaid with noise contours as specified in §§ 161.9 and 161.11 of this part;

        () The number of people and the noncompatible land uses within the airport noise study area with and without the proposed restriction for each year the noise restriction is analyzed;

        () Technical data supporting the noise impact analysis, including the classes of aircraft, fleet mix, runway use percentage, and day/night breakout of operations; and

        () _D_ata on current and projected airport activity that would exist in the absence of the proposed restriction.

        () Evidence that other available remedies are infeasible or would be less cost-effective, including descriptions of any alternative aircraft restrictions that have been considered and rejected, and the reasons for the rejection; and of any land use or other nonaircraft controls or restrictions that have been considered and rejected, including those proposed under 14 CFR part 150 and not implemented, and the reasons for the rejection or failure to implement.

        () Evidence that the noise or access standards are the same for all aviation user classes or that the differences are justified, such as:

        () A descr_i_ption of the relationship of the effect of the proposed restriction on airport users (by aviation user class); and

        () The noise attributable to these users in the absence of the proposed restriction.

        (B) At the applicant's discretion, information may also be submitted as follows:

        () Evidence not submitted under paragraph (e)(2)(ii)(A) of this section (Condition 2) that there is a reasonable chance that expected benefits will equal or exceed expected cost; for example, comparative economic analyses of the costs and benefits of the proposed restriction and aircraft and nonaircraft alternative measures. For detailed elements of analysis, see paragraph (e)(2)(ii)(A) of this section.

        () Evidence not submitted under paragraph (e)(_2_)(ii)(A) of this section that the level of any noise-based fees that may be imposed reflects the cost of mitigating noise impacts produced by the aircraft, or that the fees are reasonably related to the intended level of noise impact mitigation.

        (ii)  (A) Essential information needed to demonstrate this statutory condition includes:

        () Evidence, based on a cost-benefit analysis, that the estimated potential benefits of the restriction have a reasonable chance to exceed the estimated potential cost of the adverse effects on interstate and foreign commerce. In preparing the economic analysis required by this section, the applicant shall use currently accepted economic methodology, specify the methods used and assumptions underlying the analysis, and consider:

        () The effect of the proposed restr_i_ction on operations of aircraft by aviation user class (and for air carriers, the number of operations of aircraft by carrier), and on the volume of passengers and cargo for the year the restriction is expected to be implemented and for the forecast timeframe.

        () The estimated costs of the proposed restriction and alternative nonaircraft restrictions including the following, as appropriate:

        () _A_ny additional cost of continuing aircraft operations under the restriction, including reasonably available information concerning any net capital costs of acquiring or retrofitting aircraft (net of salvage value and operating efficiencies) by aviation user class; and any incremental recurring costs;

        () Costs associated with altered or discontinued aircraft operations, such as reasonably available information concerning loss to carriers of operating profits; decreases in passenger and shipper consumer surplus by aviation user class; loss in profits associated with other airport services or other entities: and/or any significant economic effect on parties other than aviation users.

        () _C_osts associated with implementing nonaircraft restrictions or nonaircraft components of restrictions, such as reasonably available information concerning estimates of capital costs for real property, including redevelopment, soundproofing, noise easements, and purchase of property interests; and estimates of associated incremental recurring costs; or an explanation of the legal or other impediments to implementing such restrictions.

        () Estimated benefits of the proposed restriction and alternative restrictions that consider, as appropriate, anticipated increase in real estate values and future construction cost (such as sound insulation) savings; anticipated increase in airport revenues; quantification of the noise benefits, such as number of people removed from noise contours and improved work force and/or educational productivity, if any; valuation of positive safety effects, if any; and/or other qualitative benefits, including improvements in quality of life.

        (B) At the applicant's discretion, information may also be submitted as follows:

        () Evidence that the affected carriers have a reasonable chance to continue service at the airport or at other points in the national airport system.

        () Evidence that other air carriers are able to provide adequate service to the airport and other points in the system without diminishing competition.

        () Evidence that comparable services or facilities are available at another airport controlled by the airport operator in the market area, including services available at other airports.

        () Evidence that alternative transportation service can be attained through other means of transportation.

        () Information on the absence of adverse evidence or adverse comments with respect to undue burden in the notice process required in § 161.303, or alternatively in § 161.321, of this part as evidence that there is no undue burden.

        (iii)  Essential information needed to demonstrate this statutory condition includes evidence that the proposed restriction maintains safe and efficient use of the navigable airspace based upon:

        (A) Identification of airspace and obstacles to navigation in the vicinity of the airport; and

        (B) An analysis of the effects of the proposed restriction with respect to use of airspace in the vicinity of the airport, substantiating that the restriction maintains or enhances safe and efficient use of the navigable airspace. The analysis shall include a description of the methods and data used.

        (iv)  Essential information needed to demonstrate this condition includes evidence demonstrating that no conflict is presented between the proposed restriction and any existing Federal statute or regulation, including those governing:

        (A) Exclusive rights;

        (B) Control of aircraft operations; and

        (C) Existing Federal grant agreements.

        (v)  Essential information needed to demonstrate this condition includes evidence that there has been adequate opportunity for public comment on the restriction as specified in § 161.303 or § 161.321 of this part.

        (vi)  Essential information needed to demonstrate this condition includes evidence that the proposed restriction does not create an undue burden on the national aviation system such as:

        (A) An analysis demonstrating that the proposed restriction does not have a substantial adverse effect on existing or planned airport system capacity, on observed or forecast airport system congestion and aircraft delay, and on airspace system capacity or workload;

        (B) An analysis demonstrating that nonaircraft alternative measures to achieve the same goals as the proposed subject restrictions are inappropriate;

        (C) The absence of comments with respect to imposition of an undue burden on the national aviation system in response to the notice required in § 161.303 or § 161.321.

        § 161.307   Comment by interested parties.

#### § § 161.307

        (a) Each applicant proposing a restriction shall establish a public docket or similar method for receiving and considering comments, and shall make comments available for inspection by interested parties upon request. Comments must be retained as long as the restriction is in effect.

        (b) Each applicant shall submit to the FAA a summary of any comments received. Upon request by the FAA, the applicant shall submit copies of the comments.

        § 161.309   Requirements for proposal changes.

#### § § 161.309

        (a) Each applicant shall promptly advise interested parties of any changes to a proposed restriction or alternative restriction that are not encompassed in the proposals submitted, including changes that affect noncompatible land uses or that take place before the effective date of the restriction, and make available these changes to the proposed restriction and its analysis. For the purpose of this paragraph, interested parties include those who received direct notice under § 161.303(b) of this part, or those who were required to be consulted in accordance with the procedures in § 161.321 of this part, and those who commented on the proposed restriction.

        (b) If there are substantial changes to a proposed restriction or the analysis made available prior to the effective date of the restriction, the applicant proposing the restriction shall initiate new notice in accordance with the procedures in § 161.303 or, alternatively, the procedures in § 161.321. These requirements apply to substantial changes that are not encompassed in submitted alternative restriction proposals and their analyses. A substantial change to a restriction includes, but is not limited to, any proposal that would increase the burden on any aviation user class.

        (c) In addition to the information in § 161.303(c), a new notice must indicate that the applicant is revising a previous notice, provide the reason for making the revision, and provide a new effective date (if any) for the restriction.

        (d) If substantial changes requiring a new notice are made during the FAA's 180-day review of the proposed restriction, the applicant submitting the proposed restriction shall notify the FAA in writing that it is withdrawing its proposal from the review process until it has completed additional analysis, public review, and documentation of the public review. Resubmission to the FAA will restart the 180-day review.

        § 161.311   Application procedure for approval of proposed restriction.

#### § § 161.311

        Each applicant proposing a Stage 3 restriction shall submit to the FAA the following information for each restriction and alternative restriction submitted, with a request that the FAA review and approve the proposed Stage 3 noise or access restriction:

        (b) An analysis as specified in § 161.305, as appropriate to the proposed restriction;

        (c) A statement that the entity submitting the proposal is the party empowered to implement the restriction, or is submitting the proposal on behalf of such party; and

        (d) A statement as to whether the airport requests, in the event of disapproval of the proposed restriction or any alternatives, that the FAA approve any portion of the restriction or any alternative that meets the statutory requirements for approval. An applicant requesting partial approval of any proposal should indicate its priorities as to portions of the proposal to be approved.

        § 161.313   Review of application.

#### § § 161.313

        (a)  The FAA, within 30 days of receipt of an application, will determine whether the application is complete in accordance with § 161.311. Determinations of completeness will be made on all proposed restrictions and alternatives. This completeness determination is not an approval or disapproval of the proposed restriction.

        (b)  When the FAA determines that a complete application has been submitted, the following procedures apply:

        (1) The FAA notifies the applicant that it intends to act on the proposed restriction and publishes notice of the proposed restriction in the  in accordance with § 161.315. The 180-day period for approving or disapproving the proposed restriction will start on the date of original FAA receipt of the application.

        (2) Following review of the application, public comments, and any other information obtained under § 161.317(b), the FAA will issue a decision approving or disapproving the proposed restriction. This decision is a final decision of the Administrator for purpose of judicial review.

        (c)  If the FAA determines that an application is not complete with respect to any submitted restriction or alternative restriction, the following procedures apply:

        (1) The FAA shall notify the applicant in writing, returning the application and setting forth the type of information and analysis needed to complete the application in accordance with § 161.311.

        (2) Within 30 days after the receipt of this notice, the applicant shall advise the FAA in writing whether or not it intends to resubmit and supplement its application.

        (3) If the applicant does not respond in 30 days, or advises the FAA that it does not intend to resubmit and/or supplement the application, the application will be denied. This closes the matter without prejudice to later application and does not constitute disapproval of the proposed restriction.

        (4) If the applicant chooses to resubmit and supplement the application, the following procedures apply:

        (i) Upon receipt of the resubmitted application, the FAA determines whether the application, as supplemented, is complete as set forth in paragraph (a) of this section.

        (ii) If the application is complete, the procedures set forth in § 161.315 shall be followed. The 180-day review period starts on the date of receipt of the last supplement to the application.

        (iii) If the application is still not complete with respect to the proposed restriction or at least one submitted alternative, the FAA so advises the applicant as set forth in paragraph (c)(1) of this section and provides the applicant with an additional opportunity to supplement the application as set forth in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.

        (iv) If the environmental documentation (either an environmental assessment or information supporting a categorical exclusion) is incomplete, the FAA will so notify the applicant in writing, returning the application and setting forth the types of information and analysis needed to complete the documentation. The FAA will continue to return an application until adequate environmental documentation is provided. When the application is determined to be complete, including the environmental documentation, the 180-day period for approval or disapproval will begin upon receipt of the last supplement to the application.

        (v) Following review of the application and its supplements, public comments, and any other information obtained under § 161.317(b), the FAA will issue a decision approving or disapproving the application. This decision is a final decision of the Administrator for the purpose of judicial review.

        (5) The FAA will deny the application and return it to the applicant if:

        (i) None of the proposals submitted are found to be complete;

        (ii) The application has been returned twice to the applicant for reasons other than completion of the environmental documentation; and

        (iii) The applicant declines to complete the application. This closes the matter without prejudice to later application, and does not constitute disapproval of the proposed restriction.

        § 161.315   Receipt of complete application.

#### § § 161.315

        (a) When a complete application has been received, the FAA will notify the applicant by letter that the FAA intends to act on the application.

        (b) The FAA will publish notice of the proposed restriction in the  inviting interested parties to file comments on the application within 30 days after publication of the  notice.

        § 161.317   Approval or disapproval of proposed restriction.

#### § § 161.317

        (a) Upon determination that an application is complete with respect to at least one of the proposals submitted by the applicant, the FAA will act upon the complete proposals in the application. The FAA will not act on any proposal for which the applicant has declined to submit additional necessary information.

        (b) The FAA will review the applicant's proposals in the preference order specified by the applicant. The FAA may request additional information from aircraft operators, or any other party, and may convene an informal meeting to gather facts relevant to its determination.

        (c) The FAA will evaluate the proposal and issue an order approving or disapproving the proposed restriction and any submitted alternatives, in whole or in part, in the order of preference indicated by the applicant. Once the FAA approves a proposed restriction, the FAA will not consider any proposals of lower applicant-stated preference. Approval or disapproval will be given by the FAA within 180 days after receipt of the application or last supplement thereto under § 161.313. The FAA will publish its decision in the  and notify the applicant in writing.

        (d) The applicant's failure to provide substantial evidence supporting the statutory conditions for approval of a particular proposal is grounds for disapproval of that proposed restriction.

        (e) The FAA will approve or disapprove only the Stage 3 aspects of a restriction if the restriction applies to both Stage 2 and Stage 3 aircraft operations.

        (f) An order approving a restriction may be subject to requirements that the applicant:

        (1) Comply with factual representations and commitments in support of the restriction; and

        (2) Ensure that any environmental mitigation actions or commitments by any party that are set forth in the environmental documentation provided in support of the restriction are implemented.

        § 161.319   Withdrawal or revision of restriction.

#### § § 161.319

        (a) The applicant may withdraw or revise a proposed restriction at any time prior to FAA approval or disapproval, and must do so if substantial changes are made as described in § 161.309. The applicant shall notify the FAA in writing of a decision to withdraw the proposed restriction for any reason. The FAA will publish a notice in the  that it has terminated its review without prejudice to resubmission. A resubmission will be considered a new application.

        (b) A subsequent amendment to a Stage 3 restriction that was in effect after October 1, 1990, or an amendment to a Stage 3 restriction previously approved by the FAA, is subject to the procedures in this subpart if the amendment will further reduce or limit aircraft operations or affect aircraft safety. The applicant may, at its option, revise or amend a restriction previously disapproved by the FAA and resubmit it for approval. Amendments are subject to the same requirements and procedures as initial submissions.

        § 161.321   Optional use of 14 CFR part 150 procedures.

#### § § 161.321

        (a) An airport operator may use the procedures in part 150 of this chapter, instead of the procedures described in §§ 161.303(b) and 161.309(b) of this part, as a means of providing an adequate public notice and opportunity to comment on proposed Stage 3 restrictions, including submitted alternatives.

        (b) If the airport operator elects to use 14 CFR part 150 procedures to comply with this subpart, the operator shall:

        (1) Ensure that all parties identified for direct notice under § 161.303(b) are notified that the airport's 14 CFR part 150 program submission will include a proposed Stage 3 restriction under part 161, and that these parties are offered the opportunity to participate as consulted parties during the development of the 14 CFR part 150 program;

        (2) Include the information required in § 161.303(c) (2) through (5) and § 161.305 in the analysis of the proposed restriction in the 14 CFR part 150 program submission; and

        (3) Include in its 14 CFR part 150 submission to the FAA evidence of compliance with the notice requirements in paragraph (b)(1) of this section and include the information required for a part 161 application in § 161.311, together with a clear identification that the 14 CFR part 150 submission includes a proposed Stage 3 restriction for FAA review and approval under §§ 161.313, 161.315, and 161.317.

        (c) The FAA will evaluate the proposed part 161 restriction on Stage 3 aircraft operations included in the 14 CFR part 150 submission in accordance with the procedures and standards of this part, and will review the total 14 CFR part 150 submission in accordance with the procedures and standards of 14 CFR part 150.

        (d) An amendment of a restriction, as specified in § 161.319(b) of this part, may also be processed under 14 CFR part 150 procedures.

        § 161.323   Notification of a decision not to implement a restriction.

#### § § 161.323

        If a Stage 3 restriction has been approved by the FAA and the restriction is not subsequently implemented, the applicant shall so advise the interested parties specified in § 161.309(a) of this part.

        § 161.325   Availability of data and comments on an implemented restriction.

#### § § 161.325

        The applicant shall retain all relevant supporting data and all comments relating to an approved restriction for as long as the restriction is in effect and shall make these materials available for inspection upon request by the FAA. This information shall be made available for inspection by any person during the pendency of any petition for reevaluation found justified by the FAA.

      Subpart E—Reevaluation of Stage 3 Restrictions

        § 161.401   Scope.

#### § § 161.401

        This subpart applies to an airport imposing a noise or access restriction on the operation of Stage 3 aircraft that first became effective after October 1, 1990, and had either been agreed to in compliance with the procedures in subpart B of this part or approved by the FAA in accordance with the procedures in subpart D of this part. This subpart does not apply to Stage 2 restrictions imposed by airports. This subpart does not apply to Stage 3 restrictions specifically exempted in § 161.7.

        § 161.403   Criteria for reevaluation.

#### § § 161.403

        (a) A request for reevaluation must be submitted by an aircraft operator.

        (b) An aircraft operator must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the FAA that there has been a change in the noise environment of the affected airport and that a review and reevaluation pursuant to the criteria in § 161.305 is therefore justified.

        (_1_) A change in the noise environment sufficient to justify reevaluation is either a DNL change of 1.5 dB or greater (from the restriction's anticipated target noise level result) over noncompatible land uses, or a change of 17 percent or greater in the noncompatible land uses, within an airport noise study area. For approved restrictions, calculation of change shall be based on the divergence of actual noise impact of the restriction from the estimated noise impact of the restriction predicted in the analysis required in § 161.305(e)(2)(i)(A)()(). The change in the noise environment or in the noncompatible land uses may be either an increase or decrease in noise or in noncompatible land uses. An aircraft operator may submit to the FAA reasons why a change that does not fall within either of these parameters justifies reevaluation, and the FAA will consider such arguments on a case-by-case basis.

        (2) A change in the noise environment justifies reevaluation if the change is likely to result in the restriction not meeting one or more of the conditions for approval set forth in § 161.305 of this part for approval. The aircraft operator must demonstrate that such a result is likely to occur.

        (c) A reevaluation may not occur less than 2 years after the date of the FAA approval. The FAA will normally apply the same 2-year requirement to agreements under subpart B of this part that affect Stage 3 aircraft operations. An aircraft operator may submit to the FAA reasons why an agreement under subpart B of this part should be reevaluated in less than 2 years, and the FAA will consider such arguments on a case-by-case basis.

        (d) An aircraft operator must demonstrate that it has made a good faith attempt to resolve locally any dispute over a restriction with the affected parties, including the airport operator, before requesting reevaluation by the FAA. Such demonstration and certification shall document all attempts of local dispute resolution.

        § 161.415   Reevaluation action.

#### § § 161.415

        (a) Upon completing the reevaluation, the FAA will issue appropriate orders regarding whether or not there is substantial evidence that the restriction meets the criteria in § 161.305 of this part.

        (b) If the FAA's reevaluation confirms that the restriction meets the criteria, the restriction may remain as previously agreed to or approved. If the FAA's reevaluation concludes that the restriction does not meet the criteria, the FAA will withdraw a previous approval of the restriction issued under subpart D of this part to the extent necessary to bring the restriction into compliance with this part or, with respect to a restriction agreed to under subpart B of this part, the FAA will specify which criteria are not met.

        (c) The FAA will publish a notice of its reevaluation findings in the  and notify in writing the aircraft operator that petitioned the FAA for reevaluation and the affected airport operator.

        § 161.417   Notification of status of restrictions and agreements not meeting conditions-of-approval criteria.

#### § § 161.417

        If the FAA has withdrawn all or part of a previous approval made under subpart D of this part, the relevant portion of the Stage 3 restriction must be rescinded. The operator of the affected airport shall notify the FAA of the operator's action with regard to a restriction affecting Stage 3 aircraft operations that has been found not to meet the criteria of § 161.305. Restrictions in agreements determined by the FAA not to meet conditions for approval may not be enforced with respect to Stage 3 aircraft operations.

      Subpart F—Failure To Comply With This Part

        § 161.501   Scope.

#### § § 161.501

        (a) This subpart describes the procedures to terminate eligibility for airport grant funds and authority to impose or collect passenger facility charges for an airport operator's failure to comply with the Airport Noise and Capacity Act of 1990 (49 U.S.C. App. 2151 ) or this part. These procedures may be used with or in addition to any judicial proceedings initiated by the FAA to protect the national aviation system and related Federal interests.

        (b) Under no conditions shall any airport operator receive revenues under the provisions of the Airport and Airway Improvement Act of 1982 or impose or collect a passenger facility charge under section 1113(e) of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 if the FAA determines that the airport is imposing any noise or access restriction not in compliance with the Airport Noise and Capacity Act of 1990 or this part. Recision of, or a commitment in writing signed by an authorized official of the airport operator to rescind or permanently not enforce, a noncomplying restriction will be treated by the FAA as action restoring compliance with the Airport Noise and Capacity Act of 1990 or this part with respect to that restriction.

        § 161.503   Informal resolution; notice of apparent violation.

#### § § 161.503

        Prior to the initiation of formal action to terminate eligibility for airport grant funds or authority to impose or collect passenger facility charges under this subpart, the FAA shall undertake informal resolution with the airport operator to assure compliance with the Airport Noise and Capacity Act of 1990 or this part upon receipt of a complaint or other evidence that an airport operator has taken action to impose a noise or access restriction that appears to be in violation. This shall not preclude a FAA application for expedited judicial action for other than termination of airport grants and passenger facility charges to protect the national aviation system and violated federal interests. If informal resolution is not successful, the FAA will notify the airport operator in writing of the apparent violation. The airport operator shall respond to the notice in writing not later than 20 days after receipt of the notice, and also state whether the airport operator will agree to defer implementation or enforcement of its noise or access restriction until completion of the process under this subpart to determine compliance.

        § 161.505   Notice of proposed termination of airport grant funds and passenger facility charges.

#### § § 161.505

        (a) The FAA begins proceedings under this section to terminate an airport operator's eligibility for airport grant funds and authority to impose or collect passenger facility charges only if the FAA determines that informal resolution is not successful.

        (b) The following procedures shall apply if an airport operator agrees in writing, within 20 days of receipt of the FAA's notice of apparent violation under § 161.503, to defer implementation or enforcement of a noise or access restriction until completion of the process under this subpart to determine compliance.

        (2) Radiation patterns must conform to limits specified in 3.1.3.3 and 3.1.3.4, but this does not mean that suppression of radiation to the rear of the antenna array to satisfy difficult siting positions (as per 3.1.3.1.4) is not allowed. For example, if a reflector screen for the antenna array is required to overcome a siting problem, the area to the rear of the localizer may be made unusable and should be so advertised.

        (3) A third marker beacon (inner marker) is not required.

        (4) The frequency tolerance of the radio frequency carrier must not exceed plus or minus 0.002 percent.

        (b) Ground inspection consists of an examination of the design features of the equipment to determine that there will not be conditions that will allow unsafe operations because of component failure or deterioration.

        (c) The monitor is checked periodically, during the in-service test evaluation period, for calibration and stability. These tests, and ground checks of glide slope and localizer radiation characteristics, are conducted in accordance with FAA Handbooks AF P 6750.1 and AF P 6750.2 “Maintenance Instructions for ILS Localizer Equipment” and “Maintenance Instructions for ILS Glide Slope Equipment”.

        (d) Flight tests to determine the facility's adequacy for operational requirements and compliance with applicable “Standards and Recommended Practices” are conducted in accord- ance with the “U.S. Standard Flight Inspection Manual”, particularly section 217.

        § 171.109   Performance requirements.

#### § § 171.109

        (a) The Simplified Directional Facility must perform in accordance with the following standards and practices:

        (1) The radiation from the SDF antenna system must produce a composite field pattern which is amplitude modulated by a 90 Hz and a 150 Hz tone. The radiation field pattern must produce a course sector with the 90 Hz tone predominating on one side of the course and with the 150 Hz tone predominating on the opposite side.

        (2) When an observer faces the SDF from the approach end of runway, the depth of modulation of the radio frequency carrier due to the 150 Hz tone must predominate on his right hand and that due to the 90 Hz tone must predominate on his left hand.

        (3) All horizontal angles employed in specifying the SDF field patterns must originate from the center of the antenna system which provides the signals used in the front course sector.

        (4) The SDF must operate on odd tenths or odd tenths plus a twentieth MHz within the frequency band 108.1 MHz to 111.95 MHz. The frequency tolerance of the radio frequency carrier must not exceed plus or minus 0.002 percent.

        (5) The radiated emission from the SDF must be horizontally polarized. The vertically polarized component of the radiation on the course line must not exceed that which corresponds to an error one-twentieth of the course sector width when an aircraft is positioned on the course line and is in a roll attitude of 20° from the horizontal.

        (6) The SDF must provide signals sufficient to allow satisfactory operation of a typical aircraft installation within the sector which extends from the center of the SDF antenna system to distances of 18 nautical miles within a plus or minus 10° sector and 10 nautical miles within the remainder of the coverage when alternative navigational facilities provide satisfactory coverage within the intermediate approach area. SDF signals must be receivable at the distances specified at and above a height of 1,000 feet above the elevation of the threshold, or the lowest altitude authorized for transition, whichever is higher. Such signals must be receivable, to the distances specified, up to a surface extending outward from the SDF antenna and inclined at 7° above the horizontal.

        (7) The modulation tones must be phase-locked so that within the half course sector, the demodulated 90 Hz and 150 Hz wave forms pass through zero in the same direction within 20° of phase relative to the 150 Hz component, every half cycle of the combined 90 Hz and 150 Hz wave form. However, the phase need not be measured within the half course sector.

        (8) The angle of convergence of the final approach course and the extended runway centerline must not exceed 30°. The final approach course must be aligned to intersect the extended runway centerline between points A1 and the runway threshold. When an operational advantage can be achieved, a final approach course that does not intersect the runway or that intersects it at a distance greater than point A1 from the threshold, may be established, if that course lies within 500 feet laterally of the extended runway centerline at a point 3,000 feet outward from the runway threshold. The mean course line must be maintained within ±10 percent of the course sector width.

        (9) The nominal displacement sensitivity within the half course sector must be 50 microamperes/degree. The nominal course sector width must be 6°. When an operational advantage can be achieved, a nominal displacement sensitivity of 25 microamperes/degree may be established, with a nominal course sector width of 12° with proportional displacement sensitivity. The lateral displacement sensitivity must be adjusted and maintained within the limits of plus or minus 17 percent of the nominal value.

        (10) The off-course (clearance) signal must increase at a substantially linear rate with respect to the angular displacement from the course line up to an angle on either side of the course line where 175 microamperes of deflection is obtained. From that angle to ±10°, the off-course deflection must not be less than 175 microamperes. From ±10° to ±35° the off-course deflection must not be less than 150 microamperes. With the course adjusted to cause any of several monitor alarm conditions, the aforementioned values of 175 microamperes in the sector 10° each side of course and 150 microamperes in the sector ±10° to ±35° may be reduced to 160 microamperes and 135 microamperes, respectively. These conditions must be met at a distance of 18 nautical miles from the SDF antenna within the sector 10° each side of course line and 10 nautical miles from the SDF antenna within the sector ±10° to ±35° each side of course line.

        (11) The SDF may provide a ground-to-air radiotelephone communication channel to be operated simultaneously with the navigation and identification signals, if that operation does not interfere with the basic function. If a channel is provided, it must conform with the following standards:

        (i) The channel must be on the same radio frequency carrier or carriers as used for the SDF function, and the radiation must be horizontally polarized. Where two carriers are modulated with speech, the relative phases of the modulations on the two carriers must avoid the occurrence of nulls within the coverage of the SDF.

        (ii) On centerline, the peak modulation depth of the carrier or carriers due to the radiotelephone communications must not exceed 50 percent but must be adjusted so that the ratio of peak modulation depth due to the radiotelephone communications to that due to the identification signal is approximately 9:1.

        (iii) The audio frequency characteristics of the radiotelephone channel must be flat to within 3 db relative to the level at 1,000 Hz over the range from 300 Hz to 3,000 Hz.

        (12)(i) The SDF must provide for the simultaneous transmission of an identification signal, specific to the runway and approach direction, on the same radio frequency carrier or carriers as used for the SDF function. The transmission of the identification signal must not interfere in any way with the basic SDF function.

        (ii) The identification signal must be produced by Class A2 modulation of the radio frequency carrier or carriers using a modulation tone of 1020 Hz within ±50 Hz. The depth of modulation must be between the limits of 5 and 15 percent except that, where a radiotelephone communication channel is provided, the depth of modulation must be adjusted so that the ratio of peak modulation depth due to radiotelephone communications to that due to the identification signal modulation is approximately 9:1. The emissions carrying the identification signal must be horizontally polarized.

        (iii) The identification signal must employ the International Morse Code and consist of three letters.

        (iv) The identification signal must be transmitted at a speed corresponding to approximately seven words per minute, and must be repeated at approximately equal intervals, not less than six times per minute. When SDF transmission is not available for operational use, including periods of removal of navigational components or during maintenance or test transmissions, the identification signal must be suppressed.

        (b) It must be shown during ground inspection of the design features of the equipment that there will not be conditions that will allow unsafe operations because of component failure or deterioration.

        (c) The monitor must be checked periodically during the in-service test evaluation period for calibration and stability. These tests, and ground checks of SDF radiation characteristics must be conducted in accordance with the maintenance manual required by § 171.115(c) and must meet the standards and tolerances contained in § 171.111(j).

        (d) The monitor system must provide a warning to the designated control point(s) when any of the conditions of § 171.111(j) occur, within the time periods specified in that paragraph.

        § 171.259   Performance requirements: General.

#### § § 171.259

        (a) The ISMLS consists of the following basic components:

        (1) C-Band (5000 MHz-5030 MHz) localizer equipment, associated monitor system, and remote indicator equipment;

        (2) C-Band (5220 MHz-5250 MHz) glide path equipment, associated monitor system, and remote indicator equipment;

        (3) VHF marker beacons (75 MHz), associated monitor systems, and remote indicator equipment.

        (4) An ISMLS airborne receiver or a VHF/UHF ILS receiver modified to be capable of receiving the ISMLS signals. This modification requires the addition of a C-Band antenna, a converter unit, a microwave/ILS mode control, and a VHF/UHF receiver modification kit.

        (b) The electronic ground equipments in paragraph (a)(1), (2), and (3) of this section, must be designed to operate on a nominal 120/240 volt, 60 Hz, 3-wire single phase AC power source.

        (c) ISMLS ground equipment must meet the following service conditions:

        (1) AC line parameters, DC voltage, elevation, and duty:

        (2) Ambient conditions for localizer and glide path equipment:

        (3) Ambient conditions for marker beacon facilities and all other equipment installed outdoors (for example, antennae, field detectors, and shelters):

        (4) All equipment installed outdoors must operate satisfactorily under the following conditions:

        (d) The ISMLS must perform in accordance with the following standards and practices for Facility Performance Category I operation:

        (1) The ISMLS must be constructed and adjusted so that, at a specified distance from the threshold, similar instrumental indications in the aircraft represent similar displacements from the course line or ISMLS glide path, as appropriate, regardless of the particular ground installation in use.

        (2) The localizer and glide path components listed in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section which form part of an ISMLS, must comply at least with the standard performance requirements specified herein. The marker beacon components listed in paragraph (a)(3) of this section which form part of an ISMLS, must comply at least with the standard performance requirements specified in subpart H of this part.

        (3) The ISMLS must be so designed and maintained that the probability of operation is within the performance requirements specified in § 171.273(k).

        (e) The signal format and pairing of the runway localizer and glide path transmitter frequencies of an ISMLS must be in accordance with the frequency plan approved by the FAA, and must meet the following signal format requirements:

        (1) The localizer and glide slope stations must transmit angular guidance information on a C-band microwave carrier on narrow, scanned antenna beams that are encoded to produce a modulation in space which, after averaging over several beam scans, is equivalent to the modulation used for conventional ILS as specified in subpart C of this part, except that the frequency tolerance may not exceed ±0.0001 percent.

        (2) Guidance modulation must be impressed on the microwave carrier of the radiated signal in the form of a summation of 90 Hz and 150 Hz sinusoidal modulation corresponding to the pointing direction of the particular beam which radiates the signal.

        (3) Each of the effective beam positions must be illuminated in a particular sequence for a short time interval. The modulation impressed on each beam must be a sample of the combined 90 Hz and 150 Hz waveform appropriate for that particular beam direction and time slot, and must be accomplished by appropriately varying the length of time the carrier is radiated during each beam illumination interval.

        (4) For those cases where the scanning beam fills the coverage space in steps, the incremental step must not exceed 0.6 times the beam width where the beam is in the proportional guidance sector. In the clearance region, the step may not exceed 0.8 times the beam width.

        (5) At least one pulse duration modulation (pdm) sample pulse per beam width of scan must be provided.

        (7) The minimum beam scan cycle must be 600 Hz.

        (8) The minimum duty ratio detectable by a receiver located anywhere in the coverage areas defined by this specification may not be less than 0.1. Detected duty ratio means the ratio of the average energy per scan detected at a point in space to the average energy per scan transmitted in all directions through the transmitting antenna.

        (9) The localizer must produce a C-band unmodulated reference frequency signal of sufficient strength to allow satisfactory operation of an aircraft receiver within the specified localizer and glide path coverage sectors. Pairing of this reference frequency with the localizer and glide slope frequencies must be in accordance with a frequency plan approved by the FAA.

        § 171.261   Localizer performance requirements.

#### § § 171.261

        This section prescribes the performance requirements for localizer equipment components of the ISMLS.

        (a) The localizer antenna system must:

        (1) Be located on the extension of the centerline of the runway at the stop end;

        (2) Be adjusted so that the course line be on a vertical plane containing the centerline of the runway served;

        (3) Have the minimum height necessary to comply with the coverage requirements prescribed in paragraph (j) of this section;

        (4) Be located at a distance from the stop end of the runway that is consistent with safe obstruction clearance practices;

        (5) Not obscure any light of the approach landing system; and

        (6) Be installed on frangible mounts or beyond the 1000′ light bar.

        (b) On runways where limited terrain prevents the localizer antennae from being positioned on the runway centerline extended, and the cost of the land fill or a tall tower antenna support is prohibitive, the localizer antenna array may be offset, including a collocated ground station, so that the course intercepts the centerline at a point determined by the amount of the angular offset and the glide path angle. If other than a runway centerline localizer is used, the criteria in subpart C of part 97 of this chapter is applicable.

        (c) At locations where two separate ISMLS facilities serve opposite ends of of a single runway, an interlock must ensure that only the facility serving the approach direction being used will radiate.

        (d) The radiation from the localizer antenna system must produce a composite field pattern which is pulse duration modulated, the time average equivalent to amplitude modulation by a 90 Hz and 150 Hz tone. The localizer station must transmit angular guidance information over a C-band microwave carrier on narrow, scanned antenna beams that are encoded to produce a modulation in space which, after averaging over several beam scans, is equivalent to the modulation used for conventional ILS as specified in subpart C of this part. The radiation field pattern must produce a course sector with one tone predominating on one side of the course and with the other tone predominating on the opposite side. When an observer faces the localizer from the approach end of the runway, the depth of modulation of the radio frequency carrier due to the 150 Hz tone must predominate on his right hand and that due to the 90 Hz tone must predominate on his left hand.

        (e) All horizontal angles employed in specifying the localizer field patterns must originate from the center of the localizer antenna system which provides the signals used in the front course sector.

        (f) The ISMLS course sector angle must be adjustable between 3 degrees and 9 degrees. The applicable course sector angle will be established and approved on an individual basis.

        (g) The ISMLS localizer must operate in the band 5000 MHz to 5030 MHz. The frequency tolerance may not exceed ±0.0001 percent.

        (h) The emission from the localizer must be vertically polarized. The horizontally polarized component of the radiation of the course line may not exceed that which corresponds to a DDM error of 0.016 when an aircraft is positioned on the course line and is in a roll attitude of 20 degrees from the horizontal.

        (i) The localizer must provide signals sufficient to allow satisfactory operation of a typical aircraft installation within the localizer and glide path coverage sectors. The localizer coverage sector must extend from the center of the localizer antenna system to distances of 18 nautical miles minimum within ±10 degrees from the front course line, and 10 nautical miles minimum between ±10 degrees and ±35 degrees from the front course line. The ISMLS localizer signals must be receivable at the distances specified up from a surface extending outward from the localizer antenna and within a sector in the elevation plane from 0.300 to 1.750 of the established glide path angle (θ).

        (j) Except as provided in paragraph (k) of this section, in all parts of the coverage volume specified in paragraph (i) of this section, the peak field strength may not be less than −87 dBW/m  , and must permit satisfactory operational usage of ISMLS localizer facilities.

        (k) The minimum peak field strength on the ISMLS glide path and within the localizer course sector from a distance of 10 nautical miles to a height of 100 feet (30 meters) above the horizontal plane containing the threshold, may not be less than + 87 dBW/m  .

        (l) Above 16 degrees, the ISMLS localizer signals must be reduced to as low a value as practicable.

        (m) Bends in the course line may not have amplitudes which exceed the following:

        (n) The amplitudes referred to in paragraph (m) of this section are the DDMs due to bends as realized on the mean course line, when correctly adjusted.

        (o) The radio frequency carrier must meet the following requirements:

        (1) The nominal depth of modulation of the radio frequency carrier due to each of the 90 Hz and 150 Hz tones must be 20 percent along the course line.

        (2) The depth of modulation of the radio frequency carrier due to each of the 90 Hz and 150 Hz tones must be between 18 and 22 percent.

        (3) The frequency tolerance of the 90 Hz and 150 Hz modulated tones must be within ±25 percent.

        (4) Total harmonic content of the 90 Hz tone may not exceed 10 percent.

        (5) Total harmonic content of the 150 Hz tone may not exceed 10 percent. However, a 300 Hz tone may be transmitted for identification purposes.

        (6) At every half cycle of the combined 90 Hz and 150 Hz wave form, the modulation tones must be phase-locked so that within the half course sector, the demodulated 90 Hz and 150 Hz wave forms pass through zero in the same direction within 20 degrees with phase relative to the 150 Hz component. However, the phase need not be measured within the half course sector.

        (p) The mean course line must be adjusted and maintained within ±.015DDM from the runway centerline at the ISMLS reference datum.

        (q) The nominal displacement sensitivity within the half course sector at the ISMLS reference datum, must be 0.00145 DDM/meter (0.00044DDM/foot). However, where the specified nominal displacement sensitivity cannot be met, the displacement sensitivity must be adjusted as near as possible to that value.

        (r) The lateral displacement sensitivity must be adjusted and maintained within 17 percent of the nominal value. Nominal sector width at the ISMLS reference datum is 210 meters (700 feet).

        (s) The increase of DDM must be substantially linear with respect to angular displacement from the front course line where DDM is zero, up to angle on either side of the front course line where the DDM is 0.180. From that angle to ±10 degrees, the DDM may not be less than 0.180. From ±10 degrees to ±35 degrees, the DDM may not be less than 0.155.

        (t) The localizer must provide for the simultaneous transmission of an identification signal which meets the following:

        (1) It must be specific to the runway and approach direction, on the same radio frequency carrier, as used for the localizer function.

        (2) Transmission of the identification signal may not interfere in any way with the basic localizer function.

        (3) The signal must be produced by pulse duration modulation of the radio frequency carrier resulting in a detected audio tone in the airborne VHF receiver of 1020 Hz ±50Hz.

        (4) The depth of modulation must be between the limits of 10 and 12 percent.

        (5) The emissions carrying the identification signal must be vertically polarized.

        (6) The identification signal must employ the International Morse Code and consist of three letters. It must be preceded by the International Morse Code signal of the letter “M” followed by a short pause where it is necessary to distinguish the ISMLS facility from other navigational facilities in the immediate area. At airports where both an ISMLS and an ILS are in operation, each facility must have a different identification call sign.

        (7) The signal must be transmitted at a speed corresponding to approximately seven words per minute, and must be repeated at approximately equal intervals, not less than six times per minute, during which time the localizer is available for operational use. When the localizer is not available for transmission, the identification signal must be suppressed.

        § 171.263   Localizer automatic monitor system.

#### § § 171.263

        (a) The ISMLS localizer equipment must provide an automatic monitor system that transmits a warning to designated local and remote control points when any of the following occurs:

        (1) A shift of the mean course line of the localizer from the runway centerline equivalent to more than 0.015 DDM at the ISMLS reference datum.

        (2) For localizers in which the basic functions are provided by the use of a single-frequency system, a reduction of power output to less than 50 percent of normal or a loss of ground station identification transmissions.

        (3) Changes of displacement sensitivity to a value differing by more than 17 percent from nominal value for the localizer.

        (4) Failure of any part of the monitor itself. Such failure must automatically produce the same results as the malfunctioning of the element being monitored.

        (b) Within 10 seconds of the occurrence of any of the conditions prescribed in paragraph (a) of this section, including periods of zero radiation, localizer signal radiation must cease or the navigation and identification components must be removed.

        § 171.265   Glide path performance requirements.

#### § § 171.265

        This section prescribes the performance requirements for glide path equipment components of the ISMLS. These requirements are based on the assumption that the aircraft is heading directly toward the facility.

        (a) The glide slope antenna system must be located near the approach end of the runway, and the equipment must be adjusted so that the vertical path line will be in a sloping horizontal plane containing the centerline of the runway being served, and satisfy the coverage requirements prescribed in paragraph (g) of this section. For the purpose of obstacle clearance, location of the glide slope antenna system must be in accordance with the criteria specified in subpart C of part 97 of this chapter.

        (b) The radiation from the glide path antenna system must produce a composite field pattern which is pulse duration modulated by a 90 Hz and a 150 Hz tone, which is the time average equivalent to amplitude modulation. The pattern must be arranged to provide a straight line descent path in the vertical plane containing the centerline of the runway, with the 150 Hz tone predominating below the path and the 90 Hz tone predominating above the path to at least an angle equal to 1.752θ. As used in this section theta (θ), denotes the nominal glide path angle. The glide path angle must be adjusted and maintained within 0.075θ.

        (c) The glide path equipment must be capable of producing a radiated glide path from 3 to 9 degrees with respect to the horizontal. However, ISMLS glide path angles in excess of 3 degrees may be used to satisfy instrument approach procedures or to overcome an obstruction clearance problem, only in accordance with the criteria specified in subpart C of part 97 of this chapter.

        (d) The downward extended straight portion of the ISMLS glide path must pass through the ISMLS reference datum at a height ensuring safe guidance over obstructions and safe and efficient use of the runway served. The height of the ISMLS reference datum must be in accordance with subpart C of part 97 of this chapter.

        (e) The glide path equipment must operate in the band 5220 MHz to 5250 MHz. The frequency tolerance may not exceed ±0.0001 percent.

        (f) The emission from the glide path equipment must be vertically polarized.

        (g) The glide path equipment must provide signals sufficient to allow satisfactory operation of a typical aircraft installation insectors of 8 degrees on each side of the centerline of the ISMLS glide path, to a distance of at least 10 nautical miles up to 1.75θ and down to 0.45θ above the horizontal or to such lower angle at which 0.22 DDM is realized.

        (h) To provide the coverage for glide path performance specified in paragraph (g) of this section, the minimum peak field strength within this coverage sector must be −82 dBW/m  . The peak field strength must be provided on the glide path down to a height of 30 meters (100 feet) above the horizontal plane containing the threshold.

        (i) Bends in the glide path may not have amplitudes which exceed the following:

        (j) Guidance modulation must be impressed on the microwave carrier of the radiated glide slope signal in the form of a unique summation of 90 Hz and 150 Hz sinusoidal modulation corresponding to the point direction of the particular beam which radiates the signal. Each of the effective beam positions must be illuminated in sequence for a short time interval. The scan rate must be synchronous with the 90 and 150 Hz tone base. The modulation impressed on each beam must be a sample of the combined 90 Hz and 150 Hz waveform appropriate for that particular beam direction and time slot. The actual modulation must be accomplished by appropriately varying the length of time the carrier is radiated during each beam illumination interval.

        (k) The nominal depth of modulation of the radio frequency carrier due to each of the 90 Hz and 150 Hz tones must be 40 percent along the ISMLS glide path. The depth of modulation may not deviate outside the limits of 37.5 percent to 42.5 percent.

        (l) The following tolerances apply to the frequencies of the modulating tones:

        (1) The modulating tones must be 90 Hz and 150 Hz within 2.5 percent.

        (2) The total harmonic content of the 90 Hz tone may not exceed 10 percent.

        (3) The total harmonic content of the 150 Hz tone may not exceed 10 percent.

        (m) At every half cycle of the combined 90 Hz and 150 Hz wave form, the modulation must be phase-locked so that, within the ISMLS half glide path sector, the demodulated 90 Hz and 150 Hz wave forms pass through zero in the same direction within 20 degrees of phase relative to the 150 Hz component. However, the phase need not be measured within the ISMLS half glide path sector.

        (n) The nominal angular displacement sensitivity must correspond to a DDM of 0.0875 at an angular displacement above and below the glide path of 0.12θ. The glide path angular displacement sensitivity must be adjusted and maintained within ±25 percent of the nominal value selected. The upper and lower sectors must be as symmetrical as practicable within the limits prescribed in this paragraph.

        (o) The DDM below the ISMLS glide path must increase smoothly for decreasing angle until a value of 0.22 DDM is reached. This value must be achieved at an angle not less than 0.30θ above the horizontal. However, if it is achieved at an angle above 0.45θ, the DDM value may not be less than 0.22 at least down to an angle of 0.45θ.

        § 171.267   Glide path automatic monitor system.

#### § § 171.267

        (a) The ISMLS glide path equipment must provide an automatic monitor system that transmits a warning to designated local and remote control points when any of the following occurs:

        (1) A shift of the mean ISMLS glide path angle equivalent to more than 0.075θ.

        (2) For glide paths in which the basic functions are provided by the use of a single frequency system, a reduction of power output to less than 50 percent.

        (3) A change of the angle between the glide path and the line below the glide path (150 Hz predominating), at which a DDM of 0.0875 is realized by more than ±0.0375θ.

        (4) Lowering of the line beneath the ISMLS glide path at which a DDM of 0.0875 is realized to less than 0.75θ from the horizontal.

        (5) Failure of any part of the monitor itself. Such failure must automatically produce the same results as the malfunctioning of the element being monitored.

        (b) At glide path facilities where the selected nominal angular displacement sensitivity corresponds to an angle below the ISMLS glide path, which is close to or at the maximum limits specified, an adjustment to the monitor operating limits may be made to protect against sector deviations below 0.75θ from the horizontal.

        (c) Within 10 seconds of the occurrence of any of the conditions prescribed in paragraph (a) of this section, including periods of zero radiation, glide path signal radiation must cease.

        § 171.269   Marker beacon performance requirements.

#### § § 171.269

        ISMLS marker beacon equipment must meet the performance requirements prescribed in subpart H of this part.

        § 171.271   Installation requirements.

#### § § 171.271

        (a) The ISMLS facility must be permanent in nature, located, constructed, and installed according to accepted good engineering practices, applicable electric and safety codes, FCC licensing requirements, and paragraphs (a) and (c) of § 171.261.

        (b) The ISMLS facility must have a reliable source of suitable primary power, either from a power distribution system or locally generated. Adequate power capacity must be provided for the operation of test and working equipment of the ISMLS.

        (c) The ISMLS facility must have a continuously engaged or floating battery power source for the ground station for continued normal operation if the primary power fails. A trickle charge must be supplied to recharge the batteries during the period of available primary power. Upon loss and subsequent restoration of power, the batteries must be restored to full charge within 24 hours. When primary power is applied, the state of the battery charge may not affect the operation of the ISMLS ground station. The battery must permit continuation of normal operation for at least two hours under the normal operating conditions. The equipment must meet all specification requirements with or without batteries installed.

        (d) There must be a means for determining, from the ground, the performance of the equipment including antennae, both initially and periodically.

        (e) The facility must have, or be supplemented by, ground-air or landline communications services. At facilities within or immediately adjacent to controlled airspace and that are intended for use as instrument approach aids for an airport, there must be ground-air communications or reliable communications (at least a landline telephone) from the airport to the nearest Federal Aviation Administration air traffic control or communication facility. Compliance with this paragraph need not be shown at airports where an adjacent Federal Aviation Administration facility can communicate with aircraft on the ground at the airport and during the entire proposed instrument approach procedure. In addition, at low traffic density airports within or immediately adjacent to controlled airspace, and where extensive delays are not a factor, the requirements of this paragraph may be reduced to reliable communications (at least a landline telephone) from the airport to the nearest Federal Aviation Administration air traffic control or communications facility, if an adjacent Federal Aviation Administration facility can communicate with aircraft during the proposed instrument approach procedure, at least down to the minimum en route altitude for the controlled area.

        (f) Except where no operationally harmful interference will result, at locations where two separate ISMLS facilities serve opposite ends of a single runway, an interlock must ensure that only the facility serving the approach direction in use can radiate.

        § 171.301   Scope.

#### § § 171.301

        This subpart sets forth minimum requirements for the approval, installation, operation and maintenance of non-Federal Microwave Landing System (MLS) facilities that provide the basis for instrument flight rules (IFR) and air traffic control procedures.

        § 171.303   Definitions.

#### § § 171.303

        As used in this subpart:

        means data transmitted in addition to basic data that provide ground equipment siting information for use in refining airborne position calculations and other supplementary information.

        means data transmitted by the ground equipment that are associated directly with the operation of the landing guidance system.

        means the midpoint between the −3 dB points on the leading and trailing edges of the scanning beam main lobe.

        means the width of the scanning beam main lobe measured at the −3 dB points and defined in angular units on the boresight, in the horizontal plane for the azimuth function and in the vertical plane for the elevation function.

        means the volume of airspace, inside the coverage sector, within which the azimuth guidance information provided is not proportional to the angular displacement of the aircraft, but is a constant fly-left or fly-right indication of the direction relative to the approach course the aircraft should proceed in order to enter the proportional guidance sector.

        means those fluctuations in the guidance which affect aircraft attitude, control surface motion, column motion, and wheel motion. Control motion noise is evaluated by filtering the flight error record with a band-pass filter which has corner frequencies at 0.3 radian/sec and 10 radians/sec for azimuth data and 0.5 radian/sec and 10 radians/sec for elevation data.

        means the average number of times per second that transmissions occur for a given function.

        means differential phase modulation of the radio frequency carrier with relative phase states of 0 degree or 180 degrees.

        means the inability of an item to perform within previously specified limits.

        means an unused period of time provided in the transmitted signal format to allow for equipment tolerances.

        means that quality which relates to the trust which can be placed in the correctness of the information supplied by the facility.

        means the average time required to correct an equipment failure over a given period, after a service technician reaches the facility.

        means the average time between equipment failures over a given period.

        means the MLS selected by ICAO for international standardization.

        means the lowest angle of descent along the zero degree azimuth that is consistent with published approach procedures and obstacle clearance criteria.

        is a point at a specified height located vertically above the intersection of the runway centerline and the threshold.

        means a point 15 meters (50 feet) above the runway centerline at the runway midpoint.

        means a point defined by the intersection of the runway centerline with a vertical plane perpendicular to the centerline and passing through the elevation antenna phase center.

        means a signal radiated into areas outside the intended coverage sector, where required, to specifically prevent invalid removal of an airborne warning indication in the presence of misleading guidance information.

        means the guidance perturbations which could cause aircraft displacement from the desired course or glidepath. It is composed of the path following noise and of the mean course error in the case of azimuth functions, or the mean glidepath error in the case of elevation functions. Path following errors are evaluated by filtering the flight error record with a second order low pass filter which has a corner frequency at 0.5 radian/sec for azimuth data or 1.5 radians/sec for elevation data.

        means that portion of the guidance signal error which could cause displacement from the actual mean course line or mean glidepath as appropriate.

        means the type of ground station in which the azimuth portion of the ground station is located near the stop end of the runway, and the elevation portion is located near the approach end.

        means that each function is transmitted on the same frequency in time sequence, with a distinct preamble preceding each function transmission.

These components must be capable of operating on any one of the 200 channels spaced 300 KHz apart with center frequencies from 5031.0 MHz to 5090.7 MHz and with channel numbering as shown in Table 1a. The operating radio frequencies of all ground components must not vary by more than ±10 KHz from the assigned frequency. Any one transmitter frequency must not vary more than ±50 Hz in any one second period. The MLS angle/data and DME equipment must operate on one of the paired channels as shown in Table 1b.

        (b)  (1) The radio frequency emissions from all ground equipment must be nominally vertically polarized. Any horizontally polarized radio frequency emission component from the ground equipment must not have incorrectly coded angle information such that the limits specified in paragraphs (b) (2) and (3) of this section are exceeded.

        (2) Rotation of the receiving antenna thirty degrees from the vertically polarized position must not cause the path following error to exceed the allowed error at that location.

        (c)  Each function transmitter must be capable of DPSK and continuous wave (CW) modulations of the RF carrier which have the following characteristics.

        (1) DPSK. The DPSK signal must have the following characteristics:

        (2) CW. The CW pulse transmissions and the CW angle transmissions as may be required in the signal format of any function must have characteristics such that the requirements of paragraph (d) of this section are met.

        (d)  The transmitted signal must be such that during the transmission time, the mean power density above a height of 600 meters (2000 feet) does not exceed −100.5 dBW/m   for angle guidance and −95.5 dBW/m   for data, as measured in a 150 KHz bandwidth centered at a frequency of 840 KHz or more from the assigned frequency.

        (e)  Synchronization between the azimuth and elevation components is required and, in split-site configurations, would normally be accomplished by landline interconnections. Synchronization monitoring must be provided to preclude function overlap.

        (f)  Angle guidance and data signals must be transmitted at the following average repetition rates:

        (g)  Sequences of angle transmissions which will generate the required repetition rates are shown in Figures 2 and 3.

        (h)  The time periods between angle transmission sequences must be varied so that exact repetitions do not occur within periods of less than 0.5 second in order to protect against synchronous interference. One such combination of sequences is shown in Figure 4 which forms a full multiplex cycle. Data may be transmitted during suitable open times within or between the sequences.

        (i)  Each angle function must contain the following elements: a preamble; sector signals; and a TO and FRO angle scan organized as shown in Figure 5a. Each data function must contain a preamble and a data transmission period organized as shown in Figure 5b.

        (1)  The transmitted angle and date functions must use the preamble format shown in Figure 6. This format consists of a carrier acquisition period of unmodulated CW transmission followed by a receiver synchronization code and a function identification code. The preamble timing must be in accordance with Table 2.

        (i)  The coding used in the preamble for receiver synchronization is a Barker code logic *11*101. The time of the last phase transition midpoint in the code shall be the receiver reference time (see Table 2). The function identification codes must be as shown in Table 3. The last two bits (I and I) of the code are parity bits obeying the equations:

        (ii)  The digital code portions of the preamble must be DPSK modulated in accordance with § 171.311(c)(1) and must be transmitted throughout the function coverage volume.

        (2)  The timing of the angle transmissions must be in accordance with Tables 4a, 4b, and 5. The actual timing of the TO and FRO scans must be as required to meet the accuracy requirements of §§ 171.313 and 171.317.

        (i) Preamble. Must be in accordance with requirements of § 171.311(i)(1).

        (ii)  In all azimuth formats, sector signals must be transmitted to provide Morse Code identification, airborne antenna selection, and system test signals. These signals are not required in the elevation formats. In addition, if the signal from an installed ground component results in a valid indication in an area where no valid guidance should exist, OCI signals must be radiated as provided for in the signal format (see Tables 4a, 4b, and 5). The sector signals are defined as follows:

        (A)  DPSK transmissions that will permit Morse Code facility identification in the aircraft by a four letter code starting with the letter “M” must be included in all azimuth functions. They must be transmitted and repeated at approximately equal intervals, not less than six times per minute, during which time the ground subsystem is available for operational use. When the transmissions of the ground subsystem are not available, the identification signal must be suppressed. The audible tone in the aircraft is started by setting the Morse Code bit to logic “1” and stopped by a logic “0” (see Tables 4a and 4b). The identification code characteristics must conform to the following: the dot must be between 0.13 and 0.16 second in duration, and the dash between 0.39 and 0.48 second. The duration between dots and/or dashes must be one dot plus or minus 10%. The duration between characters (letters) must not be less than three dots. When back azimuth is provided, the code shall be transmitted by the approach azimuth and back azimuth within plus or minus 0.08 seconds.

        (B)  A signal for airborne antenna selection shall be transmitted as a “zero” DPSK signal lasting for a six-bit period (see Tables 4a and 4b).

        (C)  Where OCI pulses are used, they must be: (1) greater than any guidance signal in the OCI sector; (2) at least 5 dB less than the level of the scanning beam within the proportional guidance sector; and (3) for azimuth functions with clearance signals, at least 5 dB less than the level of the left (right) clearance pulses within the left (right) clearance sector.

        The duration of each pulse measured at the half amplitude point shall be at least 100 microseconds, and the rise and fall times shall be less then 10 microseconds. It shall be permissible to sequentially transmit two pulses in each out-of-coverage indication time slot. Where pulse pairs are used, the duration of each pulse shall be at least 50 microseconds, and the rise and fall times shall be less then 10 microseconds. The transmission of out-of-coverage indication pulses radiated from antennas with overlapping coverage patterns shall be separated by at least 10 microseconds.

        (D)  Time slots are provided in Tables 4a and 4b to allow radiation of TO and FRO test pulses. However, radiation of these pulses is not required since the characteristics of these pulses have not yet been standardized.

        (iii)  The encoding must be as follows:

        (A)  Azimuth and elevation angles are encoded by scanning a narrow beam between the limits of the proportional coverage sector first in one direction (the TO scan) and then in the opposite direction (the FRO scan). Angular information must be encoded by the amount of time separation between the beam centers of the TO and FRO scanning beam pulses. The TO and FRO transmissions must be symmetrically disposed about the midscan point listed in Tables 4a, 4b, 5, and 7. The midscan point and the center of the time interval between the TO and FRO scan transmissions must coincide with a tolerance of ±10 microseconds. Angular coding must be linear with angle and properly decoded using the formula:

        (B)  Each guidance angle transmitted must consist of a clockwise TO scan followed by a counterclockwise FRO scan as viewed from above the antenna. For approach azimuth functions, increasing angle values must be in the direction of the TO scan; for the back azimuth function, increasing angle values must be in the direction of the FRO scan. The antenna has a narrow beam in the plane of the scan direction and a broad beam in the orthogonal plane which fills the vertical coverage.

        (C)  The radiation from elevation equipment must produce a beam which scans from the horizon up to the highest elevation angle and then scans back down to the horizon. The antenna has a narrow beam in the plane of the scan direction and a broad beam in the orthogonal plane which fills the horizontal coverage. Elevation angles are defined from the horizontal plane containing the antenna phase center; positive angles are above the horizontal and zero angle is along the horizontal.

        (iv)  The timing of the clearance pulses must be in accordance with Figure 8. For azimuth elements with proportional coverage of less than ±40 degrees (±20 degrees for back azimuth), clearance guidance information must be provided by transmitting pulses in a TO and FRO format adjacent to the stop/start times of the scanning beam signal. The fly-right clearance pulses must represent positive angles and the fly-left clearance pulses must represent negative angles. The duration of each clearance pulse must be 50 microseconds with a tolerance of ±5 microseconds. The transmitter switching time between the clearance pulses and the scanning beam transmissions must not exceed 10 microseconds. The rise time at the edge of each clearance pulse must be less than 10 microseconds. Within the fly-right clearance guidance section, the fly-right clearance guidance signal shall exceed scanning beam antenna sidelobes and other guidance and OCI signals by at least 5 dB; within the fly-left clearance guidance sector, the fly left clearance guidance signal shall exceed scanning beam antenna sidelobes and all other guidance and OCI signals by at least 5 dB; within the proportional guidance sector, the clearance guidance signals shall be at least 5dB below the proportional guidance signal. Optionally, clearance guidance may be provided by scanning throughout the approach guidance sector. For angles outside the approach azimuth proportional coverage limits as set in Basic Data Word One (Basic Data Word 5 for back azimuth), proper decode and display of clearance guidance must occur to the limits of the guidance region. Where used, clearance pulses shall be transmitted adjacent to the scanning beam signals at the edges of proportional coverage as shown in Figure 8. The proportional coverage boundary shall be established at one beamwidth inside the scan start/stop angles, such that the transition between scanning beam and clearance signals occurs outside the proportional coverage sector. When clearance pulses are provided in conjunction with a narrow beamwidth (e.g., one degree) scanning antenna, the scanning beam antenna shall radiate for 15 microseconds while stationary at the scan start/stop angles.

        (3)  Basic data words provide equipment characteristics and certain siting information. Basic data words must be transmitted from an antenna located at the approach azimuth or back azimuth site which provides coverage throughout the appropriate sector. Data function timing must be in accordance with Table 7a.

        (i)  Must be in accordance with requirements of § 171.311(i)(1).

        (ii)  Basic data must be transmitted using DPSK modulation. The content and repetition rate of each basic data word must be in accordance with Table 8a. For data containing digital information, binary number 1 must represent the lower range limit with increments in binary steps to the upper range limit shown in Table 8a. Data containing digital information shall be transmitted with the least significant bit first.

        § 171.313   Azimuth performance requirements.

#### § § 171.313

        This section prescribes the performance requirements for the azimuth equipment of the MLS as follows:

        (a)  The approach azimuth equipment must provide guidance information in at least the following volume of space (see Figure 9):

        (1) Horizontally within a sector plus or minus 40 degrees about the runway centerline originating at the datum point and extending in the direction of the approach to 20 nautical miles from the runway threshold. The minimum proportional guidance sector must be plus or minus 10 degrees about the runway centerline. Clearance signals must be used to provide the balance of the required coverage, where the proportional sector is less than plus or minus 40 degrees. When intervening obstacles prevent full coverage, the ±40° guidance sector can be reduced as required. For systems providing ±60° lateral guidance the coverage requirement is reduced to 14 nm beyond ±40°.

        (2) Vertically between:

        (i) A conical surface originating 2.5 meters (8 feet) above the runway centerline at threshold inclined at 0.9 degree above the horizontal.

        (ii) A conical surface originating at the azimuth ground equipment antenna inclined at 15 degrees above the horizontal to a height of 6,000 meters (20,000 feet).

        (iii) Where intervening obstacles penetrate the lower surface, coverage need be provided only to the minimum line of sight.

        (3) Runway region:

        (i) Proportional guidance horizontally within a sector 45 meters (150 feet) each side of the runway centerline beginning at the stop end and extending parallel with the runway centerline in the direction of the approach to join the approach region. This requirement does not apply to offset azimuth installations.

        (ii) Vertically between a horizontal surface which is 2.5 meters (8 feet) above the farthest point of runway centerline which is in line of sight of the azimuth antenna, and in a conical surface originating at the azimuth ground equipment antenna inclined at 20 degrees above the horizontal up to a height to 600 meters (2,000 feet). This requirement does not apply to offset azimuth installations.

        (4) Within the approach azimuth coverage sector defined in paragraphs (a) (1), and (2) and (3) of this section, the power densities must not be less than those shown in Table 9 but the equipment design must also allow for:

        (i) Transmitter power degradation from normal by −1.5 dB;

        (ii) Rain loss of −2.2 dB at the longitudinal coverage extremes.

        (b)  The approach azimuth antenna system must, except as allowed in paragraph (c) of this section:

        (1) Be located on the extension of the centerline of the runway beyond the stop end;

        (2) Be adjusted so that the zero degree azimuth plane will be a vertical plane which contains the centerline of the runway served;

        (3) Have the minimum height necessary to comply with the coverage requirements prescribed in paragraph (a) of this section;

        (4) Be located at a distance from the stop end of the runway that is consistent with safe obstruction clearance practices;

        (5) Not obscure any light of an approach lighting system; and

        (6) Be installed on frangible mounts or beyond the 300 meter (1,000 feet) light bar.

        (c) On runways where limited terrain prevents the azimuth antenna from being positioned on the runway centerline extended, and the cost of the land fill or a tall tower antenna support is prohibitive, the azimuth antenna may be offset.

        (d)  The scanning beams transmitted by the approach azimuth equipment within ±40° of the centerline may be either conical or planar.

        (e)  (1) The system and subsystem errors shall not exceed those listed in Table 10 at the approach reference datum.

        At the approach reference datum, temporal sinusoidal noise components shall not exceed 0.025 degree peak in the frequency band 0.01 Hz to 1.6 Hz, and the CMN shall not exceed 0.10 degree. From the approach reference datum to the coverage limit, the PFE, PFN and CMN limits, expressed in angular terms, shall be allowed to linearly increase as follows:

        (i) With distance along the runway centerline extended, by a factor of 1.2 for the PFE and PFN limits and to ±0.10 degree for the CMN limits.

        (ii) With azimuth angle, by a factor of 1.5 at the ±40 degree and a factor of 2.0 at the ±60 degree azimuth angles for the PFE, PFN and CMN limits.

        (iii) With elevation angle from + 9 degrees to + 15 degrees, by a factor of 1.5 for the PFE and PFN limits.

        (iv) Maximum angular limits. The PFE limits shall not exceed ±0.25 degree in any coverage region below an elevation angle of + 9 degrees nor exceed ±0.50 degree in any coverage region above that elevation angle. The CMN limits shall not exceed ±0.10 degree in any coverage region within ±10 degrees of runway centerline extended nor exceed ±0.20 degree in any other region within coverage.

        (f) Approach azimuth antenna characteristics are as follows:

        (1)  Any azimuth angle as encoded by the scanning beam at any point within the proportional coverage must not vary more than ±0.07 degree over the range of service conditions specified in § 171.309(d) without the use of internal environmental controls. Multipath effects are excluded from this requirement.

        (2)  The azimuth angle as encoded by the scanning beam at any point within ±0.5 degree of the zero degree azimuth must not deviate from the true azimuth angle at that point by more than ±.05 degree. Multipath and drift effects are excluded from this requirement.

        (3)  The antenna must be equipped with suitable optical, electrical or mechanical means or any combination of the three, to bring the zero degree azimuth radial into coincidence with the approach reference datum (for centerline siting) with a maximum error of 0.02 degree. Additionally, the azimuth antenna bias adjustment must be electronically steerable at least to the monitor limits in steps not greater than 0.005 degree.

        (4)  On boresight, the azimuth antenna mainlobe pattern must conform to Figure 10, and the beamwidth must be such that, in the installed environment, no significant lateral reflections of the mainlobe exist along the approach course. In any case the beamwidth must not exceed three degrees. Anywhere within coverage the −3 dB width of the antenna mainlobe, while scanning normally, must not be less than 25 microseconds (0.5 degree) or greater than 250 microseconds (5 degrees). The antenna mainlobe may be allowed to broaden from the value at boresight by a factor of 1/cosθ, where θ is the angle off boresight. The sidelobe levels must be as follows:

        (i)  With the antenna scanning normally, the dynamic sidelobe level that is detected by a receiver at any point within the proportional coverage sector must be down at least 10 dB from the peak of the main beam. Outside the coverage sector, the radiation from the scanning beam antenna must be of such a nature that receiver warning will not be removed or suitable OCI signals must be provided.

        (ii)  With the antenna scanning normally, the sidelobe levels in the plane of scan must be such that, in the installed environment, the CMN contributed by sidelobe reflections will not exceed the angular equivalent of 9 feet at approach reference datum over the required range of aircraft approach speeds.

        (5)  The azimuth antenna free space radiation pattern below the horizon must have a slope of at least −8 dB/degree at the horizon and all sidelobes below the horizon must be at least 13 dB below the pattern peak. The antenna radiation pattern above the horizon must satisfy both the system coverage requirements and the spurious radiation requirement.

        (6)  The data antenna must have horizontal and vertical patterns as required for its function.

        (g)  The back azimuth equipment where used must provide guidance information in at least the following volume of space (see Figure 11):

        (1) Horizontally within a sector ±40 degrees about the runway centerline originating at the back azimuth ground equipment antenna and extending in the direction of the missed approach at least to 20 nautical miles from the runway stop end. The minimum proportional guidance sector must be ±10 degrees about the runway centerline. Clearance signals must be used to provide the balance of the required coverage where the proportional sector is less than ±40 degrees.

        (2) Vertically in the runway region between:

        (i) A horizontal surface 2.5 meters (8 feet) above the farthest point of runway centerline which is in line of sight of the azimuth antenna, and,

        (ii) A conical surface originating at the azimuth ground equipment antenna inclined at 20 degrees above the horizontal up to a height of 600 meters (2000 feet).

        (3) Vertically in the back azimuth region between:

        (i) A conical surface originating 2.5 meters (8 feet) above the runway stop end, included at 0.9 degree above the horizontal, and,

        (ii) A conical surface orginating at the missed approach azimuth ground equipment antenna, inclined at 15 degrees above the horizontal up to a height of 1500 meters (5000 feet).

        (iii) Where obstacles penetrate the lower coverage limits, coverage need be provided only to minimum line of sight.

        (4) Within the back azimuth coverage sector defined in paragraph (q) (1), (2), and (3) of this section the power densities must not be less than those shown in Table 9, but the equipment design must also allow for:

        (i) Transmitter power degradation from normal −1.5 dB.

        (ii) Rain loss of −2.2 dB at the longitudinal coverage extremes.

        (h)  The back azimuth equipment antenna must:

        (1) Normally be located on the extension of the runway centerline at the threshold end;

        (2) Be adjusted so that the vertical plane containing the zero degree course line contains the back azimuth reference datum;

        (3) Have minimum height necessary to comply with the course requirements prescribed in paragraph (g) of this section;

        (4) Be located at a distance from the threshold end that is consistent with safe obstruction clearance practices;

        (5) Not obscure any light of an approach lighting system; and

        (6) Be installed on frangible mounts or beyond the 300 meter (1000 feet) light bar.

        (i)  The scanning beams transmitted by the back azimuth equipment may be either conical or planar.

        (j)  The requirements specified in § 171.313(e) apply except that the reference point is the back azimuth reference datum.

        (k)  The requirements specified in § 171.313(f) apply.

        (l)  Figure 12 shows the approach azimuth and back azimuth scanning conventions.

        (m)  False courses which can be acquired and tracked by an aircraft shall not exist anywhere either inside or outside of the MLS coverage sector. False courses which exist outside of the minimum coverage sector may be suppressed by the use of OCI.

        § 171.315   Azimuth monitor system requirements.

#### § § 171.315

        (a) The approach azimuth or back azimuth monitor system must cause the radiation to cease and a warning must be provided at the designated control point if any of the following conditions persist for longer than the periods specified:

        (1) There is a change in the ground equipment contribution to the mean course error component such that the path following error at the reference datum or in the direction of any azimuth radial, exceeds the limits specified in §§ 171.313(e)(1) or 171.313(j) for a period of more than one second.

        (2) There are errors in two consecutive transmissions of Basic Data Words 1, 2, 4 or 5.

        (iii) A conical surface originating at the datum point and inclined at 15.0 degrees above the horizontal up to a height of 6000 meters (20,000 feet).

        (4) Within the elevation coverage sector defined in paragraphs (a) (1), (2) and (3) of this section, the power densities must not be less than those shown in Table 9, but the equipment design must also allow for:

        (i) Transmitter power degradation from normal by −1.5 dB.

        (ii) Rain loss of −2.2 dB at the coverage extremes.

        (b)  The Elevation Antenna System must:

        (1) Be located as close to runway centerline as possible (without violating obstacle clearance criteria).

        (2) Be located near runway threshold such that the asymptote of the minimum glidepath crosses the threshold of the runway at the Approach Reference Datum height. Normally, the minimum glidepath should be 3 degrees and the Approach Reference Datum height should be 50 feet. However, there are circumstances where other glideslopes and reference datum heights are appropriate. Some of these instances are discussed in FAA Order 8260.34 (Glide Slope Threshold Crossing Height Requirements) and Order 8260.3 (IFR Approval of MLS.)

        (3) Be located such that the MLS Approach Reference Datum and ILS Reference Datum heights are coincident within a tolerance of 3 feet when MLS is installed on a runway already served by an ILS. This requirement applies only if the ILS glide slope is sited such that the height of the reference datum meets the requirements of FAA Order 8260.34.

        (c)  The scanning beams transmitted by the elevation subsystem must be conical.

        (d)  (1) The accuracies shown in Table 13 are required at the approach reference datum. From the approach reference datum to the coverage limit, the PFE, PFN and CMN limits shall be allowed to linearly increase as follows:

        (i) With distance along the runway centerline extended at the minimum glide path angle, by a factor of 1.2 for the PFE and PFN limits and to ±0.10 degree for the CMN limits;

        (ii) With azimuth angle, from runway centerline extended to the coverage extreme, by a factor of 1.2 for the PFE and PFN limits and by a factor of 2.0 for the CMN limits;

        (iii) With increasing elevation angles from + 3 degrees to + 15 degrees, by a factor of 2.0 for the PFE and PFN limits;

        (iv) With decreasing elevation angle from + 3 degrees (or 60% of the minimum glide path angle, whichever is less) to the coverage extreme, by a factor of 3 for the PFE, PFN and CMN limits; and

        (v) Maximum angular limits. the CMN limits shall not exceed ±0.10 degree in any coverage region within ±10 degrees laterally of runway centerline extended which is above the elevation angle specified in (iv) above.

        (2) The system and ground subsystem accuracies shown in Table 13 are to be demonstrated at commissioning as maximum error limits. Subsequent to commissioning, the accuracies are to be considered at 95% probability limits.

        (e) Elevation antenna characteristics are as follows:

        (1)  Any elevation angle as encoded by the scanning beam at any point within the coverage sector must not vary more than 0.04 degree over the range of service conditions specified in § 171.309(d) without the use of internal environmental controls. Multipath effects are excluded from this requirement.

        (2)  The elevation angle as encoded by the scanning beam at any point within the coverage sector must not deviate from the true elevation angle at that point by more than ±0.04 degree for elevation angles from 2.5° to 3.5°. Above 3.5° these errors may linearly increase to ±0.1 degree at 7.5°. Multipath and drift effects are excluded from this requirement.

        (3)  The antenna must be equipped with suitable optical, electrical, or mechanical means or any combination of the three, to align the lowest operationally required glidepath to the true glidepath angle with a maximum error of 0.01 degree. Additionally, the elevation antenna bias adjustment must be electronically steerable at least to the monitor limits in steps not greater than 0.005 degrees.

        (4)  On the lowest operationally required glidepath, the antenna mainlobe pattern must conform to Figure 10, and the beamwidth must be such that in the installed environment, no significant ground reflections of the mainlobe exist. In any case, the beamwidth must not exceed 2 degrees. The antenna mainlobe may be allowed to broaden from the value at boresight by a factor of 1/cosθ, where θ is the angle of boresight. Anywhere within coverage, the −3 dB width of the antenna mainlobe, while scanning normally, must not be less than 25 microseconds (0.5 degrees) or greater than 250 microseconds (5 degrees). The sidelobe levels must be as follows:

        (i)  With the antenna scanning normally, the dynamic sidelobe level that is detected by a receiver at any point within the proportional coverage sector must be down at least 10 dB from the peak of the mainlobe. Outside the proportional coverage sector, the radiation from the scanning beam antenna must be of such a nature that receiver warnings will not be removed or a suitable OCI signal must be provided.

        (ii)  With the antenna scanning normally, the sidelobe levels in the plane of scan must be such that, when reflected from the ground, the resultant PFE along any glidepath does not exceed 0.083 degrees.

        (5)  The horizontal pattern of the antenna must gradually de-emphasize the signal away from antenna boresight. Typically, the horizontal pattern should be reduced by at least 3 dB at 20 degrees off boresight and by at least 6 dB at 40 degrees off boresight. Depending on the actual multipath conditions, the horizontal radiation patterns may require more or less de-emphasis.

        (6)  The data antenna must have horizontal and vertical patterns as required for its function.

        (f)  False courses which can be acquired and tracked by an aircraft shall not exist anywhere either inside or outside of the MLS coverage sector. False courses which exist outside of the minimum coverage sector may be suppressed by the use of OCI.

        § 171.319   Approach elevation monitor system requirements.

#### § § 171.319

        (a) The monitor system must act to ensure that any of the following conditions do not persist for longer than the periods specified when:

        (1) There is a change in the ground component contribution to the mean glidepath error component such that the path following error on any glidepath exceeds the limits specified in § 171.317(d) for a period of more than one second.

        (2) There is a reduction in the radiated power to a level not less than that specified in § 171.317(a)(4) for a period of more than one second.

        (3) There is an error in the preamble DPSK transmission which occurs more than once in any one second period.

        (4) There is an error in the time division multiplex synchronization of a particular elevation function such that the requirement specified in § 171.311(e) is not satisfied and this condition persists for more than one second.

        (5) A failure of the monitor is detected.

        (b) The period during which erroneous guidance information is radiated must not exceed the periods specified in § 171.319(a). If the fault is not cleared within the time allowed, radiation shall cease. After shutdown, no attempt must be made to restore service until a period of 20 seconds has elapsed.

        § 171.321   DME and marker beacon performance requirements.

        § 171.323   Fabrication and installation requirements.

#### § § 171.323

        (a) The MLS facility must be permanent and must be located, constructed, and installed in accordance with best commercial engineering practices, using applicable electric and safety codes and Federal Communications Commission (FCC) licensing requirements and siting requirements of §§ 171.313(b) and 171.317(b).

        (b) The MLS facility components must utilize solid state technology except that traveling wave tube amplifiers (TWTA) may be used. A maximum level of common modularity must be provided along with diagnostics to facilitate maintenance and troubleshooting.

        (c) An approved monitoring capability must be provided which indicates the status of the equipment at the site and at a remotely located maintenance area, with monitor capability that provides pre-alarm of impending system failures. This monitoring feature must be capable of transmitting the status and pre-alarm over standard phone lines to a remote section. In the event the sponsor requests the FAA to assume ownership of the facility, the monitoring feature must also be capable of interfacing with FAA remote monitoring requirements. This requirement may be complied with by the addition of optional software and/or hardware in space provided in the original equipment.

        (d) The mean corrective maintenance time of the MLS equipment must be equal to or less than 0.5 hours with a maximum corrective maintenance time not to exceed 1.5 hours. This measure applies to correction of unscheduled failures of the monitor, transmitter and associated antenna assemblies, limited to unscheduled outage and out of tolerance conditions.

        (e) The mean-time-between-failures of the MLS angle system must not be less than 1,500 hours. This measure applies to unscheduled outage, out-of-tolerance conditions, and failures of the monitor, transmitter, and associated antenna assemblies.

        (f) The MLS facility must have a reliable source of suitable primary power, either from a power distribution system or locally generated. Adequate power capacity must be provided for the operation of the MLS as well as the test and working equipment of the MLS.

        (g) The MLS facility must have a continuously engaged or floating battery power source for the continued normal operation of the ground station operation if the primary power fails. A trickle charge must be supplied to recharge the batteries during the period of available primary power. Upon loss and subsequent restoration of power, the battery must be restored to full charge within 24 hours. When primary power is applied, the state of the battery charge must not affect the operation of the MLS ground station. The battery must allow continuation of normal operation of the MLS facility for at least 2 hours without the use of additional sources of power. When the system is operating from the battery supply without prime power, the radome deicers and the environmental system need not operate. The equipment must meet all specification requirements with or without batteries installed.

        (h) There must be a means for determining, from the ground, the performance of the system including antenna, both initially and periodically.

        (i) The facility must have, or be supplemented by, ground, air, or landline communications services. At facilities within or immediately adjacent to controlled airspace, that are intended for use as instrument approach aids for an airport, there must be ground air communications or reliable communications (at least a landline telephone) from the airport to the nearest FAA air traffic control or communication facility. Compliance with this paragraph need not be shown at airports where an adjacent FAA facility can communicate with aircraft on the ground at the airport and during the entire proposed instrument approach procedure. In addition, at low traffic density airports within or immediately adjacent to controlled airspace, and where extensive delays are not a factor, the requirements of this paragraph may be reduced to reliable communications from the airport to the nearest FAA air traffic control or communications facility. If the adjacent FAA facility can communicate with aircraft during the proposed instrument approach procedure down to the airport surface or at least down to the minimum en route altitude, this would require at least a landline telephone.

        (j) The location of the phase center for all antennas must be clearly marked on the antenna enclosures.

        (k) The latitude, longitude and mean sea level elevation of all MLS antennas, runway threshold and runway stop end must be determined by survey with an accuracy of ±3 meters (±10 feet) laterally and ±0.3 meter (±1.0 foot) vertically. The relative lateral and vertical offsets of all antenna phase centers, and both runway ends must be determined with an accuracy of ±0.3 meter (±1.0 foot) laterally and ±0.03 meter (±0.1 foot) vertically. The owner must bear all costs of the survey. The results of this survey must be included in the “operations and maintenance” manual required by section 171.325 of this subpart and will be noted on FAA Form 198 required by § 171.327.

      § 187.53   Calculation of overflight fees.

#### § § 187.53

      (a) The FAA assesses a total fee that is the sum of the Enroute and Oceanic calculated fees.

      (1)  The Enroute fee is calculated by multiplying the Enroute rate in paragraph (c) of this section by the total number of nautical miles flown through each segment of Enroute airspace divided by 100 (because the Enroute rate is expressed per 100 nautical miles).

      (2)  The Oceanic fee is calculated by multiplying the Oceanic rate in paragraph (c) of this section by the total number of nautical miles flown through each segment of Oceanic airspace divided by 100 (because the Oceanic rate is expressed per 100 nautical miles).

      (b) Distance flown through each segment of Enroute or Oceanic airspace is based on the great circle distance (GCD) from the point of entry into U.S.-controlled airspace to the point of exit from U.S.-controlled airspace based on FAA flight data. Where actual entry and exit points are not available, the FAA will use the best available flight data to calculate the entry and exit points.

      (c) The rate for each 100 nautical miles flown through Enroute or Oceanic airspace is:

      (d) The formula for the total overflight fee is:

      (e) The FAA will review the rates described in this section at least once every 2 years and will adjust them to reflect the current costs and volume of the services provided.

      § 187.55   Overflight fees billing and payment procedures.

#### § § 187.55

      (a) The FAA will send an invoice to each user when fees are owed to the FAA. If the FAA cannot identify the user, then an invoice will be sent to the registered owner. Users will be billed at the address of record in the country where the aircraft is registered, unless a billing address is otherwise provided.

      (b) The FAA will send an invoice if the monthly (based on Universal Coordinated Time) fees equal or exceed $400.

      (c) Payment must be made by one of the methods described in § 187.15(d).

**Source:** Source: Docket No. 28893, 63 FR 13739, Mar. 20, 1998, unless otherwise noted.

      § 198.1   Eligibility of aircraft operation for insurance.

#### § § 198.1

      An aircraft operation is eligible for insurance if—

      (a) The President of the United States has determined that the continuation of that aircraft operation is necessary to carry out the foreign policy of the United States;

      (b) The aircraft operation is—

      (1) In foreign air commerce or between two or more places all of which are outside the United States if insurance with premium is sought; or

      (2) In domestic or foreign air commerce, or between two or more places all of which are outside the United States if insurance without premium is sought; and

      (c) The Administrator finds that commercial insurance against loss or damage arising out of any risk from the aircraft operation cannot be obtained on reasonable terms from an insurance carrier.

      § 198.3   Basis of insurance.

#### § § 198.3

      (a) Premium insurance may be issued by the FAA is the requirements of § 198.1 (a), (b)(1) and (c) are met.

      (b) Subject to § 198.9(c), standby insurance without premium may be issued by the FAA if all of the following conditions have been met:

      (1) A department, agency, or instrumentality of the U.S. Government seeks performance of air services operations, pursuant to a contract of the department, agency, or instrumentality; or transportation of military forces or materiel on behalf of the United States, pursuant to an agreement between the United States and a foreign government.

      (2) Such department, agency, or instrumentality of the U.S. Government has agreed in writing to indemnify the Secretary of Transportation against all losses covered by such insurance. Such an agreement, when countersigned by the President, constitutes a determination that the continuation of that aircraft operation is necessary to carry out the foreign policy of the United States.

      (3) A current copy of the aircraft operator's applicable commercial insurance policy or policies is on file with the FAA, including every endorsement making a material change to the policy. Updated copies of these policies must be provided upon each renewal of the commercial policy. Every subsequent material change by endorsement must be promptly provided to the FAA.

      (c) Insurance is activated, placing the insurance in full force, as specified by the FAA's written notification to the operator and remains in force until such time as either of the following occurs:

      (1) The requirements in § 198.1 are no longer met; or

      (2) In the case of non-premium insurance, an aircraft operation is no longer performed under contract to a department, agency, or instrumentality of the U.S. Government; or pursuant to an agreement between the United States and a foreign government; or the Administrator finds that commercial insurance can now be obtained on reasonable terms.

      (d) Insurance policies revert to standby status upon written notification by the FAA to the aircraft operator. A policy will remain in standby status until either—

      (1) The insurance is activated by written notice; or

      (2) The policy is canceled.

      § 198.5   Types of insurance coverage available.

#### § § 198.5

      Application may be made for insurance against loss or damage to the following persons, property, or interests:

      (a) Aircraft, or insurable items of an aircraft, engaged in eligible operations under § 198.1.

      (b) Any individual employed or transported on the aircraft referred to in paragraph (a) of this section.

      (c) The baggage of persons referred to in paragraph (b) of this section.

      (d) Property transported, or to be transported, on the aircraft referred to in paragraph (a) of this section.

      (e) Statutory or contractual obligations, or any other liability, of the aircraft referred to in paragraph (a) of this section or of its owner or operator, of the nature customarily covered by insurance.

      § 198.7   Amount of insurance coverage available.

#### § § 198.7

      (a) For each aircraft or insurable item, the amount insured may not exceed the amount for which the applicant has otherwise insured or self-insured the aircraft or insurable item against damage or liability arising from any risk. In the case of hull insurance, the amount insured may not exceed the reasonable value of the aircraft as determined by the FAA or its designated agent.

      (b) Policies issued without premium may be revised from time to time by the FAA with notice to the insured, to add aircraft or insurable items or to amend amounts of coverage if the insured has changed the amount by which it has otherwise insured or self-insured the aircraft or itself.

      § 198.9   Applicant for insurance.

#### § § 198.9

      (a) Application for premium or non-premium insurance must be made in accordance with the applicable form supplied by the FAA.

      (b) Each applicant for insurance with the premium under this part must submit to the FAA with its application a letter describing in detail the operations in which the aircraft is or will be engaged and stating the type of insurance coverage being sought and the reason it is being sought. The applicant must also submit any other information deemed pertinent by the FAA.

      (c) Each applicant for premium or non-premium insurance must, upon request by the FAA, submit to the FAA evidence that commercial insurance is not available on reasonable terms for each flight or ground operation for which insurance is sought. Each aircraft operator who has a standby non-premium insurance policy must, upon request by the FAA, submit evidence to the FAA that commercial insurance is not available on reasonable terms before the FAA activates that policy. The adequacy of the evidence submitted is determined solely by the FAA.

      (d) The standby non-premium policy issued to the aircraft operator does not provide actual coverage until formally activated by the FAA.

      § 198.11   Change in status of aircraft.

#### § § 198.11

      In the event of sale, lease, confiscation, requisition, total loss, or other change in the status of an aircraft or insurable items covered by insurance under this part, the insured party must notify the office administering the Aviation Insurance Program before, or as soon as practicable after, the change in status.

      § 198.13   Premium insurance—payment of premiums.

#### § § 198.13

      The insured must pay the premium for insurance issued under this part within the stated period after receipt of notice that premium payment is due and in accordance with the provisions of the applicable FAA insurance policy. Premiums must be sent to the FAA, and made payable to the FAA.

      § 198.15   Non-premium insurance—payment of registration binders.

#### § § 198.15

      (a) The binder for initial registration is $575 for each aircraft or insurable item. This binder is adjusted not more frequently than annually based on changes in the Consumer Price Index of All Urban Consumers published by the Secretary of Labor.

      (b) An application for non-premium insurance must be accompanied by the proper binder, payable to the FAA. A binder is not returnable unless the application is rejected.

      (c) Requests made after issuance of a non-premium policy for the addition of an aircraft or insurable item must be accompanied by the binder for each aircraft and insurable item.

      (d) When an operator acquires an aircraft or insurable item that was previously covered under an active or standby policy, the new operator must register that aircraft or item on its policy and pay the binder for each aircraft and insurable item.

      § 198.17   Ground support and other coverage.

#### § § 198.17

      An aircraft operator may apply for insurance to cover any risks arising from the provision of goods or services directly supporting the operation of an aircraft that meets the requirements of § 198.3(b).
