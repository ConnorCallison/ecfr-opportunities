#### § § 1501.10

    (a) In all cases the Board shall consider the reports of investigation in the light of the standard as set forth in § 1501.8 and shall determine whether such reports warrant a finding favorable to the individual or appear to call for further processing of the case with a view to a possible unfavorable determination.

    (b) If the Board reaches a favorable conclusion in a case involving a question of loyalty, it shall make a determination that on all the evidence there is not a reasonable doubt as to the individual's loyalty.

    (c) If the Board determines that the reports do not warrant a finding favorable to the individual, or the Board determines that the evidence is of such a nature that a hearing may be required before a final decision is made, the Board shall send by registered mail, or in such other manner as the Board in a particular case may decide, a written interrogatory to the individual. Such interrogatory shall state the nature of the evidence against him, setting forth with particularity the facts and circumstances involved, in as much detail as security conditions permit, in order to enable him to submit his answer, defense or explanation and to submit affidavits. It will also inform the applicant or employee, of his opportunity to reply to the interrogatory in writing, under oath or affirmation, within ten (10) calendar days of the date of receipt by him of the interrogatory or such longer time as the Board in specific cases may prescribe, and of his opportunity for a hearing on the issues before the Board or a panel of the Board, including his right to appear personally at such hearing, to be represented by counsel of a representative of his own choosing, to present evidence in his own behalf, and to cross-examine witnesses offered in support of the derogatory information.

#### § § 1501.11

    (a) Following delivery to the applicant or employee of the interrogatory and after expiration of the time limit for filing an answer to the interrogatory, the Board shall proceed to consider the case on the complete file, including the answer, if any, to the interrogatory.

#### § § 1501.12

    (d) Testimony shall be given under oath or affirmation.

    (e) Strict legal rules of evidence shall not be applied at the hearings, but reasonable bounds shall be maintained as to competency, relevancy, and materiality and due allowance shall be made for the effect of any nondisclosure to the individual of information or the absence of any opportunity to cross-examine persons who supplied information but who do not appear and testify. Both the Government and the applicant or employee may introduce such evidence as the panel may deem proper in the particular case.

    (f) A complete verbatim stenographic transcript shall be made of the hearing, and the transcript shall constitute a permanent part of the record.

    (g) Applicants and employees must pay their own travel and subsistence expenses incident to attendance at hearings, except that the Board may authorize the payment of travel and subsistence expenses to applicants or employees when the hearing is held at a place other than the place outside the continental limits of the United States where the employee works, or the applicant resides, and such payment is considered in the interest of good administration and funds are available for this purpose.
